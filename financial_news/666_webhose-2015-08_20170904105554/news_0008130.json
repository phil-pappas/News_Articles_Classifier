Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Michael Smith Alan Joyce won't be having a celebratory drink this weekend despite capping off the best week of his near seven-year stint running one of Australia's most volatile companies.\n\"I'm off alcohol for the month,\" the Qantas chief executive says the morning after delivering the airline's best profit result since the global financial crisis.\n\"We just had my parents' 50th wedding anniversary in Ireland and a big party with 120 of my relatives I hadn't seen in years. We finished at 5am and my 70-year aunts outlasted me.\n\"I've been away from Ireland for too long.\n\"I didn't have a drink last night and I won't have one tonight, although I will be [celebrating] with the staff.\"\nIrish-born Joyce has spent the last two years dealing with the hangover from Qantas' history as a state-owned airline. This included the airline's high cost-base, heavily unionised workforce and foreign ownership restrictions.\nHis darkest days were 18 months ago when the airline posted the worst loss in its history and announced 5000 job cuts. Joyce is one of the highest-profile chief executives in the country and there was no shortage of critics calling for his head.\nThen the tide turned and Joyce was suddenly in favour. Qantas shares were soaring, costs were falling, the impasse on wage deals was broken, and staff were awarded a bonus.\n The high point Joyce's high point came this week, though, when the airline announced a near $1 billion profit, the first capital return for shareholders in years and new long-haul aircraft orders. The incentives to repair staff morale continued on Friday with the announcement of a $400 discount on employee travel.\nJoyce says the mood has clearly shifted at the airline's Mascot headquarters where he catches up with AFR Weekend in between another round of television interviews and an event to name the new Australian Rugby World Cup squad.\nWhile clearly happy with the turnaround, the 49-year-old says he is not ready to go out on a high.\n\"I was appointed at a pretty young age, 42, to takeover Qantas with the intention it was going to be a long tenure. Qantas, like Wesfarmers, typically likes stability and long terms for the CEO,\" says Joyce, who ran Jetstar in its early years before inheriting the top job from predecessor Geoff Dixon in 2008.\n\"The board and the shareholders have to want you and you have to enjoy the job and if those conditions apply I am very happy to continue for a few more years. I'm not going to go to Geoff Dixon's age of 72 you will be glad to know. It would mean another 22 years.\"\nThe big question is what does Joyce do now? The airline's cost-cutting and \"transformation\" program and lower fuel bills were key to the financial turnaround, as well as the cooling the in the domestic turf war with rival Virgin.\nNow that he is out of survival mode, Joyce is under pressure to grow the airline's operations domestically and internationally.\nDigital opportunities He is also looking at ways to turn Qantas into a technology company by mining the opportunities its 10.5-million-member frequent flyer program offers in data analytics and digital marketing. He points to new businesses such as Qantas' Loyalty's digital marketing business Red Planet and small business-targeted Acquire as examples of the direction he hopes to take the company.\n\"We think there is a lot of opportunity there and you will see us launching a lot of these businesses, there is a pipeline,\" he says, saying he expects earnings for the frequent flyer business to increase 10 per cent year on year.\nBut it was the announcement this week to purchase eight Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft and what this means for the international network that stole the limelight. With the potential to buy up to 45 of the \"game-changing\" long-haul aircraft, Joyce has his sights set on a bigger global network of new direct routes from Australia to destinations which it could not make work in the past such as Beijing and China. New services to Dallas, Vancouver and even New York are on the cards when the technology is available.\n\"There are so much more opportunities. People think we have shrunk everywhere but we are bigger in the (United) States than we have ever been. We are bigger into Japan than we have ever been. Sure, we are smaller in Europe because Europe is structurally a harder market to make money.\"\nWhile we are speaking, the competition regulator announces it will back Qantas' alliance with China Eastern, an important step in the airline's ambitions to tap into the Chinese market. Hong Kong has been more challenging where ambitions to establish Jetstar were killed off by regulators.\nJoyce admits there have been mistakes along the way, but he encourages his management team to take risks.\n\"If you are out there not taking some commercial risks you are not doing your job.\n\"We have taken risks with businesses, we have tried to set up a premium airline in Singapore and a low-cost carrier in Hong Kong. Some of these things are not going to work but at the end of the day would you go back and not try them? If you had that attitude Jetstar would never have happened.\"\nFuture agenda Completing the transformation program, improving customer service, renewing the fleet, and getting the airline's costs down to within 5 per cent of rival Virgin Australia are also on top of his agenda in coming years.\n\"The game is not over yet,\" he quips.\nJoyce does not appear battle-scarred despite the name-calling, the calls to resign, and the public backlash when he grounded the entire fleet to end an industrial dispute in 2011. Seated in the airline's glass-walled boardroom, Joyce gestures to the bustling atrium below and says he is enjoying the smiles rather than frowns from staff when he comes to work each day.\n\"As we were walking around after the results yesterday there were smiles everywhere,\" Joyce says, comparing it to his first encounter with a group of 700 engineers in Brisbane when he started in the job over six years ago.\n\"The engineers were all crossing their arms and asking negative questions about the intentions of management and where it is going. Now they are asking all positive questions.\"\nJoyce says he received a lot of support from other chief executives such as Richard Goyder, Gail Kelly and Elmer Funke Kupper who would send him text messages during the rough patches. British Airways boss Willie Walsh texted on Thursday night to congratulate him on the result.\nJoyce, who is openly gay, has also said his partner Shane also supported him through the tough times.\nHe says he is disappointed with the direction the gay marriage debate has taken in Australia, contrasting it with the referendum in his native Ireland earlier this year.\n\"My worry about a plebiscite or a referendum is that it can be very decisive and have the opposite impact a change of law would have had.\n\"The suicide rate of young gay men is six times the national average and the depression rate is higher. The whole message behind marriage equality is that it is OK to be gay, society accepts it. Any piece of legislation that says you are not equal is just wrong. \"\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-08-21T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:50:31.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
