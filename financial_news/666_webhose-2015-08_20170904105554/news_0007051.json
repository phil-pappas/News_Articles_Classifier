Auctioneer this September and October. On June 18, 2015, Gordon Brothers Group announced that it had executed a definitive agreement with Rodan Transport (U.S.A) Ltd. and Hodges Trucking Company to acquire a large portion of Hodges’ fleet of heavy haul and mobile crane equipment and undertook its immediate, orderly disposition. Ritchie Bros. subsequently approached Gordon Brothers Group’s Commercial & Industrial Division to arrange for a large-scale auction event to include the equipment, which consists of mobile cranes (all terrain, truck mounted and crawler), truck tractors, trailers, forklifts/loaders and service trucks.“Due to the late model nature of the fleet and its outstanding condition, we received a tremendous amount of interest from both dealers and end users around the country,” stated Robert Maroney, President of Gordon Brothers Group’s Commercial & Industrial Division. “We quickly realized that combining our extensive orderly disposition experience in this sector along with Ritchie Bros.’ proven success in an auction format would be a mutually advantageous strategy to maximize the value of these assets.” “The equipment acquired by Gordon Brothers Group includes some of the best-maintained and high performing cranes on the market today,” said Terry Dolan, President (USA & Latin America), Ritchie Bros. “We are excited to work with Gordon Brothers Group and look forward to the results we can accomplish together.” In March 2015, Ritchie Bros. conducted a record-breaking crane auction in Wyoming. It was the largest single-owner auction in company history, selling more than $54 million of equipment, including 38 cranes, and attracting over 3,000 bidders from 47 countries.The equipment will be featured and sold in two separate Ritchie Bros. auctions, on September 23 - 24 in Fort Worth, Texas and October 6 in Columbus, Ohio. Both auctions will be open to the public and all items will be sold unreserved, with no minimum bids or reserve prices.
