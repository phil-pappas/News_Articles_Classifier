Modest growth in home lending is to be expected as the economy grows, the population continues to grow — that’s a key driver — and interest rates are low.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/housing-prices-property-investor-home-loans-fall/story-fndbarft-1227474820222?sv=325c93c6cf9cf10ccf3d34541f76386c&title=The+signal+that+house+prices+may+stall", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/housing-prices-property-investor-home-loans-fall/story-fndbarft-1227474820222?sv=325c93c6cf9cf10ccf3d34541f76386c", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/housing-prices-property-investor-home-loans-fall/story-fndbarft-1227474820222?sv=325c93c6cf9cf10ccf3d34541f76386c&title=The+signal+that+house+prices+may+stall", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/housing-prices-property-investor-home-loans-fall/story-fndbarft-1227474820222?sv=325c93c6cf9cf10ccf3d34541f76386c", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+signal+that+house+prices+may+stall&c=THIS+could+be+the+one+sign+that+the+brakes+may+soon+be+applied+to+slow+down+the+rate+of+soaring+house+prices.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/housing-prices-property-investor-home-loans-fall/story-fndbarft-1227474820222?sv=325c93c6cf9cf10ccf3d34541f76386c", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/housing-prices-property-investor-home-loans-fall/story-fndbarft-1227474820222?sv=325c93c6cf9cf10ccf3d34541f76386c&h=The+signal+that+house+prices+may+stall"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T17:05:50.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
