Justin McManus by Geoff Winestock Politicians like to criticise unions and businesses for poor corporate governance. But the shock news that the Victorian Liberals somehow misplaced $1.5 million makes it look like they are throwing stones in a glass house.\nThe alleged embezzlement by former Victorian state party director Damien Mantach has parallels to revelations about the NSW Liberals at the Independent Commission Against Corruption last year. Both cases add to the impression that political parties have only the weakest of controls over how they spend or raise their money, including the millions of dollars they receive in public election funding.\nThis is not just a Liberal problem as shown by the trade union royal commission's revelations about ALP leader Bill Shorten's failure to disclose a donation from a labor hire firm. But the mess at the Victorian Liberals comes at a very poor time for a party that likes to stress its financial management skills.\nThe $1.5 million was no bagatelle. It represents 7.5 per cent of the party's 2013-14 expenditure. How could a Liberal Party State executive, which includes such financial luminaries as state party president Michael Kroger, fail to notice that the money was not there for what appears to be over a year?\nThe level of regulation is zilch The answer according to Joo-Cheong Tham, associate professor of Melbourne University Law School is that political paries operate with an organisation designed for \"stamp collecting societies\" rather than modern institutions. \"The level of regulation is zilch,\" he said.\nThe executive committees may be composed of eminent party members but they have no legal responsibility for or direct control over what the state officials do. In the NSW and Victorian cases, he said: \"It seems like there was no effective oversight provided by the administrative committee.\"\nOne reason this system persists is that it offers the huge advantage of plausible deniability to those on the committees. During the ICAC inquiry into the NSW division of the Liberals last yea r it emerged that almost no one, including Senator Arthur Sinodinos, then chairman of the finance committee and honorary treasurer, was paying attention to the flows of potentially illegal cash into and out of the party coffers from property developers that are banned from donating under NSW law.\n When he was asked about his responsibility at ICAC, Mr Sinodinos was at first confused. \"Responsibility in what sense?\" he said.\nHe then said that he only ever looked at numbers \"in aggregate\" and all responsibility was born by the party's finance director.\nThe other insight from ICAC relevant for Victoria is that battles between party factions can make it hard for any one person to see how all the money is being spent.\nVictoria's Liberals are torn between pro and anti-Kroger factions. That parallels NSW, where some money from potentially illegal sources bypassed the \"left-faction\" dominated state executive and was shifted to campaigns for specific candidates at the behest of right faction power brokers.\nLindsay Partridge, managing director of Liberal Party donor Brickworks, complained that: \"Giving money to the Liberal Party was like giving a hot chip to a bunch of seagulls. The seagull that has got the chip in his mouth doesn't necessarily get to eat it.\"\nAfter the revelations in NSW the state Liberal party appointed a former ICAC officer to overhaul its governance system. But there are calls for more reform.\nA leaked resignation email in February from Phil Higginson, a former federal Liberal Party treasurer, revealed he had major concerns about governance at a national level.\nIn NSW an inquiry led by prominent businesswoman Kerry Schott recommended that senior executive committees of political parties face statutory penalties just like board directors and the parties should face the same burdens of financial reporting as corporations with external audit by the NSW auditor general. NSW premier Mike Baird has accepted the proposals in principle but no legislation has yet been tabled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T09:02:05.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
