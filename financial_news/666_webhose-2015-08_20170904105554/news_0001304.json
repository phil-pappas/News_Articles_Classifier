Its Taobao platform holds more than 90 percent of the country?s consumer-to-consumer market. \nAlibaba's founder and executive chairman Jack Ma said: \"Over the past two decades, e-commerce has become an inextricable part of the lives of Chinese consumers, and this new alliance brings forth a new commerce model that fully integrates online and offline.\" \nSuning chairman Zhang Jindong said the deal would \"help transform China's manufacturing industry and broaden the global horizons of Chinese brands\". \nIt is the latest in a string of acquisitions by Alibaba as Ma seeks to diversify the huge New York-listed company, which is facing domestic competition from Internet giants Baidu (Xetra: A0F5DE - news ) and Tencent (HKSE: 0700-OL.HK - news ) and remains relatively unknown outside China. \nTwo weeks ago Alibaba announced it would invest $1.0 billion in its cloud computing arm to expand its international presence. \nIn June, it launched an Internet bank aimed at serving small businesses which often struggle to obtain credit from large banks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T12:44:49.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
