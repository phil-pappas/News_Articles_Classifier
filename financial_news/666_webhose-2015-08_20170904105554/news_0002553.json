If it's an electronic system, it's easy to say $0.15 or $0.10 to go through. Cumulatively, it becomes a figure that greatly enhances and improves what we do on the road network.\" \nMr Mugabe said given that they would use an electronic system, they did not consider constructing toll plazas. \n\"There are systems that have been developed and generated in other parts of the world that we are considering and looking at which one will work best for us. \n\"The advantage we have is that we have an electronic database of vehicles that are in the country.

There are certain motorists who will now think twice before they just drive through and add congestion to certain areas,\" he said. \nMr Mugabe said the urban tolling would enable them to track vehicles that default on licences. \nHe said some vehicles still had old number plates more than three years after the introduction of new ones. \n\"But with the urban tolling system, all those vehicles will be in our system and will become contributors to the road fund and that will greatly help us to generate revenue that we need to make a more discernible impact. \n\"It also help us when we are going out and reaching out to investors both local and international, it means the pot we have grown it slightly bigger which means we can borrow significantly more which will help us halt the decay on our roads.\" Zimbabwe \nHarare City Council is set to give World Boxing Council international welterweight champion Charles Manyuchi, a … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Herald.
