Near-term resistance is at 1.3207, the 23.6% Fibonacci expansion, with a break above that on a daily closing basis exposing the 38.2% level at 1.3366. Alternatively, a push below the 14.6% Fib retracement at 1.3054 opens the door for a challenge of the 23.6% threshold at 1.2956. An actionable trade setup is absent at this point, arguing against committing to a directional bias on long or short side. We will continue to stand aside for now, waiting for a clear-cut trading opportunity to present itself in the days ahead.
