Mr Flavell said the performance of Help Me Choose, which offers mortgage and health fund comparisons, would be addressed as a matter of urgency. \"The financial performance of our Help Me Choose business was not as it should have been,\" he said. Staff were recruited too early and improved results in May and June were not enough to offset higher costs, Mr Flavell said. Mortgage Choice shares gained one cent to $2.01.
