You love them, or you hate them.[/tweet_Quote: ] You view them as the answer to all of your budgetary problems, or you consider them to be an easy way to get into debt and pay a lot of money in interest.The thing is, as with anything, when used in moderation, credit cards are actually pretty handy tools-- and an important one if you're trying to build up your credit for your future endeavors (like applying for a loan or apartment). Part of making sure you use credit cards correctly is understanding what exactly can negatively impact your credit score (aside from obvious things, like maxing out your card then forgetting to pay it off for a while). [tweet_Quote: display=\"Here are eight unexpected things you may want to avoid to keep your credit score in good shape:\"]Here are eight unexpected things you may want to avoid to keep your credit score in good shape:[/tweet_Quote: ] 1. Not Paying Your Doc Remember a couple of months ago when you went to the doctor? Did you get a bill in the mail a few days later? If you did, and that bill is now sitting unpaid under a stack of other mail on your kitchen counter, your credit score may be taking a hit. Medical bills are sent to debt collection agencies after a certain amount of time, and when that happens, it negatively impacts your credit. So, make sure you keep up with those expenses every time you head into the doctor or dentist for a checkup or procedure. 2. Not Paying Your Rent or Utilities And it's not just medical debt that can impact your credit, either-- failing to pay basically anything on time could cause a problem for you down the road. Landlords and utility companies can report you to credit agencies if you aren't paying your expenses on time or in full. Even that parking ticket you got a few months ago or the debt you racked up on your library card last year could come back and bite you if they're reported to debt collectors or credit agencies. 3. Applying for Too Many Credit Cards at Once A common thing many people don't realize affects their credit is a hard inquiry. Hard inquiries are what happens when someone requests a credit check on you (your landlord probably did one when you applied for the apartment , for instance). That means that any time you apply for an apartment, loan, or mortgage your credit takes a hit. Even applying for a new credit card means you're requesting a hard inquiry, though. That means that if you apply for multiple credit cards at once (even just the in-store ones you can use for discounts), your credit could be significantly affected. 4. Closing Out a Credit Card On the other side of the spectrum, believe it or not, even closing an old credit card can affect your score negatively. There are a couple of reasons this is the case. For one thing, your credit utilization affects your score-- in other words, having a high credit limit and using just a small amount of it is better than having a low limit and using all of it. When you close a credit card, that lowers the amount of total credit you have, which affects that ratio. Another thing that impacts your score? Your credit age. That means, if you're closing your oldest credit card, your credit age will be a bit younger, potentially reducing your score. 5. Going Credit Crazy Speaking of credit utilization, it's best to avoid spending too much on your credit cards. If you have a $1,000 limit, and you use your credit card for a $700 computer, that's 70% utilization-- and that's bad. Try to keep your utilization to under 30%. 6. Avoiding Credit Cards Completely As mentioned above, you do need to build credit to do things like apply for loans and buy cars. But what's more, having just a single type of credit can decrease your score. That means even if you're building credit by paying student loans or in some other way, a credit card can still help you make your credit history more diverse. 7. Renting a Car With a Debit Card OK, this one is a little stranger-- if you rent a car with a debit card, rather than a credit card, your credit can take a hit. Why? For some car rental companies, when customers use a debit card it causes them to order a hard inquiry on their credit. Pay with a credit card or check the rental application to keep this from happening. 8. Forgetting Your Payment Just Once Of course, everyone knows you have to pay off your credit card or you can say goodbye to a good score. But did you know that even a single late payment can affect your overall credit? It can if it's late by more than 30 days! The lesson? Pay everything on time. You'll have a better credit score (and a better conscience).", "external_links": ["http://www.rent.com/blog/avoid-common-money-blunders/", "http://www.rent.com/blog/how-late-payments-affect-your-credit-score/", "http://www.rent.com/blog/pay-debt-or-save-that-is-the-question/", "http://www.rent.com/blog/how-to-land-apartment-no-credit-history/", "http://www.rent.com/blog/financial-bad-habits-and-how-to-break-them/"], "published": "2015-08-21T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T21:13:37.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
