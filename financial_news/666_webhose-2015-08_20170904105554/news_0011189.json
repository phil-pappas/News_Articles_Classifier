Now (Frankfurt: 11N.F - news ) we need the board and the management to explain their Plan B,\" said Pauline McPherson, co-fund manager of Kames Capital's global equity fund, which holds Syngenta stock. \n\"The ball is firmly in their camp with regards to creating the value they have just refused,\" she added. \nA second investor, who declined to be named, also questioned why Syngenta's management were so reluctant to open their books. \n\"There will be a huge amount of pressure ... whether they care is another matter...They had a reasonable bid on the table and now the share has fallen 20 percent... it will be interesting to see what Syngenta has to say.\" (Reporting By Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop, editing by Alexander Smith)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:05:08.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
