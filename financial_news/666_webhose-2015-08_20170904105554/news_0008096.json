The low rates may be distorting valuations and creating asset bubbles. \n\"The Fed is in an extremely awk6ward situation right now,\" Robbert van Batenburg, director of flow strategy at Societe Generale. \"You have across-the-board competitive currency devaluations that will invoke the deflationary monster here in the U.S.\" \nStocks on Wall Street and in Europe fell more than 2 percent in a global rout spurred by a 4-percent decline in Shanghai stocks. Major European indices were in correction territory, a decline of 10 percent or more from their peak. \nThe pan-regional FTSEurofirst fell 3.4 percent to 1,427.13, its worst day since November 2011, as traders shrugged off euro zone manufacturing and services data in a third straight day of selling. \nMSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's emerging markets index was at its weakest in four years, off 2.17 percent, while the firm's all-country world stock index fell 1.99 percent. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average is fell 365.39 points, or 2.15 percent, to 16,625.3. The S&P 500 slid 43.91 points, or 2.16 percent, to 1,991.82 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 114.10 points, or 2.34 percent, to 4,763.39. \nThomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors in New York, said it was hard to say what was behind the selloff. \n\"There's no shortage of things people can cite, from the movement in currencies, to the weakness in commodities and fears about China,\" Lee said. \"But at the end of the day if people are trying to take down risk, then it's going to make sense for them to sell their exposure in equities as well.\" \nOil fell hard again. U.S. crude was at a more than 6-year low, on track for its eighth straight weekly decline, down 3.17 percent to $40.01 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark traded below the psychologically-important barrier of $40. Brent fell 3.13 percent to $45.16 a barrel. \nOil's run of weekly losses is its worst since 1986, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ramped up production and sent it as low as $10 a barrel. \nThe Australian dollar, considered a liquid proxy for China demand, slid to $0.7285 at one point and was last trading at $0.7330, down 0.08 percent. \nThe Malaysian ringgit hit a pre-peg 17-year low and South Korea's won took its losses to 1.8 percent against the dollar this week. The Mexican peso, a proxy for emerging market currencies, fell 1 percent. \n\"The perfect storm that has enveloped EM local markets looks set to continue,\" Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) analysts said in a note. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) , seen as a good asset in difficult times, rose to its highest level in more than a month. Gold was up 0.55 percent at $1,159.60 an ounce. \nYields on safe-haven U.S. Treasuries slipped further, with the benchmark 10-year note rising 12/32 in price, pushing its yield down to 2.0417 percent. \nLower Treasury yields and the stronger euro weighed on the dollar. The greenback traded at 121.97 yen, the lowest in more than five weeks. Against the euro, the dollar fell 1.1 percent to $1.1364.
