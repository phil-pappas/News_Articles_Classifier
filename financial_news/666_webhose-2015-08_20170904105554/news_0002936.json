WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) â€” Sales at U.S. retailers were solid in July and stronger than previously estimated for May and June, suggesting the economy is on firm footing going into the second half of the year.\nRetail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% last month, or by 0.4% excluding the auto sector, the Commerce Department said Thursday.\nRetail sales account for about one-third of consumer spending, the main engine of U.S. economic activity.\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch had forecast retail sales to rise by 0.7% overall and by 0.6% minus autos.\nAdding to the sense of strength were upward revisions to May and June.\nIn June, sales were revised up to unchanged from a decline of 0.3%. May sales were revised to show a gain of 1.9% instead of a 1.0% gain.\nThe firm retail sales data gives more ammunition to supporters of a rate hike on the Federal Reserve.\nThe U.S. central bank will meet in mid-September, and many economists expect the Fed to hike rates for the first time since 2006, although recent moves by China to devalue its currency have caused some analysts to conclude the U.S. central bank may wait to move until later in the year.\nOne major factor that could cause the Fed to delay a rate hike is continued low inflation. And there was a fresh signal of disinflation on Thursday as import prices fell 0.9% according to the Labor Department, the biggest drop in six months.\nIn the retail sales data in July, the gains were led by the auto sector, where sales jumped 1.4%. This was expected as the light vehicle selling rate rose to a seasonally adjusted 17.5 million units, the second best result since early 2006.\nBut the sales gain in July was broad based.\nAll sectors showed increases except electronics and general merchandise and department stores.\nIn the past year, retail sales have risen 2.4%.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:12:53.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
