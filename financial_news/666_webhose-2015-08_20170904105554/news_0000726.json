Stripping out the businesses Nuplex sold in the year, underlying profit rose 39 per cent to $NZ63.4 million on a 1.4 per cent increase in sales to $NZ1.37 billion. Operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 15 per cent to $NZ127 million , within Nuplex's guidance for Ebitda from continuing operations to be between $NZ124 million and $NZ128 million. Chief executive Emery Severin said its improved earnings was driven by growth in Europe, Asia, the Americas and a turnaround in Australasia. He said its plans in Asia and the new technologies and products coming through its research and development had it well placed to deliver improved returns and grow earnings in the coming years. Nuplex has been cutting back operations in Australia and New Zealand, where a weaker performance is weighing on growth in Asia, America and Europe. In November it sold its Australasian agency and distribution business Nuplex Specialties and its plastic additives business Nuplex Masterbatch for $A127.5 million ($NZ142.3 million) to focus on global resins. The shares last traded at $NZ4.18, and have climbed 40 per cent this year.
