Investors are even willing to accept yields lower than benchmark indexes on the state’s short-maturity debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nCalifornia plans to take advantage of the renewed faith in its finances by selling $1.9 billion in general obligations this week in the first offering of the securities since Standard & Poor’s raised the state’s credit rating to its highest level in 14 years. S&P noted that California’s economy is expanding faster than the nation’s, due in part to innovative sectors such as technology that draw capital investment to the state.\n“The state of California has done a very nice job as far as improving its fiscal situation,” said Greg Kaplan, director of fixed income in San Francisco at City National Bank’s Rochdale unit, which manages $4.4 billion in munis. “Five years ago, people didn’t want that paper. That fear is gone.”\nIn July, S&P lifted the state’s rating to AA-, its fourth-highest level, and pointed to passage of a budget that directed money to a rainy-day fund approved by voters in November. The fund, which requires the state to save a portion of capital-gains taxes, helps cushion the state when receipts fall, the company said.\nCredit Environment “It was important to see them enact a budget that represented an extension of their recent approach to their fiscal policy, which has been to emphasize structural alignment between the ongoing revenues and recurring expenditures,” Gabriel Petek, a San Francisco-based S&P analyst, said Monday.\nInvestors have also liked how California under Governor Jerry Brown has notched budget surpluses after more than $100 billion of cumulative deficits from 2000 through 2010.\n“Governor Brown has put the fiscal house in order,” said Ben Woo, senior municipal analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which manages about $30 billion in local debt. “Compared to the chaotic political environment we’re seeing in New Jersey and Illinois, California is a much better credit environment than some other states.”\nInvestors are demanding about 0.18 percentage point over top-rated debt to own 10-year California securities, close to the 0.17 percentage point low since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from a peak of about 1.7 percentage points in 2009, when the state resorted to IOUs to pay bills.\nThat’s also better than the 0.52 percentage point for debt issued by Pennsylvania, which has the same investment-grade ratings from S&P and Moody’s Investors Service.\nGreece Comparison If mutual-fund flows remain consistent, it’s a “pretty easy case to make” that California spreads can go to 0.1 percentage point this year, Kaplan said.\nThat level was seen in 2006 and 2007, before deficits for the nation’s most indebted state soared amid the recession and sparked comparisons to Greece, which has recently received a third bailout since 2010 from European authorities to repay creditors.\nYield premiums on individual California general obligations have declined. In March, California sold 10-year bonds at 0.26 percentage point over benchmark munis. The premium has narrowed to 0.21 percentage point on Aug. 17.\nOverall yields on California bonds have narrowed 10 basis points this year to 2.41 percent, when compared with the average yield of AAA rated 10-year securities, the second-best performance among 20 states tracked by Bloomberg.\nCapital Projects California is selling bonds mostly to refund securities and to help fund capital projects such as roads and public buildings.\n“We have to take advantage of our recent credit upgrades, and I encourage individual and institutional investors to get behind California and help us make this sale a success,” State Treasurer John Chiang said in a statement.\nThe size of the deal might “take some digestion” and may prevent the state from testing new lows for yields, Woo said.\nAdrian Van Poppel, who helps run a California fund for Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, said he would want risk premiums above those seen on existing bonds before buying.\n“It’ll just come down to pricing for us,” he said. “You’re not getting much” in extra yield for debt maturing under five years.\nInvestors are demanding 0.57 percent to own California two-year bonds, less than the 0.6 percent for benchmark munis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n“We’ll definitely be following it,” Van Poppel said. “They’ve been moving in the right direction.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T17:31:08.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
