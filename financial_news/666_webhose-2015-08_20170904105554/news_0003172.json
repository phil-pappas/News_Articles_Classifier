Qantas is expected to post an almost $1 billion pre-tax profit for the 2014/15 financial year, a huge turnaround from its record $646 million underlying loss in the prior year. The ratings could be upgraded again if Qantas' positive momentum is continued and operating conditions are sustained or improved, Moody's said.
