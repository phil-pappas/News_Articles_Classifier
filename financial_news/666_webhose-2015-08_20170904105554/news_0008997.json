Reuters Share on twitter by Philip Baker As gloom follows boom, there will be better times for the sharemarket after the recent declines.\nBut just don't expect the latest earnings season to help propel stocks higher any time soon.\nIf stocks do go higher, it will have to be something else that sends them north.\nThe sharemarket is still one of the best generators of long-term capital appreciation for investors, but the past few weeks have clearly shown that short-term pain can be a consequence of exposure to the riskier asset class.\nThe obvious benefit of the latest sell-off is that it has made stocks cheaper.\nIf Glenn Stevens, the governor of the Reserve Bank , is right and Australia's growth potential has fallen, then unless there is an increase in productivity, life for companies will remain tough.\nIndeed, on Wednesday, the latest set of national accounts are due to be released and the economy is tipped to have expanded 0.4 per cent for the three months ended June 30, but slowed to an annual rate of just 2.2 per cent.\nAs analysts troll through the latest set of results, there doesn't seem to be one theme that stands out.\n As CommSec's Craig James points out, that's odd. Normally, there will be something that catches the eye but not this time around, while the outlook isn't that bright.\n\"Corporate Australia is at the crossroads. Earnings have been hard to generate in the past year, and if anything, this is likely to continue,\" he said.\nThe first six months of financial 2015 were tough but the second six months were much better, which might flow through to the current half year.\nBut in line with the economy, the nation's top companies are doing the best they can without exactly shooting the lights out.\nOK, but can do better.\nThere's no doubt the operating environment for companies has been tougher.\nIn turn, that has made it more difficult to increase revenue and so it's been tougher to turn a profit to help the bottom line.\nCommSec took a detailed look at 143 companies from the S&P/ASX 200 index that announced full-year profits in the past month, and on their numbers, revenue edged up 0.4 per cent, while expenses grew 3.1 per cent, resulting in a 31.9 per cent fall in net profit.\nThat compares with a fall in profits of 26.2 per cent for the six months ended December 31.\nAs James points out, \"There has been a sharp lift in the variability of bottom-line earnings\" and some companies have chosen to take \"impairments\" to bottom-line earnings.\n\"Stripping out 'outliers', we estimate that underlying aggregate revenues rose by 2.0 per cent, expenses rose by 2.2 per cent and aggregate profits fell by 3 per cent,\" said James.\nAbout 80 per cent of companies reported a profit, which is below the long-term average.\nBut of those that did, 71.7 per cent lifted profits, compared with 65 per cent in the February season, while about 60 per cent of all companies improved their bottom-line results.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-31T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:04:22.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
