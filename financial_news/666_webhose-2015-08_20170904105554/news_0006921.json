Lucasfilm / Disney Films Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason Colin Trevorrow has been officially announced as the director of the final movie in the new Star Wars trilogy being made by Disney, to be released in 2019.\nThe announcement was made at Disney's D23 Expo in Anaheim, California, as fans of the series were also given a first look at the photography for the first of two Star Wars spinoffs, Rogue One , staring Felicity Jones, which is slated for release in December 2016.\nIt comes as Star Wars: The Force Awakens , the first Disney film in the series and directed by Star Trek director JJ Abrams, gets set for release on December 17 in Australia.\nDisney chief executive Bob Iger also announced that the company would be building two 5.6-hectare Star Wars-themed lands at the company's Orlando, Florida, and Anaheim, California, resorts.\nMr Trevorrow, who recently directed Jurassic World , which grossed $US1 billion ($1.36 billion) in two weeks, said taking up the final movie in the new trilogy was not a job or assignment, but \"a seat at a campfire\" with many others.\n\"We've been charged with telling new stories for a younger generation because they deserve what we all had â€“ a mythology to call their own. We will do this by channelling something George Lucas instilled in all of us: boundless creativity, pure invention and hope.\"\nLucasfilm was bought by Disney in 2012 for $US4 billion, which was the easy part, Mr Iger said.\n\"Considering the responsibility associated with buying it and what that means was harder. There is a huge responsibility on my shoulders, on our shoulders, that I even felt today on stage talking with George to make sure that the legacy he created is honoured.\"\n The original Star Wars movie, A New Hope , was released in 1977 and the film has grown to epic proportions to including films, music, video games, cartoons, books and countless forms of merchandise.\nCritics have often taken aim at the newer prequel Star Wars film series, which started with A Phantom Menace in 1999.\nMr Iger said making a new Star Wars series was a difficult task because of the need to balance the expectations of old fans and trying to create new ones.\n\"The first thing you have to understand is that once you appreciate how great it is, the world is changing all the time,\" Mr Iger said.\n\"No one wants it to be the same. They may say that they do, but deep down in order to experience this in the highest form you have to have a different entertainment experience than what it was before.\"\nThe creator of Star Wars, Lucas, who was given the Disney Legends award on Friday, seemed confident Disney would do a good job with Star Wars .\n\"I think Disney has given me back much more than I have given Disney,\" he told a crowd at the D23 Expo.\nMax Mason travelled to D23 courtesy of Disney.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts"], "published": "2015-08-16T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:07:32.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
