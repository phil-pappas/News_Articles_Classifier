ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan said that while the decline was modest, it was disappointing that confidence levels were yet to bounce back to the heights reached before worries about Greek government debt and Chinese market volatility hurt sentiment. \"Sentiment towards the future, particularly the medium- to long-term outlook for the economy, is extremely weak,\" he said. \"The Australian consumer remains highly vulnerable to a negative economic or financial shock.\" Mr Hogan said the outlook for consumer confidence was uncertain because the boost that the strong housing market was giving the retail sector wouldn't be sustained. \"Housing will be less stimulative to retail sales into 2016 as higher interest rates for investors and other policies aimed at limiting investor housing lending growth slow house price growth,\" he said. \"This means that it will be essential for other drivers of confidence and spending, namely jobs and wages, to lift as housing tails off.\" ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Consumer+confidence+hits+a+speed+bump&c=THE+ANZ%2FRoy+Morgan+weekly+consumer+confidence+index+fell+0.4+per+cent+last+week%2C+after+gaining+5.5+per+cent+in+the+previous+three+weeks.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/consumer-confidence-hits-a-speed-bump/story-e6frfkur-1227478411503?sv=e0f8f22c91cf0df7c337beb585831c57", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/consumer-confidence-hits-a-speed-bump/story-e6frfkur-1227478411503?sv=e0f8f22c91cf0df7c337beb585831c57&title=Consumer+confidence+hits+a+speed+bump", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/consumer-confidence-hits-a-speed-bump/story-e6frfkur-1227478411503?sv=e0f8f22c91cf0df7c337beb585831c57", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/consumer-confidence-hits-a-speed-bump/story-e6frfkur-1227478411503?sv=e0f8f22c91cf0df7c337beb585831c57&h=Consumer+confidence+hits+a+speed+bump", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/consumer-confidence-hits-a-speed-bump/story-e6frfkur-1227478411503?sv=e0f8f22c91cf0df7c337beb585831c57", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/consumer-confidence-hits-a-speed-bump/story-e6frfkur-1227478411503?sv=e0f8f22c91cf0df7c337beb585831c57&title=Consumer+confidence+hits+a+speed+bump"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T07:55:17.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
