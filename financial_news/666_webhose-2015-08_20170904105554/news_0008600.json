And it comes as concerns are growing about a generation of new internet-driven business such as Uber and Lyft that depend heavily on independent contractors that often do not have the benefits and protections of full-time employees.\nIn a case that drew intense lobbying by both business and union groups, Democratic appointees on the panel split 3-2 with Republicans to adopt a more expansive definition of what it means to be a \"joint employer\". The decision makes it more difficult for companies to avoid responsibility for the treatment of employees by outsourcing work to others.\nIn doing so, the panel sided with labour advocates and academics who have described an increasingly fissured economy, in which whole industries have been built on business models that offer workers few of the protections of a traditional employer relationship.\nAdvertisement \"With more than 2.87 million of the nation's workers employed through temporary agencies in August 2014, the board held that its previous joint employer standard has failed to keep pace with changes in the workplace and economic circumstances,\" the board said.\nThe board's action is just the latest to tackle the trend. The Department of Labour has cracked down on employers who misclassify workers as independent contractors, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has directed inspectors to consider whether principal employers might be at fault for the safety violations of their subcontractors. Courts, meanwhile, have been scrutinising companies like FedEx and Uber for their use of contractors.\nEmployers are pushing back. Businesses that might be subject to the new joint employer definition have warned that it could undermine established business practices that have kept the US economy competitive by holding down labour costs.\nAs a result of the decision, some businesses may try to legally distance themselves from their partners to avoid joint employer status, but others may find they need to exert more control.\nCorporations are \"trying to have it both ways â€“ have the benefits of the control, and not the disadvantages\", said Timothy Glynn, a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law. \"Where I think it would be very difficult to give up control is circumstances where there's some exacting need for quality, timeliness, or consistency in the product.\"\nIt is not only between unions and employers that the issue has been a bone of contention. It also created sharp disagreements within the labour board: The two Republican appointees authored a blistering dissent, arguing that the new standard goes beyond the body's authority and could have unintended consequences.\n\"Under the majority's test, the home owner hiring a plumbing company for bathroom renovations could well have all of that indirect control over a company employee!\" the dissent read. \"We suppose that our colleagues do not intend that every business relationship necessarily entails joint employer status, but the facts relied upon here demonstrate the expansive, near-limitless nature of the majority's new standard.\"\nWashington Post\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FairfaxForeign", "https://www.facebook.com/FairfaxForeign"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:44:56.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
