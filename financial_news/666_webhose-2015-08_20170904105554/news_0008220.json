ANZ also said its provisions for bad and doubtful debts had increased, partly due to stress in the resources and agriculture sectors. Despite releasing the numbers ahead of schedule, chief executive Mike Smith will still brief investors on Tuesday, and will likely face questions about the state of business confidence and the economy. Among other companies releasing financial results on Tuesday are QBE Insurance, retailer Dick Smith, pathology and radiology provider Sonic Healthcare and Sydney Airport.
