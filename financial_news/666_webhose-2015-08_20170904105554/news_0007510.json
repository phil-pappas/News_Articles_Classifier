The Independent Community Bankers of America® (ICBA) is proud to highlight outstanding community banks and community bankers who make social media an integral part of their marketing and communications strategy. ICBA today released its Top 50 Community Bank Leaders in Social Media and Top 25 Community Bank Influencers on Twitter. This is the third year the association has held this contest, which was sponsored by Shazam and highlights social media trailblazers among the community bank industry.\n“These top community banks and bankers understand that building a reputable financial brand goes beyond just a physical presence on Main Street,” ICBA Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Chris Lorence said. “These community banks and bankers consistently introduce fresh content and interact with their customers both in-person and online. ICBA is pleased to recognize them for their digital efforts.”\nMore than 6,000 community banks throughout the nation were eligible to be part of ICBA’s list. ICBA sought nominations from the nation’s community banks from May to June and received nearly 300 nominations. Community banks were chosen based on their engagement with fans and followers, the content distributed on their social media platforms, the number of followers they have and the frequency of posting new content.\nThe community banks and community bankers featured on ICBA’s Top 50 Community Bank Leaders in Social Media and the Top 25 Community Bank Influencers on Twitter will be profiled in the September 2015 issue of ICBA Independent Banker®, ICBA’s award-winning magazine.\nTo view all 50 community banks and 25 community bankers featured on these lists, visit http://www.icba.org/smleaders .
