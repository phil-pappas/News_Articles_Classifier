(MarketWatch) — Investors’ reaction to Google’s reorganization plan is yet another sign of an overvalued stock market.\nThat’s because the reorganization, along with the market’s exuberant reaction to it, is something often seen near the end of bull markets. It represents a triumph of financial engineering over substance. Even though it’s hard to see how any of the changes will make Google GOOG, +4.27% more profitable, investors quickly decided that the company was worth nearly $30 billion more because of it.\nThe only people who are guaranteed to profit from the shell game are the army of lawyers and accountants who will be employed to dot the i’s and cross the t’s in the reorganization.\nThat hasn’t stopped cheerleader investors from trumpeting a number of supposed benefits of the greater “transparency” that will result from the new organizational structure. But how, exactly, does transparency translate into bigger profits? It’s not as if Google executives don’t already know how profitable their core search-and-advertising business really is or how unprofitable most of their other divisions are.\nIn any case, according to hedge fund manager Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management, the greater transparency that Google is now committing itself to is merely standard operating procedure for most other companies. Why get all excited about something the company should have been doing all along?\nKass, in an email, called the Google reorganization “a total non-event.”\n“It is amazing to me how gullible analysts are when a company like Google makes the smallest move toward transparency after being opaque in its operations from its inception as a publicly traded entity,” he said.\nAlphabet, Google’s new parent, is born (1:39)\nCoinciding with the reorganization, the company is changing its name to Alphabet. Might the market’s positive reaction be at least partially because of that name change?\nEven raising this possibility conjures up yet another dangerous precedent: The market’s exuberant reaction in the late 1990s to companies that changed their names to include “.com.” One study, by Michael Cooper of the University of Utah and his two co-authors , analyzed the market’s reaction to 63 such companies and found that their stocks, on average, did 74% better than the market over the 10 days surrounding the announcements of their name changes.\nThe authors considered this to be prima facie evidence of investor irrationality.\nTo be sure, Google’s stock hasn’t received a 74% boost. But that doesn’t mean investors aren’t being just as irrational.\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Sentiment Indexes.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://ssrn.com/abstract=254052"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:00:51.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
