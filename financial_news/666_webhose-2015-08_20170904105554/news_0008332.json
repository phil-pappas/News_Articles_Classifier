(NYSE: N), a leading global provider of cloud-based financials/ERP and omnichannel commerce suites, to deploy the NetSuite OneWorld solution. The solution will support the core finance, financial planning and procurement functions, including financial consolidation, multicurrency and tax compliance. \n“An agile and intuitive back-office IT system is critical for effective management and delivery of large-scale infrastructure projects,” said Robin Johns, head of Information Systems at Thames Tideway Tunnel. “We selected Accenture to help us with this implementation based on its extensive experience with NetSuite cloud ERP technology and complex system integrations. We also chose Accenture for its ability to offer practical solutions to deliver an IT platform that will help facilitate financing and construction of the super sewer, while keeping costs down for customers.” \nMaureen Costello, managing director of Accenture’s utilities practice in the U.K. and Ireland, said, “The NetSuite platform will enable Thames Tideway Tunnel to streamline its core operations and make faster and more-informed business decisions based on real-time data. This is the first implementation of a true multi-tenant cloud-based ERP system at a regulated utility in the U.K. and demonstrates the company’s innovative approach and commitment to efficiently manage the delivery of this capital project.” \nTo date, Accenture has worked on more than 9,000 cloud computing projects for clients, including nearly 75 percent of the Fortune Global 100, and has more than 17,000 professionals trained in cloud computing. \nAbout Thames Tideway Tunnel \nThe Thames Tideway Tunnel is a 25km sewer tunnel which will intercept the 34 most polluting Combined Sewage Overflow (CSO) points along the River Thames. Currently, 39 million tonnes of raw sewage pours into the river after heavy rainfall in a typical year. Work is due to start in 2016, and the project is due for completion in 2023.
