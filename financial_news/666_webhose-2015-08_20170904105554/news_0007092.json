Share on twitter by Michael Smith For years Peter Coleman resisted pressure to address the company's growing cash pile.\nInvestors clamoured for growth, given the company's robust cash flows, and there were fears the Woodside Petroleum chief executive was passing up expansion opportunities in favour of cost cuts.\nThe sharp and unexpected deterioration in oil prices mean Coleman's conservatism is paying off now. He cannot afford to be too smug, given the impact falling oil prices are having on his company's earnings and dividends , but Woodside is in a better position than many in the industry.\nThe immediate problem for investors is that Woodside is losing its attraction as a yield play. The dividend payout ratio remains unchanged at 80 per cent, but the company's 40 per cent drop in first-half profit means the interim dividend has come in at US66Â¢ a share, compared with $US1.11 a year ago.\nWhile some global oil and gas companies have been willing to debt-fund dividends to keep shareholders sweet, Coleman is not going down that path.\nThis is not a shock for investors. Coleman hinted in December he would not change the dividend policy. This was partly because he had just spent $US3.75 billion ($5.1 billion) buying Apache's liquefied natural gas assets. Woodside shares rose more than 2 per cent on Wednesday, which was in line with the rest of the sector.\nThe market's obsession with yield is coming back to bite it. Australian companies have traditionally out-performed global firms in terms of dividend payout ratios, but with growth slowing at big payers like the banks and Telstra that could be about to change.\nBut Woodside's latest results confirm Coleman's reputation as a prudent and conservative manager. The company has made good progress on costs, which means its Browse floating liquefied natural gas project is still going ahead despite weak oil markets.\n Woodside's big challenge has been identifying the next phase of its growth after Pluto. It abandoned a $US2.5 billion deal to buy into the Leviathan gas field in Israel, and downgraded its Browse LNG project to a floating solution.\nWoodside now has the balance sheet advantage many of its peers do not as it looks for acquisitions. While debt markets are closing for some competitors, it will not have the same problem.\nBut the problem is finding the right assets to buy. Not many companies are generating enough free cash to do deals in a low-price environment. This means prospective sellers will not let go of high-quality assets until there is some buying tension, unless they get desperate. Coleman believes this could take another quarter or two before a significant number of assets come on to the market.\nWith oil prices coming off their mid-2014 highs, Coleman warns global markets will remain structurally over-supplied for some time. There are some signs of demand growth though.\n\"The oil market is rebalancing but it is going to take some time to rebalance completely,\" he told investors after releasing the company's half-year results.\nRare sweet spot The global airline industry should be enjoying a rare sweet spot. Years of consolidation, tighter cost controls and lower fuel prices mean airlines in the United States and Europe are in better shape than they have been for years.\nBut despite the improved conditions, shareholders have been exiting carriers such as American, SouthWest and Delta. Competition is intense and customers are demanding cheaper fares. Cathay Pacific is under pressure from the flood of new Chinese competitors.\nAirlines are hurling millions of dollars into new lounges, flat-beds, on-board food and other gimmicks to woo customers on to the front end of their planes, where they make the most money. Virgin Australia's decision to put an espresso machine on some business-class flights is the latest example.\nWhile they have called off their domestic turf war, the rivalry between Qantas and Virgin remains intense. Qantas is in a strong position, with its shares near record highs as it prepares to announce a nearly $1 billion result on Thursday. Investors also expect a share buyback. How it manages slowing consumer demand and the battle for business-class bums on seats will be key questions for chief executive Alan Joyce.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-08-19T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:21:09.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
