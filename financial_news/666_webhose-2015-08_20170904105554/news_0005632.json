He then cancelled those trades and bought the contracts at the lower prices, reaping a roughly $40 million profit on his trading, U.S. authorities said. \nHe has denied wrongdoing, telling the court in May: \"I've not done anything wrong apart from being good at my job.\" \nSarao had been granted bail on April 22 but, with his assets frozen by the U.S. authorities, he had been unable to meet the terms of 5 million pounds ($7.8 million), meaning he remained in prison for four months. \nOn Friday the court heard, however, that Sarao had funds of more than 30 million pounds, including 25.5 million held in Switzerland and 5 million in an escrow account in the United States. \nThe disclosure was enough for the U.S. authorities not to oppose the renewed bail application and as a result the judge agreed to lower the terms to 50,000 pounds, which has been paid. \nAs part of his new bail conditions, Sarao will have to abide by a nightly curfew, hand in his passport, be electronically monitored and agree not to move outside London's orbital motorway. He cannot use the Internet for trading. \nThe court also heard that the trader, who is set to face an extradition hearing in September, had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. \n($1 = 0.6393 pounds) (Reporting by Michael Holden, writing by Estelle Shirbon and Kate Holton; Editing by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Stephen Addison)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T20:08:55.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
