Getty by STEVEN KURUTZ One can imagine Hollywood gatekeepers emailing the September Esquire cover featuring Miles Teller to their clients with a warning: \"This is what happens when you run your mouth to a reporter.\"\nTeller, 28, the star of films like \"Whiplash\" and \"Fantastic Four,\" appeared to go off-script in a way celebrities rarely do during those highly negotiated restaurant sit-downs with crumb-snatching writers.\nHe compared his penis to a highball glass, boasted of all the pot he had smoked and mused about his appearance, saying, \"I was thinking about that today, how I probably think I'm better looking than the public thinks I am.\"\nIf the Esquire article did little to advance Teller's appeal with some fans, it was nevertheless part of a long, if infrequent, journalistic tradition.\nSometimes an interview with a famous person transcends its usual stage-managed blandness for something unusually revealing - and riveting. In the continuing battle between the handlers and the media to control the public image of a given star, now and then the celebrity loses.\nAnd the rarity of such occurrences is a testament to how well modern-day publicists guard access to their clients (and perhaps the lackluster job that writers and their employers do at circumventing them).\nSuch stories can take various forms. Lillian Ross' classic article on Ernest Hemingway, published in 1950 in The New Yorker, belongs to the hang-them-with-their-own-words school, in which, through a subtle accumulation of Quote: s and observations, the writer creates a damning portrait.\nThe profile of Teller, on the other hand, feels more overt. The writer, Anna Peele, comes right out and calls the actor a jerk early in the article (in stronger language).\n Although unflattering, the article may not be so bad for its subject's career. After all, was anybody talking about Teller before the profile went online last week?\nHe responded on Twitter, saying the article was \"very misrepresenting.\" (Peele was reached for comment but declined to be interviewed for this article.)\nTeller is hardly alone among famous people whose images have taken something of a hit thanks to an article that ignores the usual niceties of the celebrity profile genre. The reaction to the Esquire article brought to mind other examples from the recent and deeper past.\nCara Delevingne, Vogue, 2014 Delevingne's awkward on-camera interview recently with the hosts of \"Good Day Sacramento\" while promoting her role in the film \"Paper Towns\" wasn't the only time she appeared disengaged.\nA profile in Vogue last year by writer Plum Sykes made much of how Delevingne, a model and actress, arrived late to the interview after oversleeping. And then, after writer and subject received separate massages, Delevingne fell asleep in her massage room and kept Sykes waiting for more than a half-hour.\nAn overscheduled model falling asleep during an interview may not seem like much of a transgression. But consider the publication and the power that its editor, Anna Wintour, has over a young model's career.\nAs part of the profile, Sykes laid out how Delevingne's behavior suggested a lack of respect toward the fashion bible: \"Dear reader, to misQuote: Oscar Wilde, can I say that to oversleep once for a Vogue interview may be regarded as a misfortune, but to oversleep twice looks like carelessness?\"\nLike Teller, Delevingne said she was misrepresented after the article appeared and took to Twitter: \"All I can say is that I work extremely hard and 'sleeping' is proof that sometimes I work too hard. I apologize for being so ambitious.\"\nJohn Mayer, Playboy, 2010 This infamous interview began, prophetically, with writer Rob Tannenbaum asking the singer if it would be his last. \"No, though I have fantasies of it,\" Mayer said.\nInstead, he went on to kiss-and-tell about his relationships with famous women like Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson (\"It was like napalm, sexual napalm\" he said of the latter in a much circulated Quote: ) and to profess his fondness for pornography and masturbation.\nHe also used a racial epithet discussing his appeal with African-American audiences and said his penis was \"sort of like a white supremacist.\"\nBecause it was a long-form question-and-answer Playboy interview, Mayer's damning portrayal came not at the hands of the writer but his own foot-in-mouth.\nAfter a media firestorm, Mayer issued an apology on Twitter and addressed an audience at a concert in Nashville, reportedly saying: \"I quit the media game. I'm out. I'm done. I just want to play my guitar to whoever is around.\" He has since lifted his self-imposed media blackout.\nTiger Woods, GQ, 1997 This profile of a 21-year-old Tiger Woods by writer Charles P. Pierce shares similarities with the article about Teller: a young male celebrity, in the first flush of fame, talks unguardedly (and grandiosely) to a writer who decides not to play by the usual rules of the game.\nAfter protracted negotiations with Woods' team at International Management Group, Pierce was granted access to the golfer during a limousine ride from a photo shoot.\nIn that short span he captured a side of Woods that golf insiders (but not the public) had already observed. Woods \"told some puerile and sexist jokes,\" Pierce wrote of the exchange, and the golfer repeated racial stereotypes about African-American men, which were detailed in the article.\nWoods and his team refuted parts of the feature, and his dominance on the golf course (he won the 1997 Masters soon after the profile was published) shifted the media's focus.\nBut Woods' father, Earl Woods, expressed concern to Charlie Rose that the article would do lasting damage to his son's career. As attention-grabbing celebrity profiles tend to do, this one has cropped up over the years, both in the wake of Woods' cheating scandal in 2009 and more recently when Grantland published an annotated version.\nCourtney Love, Vanity Fair, 1992 Lynn Hirschberg's profile of Love and her husband, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, arrived at the height of grunge music's popularity and was a bombshell at the time. Love, 26 then, was Quote: d about her drug use after an appearance by Nirvana on \"Saturday Night Live\": \"Then, we got high and went to 'SNL.' After that, I did heroin for a couple of months.\" The article said that Love's heroin use had come during her pregnancy with her daughter by Cobain, Frances Bean.\nThe rock-star couple released a statement after the article was published, saying it contained \"many inaccuracies and distortions\"; as noted this year in the documentary \"Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,\" Cobain left a threatening voice mail for Hirschberg. He is also said to have written the song \"Rape Me\" as a veiled critique of the article.\nVanity Fair stood by the article. Love later said she did use heroin while pregnant.\nErnest Hemingway, The New Yorker, 1950 This profile, later published as a short book, \"Portrait of Hemingway\" (Penguin), is considered a classic takedown, although it's an odd one. In her introduction to the stand-alone book version, Ross wrote that it was meant to be \"a sympathetic piece\" that would capture Papa Hemingway's \"vitality and his enormous spirit of fun.\"\nRoss said she was so assured of this result that, in an admission that would cause heart palpitations for The New Yorker's present-day staff, she sent a galley proof of the article to Hemingway and his wife for their approval before its publication. Ross wrote that Hemingway \"found the Profile funny and good, and that he had suggested only one deletion.\"\nStill, her fly-on-the-wall description of two days Hemingway spent in New York captures a blustery macho man who talked like a stereotypical Native American in a Western movie (\"Eat good and digest good,\" he said after eating oysters).\nIt caused a sensation when it was published, baffling Ross, who suggested some readers were bringing their own biases.\nMira Sorvino, GQ, 1996 This profile of the Oscar-winning actress by writer Andrew Corsello inspired columnist Ross Douthat to write an Op-Ed article for The New York Times in 2010 expressing sympathy for Sorvino and calling the GQ article a case study \"in the power of journalists to celebrate or destroy.\"\nCorsello, who brought into the article a previous encounter he had had with Sorvino at Harvard, portrayed her as intellectually pretentious and eccentric. And her meta-commentary on the sexual politics of male-reporter, female-starlet magazine profiles exhausted him.\nAfter the article was published, followed not long after by an Esquire profile of Kevin Spacey that explored the actor's sexual orientation, Variety published a piece asking if magazine editors and writers were acting maliciously - a topic no doubt being discussed among Teller's team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:06:16.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
