We have tried to get from them their cost of production but they have not responded,\" he said. \nLocal cement producers are complaining of unlevelled playing field due to cheap imports which, they say, were distorting the market, limiting their prospects for growth in the industry currently enjoying a boom in construction. \nThey say their growth prospects looked bearish despite a growing demand for cement to feed the rapidly expanding construction sector in the country. \nAccording to the Chairman of the Tanzania Chapter of East African Cement Producers Association (EACPA), Mr Reinhardt Swart, the industry is facing contraction and possible job losses in the near future as they are forced to compete with cheap imports. \"I am not asking for protection. \nI'm not asking the government to ban imports. I am asking for the government to create a level playing field,\" he told the 'Daily News' in an interview last week. \nTanzania's building and construction sector is amongst the most rapidly growing, leading to increased consumption of cement that has attracted new investments including a 500 million US dollar factory built in Mtwara Region by Nigeria's billionaire Aliko Dangote. \nWith an annual capacity of 3 million tonnes, the Dangote cement factory is expected to double the country's annual output of cement to 6 million tonnes from the current levels of slightly above 3 million tonnes. \nThe factory which expects to start production this month, will be competing with other Tanzanian cement producers including Tanzania Portland Cement, owned by a subsidiary of Germany's Heidelberg Cement AG; Tanga Cement, majority owned by Afrisam Mauritius Investment Holdings Limited; and Mbeya Cement, owned by France's Lafarge SA.
