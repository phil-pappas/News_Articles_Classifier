Photo: Jeff Chan\nThe senior Treasury official in charge of the government's tax white paper taskforce says submissions reveal \"an overwhelming sense that there are issues with the tax system and it should change\", suggesting an options paper due by the end of 2015 might advocate for lower income and company tax rates.\n​Roger Brake, the general manager of the tax white paper taskforce, told the Financial Services Council conference that there was strong support for reducing personal income and company tax rates, for abolishing state stamp duties and for maintaining dividend imputation from the 850 submissions received on the March discussion paper.\n\"All of that is in the mix in terms of the government putting out the options paper,\" he said. \"When we look at the submissions and in our own consultations, support for lowering the company tax rate has been pretty strong, as has cutting personal income tax. The modelling shows company income tax does impose a relatively high burden on the economy, and that is certainly the case.\"\nTreasurer Joe Hockey will meet the state treasurers in Canberra on August 21 to discuss tax reform. An options paper will be released before Christmas, followed by a white paper before the next federal election so reform proposals can be taken to the electorate.\nAdvertisement In its submission to the discussion paper, released on Thursday, the Business Council of Australia called for a reduction in personal income and company tax rates, a move away from inefficient and volatile state taxes and for an increase in the rate of the GST and a broadening of its base to compensate for the lost revenue. This revenue-neutral changing of the tax mix was also central to the Financial Services Council submission, along with many others.\nLisa Gropp, chief economist at the BCA, told the conference moving away from income and indirect taxes was important given the digitisation of the economy and greater mobility of labour.\nKey challenge With the BCA calling for the corporate tax rate to be cut from 30 per cent to 25 per cent, Ms Gropp said a key challenge for reformers remained explaining proposals to the community.\n\"They think companies are arguing their own book, so we have to explain who actually pays the company tax – a lot of it is labour, through lower wages and foregoing investment. We have to explain that [lower company tax] leads to higher wages and investment activity, which creates capacity for everybody to be better off.\"\nMr Brake said the taskforce was paying close attention to international competitiveness issues.\n\"Other countries are moving in this space,\" he said. \"The UK is moving to an 18 per cent company tax rate by 2020. The rest of the world will not stand still for Australia.\"\nThere \"is a very strong view the tax system needs to be simpler, more certain in its operation, and needs to be more competitive. There are concerns about the competitiveness of our tax system internationally,\" he said.\n\"If you look internationally, we have a heavy reliance on company tax and the progressive personal income tax system, and over time there are some real challenges with technological innovation and the digital economy, increasing international competitiveness, and the ability of firms and people to relocate their activities.\"\nAs part of its national policy series The Australian Financial Review will host the Tax Reform Summit, which will be addressed by Mr Hockey , in Sydney on September 22 and 23 .", "external_links": ["http://www.informa.com.au/conferences/financial-services-conference/afr-tax-reform-summit"], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:15:14.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
