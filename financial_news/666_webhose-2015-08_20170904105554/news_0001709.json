We're interested in more M&A activity if it makes sense,\" Chief Executive Dean Connor said in an interview. \n\"We have quite a bit of capital and balance sheet flexibility.\" \nWhile this year's deals have been in North America, some analysts speculate Asia might be Sun Life’s next target. \nAsia contributed about 13 percent to Sun Life's operating earnings in the second quarter, with net income from the region more than doubling. \nIndia's move earlier this year to increase the proportion of foreign investment allowed in insurance companies could create an opening for Sun Life to expand its presence. The insurer has interest in lifting its stake in Birla Sun Life to 49 percent, from 26 percent currently, Connor said. \n“That would be of interest to us if we could find a purchase price that makes sense for both parties. It really comes down to price,” he said. “We like India, we think India has strong long-term prospects.” \nSun Life also owns 49 percent of Birla Sun Life Asset Management, the fourth largest mutual fund company in India, he said. \nConnor said the Indian insurance business is starting to turn the corner after being under pressure in recent years due to regulatory changes. \nHe added that earnings from Asia this year are on track to beat the company's target. \n“The Asia piece is growing quickly. There will come a point, I think, where our Asian business could be larger than our Canadian business.” \nThe company is seeing strong momentum in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong, Connor said. \nSun Life shares were up 4.9 percent on Thursday after the company reported a quarterly profit late on Wednesday that topped market estimates. \n($1=$1.31 Canadian)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T22:51:29.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
