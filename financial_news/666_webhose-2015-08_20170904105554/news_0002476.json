But when Croce and his wife took over the family business in 2001 they switched to organic, a shocking -- but ultimately beneficial, he believes -- change in rhythm. \n\"Our production dropped 80 percent,\" Croce remembers. \nBefore, the plantation collected 10,000 bags of coffee a year. Croce would not reveal the current output. \nIt's still below old levels, he said, but the business is sustainable, selling to about 30 countries, including France and Italy. \nNow Croce, who also set up the Bob-o-Link cooperative of some 60 small producers, wants the organic approach to expand. \n\"We want to set up a sustainability index, not just in environmental terms, but social,\" he said. \n- Best of the average - \n\"When it comes to coffee, Brazil has always been considered the best team of the second division,\" Silvio Leite, president of the Brazilian Specialty Coffee Association, which was set up in 1991. \nWith production of 45.3 million 132-pound (60 kg) bags in 2014, Brazil accounts for almost a third of world output, trailed by Vietnam and Colombia. But there's a problem: Brazilian coffee is very much at the bottom end of the market. \nLast year, only eight million bags qualified as specialty grade. However, that was up 59 percent from 2013, and specialty coffee is hot. \nIt was Brazil's association that created the Cup of Excellence contest in 1999 to promote its coffee. Today, the competition has gone international and is considered a reference. \nDemand for specialty coffee has risen worldwide by 10 to 15 percent in the last few years, compared to about two percent for regular coffee, with Europe, Japan and the United States leading the way. \nBut to date the best known producers remain Colombia and several African countries -- not the sleeping giant of Brazil. \n- A 'miracle' - \nSo what's all the fuss about? \nTechnically, specialty coffee means scoring 80 points on a 100 point scale, standing out for taste and having few or no defects. \nA good cup of coffee is \"a miracle,\" says Isabela Raposeiras, 41, who teaches about coffee and sells coffee at the Coffee Lab in Sao Paulo. \n\"There are many stages that need to be done right,\" the renowned specialist said, ticking off everything from where the bean grows to how it is dried and toasted, to how the actual cup of coffee is prepared. \nIn Brazil, the number of regions producing specialty coffee is growing -- and, whether it's in Sao Paulo or Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espiritu Santo or Parana, each coffee is influenced by the different soils, climate and altitude. \nMostly these are small-scale producers, but some are also larger players who want to break into the market. \nGradually the trend is catching on. It was only in 2014 that a regional designation certification was set up, with Cerrado Minheiro from Minas Gerais state so far the only one. \n\"There are incredible coffees in Brazil and they're increasingly in demand,\" said Susie Spindler, from the Alliance for Coffee Excellence. \nOn the patio of Fortaleza, farmer Ivan Santos, 31, showed off the dark, hand-picked beans from the recent harvest. \n\"Making quality coffee, without defects, is difficult, slow and expensive,\" he said. \"But it's a dream: we are sending our best coffee around the world and for the best prices.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Tax dodgers hide behind privacy laws: ALP AAP \nLabor senator Sam Dastyari says privacy provisions in Australia make it possible for some of the world's biggest …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T13:29:27.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
