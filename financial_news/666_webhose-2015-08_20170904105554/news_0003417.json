Last week Fed chairperson Janet Yellen said that she would act as early as September or as late as December.\nOn the plan to gradually increase the foreign portfolio investors cap on holding in government debt, Rajan said “I think it’s prudent to (long term money with higher holdings for foreign portfolio investors).\n“Also, given the state of liquidity in the market, it doesn’t cost us too much to wait. But once we get a good sense of either the fact that nothing really is going to happen on the external side for sometime or that it has happened and the consequences haven’t been significant, we will have room to act.\n“But, by and large, sooner rather than later it (higher holding limit for foreign portfolio investors) will happen,” the RBI Governor said.\nEarlier in the day, Rajan said that the RBI is in discussions with the government to raise the FPI caps, adding that the new structure will be in place before the end of September.\n“I don’t think the consultation with the government will take too long a time but we are also looking for appropriate market conditions. You don’t want to introduce this in an environment of excess liquidity and see a lot of flows come in,” he said.\nAfter discussions, RBI will formulate a framework to raise the investment limit for such investors in government debt securities, which will be pegged to the rupee against the current practise of linking it to the dollar, he said.\n“The overall goal of this medium-term framework will be to enlist FPIs in market development within prudential limits which we set even as they are attracted by the rates available in domestic bonds,” Rajan told reporters at the customary post-policy press meet.\nThe proposed framework, expected by the next month, will include a target for what fraction of the sovereign bond market will be constituted by FPIs in the medium-term.\nIt will also consist of an announcement of staggered changes in limits every six months, with limits being released on a monthly or quarterly basis on which the decision is yet to be taken, the Governor said, adding the limits will be specified in rupees so that they do not vary with exchange rate movements.\nCurrently FPIs can invest up to USD 31 billion in government bonds and an additional USD 20 billion in other debt instruments. Both these caps are almost fully exhausted and foreign investors have been calling for a higher limits.\nThe RBI has barred FIIs from investing in short-term debt to encourage long-term flows and reduce dependence on hot money. It hasn’t allowed fresh foreign investment in government bonds since raising the ceiling to USD 30 billion in 2013.\nTo check any possible turbulence after the Fed action, the RBI has been shoring up the forex reserves which currently stands at around USD 354 billion. Since March 2014 alone, the RBI had ramped up the forex reserves by USD 105.8 billion.\n 04, 2015 9:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T00:08:33.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
