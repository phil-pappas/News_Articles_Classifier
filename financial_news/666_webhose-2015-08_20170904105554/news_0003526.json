Bloomberg by Vesna Poljak It's a question that troubles every fund manager at some point in time. What to buy in an \"ageing bull market\"?\nMacquarie has described the risk-reward on offer in the Australian sharemarket as being \"not particularly attractive\" in new research by equity strategist Jason Todd.\nMr Todd does not think shares have a valuation problem. But he does think that for the index to keep advancing, \"a lot must go right for it to trade meaningfully higher and not a lot wrong for it to trade lower\". His price target is pegged at 5200 points over the next year. Shares last closed at 5382.10 points.\nThe strategist bemoaned the lack of leadership in the market, arguing there needed to be a reason to unseat defensive growth and yield stocks from their pedestal. These stocks - such as infrastructure, utilities and property trusts - have been enduringly popular in the era of low interest rates for their stable dividends.\nThe next obvious rotation according to Macquarie is into cyclical stocks and banks.\nMr Todd said: \"In the absence of a strong macro signal, the market will continue to oscillate up and down with rallies supported by optimism on policy success (rates and growth) and declines on rising pessimism due to policy disappointment, Chinese growth, deflation fears and a rising cost of capital.\"\nThe strategist advocated buying BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto because they are low beta stocks where earnings expectations have taken a dive and if anything, Chinese growth probably looks more hopeful now.\nOn the flipside, he urges selling down - or \"profit taking\" - CSL, James Hardie, Ramsay Health Care, Amcor and Telstra.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...
