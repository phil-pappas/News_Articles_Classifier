We are saying to the investors, if you come, your investment is safe, but we encourage you to partner locals,\" he added.\nThe southern African country is struggling to recover from a catastrophic recession that was marked by billion percent hyperinflation and widespread food shortages.\nForeign investors say the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act signed into law in 2008 requiring foreign-owned firms to sell at least 51% shares to locals, is the biggest obstacle to investing in the mineral-rich country.\nPresident Robert Mugabe has defended the law, saying it aims to redress colonial-era imbalances.\nAnglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum Holdings are the two largest mining companies operating in Zimbabwe and have previously expressed reservations with complying with the empowerment law.\nZimbabwe has the second largest reserves of platinum and chrome, but has lagged behind neighbours like Mozambique and Zambia in attracting foreign investment largely due to Mugabe’s economic empowerment drive and high political risk.\nOutside mining, foreign investors are interested in Zimbabwe’s manufacturing and tourism sectors and infrastructure projects like power generation, but are often discouraged by the indigenisation law and red tape.\nZimbabwe has halved this year’s growth target to 1.5% while labour unions say more than 20,000 workers have lost their jobs in the last month as firms close due to power shortages, high cost of capital and competition from cheaper imports.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:07:34.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
