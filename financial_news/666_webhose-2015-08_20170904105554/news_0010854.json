In turn, ZTE saw an increase from 3.1%. \nApple, meanwhile, rounded out the top five with a slight decline from 5.6% to 5%. \n\"I expect Samsung to continue its dominance in South Africa, purely because Samsung is one of the trusted brands and resonates with the end-user,\" Joseph Hlongwane, an IDC SA research analyst told Fin24. \nRange \nSamsung also led the tablet market, followed by Lenovo which has seen strong growth in the last year. \nApple dropped from second to third, followed by Mecer and Huawei. \nSamsung's success in SA is thanks to its large portfolio of devices, according Hlongwane. \n\"Samsung is also affordable and accessible to the large portion of the population due to its huge portfolio when compared to other brands,\" said Hlongwane. \nThe IDC revised downward its growth forecast for the global smartphone market from 11.3% to 10.4% as a slowdown in China impacts sales of smartphones. \nHowever, handsets priced in the $100 and $200 bracket saw healthy growth and Hlongwane said this trend is likely to continue. \n\"I also think that the weak economy and the shrinking disposal income, low priced brands will grow going forward as the end-user shop around for devices that are affordable and fit their budget.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T21:22:07.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
