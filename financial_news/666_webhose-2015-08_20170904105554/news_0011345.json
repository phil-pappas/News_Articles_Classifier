Illustration: David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd It is no surprise that the overarching themes to emerge from the 2015 profit reporting season dovetail nicely with the big challenges for Australian policymakers raised at this week's National Reform Summit .\nThe latest barometer of the health of the publicly listed corporate sector shows companies struggling for decent top-line growth. This is evident in the reported revenue numbers for the year just ended, the outlook statements from chief executives and the estimates of analysts.\nOver the past couple of years, the cost-cutting story has dominated the presentations made by companies. Extensive redundancy programs and job cuts are still occurring but companies are finding it difficult to squeeze out greater efficiencies.\nThe other notable theme from the profit reporting season is that dividend payments remain sacrosanct. Company boards are unwilling to move away from the heavy emphasis on return of capital toward increased capital investment.\nOut of all the trends, that is probably the most worrying, because it means the corporate sector is setting itself up for lower growth in the future.\nChanticleer picked these themes following a discussion with Citi equity strategist Tony Brennan, who bases his views on the 150 Australian companies that the Citi team of analysts cover.\nAs of Thursday morning, 115 of the 150 companies had reported. These stocks accounted for about 90 per cent of the market capitalisation in Australia.\nBoral punished over 'timing issue' Companies to have already reported had sales of $281 billion, earnings before interest and tax of $45 billion, net profits of $29.8 billion and earnings per share of $3 billion. It says a lot about the state of the corporate sector that the profit numbers were between 5.5per cent and 6.5 per cent less than the analysts' forecasts.\nContinuous disclosure laws mean that it is very rare for a company to report earnings that are out of whack with market expectations. Any company that is unlikely to meet market consensus by a meaningful amount will have reported earlier during the confession session in late July or early August.\nThe relative certainty of earnings numbers means that fund managers and analysts are far more interested in the outlook for the year ahead.\nIt is obvious from this year's profit reporting season that the biggest hits to share prices have been to the companies which disappointed in relation to the year ahead.\nConstruction materials group Boral is a good example of this. Chief executive Mike Kane was frustrated by the focus of analysts and journalists on the company's outlook, which was disappointing compared to consensus forecasts.\nHe was disappointed to find that a \"timing issue\" with the start of major construction projects in Queensland and Victoria was the focus of attention instead of the company's \"amazing\" profit report.\nBoral report its strongest EBIT result in seven years. The EBIT rose 21 per cent to $357 million as Kane showed the wisdom of slimming down the company which rode the surge in construction in NSW.\nKane provided detailed guidance on earnings for the year ahead broken down by divisions. The disappointment came from the outlook for construction materials and cement, which is tipped to have EBIT in line with 2015.\nThe company said the benefits from restructuring and improvement initiatives, together with continued strength in the Sydney construction market, will be needed to offset a depressed Queensland construction market and further tapering off of LNG major project volumes.\nPremium on top-line growth The premium placed on top-line revenue growth was shown in the latest results from Ramsay Health Care . After turning in another stunning profit result, with revenue up 49 per cent to $7.4 billion and EBIT up 37 per cent to $803 million, the company issued a less bullish forecast for 2016.\nChief executive Chris Rex said: \"Given the strong industry fundamentals and the continuing implementation of our successful growth strategy, barring unforeseen circumstances, Ramsay is targeting core net profit after tax and core earnings-per-share growth for the group of 12 per cent to 14 per cent for fiscal year 2016.\"\nRamsay shares rose 5.5 per cent with a growth forecast less than half of the year just passed while Boral's strong 2015 performance, which proved Kane's turnaround skills, was greeted with a 7.96 per cent fall in the share price.\nBrennan says any discussion of the profit reporting season must include the banks because they account for at least a quarter of the market.\nHe says the bank results this year have shown that competition is getting tougher, growth in earnings is harder to come by and the headwinds are building for earnings growth in the year ahead.\nThese observations are valid and have already contributed to a re-rating of the market value of bank stocks.\nThe performance of the banks in recent weeks was also affected by the dilutive impact of capital raisings.\nCost-cutting a temporary fix The second-biggest sector of the market is the resources sector, which is in the third year of a cost-cutting and capital efficiency drive, signalling another tough year for the mining services companies.\nIf you exclude the financials and the resources companies, you're left with the other half of the market. Brennan has done the numbers on what those companies are up to and the results are not inspiring.\nHis work shows that average revenue growth has slipped from 3 per cent in fiscal 2013 to 2.2 per cent in 2015.\nThat lack of revenue growth is what has forced CEOs to use cost-cutting as a way to push up profit margins.\nBut during this profit reporting season few companies have announced new multi-year cost-cutting programs. It appears that companies are at the point where they can no longer slash staff and still offer adequate customer service.\nThe three themes called out here from the profit reporting season directly relate back to the analysis of Australia's challenges by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens at the National Reform Summit .\n\"Growth in jobs, in incomes, in standards of living, wealth and prosperity,\" he said. \"Better allocative efficiency, if we could secure it, would doubtless add to growth. That growth is worth having.\"\nStevens said Australia needs to increase the resources available to be deployed in economic activities of various kinds; fostering conditions under which innovation and genuine risk-taking flourish.\n\"In that regard, how to minimise adverse effects on work effort, enterprise, capital accumulation and innovation, due to tax or other factors, would be a worthwhile question – accepting, as a condition, that there is an amount of revenue the government must raise to fund the provision of services only the government can supply.\n\"Minimising those adverse effects means a larger economy; more income, more revenue and so on.\n\"In parallel, there is no avoiding the need to have the right labour market arrangements. The question is how to have suitable rules that offer basic fairness, but with minimum adverse effects on enterprise, employment and the scope for free agents to come together in ways that mutually suit them – and that grow the economy. Whether we have that balance right is a question you might address.\"\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-08-27T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:06:51.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
