Price of diesel has also reduced from GH¢ 2.98 pesewas to GH¢2.89 pesewas. \nIn a random interview conducted by the GNA, the drivers said a gallon of petrol which contained about 4.50 litres, was sold at GH¢15 at Goil, with the same litres going for more than the price at other OMCs. \nThey, however, mentioned that despite the drop in fuel prices, lorry fares remained unchanged. \nKofi Ansu, a taxi driver who plies the Sunyani-Abesim road, said drivers had resolved not to reduce the fares because a downward review would affect them due to the unstable nature of the prices in fuel. \nMeanwhile, attendants at some of the filling stations within the Municipality had indicated that daily sales of the product kept decreasing, because of the unstable nature of the prices at the various selling points. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T00:52:41.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
