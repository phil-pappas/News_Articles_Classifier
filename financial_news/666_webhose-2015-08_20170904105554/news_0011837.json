SoftBank’s executives have met both Modi and Tripathy.\nIndian resources conglomerate Adani Group has all but ended a deal with U.S. company SunEdison for a solar equipment plant, only to start talks with Softbank and Foxconn for investments, sources said.\nSo far this fiscal year India has closed tenders for about 5,000 MW of solar power and is seeking bids for 5,000 MW more, Tripathy said.\nGovernment-controlled companies Solar Energy Corp of India and NTPC Ltd have issued most of the tenders, along with states such as Madhya Pradesh in central India. SkyPower, Acme Solar, Suzlon Energy and SunEdison have been among the winners.\nTripathy said though companies were keen to invest and solar power was already competing with fossil-fuel derived electricity, federal and state governments would have to make it easier for businesses to buy land.\n 31, 2015 10:05 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:48:27.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
