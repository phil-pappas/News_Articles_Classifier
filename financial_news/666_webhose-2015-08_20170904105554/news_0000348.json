A close rival of Fiat Abarth Punto EVO is the Volkswagen Polo GT TSI, which has always been considered one of the best hatches in the country, not only for performance, but also on account of its design. The popular hatch has been found to provide a great mix of performance and stability. Therefore, it is going to be fun to pit the two, Fiat Abarth Punto EVO and the Volkswagen Polo GT TSI, against each other. Here are top 5 points to mull:\n1. Fiat Abarth Punto EVO vs Volkswagen Polo GT TSI: Price\nWe do know that Fiat will make Abarth Punto EVO affordable, which means it will carry a price tag under Rs.10 lakh. If that is the case, Abarth Punto EVO would be the most affordable performance car for the enthusiasts and that is certainly going to give it the edge over Volkswagen Polo GT TSI â€“ currently priced at Rs. 8.5 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi). However, Abarth Punto may take some time to launch which can be at the end of this year. However, we also think that the vehicle is worth the wait.\n2. Fiat Abarth Punto EVO vs Volkswagen Polo GT TSI: Looks\nWhen it comes to external appearance, Abarth Punto EVO stands out and looks more flamboyant than Volkswagen Polo GT TSI without a shadow of a doubt. The contrast in the appearance of both the hatches is substantial and will appeal to different kinds of consumers. Anybody who does not want a flashy car but rather wants something subtle and easy going, then Volkswagen Polo GT TSI is the hatch for you. A non-car enthusiast would not be able to figure out the difference between a normal Volkswagen Polo and a Volkswagen Polo GT TSI in terms of aesthetics.\n3. Fiat Abarth Punto EVO vs Volkswagen Polo GT TSI: Engine\nUnder the hood, both the hatches look pretty good with Abarth Punto EVO featuring a 1.4 litre T-Jet Turbo Petrol engine that gives 145bhp power and torque in excess of 200Nm. There is no option of the automatic transmission system as the hatch gets a 5-speed manual gearbox. Volkswagen Polo GT TSI, on the other hand, is backed by a 1.2 litre TSI petrol engine that carves away 105PS power and 175Nm torque. Volkswagen Polo GT TSI uses a 7 speed automatic DSG transmission system which is something that does give it an edge over Abarth Punto EVO.\n4. Fiat Abarth Punto EVO vs Volkswagen Polo GT TSI: Standout features\nVolkswagen Polo GT TSI has a unique GT badge which is probably the only major differentiator between the two cars. Abarth Punto EVO has an extravagant dashboard with the attractive design that is very catchy and attention grabbing. The Abarth symbol on the bonnet and tailgate is another feature that really stands out and makes up for an attractive sight. Even the diamond cut alloy wheels of Abarth Punto EVO features a scorpion symbol in the centre whereas the OVRMs have red and orange shades which make the hatch even more unique and catchy. The orange and red color further carries forward to the front and rear bumpers along with the grill.\n5. Fiat Abarth Punto EVO vs Volkswagen Polo GT TSI: Performance\nYou would think that Abarth Punto EVO with all that audacity would offer a higher top speed but the difference is not that much with the hatch delivering 200kmph top speed as oppose to the 190kmph top speed of Volkswagen Polo GT TSI\n 11, 2015 11:14 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:29:03.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
