For him, after corruption, lack of power is the greatest cause of hardship in Nigeria. \n\"We thought that with the Power Reform Act and unbundling of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria, we will begin to see a relief with regard to power supply; unfortunately, it is not so,\" Mr. Akpabio said. \nFurther, the senate urged the federal government to complete the Mambilla Power Project with the aim of improving electricity supply in the country. \nIt also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Transmission Company Of Nigeria to immediately reconnect Maiduguri back to the national grid.
