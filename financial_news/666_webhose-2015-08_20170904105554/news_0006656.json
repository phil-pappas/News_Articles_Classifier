Photo: John Woudstra\nAfter emerging from a severe honey shortage, Beechworth Honey owner Jodie Goldsworthy contacted some her old customers to tell them she could supply them again.\nTheir response surprised her.\nIn the past two years, production from some Australia's biggest honey processors had plunged as much as 50 per cent after drought and bushfires wiped out up to 30 per cent of the national bee population.\nMany industries that use honey imported product to meet the shortfall. But Ms Goldsworthy wasn't one of them. She sacrificed earnings to maintain the integrity of her product.\nThe European Parliament found honey was among the top 10 products at risk of food fraud.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [ACCC] has fined several companies for importing products into Australia that claimed to be 100 per cent bee honey, when they were mainly made from plant sugars in Turkey.\nFor this reason, Ms Goldsworthy said she didn't trust imported honey, which she said could harm people's health because rogue operators didn't declare all ingredients on the label.\nACCC chairman Rod Sims is also concerned about the health risks.\n\"You just don't know what people are allergic to,\" Mr Sims said.\n\"The honey [cases] we had wasn't bee honey; it was honey made from starch of some sort, or plants.\n\"That might be a long bow, but it's consistent with a concern that there could be a range of effects under the health heading.\"\nDespite the warning, Ms Goldsworthy said some commercial users, who had relied on imported product during the honey shortage, were refusing to switch back to Australian product.\n\"When I speak to major food companies, we have been unable to be competitive. Basically they have said to us, 'We can get imported honey, not for 5 per cent less, but heaps, heaps less than we can get Australian honey for, therefore we are going to run with that'.\"\nMs Goldsworthy said labour costs in Australia added to local product being more expensive than imported goods.\n\"But there is also a regulatory cost. We produce honey here under First World food safety systems and there are costs associated with that. We are competing with countries that don't have food safety systems, so they don't have those costs.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/embeds/273692319/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true"], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:09:58.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
