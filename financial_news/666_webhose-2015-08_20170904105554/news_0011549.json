ChargeItPro provides one-step payment processing for U.S. and Canadian-based merchants. \nPhilip Telesco, president of ChargeItPro, says, “This partnership will make it easier for retailers using Genesis’ inventory and accounting system to accept card-based payments.” \nIn this case, ChargeItPro functions as an add-on to Genesis’ software. Telesco says “After scanning in the merchandise at the point of sale, if a customer wants to pay by credit or debit, all the merchant has to do is swipe the card and it will automatically send the necessary information for payment processing.” \nThe two companies hope this will assist merchants by eliminating errors, saving time, and providing increased security. Added security includes the addition of EMV technology, which stands for Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, the three companies that created it. \nEMV, which is used in smart cards, chip-and-PIN, chip-and-signature or chip-and-choice, is a technology designed to help combat fraud and protect confidential cardholder data. These cards contain a microprocessor chip which stores and protects cardholder data, providing additional authenticity. The difference between an EMV transaction and a conventional credit card transaction is that, rather than swiping a credit card, the customer inserts a chip card into the designated terminal. \nEffective Oct. 1, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover will institute a liability shift for all merchants. With this liability shift, if an EMV card is presented and a merchant hasn’t adopted a certified EMV card terminal, liability for counterfeit fraud may shift to the acquirer, who could pass this fee back to the merchant. Telesco says “While EMV technology isn’t required by any card brand, the main motivation for merchants to adopt it is to do their part to reduce card holder fraud.” \nOf the EMV security, Telesco says, “Current and prospective Genesis users can move their payment processing to ChargeItPro at any time. We are ready today with a suite of EMV-capable units.” \nGenesis Software Systems President Crystal Migliore says of the partnership, “Prior to this, we couldn’t offer our clients integrated payment processing. Now we can. It’s going to make it a lot easier to process card payments. Faster easier, less likely to make mistakes.” \nShe adds, “It took us awhile to decide on how to complete this process. Because many of our clients are family owned furniture stores, it was important to us to choose the most cost effective option for them.” \nGenesis Software Systems is located at 13916 E 3rd in Spokane Valley. Since the company’s founding in 1996, over 700 furniture stores across North America and Europe have installed Genesis software, according to the company’s website.
