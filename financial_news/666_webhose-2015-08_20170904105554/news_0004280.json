The median salary for a so-called ethical hacker is more than $70,000, according to the compensation website PayScale.com — a figure recruiters say computer science graduates can earn off the bat. Salaries can run as high as nearly $125,000 for security engineers, and past $200,000 for chief information security officers.\nAnother reason: The agency may attract 5,000 candidates to a recruitment event, but only about 2,000 end up meeting eligibility requirements, a human resources official told the inspector general’s office. Only about two of the eligible candidates were actually hired. Here’s why: The FBI wants U.S. citizens who haven’t used marijuana in the last three years, or any other illegal drug in the last 10 years, and even subjects applicants to polygraph tests. Tack on the fact that a computer scientist can find a higher salary in the private sector, and that whittles down the pool even further.\nRead: Hackers wanted — the ethical ones\nCompetition to attract recruits is fierce. Jobs for information security analysts are expected to grow 37% from 2012 to 2022, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects, as companies bolster defenses to avoid becoming the next headline.\nTo lure more cybersecurity pros, the agency puts people through a two-year information technology Master’s program at Carnegie Mellon University, in exchange for a three-year commitment to investigate cyber intrusion threats at the FBI. The FBI plans to start up a similar program with New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering. The inspector general’s report is focused on the “Next Generation Cyber Initiative,” a program that supports FBI efforts to predict and prevent hacks against the U.S. by recruiting, among other responsibilities.\nThe FBI is considering implementing a private-sector internship program, through which its cybersecurity officials could leave the agency and work elsewhere for a period of time, Richard Jacobs, assistant special agency in charge of the cyber branch at the FBI’s New York office, told MarketWatch. That stint would offer employees new experiences — potentially helping with retention — and give the agency private-sector perspective after their return, Jacobs says.\n“Keeping them for the long-term is a challenge,” he says. “These folks are very marketable.”\n : What Mariah Carey gets for a $10,000-a-night Airbnb rental 10 surprising myths about gas mileage This is the foolproof way to lower your cable bill", "external_links": ["https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2015/a1529.pdf", "http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Certified_Ethical_Hacker_(CEH)/Salary"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T03:16:38.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
