By Alan Tovey | Telegraph – 9 hours ago 15.50 -0.51 \nA skills shortage in constrcution is contributing to the housing shortage and contributing to Britain's rising property prices \nAsk anyone trying to get on the housing ladder and they’ll tell you Britain is in a housing crisis for many, home ownership has become an unaffordable dream. Too few homes; many ridiculously overpriced, or in the wrong place, and of poor quality. To compound the problem, not enough new houses are being built. \nThe building industry has long been aware of the crisis. The Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) forecasts that an extra 224,000 builders and other workers will be needed over the next five years as the construction sector rebounds after being rocked to its foundations by the financial crisis. \nBack then, house prices fell and work dried up as companies reined in investment, fearful of what the future might hold in an uncertain economic environment. In the wake of the crash, almost 300,000 people fled the industry, with many of them packing up their trowels and hard hats for good, and finding work in new fields. \nBut having been kick-started back to growth by the Government’s Help to Buy programme, commitments to large infrastructure projects and efforts to free up land for building, CITB forecasts construction is set to grow by 2.9pc year-on-year to 2019. Driven by population growth and more people living alone, 240,000 new homes are needed each year in the UK. \nWith such demand, it would appear that construction is in rude health, but the truth is that the industry is suffering terrible growing pains. \nOnly 140,000 new homes were started in the last 12 months, 100,000 short of the requirement. The Federation of Master Builders (FMB) reported last week that two out of three small builders have to turn down work because they can’t get staff with the skills they need . Bricklayers are most in demand, followed by carpenters, then plasterers and general construction operatives labourers to the layman. \nWages are being driven up by the dearth of skilled staff, although there are some signs that new blood is beginning to come into the industry to replace those who left. \nOne of those is Adam Harris, a former corporal in the RAF. The 30-year-old spent 11 years in the forces before retraining as a bricklayer. \n“The skills shortage is driving up the price, which is an exciting prospect for me,” he said. “I’ve heard rumours of people earning upwards of £1,000 a week.” \nHe’s one of the exceptions to the rule. The CITB says that it has to work hard to promote construction as a long-term career that offers both stability and a good living. Stephen Radley, the board’s director of policy, admits the industry which is fragmented has “not been good at communicating that in the past”. \n“As the recession hit, lots of people in construction lost their jobs and it’s been hard to shift that mindset,” he said. “Some people don’t see it as a long-term job.” \nWith 25 years in the industry Charlie Welsby, a site manager with family-owned builder Seddon, has seen building at its best and worst. \n“The skills shortage means that building is becoming quite lucrative,” he said. “But after the financial crisis I saw people being made redundant, something unheard of in the trade.” \nMr Welsby says his employer continued to invest in training staff through the bad times, meaning it has a ready stock of employees. But rapid growth means that at times Seddon still finds itself “ferreting around for builders” in in-demand trades, and they come at a higher price. \nWith so many experienced or “middle skilled” builders, according to Mr Welsby having packed up for good, those who remain can pick where they work. \nIt’s filling this gap that’s causing the industry trouble. Building a wall in your back garden or some DIY carpentry might seem easy, but doing it to a standard required in the industry and at speed takes time to learn. Combine this with a dismissive general attitude from the public as to the attractions of a career in building and it’s easy to see why labour costs are rising. \nThe Local Government association was even more stark in its assessment of the situation. “For too long we’ve trained too many hairdressers and not enough bricklayers,” said Peter Box, chairman of the body’s housing board. Speaking last week he said the skills shortage in construction threatens Government’s pledge to build 275,000 affordable homes by 2020. \nPerhaps the clearest signal of how desperate the situation is came last winter. Normally a quieter time in the industry, it was reported that companies were hiring Portuguese bricklayers on £1,000 a week because they could not source staff in the UK. \nRecently some of Britain’s biggest housebuilders have expressed concerns over the skills shortage. \nPete Redfern, the boss of Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) , called labour a “challenge” that is putting “pressure” on costs, which he estimated will rise by about 5pc over the year. \nBovis Homes (LSE: BVS.L - news ) said it had seen the rates its subcontracted builders charge accelerate faster than house prices, something it expects to contribute to a 7pc rise in annual build costs. \nPersimmon (Other OTC: PSMMF - news ) boss Jeff Fairburn was more forthright. “With the levels of growth that we are doing in the industry there’s going to be a squeeze in terms of resources,” he said. “That’s particularly noticeable in terms of tradesmen bricklayers particularly.” \nIt’s not just housebuilders that are being affected. Construction and outsourcing company Interserve (LSE: IRV.L - news ) , which builds the infrastructure needed to support new homes as well as commercial projects, is also being hit. \n“We’ve seen demand for construction projects increase over the last year or two but it has been outstripped by the demand for qualified and skilled employees,” said Ian Renhard, Interserve’s construction director. “This is particularly acute in London and the South East… reflecting the fact that contractors and subcontractors are being more selective and pushing costs up as they control demand.” \nPeople with the skills most in demand such as bricklayers are reaping the rewards of this, with Mr Renhard saying a brickie in the Midlands “can command £400 a day” and “far higher in London”. \nBut while the major players say they are able to deal with the shortages for now it’s the smaller builders who are most affected, as evidenced by the FMB’s findings. \nOne feeling the pinch is Tony Passmore, whose Leeds-based home improvement business Passmore will “do anything to your house apart from build you another”. He says he’s having to pay skilled tradesmen up to 25pc more than during the recession. \n“The number of people wanting work doing will probably outstrip the number of people who can do it,” says Mr Passmore. “Recently we had three or four house extensions wanted within a time scale that we couldn’t deliver. They wanted it done before the winter but we didn’t have enough internal staff capacity and we didn’t have enough subcontractors. We either turn the work down or we compromise the quality by getting lower quality tradesmen that wasn’t an option.” \nSome industry insiders say that complaints about skills shortages are a smokescreen from builders and that it’s in their interest to blame external factors for not turning out more homes and keeping prices high. \n“Planning permission used to be blamed but that’s easing now. This is just a new reason,” said one. \nWith a 75pc increase in the planning permissions being granted over the past three years , thanks to the National Planning Policy Framework, this argument seems to have some weight, but Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation (HBF) dismisses it. \n“This challenge is a short-term one brought about by the [recent] sharp increase in house-building; in the long-run it is unlikely to affect home buyers,” he said. “Activity continues to increase but the level of the acceleration is determined, in part, by the availability of skills.” \nBut there’s been a structural change in the industry since the recession that needs to be addressed to get Britain building. Before the crash smaller house builders those completing 500 or fewer properties a year were much more strongly represented, with some estimates putting them at about 80pc of the market. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , fewer than 10 large building companies are responsible for more than half of all new houses built each year. \nAmong the smaller companies the situation is getting tougher. According to Mr Passmore, whose business employs about 50 staff, until there’s a change in the way the construction industry is seen by people looking for a career, the sector is going to continue to face skills shortages. \n“There’s not enough apprentices coming through, it’s as simple as that,” he said. “We are 7,500 short year after year so before long the construction industry will grind to a halt.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T03:49:43.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
