Glen Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The Palasczuk government extended the funding for the Mackay Conservation Group, after it launched a legal bid to block approval for Adani's $16.5 billion Carmichael mine.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Environment confirmed the group received another $50,000 grant in the July budget, five months after undertaking legal action against Adani in the Federal Court.\nFunding had also been approved for another two years, to take total funding to $150,000 over the next three years. The conditions of the new contract are still to be negotiated.\nLast week the Mackay Conservation Group won the court case with Adani's environmental approval set aside while federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt re-assesses the project.\nThe Newman government allocated $150,000 to the Mackay Conservation Group, via the Queensland Conservation Council, during its three years in power.\nFormer LNP environment minister Andrew Powell said the Newman government had cut funding to campaign-based groups such as the Environmental Defenders Office and the Wilderness Society when in office.\nHe said the funding to regional environment groups, such as the Mackay Conservation Group, was conditional on being used for project work and could not be used for litigation.\n\"It was made very clear the funding had to be project based and not a skerrick could go towards court action. They were put on notice if it was breached the funding would cease,\" Mr Powell said.\n Mr Powell said the LNP government was moving to tighten funding for green groups even further before it lost the January state election.\nHe said it was a disturbing precedent when long-standing environmental groups were becoming activist groups and questioned whether they should receive ongoing government funding.\nCore business definition needed \"I think these groups need to decide what their core business is. If it's local, conservation-based efforts that inspire future generations to care about the environment, then that's fine,\" he said.\n\"If their intent is to run campaigns designed to frustrate genuine economic growth that meets high environmental standards I think they need to question to continue to receive government funding.\"\nThe spokesperson for the Environment Department said the conditions of the new contract from 2015-2018 were yet to be finalised.\nFederal Liberal MP George Christensen, whose seat is based around Mackay, said the Palaszczuk government should cut off funding to the Mackay Conservation Group because they were trying to \"kill\" 50,000 jobs.\nMackay Conservation Group co-ordinator Ellen Roberts said the litigation against Adani was funded by donations organised by Get-Up!\nA federal parliamentary committee is also looking into whether environmental groups should lose their tax-deductibility status or face tighter scrutiny.\nIt comes as GVK/Hancock Coal, who is also trying to build a new mine in the Galilee Basin, said environmental activists were threatening investment in Australia.\n\"We currently have a situation int he Galilee Basin where literally a handful of anti-mining activists from outside the area are using the courts to delay thousands of jobs for Queensland,\" a GVK spokesman said.\n\"This is despite investments of tens of millions of dollars on environmental assessments to achieve the required environmental approvals from the relevant departments.\"\nThe spokesman said blocking the Galilee Basin projects would not stop carbon emissions because investors would move to another country.\n\"If we don't develop the Galilee Basin, all that will happen is some other country will develop their equivalent resource to meet projected future global demand and gain the thousands of jobs and billions in taxes and royalties,\" the spokesman said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-08-10T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:09:05.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
