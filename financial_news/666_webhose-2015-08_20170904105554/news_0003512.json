But the yuan didn’t budge.\nIndeed, the Chinese currency, also known as the renminbi, has been remarkably steady over the past month despite the huge selloff in China’s stock market and a spate of disappointing economic data.\nMarket strategists, including Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, and Marc Chandler, head currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said that’s because China’s policy makers have effectively re-pegged the yuan.\n“When I look at the dollar-renminbi right now, that looks like a fixed exchange rate again. They’ve re-pegged it,” Chandler said.\nChinese policy makers have repeatedly shown they prefer stable exchange rates during crises. But exerting such tight control over the currency would seemingly hurt its chances of being included in the composition of the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights. The SDR is a reserve asset created by the IMF to help central banks smooth over certain liquidity issues. Inclusion would be an important milestone on the yuan’s journey to becoming a genuine reserve currency.\nIMF policy makers have not yet decided on whether to admit the yuan, but earlier this year Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, said it was a question of when — not if — the currency would be added. The IMF re-evaluates the composition and weighting of the SDR basket every five years. The current basket expires on Jan. 1.\nGermany and the U.S. have publicly announced their support for the yuan joining the SDR, but with the caveat that China must continue to liberalize trading in the yuan.\nIn a report published last week, staffers at the IMF proposed a compromise: If the IMF does decided to admit the yuan to the SDR, it should delay adopting the new basket until September 2016.\nThe goal of the extension, according to the report, would be to prevent any market disruptions as central banks adjust their reserves to reflect the new SDR basket.\nBut it would also have another advantage: allowing China more time to loosen its grip on the yuan.\n“I suspect then what this means is China will commit to further liberalization measures between now and September 2016,” Chandler said.\nThe yuan CNYUSD, +0.0048% recently traded at 6.2 to the dollar, little changed from its value late Friday in New York.\nEvery trading day, the People’s Bank of China sets a fixed rate for the yuan-dollar pair. Then it allows the yuan to trade up to 2% in either direction against the dollar.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:53:43.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
