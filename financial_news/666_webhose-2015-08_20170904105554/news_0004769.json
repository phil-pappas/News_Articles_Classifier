Now, you could say that they'll look through that, but you could say they could look through the present weakness now to a greater extent, if they wanted to.\" \nIn its latest economic outlook, the BoE stressed that a recent strengthening in the pound and a renewed fall in oil prices would push down inflation until at least the middle of next year and said the impact of the rise in sterling could persist even longer. \nSterling hit a 7-1/2 year high earlier this month and is up almost 7 percent this year on a trade-weighted basis. \nForbes said she would keep an eye on the pass-through from sterling and on core inflation, which strips out volatile energy prices, when assessing the next rate move. \n(The story corrects date of UK inflation data to Tuesday from Wednesday) \n(Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:31:32.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
