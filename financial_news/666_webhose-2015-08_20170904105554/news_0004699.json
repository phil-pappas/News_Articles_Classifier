Last week the Communication Workers of America announced that 86 percent of Verizon workers covered by the contract voted to strike in a recent poll, if a new agreement isn't reached. \nThe contract covers employees in nine states from Massachusetts to Virginia who work for Verizon's wireline business, which provides fixed-line phone services and FiOS Internet service. \nThe unions say the telecom giant is demanding that workers sharply increase their health care contributions and make concession on pensions. \nVerizon said in a statement Friday it is \"preparing for all scenarios\" ahead of the contract's expiration. The company said it has seen little progress toward a new agreement after seven weeks of negotiations and called the union's proposals \"unrealistic and out-of-touch in today's marketplace.\" \nThe contract also affects wireline workers in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington, D.C. \nAbout 45,000 Verizon workers went on strike in August 2011 for about two weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T17:31:40.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
