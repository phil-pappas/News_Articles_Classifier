This will enable information to flow impeccably with limited manual interventions thus clearing goods quickly, increasing efficiency and reducing transit costs. \nIndustry experts point out that e-commerce is the next frontier in global expansion. The key challenges to applying ICT in trade are not technical, but infrastructural and institutional. Enabling ICT infrastructure, regulatory frameworks and evolving consumer preferences have become a necessity. In major developed countries, domestic and cross-border retail is expanding through online channels as retailers invest less in traditional brick taking advantage of technology. Such multichannel approaches are a novelty to most African markets where the regulatory and ICT framework for e-commerce is still in its infancy. \nProgress is hampered by a lack of consumer trust, poor ICT expansion and limited inventory which are critical elements for e-commerce retail. Some African countries such as Nigeria and Kenya have begun taking steps in line with these initiatives. The use of e-commerce by firms also enhanced efficiency and competitiveness. Similar to the impact of removing tariffs and quantitative restrictions, trade facilitation through ICT can promote trade by reducing transport and transit costs. \nICT cannot transform trade performance on its own. It depends on the quality of data input into single-window processes, the compliance of trading businesses and the modernization of administrative systems. Further, the value of ICT in trade facilitation can only be realized if it is integrated with broader cross-cutting reforms by governments and development partners. \nICT is an influential complement to the traditional trade facilitation measures that deal with infrastructural and non-tariff barriers to trade. Thus, countries and regional trade agreements (RTAs) around the world focus more on harmonizing and integrating trade and transport. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe have set up road funds and road development agencies to maintain regional and national road networks. \nNevertheless Africa lags behind in deploying ICT infrastructure, particularly broadband. More investment is needed in regional communications networks to allow all trade posts to be integrated into single windows and ensure the continuity of data transmission.
