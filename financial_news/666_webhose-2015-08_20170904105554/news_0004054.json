AFR Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett So where's the apology? All those years of having to put up with annual performance reviews and suddenly, it seems, managements around the world are belatedly having HR epiphanies.\nPerformance reviews are a waste of time and money, they suggest. You don't say. They are usually counterproductive in terms of improving employee performance. Oh, really? They are ill suited to today's fast-paced world of instant feedback. How convenient.\nActually, these annual reviews never passed the common sense test, quick or slow. Yet how is it that recognition of reality escaped everyone's official notice for decades? Even the media, supposedly focused on exposing management error, became enveloped in the same miasma.\nMany years ago, I was sternly warned by one manager I didn't seem to be taking the whole process seriously enough. Now admittedly, that was true. My annual answers to questions such as what I aspired to achieve in the next five years tended not to fit neatly into the appropriate HR mould. \"Doing more of same, hopefully better.\"\nIn terms of how management should judge my skills, I frequently suggested reading the paper. That option, apparently, hadn't occurred to those drawing up annual reviews for reporters.\nAs to what would motivate me more, I came up with a standard response: \"More money.\" That last answer really was a joke. Media organisations at that stage weren't facing today's financial perils. But we were still regularly reminded our annual performance reviews were formally separated from any prospect of pay increases. Don't ask my why.\nThe ludicrousness of a circular process became even more frustrating when the reviews went online. It meant questions and answers could become far more complex, featuring elaborate ratings systems as well as all of the trappings of bureaucratese.\nThis required hapless employees and managers to get training (more HR operatives and IT support) before they were able to complete them. If people didn't tick the right box, literally, the computer screen would resolutely reject their efforts until weaker-minded members of staff (I plead guilty) lay weeping in frustration over their keyboards.\n Fittingly, the titles of these Alice in Wonderland efforts became even more absurd. Achieve! Aim! Succeed!\nI was always confident most of this would never be read anyway – other than to assemble yet more incomprehensible lists of interest only to yet more HR managers. Or perhaps fodder for equally meaningless KPIs for managers.\nKPIs by the way used to be known by the name of MBOs – or management by objective as part of the early trend towards adopting versions of managerialism that started way back in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nManagement by process Not that the more effective managers liked having to do the reviews either.\nSurely any decent manager gives constant guidance and makes regular informal assessments of those they were supposed to be managing. Why wait a year? And bad ones wouldn't be capable of using the reviews for much more than blaming others or ticking off the criteria.\nThis deteriorated into management by process rather than management by results. Nor were managers immune to being force-fed reviews themselves. One manager is still laughing about being told to measure performance against agreed pairs of words separated by dots. Now … Better. Future …Together. Another tells me his career never quite recovered from that absurd psychometric testing fashionable for a while where senior people were asked to compare themselves to animals. Hint – a mullet wasn't the right answer.\nYet performance reviews seemed to become an intractable part of a jargon-ridden corporate culture cloaked in language divorced from any concept of comprehensible English.\nWhat did seem to be a constant in all of this was the presence of management consultants. This naturally increased my instinctive scepticism about the ever-expanding influence of management consultants in corporate life. After all, their natural operating method is to encourage executives to rent out (at high rates) responsibility for managing their businesses. The growth in performance reviews was thus a perfect match for the growth industry of management consultancy. Consultants could recommend an approach often developed in their own businesses, then have it absorbed into the paying host cultures.\nBut fads, even when they endure for decades, can abruptly become unfashionable. And, as usual, no one wants to be left behind in following the latest corporate trend. Some companies were already starting to break out of the annual performance straight jacket as it became ever more stifling. And when some big management consulting groups decided the gig was up, many clients were also immediately ready to sign on – or out. Confessions that just maybe they made a mistake with annual reviews have become like a corporate AA meeting.\nSo informal chats and regular feedback have become the new management black. Or rather, the old black dress tarted up as new. The switch of outfit is particularly useful when companies have so much red showing up on their balance sheets and are desperate to demonstrate how they are cutting their cloth and their costs. They are justifying the switch because it turns out complicated performance reviews created a lot of extra expense. Gee.\nThe catch is many senior executives have become trapped in the same web. Their annual bonuses are linked to their own annual performance reviews.\nBut, apologies, I have no more time to discuss this because my own performance review is scheduled for this week despite company suggestions this process is itself under review. So I need to fill out the online form, including rating myself from one (outstanding) to five (not performing) in sections such as Working Together, Transparency, Innovation, Customer Centricity and Commercial Focus as part of the \"Key Behavioural Categories for Employees\".
