Michele Mossop Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Geoff Winestock The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption will regain much of the power it lost as a result of a recent High Court decision, opening the way for it to release potentially damning reports into Liberal campaign funding, which it investigated last year.\nNSW Premier Mike Baird said on Tuesday he would implement all the recommendations of an expert panel under former chief justice Murray Gleeson and Bruce McClintock, SC.\nThe report released at the same time looked at how to respond to a High Court decision in April that stopped ICAC investigating Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen for allegations relating to a driving incident and drastically narrowed the scope of ICAC's powers.\nMr Baird's decision should mean that ICAC can release the reports of the inquiries code-named operations Spicer and Credo, which looked at alleged illegal campaign funding from property developers.\nFormer premier Barry O'Farrell quit over ICAC allegations. sasha@sashawoolley.com Reports on hold The reports mostly affected the Liberal Party but also covered allegations that a company called Australian Water Holdings with links to corrupt MP Eddie Obeid defrauded state-owned Sydney Water. The reports were put on hold pending the High Court decision.\n\"I have said many times that we have zero tolerance for corruption in NSW, which means a robust ICAC,\" Mr Baird said.\n\"That is why we are today taking significant measures to consolidate ICAC's jurisdiction.\"\n The High Court in April said that ICAC could only investigate cases that involved \"improbity\" by a public official and that did not cover the allegation that Ms Cunneen had coached her son's girlfriend on how to pass a breathalyser test.\nBut the expert panel has recommended that ICAC be given back the power to investigate many cases even where there is no \"improbity\" by a public official.\nThese include cases of collusive tendering, fraud in relation to coal and other licences, defrauding the state of revenue or fraudulently getting a government job.\nMr Baird will also give the Electoral Commission the power to ask ICAC to investigate serious breaches of political funding laws and the new law will stipulate that the Spicer and Credo inquiries will be taken to have been referred to ICAC under this clause.\nNew limit of 'serious corrupt conduct' The legislation when tabled will, however, include one significant new restriction, which is that ICAC can only investigate cases of \"serious corrupt conduct\".\nThis is a loss for ICAC, which had sought the power to investigate all actions that adversely affect public officials' exercising their duties.\nIt is not clear whether the test of \"serious corrupt conduct\" will prevent ICAC looking again at the allegations that Crown prosecutor Cunneen had coached her son's girlfriend to avoid a drug-alcohol test after a road incident.\nMs Cunneen has always denied the allegations and the NSW Solicitor-General last month said he would not take any action against Ms Cunneen based on evidence supplied by ICAC.\nThe Spicer and Credo reports will be crucial for the reputations of a host of current and former politicians.\nHopes for reputations Senator Arthur Sinodinos, who was forced to step down as assistant treasurer after his association to AWH became public, will hope to have his name cleared.\nSo will Barry O'Farrell, who resigned as premier after he misled ICAC about a gift of a $3000 bottle of wine from AWH.\nWhile Mr Baird is likely to receive support for passing the amended legislation from the opposition through the upper house, two High Court decisions could still cause ICAC problems.\nFormer Newcastle mayor Jeff McCloy, who described himself at the Credo inquiry as a \"walking ATM\" for the Liberal Party, wants the High Court to overturn a NSW ban on political donations by property developers, which was the basis for large parts of the ICAC's inquiries last year.\nCoal baron Travers Duncan has also mounted a High Court challenge against findings of corruption against him in deals related to Eddie Obeid's coal licence.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/GeoffWinestock", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108137886892627412852"], "published": "2015-08-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:05:34.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
