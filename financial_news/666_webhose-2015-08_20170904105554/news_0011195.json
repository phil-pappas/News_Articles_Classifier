Analysts in general are recommending investors take advantage of the correction to purchase good stocks that have been oversold. \nIn the travel and leisure industry, several stocks are worth considering, according to MKM Partners . \n\"We recommend four ideas that have sold off with the market on macro concerns but whose fundamentals should be much less impacted by the economic environment,\" MKM Partners' Managing Director Christopher Agnew wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"Common themes include: U.S. focus, lower-cyclicality/recurring revenue streams, good dividend yields and attractive relative valuations.\" More Headlines RBC's 25 'Darling' Stocks to Buy After Market Pullback \n\"MYCC is a stock for all seasons with high-recurring revenue streams, high member retention and attractive growth outlook,\" the note said. \"IHG and WYN each have, in our view, underappreciated less-cyclical franchising businesses, improving ROIC and attractive valuations. Finally, STAY is an attractive self-help story (narrowing the ADR gap with peers) with new leadership and a valuation that is attractive relative to peers.\" \nHere's MKM Partners' list of top travel and leisure stocks picks, paired with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. When you're done be sure to check out Deutsche Bank's transportation stocks to buy now. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nMarket Cap: $1.4 billion YTD Return: 18.5% \nClubCorp Holdings, Inc., a membership-based leisure company, owns and operates golf, country, business, sports, and alumni clubs in North America. It operates in two segments, Golf and Country Clubs; and Business, Sports, and Alumni Clubs. \nMKM Partners: Buy; $30 PT MKM Partners Said: We believe MYCC should perform well in any economic environment and we reiterate our Buy rating for several reasons: (1) recurring revenues from member dues (high member retention even through recessions), (2) a unique M&A growth opportunity (MYCC is the clear leader, in our opinion, and only strategic buyer in a very fragmented industry), and (3) high ROI growth by reinventing clubs (the company targets 10%-15% cash-on-cash returns). Our $30 PT is based on ~10.4x our FY17E EBITDA of $280mn, which is supported by our DCF analysis and strong FCF yield of ~9.5% and ~2.4% dividend yield. \nTheStreet Rating: Sell, D- TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates CLUBCORP HOLDINGS INC as a Sell with a ratings score of D-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate CLUBCORP HOLDINGS INC (MYCC) a SELL. This is driven by a few notable weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its generally high debt management risk and poor profit margins.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The debt-to-equity ratio is very high at 5.23 and currently higher than the industry average, implying increased risk associated with the management of debt levels within the company. Along with this, the company manages to maintain a quick ratio of 0.41, which clearly demonstrates the inability to cover short-term cash needs. The gross profit margin for CLUBCORP HOLDINGS INC is currently lower than what is desirable, coming in at 26.18%. It has decreased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of -0.07% is significantly below that of the industry average. This stock has increased by 27.38% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Looking ahead, however, we cannot assume that the stock's past performance is going to drive future results. Quite to the contrary, its sharp appreciation over the last year is one of the factors that should prompt investors to seek better opportunities elsewhere. Net operating cash flow has remained constant at $21.51 million with no significant change when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, CLUBCORP HOLDINGS INC has modestly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -7.85%. The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry and the overall market on the basis of return on equity, CLUBCORP HOLDINGS INC has underperformed in comparison with the industry average, but has exceeded that of the S&P 500.
