Peter Braig by Kevin Chinnery We are perched on stools at the end of a huge kitchen bench. The cooks are clattering busily in the background. Rows of vegies and salad are growing away in the sunshine in the big garden plot outside.\nIt is as close to a rustic idyll as you might find in an inner suburban restaurant, and Rick Stein is just telling me about the worst thing he has ever eaten.\nSurströmming.\n\"It's a kind of fermented herring from northern Sweden, with just a touch of salt put on it to stop it from rotting completely,\" he says.\nStein had taken a tin of it back to his famed Seafood Restaurant in Padstow on the Cornish coast. Perhaps it goes nicely with aquavit, the ice cold and fiery schnapps, but he wisely took it outside to open. The mind-blowing stench would have closed the place for a week.\nNo such trouble here. I am with the tireless travelling British cook at Chiswick restaurant in Sydney's posh Woollahra. Stein has a dinner tonight so we will share four starters, plenty of flavours while pacing the appetite: cured trout, tuna tartare, scallops, and a terrine-style dish of quail.\nPilchards in the '90s My first television memory of Stein was in the mid-1990s; he was barbecuing pilchards simply over a driftwood fire on the beach, and explaining in his earnest way why this was cooking heaven.\n Since then, food culture and TV cookery has exploded into a billion-dollar industry. Stein has now fronted over 30 TV series and programmes filmed around the world and written over 20 books, from his first cookbook, in 1988, English Seafood Cookery to a memoir Under A Mackerel Sky .\nChefs are rock stars, their faces on the gourmet packaged meals now found in any local supermarket. Amateur cooks slug it out in gladiatorial TV contests, and restaurant reality shows feed the fantasy of running your own place.\n\"It's a long way from pilchards on the beach,\" I say.\n\"Well, that motif of cooking on the beach is very much alive and well with me,\" Stein replies. \"A lot of viewers would think the same thing – it's a sort of simplicity, a belief in basics. But yes – food has come on so much since we filmed that in 1995.\"\nHe believes he's been fortunate enough to grow up with a couple of generations that completely changed their ideas about both eating and life.\nDour times When he opened that first restaurant in Cornwall in 1975 - there are now ten in various regional locations - the trade was doughty British holidaymakers, and the few food writers around would not come so far from London. They were dour times of industrial confrontation and economic decline.\n\"The UK wasn't a prosperous country then. It was relatively poor and inward-looking. Not many people knew much about food. Then Britain changed from being a place of trouble and strife to a place where confidence flowed in, and people had more money and started looking at the pleasurable side of life.\n\"People have become far more knowledgeable about food in the last 40 years. I was just part of this whole movement of enthusiasm for food ... finding a whole culture of it.\"\nElvis played his part too. Cooking was Stein's own rock'n'roll rebellion: \"A lot of Baby Boomers like me, going to a good school, going to university reading something like English or law, had decided to do something totally different.\"\nStein's father had wanted him to join oil giant BP, but the world was changing. \"There was before rock'n'roll – and there was after,\" he grins. \"Once you heard Elvis Presley there was no going back\".\nTraditional graduates were ignoring teaching or the law to go off and cook or make bread. That was were he was going.\n\"You are not one of these TV alpha chefs,\" I say, \"the maestro instructing how to do it perfectly.\"\nInstead, he's an explorer, taking audiences with him through Spanish farmhouses or Indian truck stops to see what's to be learned from a housewife or a street hawker.\n\"I think that is part of the person I am. In my youth I worked with people trained in the French brigade system: this is the menu, this is how it works; very disciplined. People of my generation like to go out and find how other people work.\n\"People my son's age though, it's all about sitting around late at night talking about food. That's what I really like about Sydney: talking to other chefs and finding what flavours are working.\"\nHe is the affable travel companion with a saucepan who shows food in its natural habitat.\n\"What you are doing is travel writing with food,\" I suggest. \"You said in the India series that 'you don't know a country until you have eaten it'. That really comes over strongly.\"\nStein says, \"The thing I find is that once you start talking food to people, you are talking about something that really matters to them. You are not a tourist any more. You are someone swapping ideas about food.\"\nAbout the arrest? He recalls filming at Corleone in Sicily when a Mafia boss on the run for decades was finally captured. As the camera was set up, the locals thought they were one of the many news crews: \"Are you here about the arrest? And we said, 'No, we are here about the pasta.'\"\nThere is a famous family pasta maker in the town. \"As soon as you say to someone, 'Tell us about the food you really love', not just the food but what it means to the region, the area and the family, people get so emotional about it,\" says Stein.\nStein remarks that the villages and countryside Bangladesh \"are sort of Arcadian – incredibly fertile because it rains all the time and rivers everywhere and lovely meadows\".\nThe striking thing about the two Asian series – in south-east Asia and India – is the amount of effort that people with few resources put into what they eat. \"Poor countries with rich food,\" I say.\n\"They have to make a little protein go a long way,\" he replies. In the West, the price of meat has gone down relative to everything else – but not there.\n\"They can't afford it so they have to be creative. Someone told me in Greece, the best food is in Lent. Not eating meat, they have to be creative with vegetables. It is making do with cheap ingredients that is really good cooking. In a way, it is sad that we can afford such incredibly expensive food.\"\nThe plates are cleared and we decline more of the sauvignon blanc with regret. I could sit here all afternoon.\nIsn't there a bit of irony that in the West, I ask, the better-off can obsess over healthy and authentic food, while other Westerners are eating themselves to death with processed junk? Is the foodie faddishness of the comfortably off unhealthy in its own way?\n\"I sometimes find myself being quite angry going on about the wonderfulness of the Mediterranean diet,\" says Stein, \"or the need not to eat too much meat, simply because I am a middle-class person who has read all the books.\n\"There is a bit of class-ness about it: one tribe who know about food, and the saps who don't with the burgers and chips. I do admire people like Jamie Oliver. We owe it to human beings to help them eat more healthily – but we have to be careful not to look snobby about it.\"\nLord Byron on the side Stein's latest TV food trek, yet to be broadcast here, is around the eastern Mediterranean – the accompanying book, Rick Stein From Venice to Istanbul, came out here this month – looking at the historic connections of food, architecture, with a bit of the mad, bad poet Lord Byron on the side.\n\"There is something incredibly satisfying about Byzantine architecture,\" he says of the trip. \"The curves and the arches are on a human scale. They don't try and dominate like St Peter's in Rome. They are trying to be a spiritual part of your life.\"\nStein has a degree in English Lit from Oxford, but it was no easy ride to get there. At his public school, Uppingham, he remembers liking mostly the food, and did not do well. He started a hotel management course to keep his parents happy. Then his bipolar father tragically took his own life.\nStein ran away to Australia. \"I spent the best part of two years here getting away from the dead loony dad. I spent a lot of that time in the bush near Alice Springs, reading a great deal of literature. I thought about writing.\n\"When I got back to England I remembered that Oxford and Cambridge ran their own entrance exam. For the exam I wrote a really good piece about landscapes and I chose the terrain around Alice Springs.\"\nThe outback had got him to Oxford.\nHe didn't fancy any of the jobs that English graduates usually did. After a failed start with a nightclub he thought about cooking again. He picked up British culinary classics such as Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson's book on fish cookery, and that was it.\nSo do good cooks make good restaurateurs? \"Not necessarily. The first paragraph in the chef's textbook, Practical Catering , says that the reason for opening a restaurant is to make a profit. I have never forgotten that.\n\"No matter how you want to look after your customers, how much you believe in the great civilising factor of the restaurant, the first reason is to make a profit.\"\nAsk Stein about the best things he has ever eaten, and it speaks volumes of the camaraderie with his crew – an important element in the spontaneous, unscripted feel of the television shows.\nIn India, it was a fish curry cooked \"in a place on the beach we just bowled into. It was the unexpectedness of it and the simplicity of it.\"\nThe same thing happened again, near Dubrovnik on the latest series. \"We found this little fishing village. There was no menu at the taverna, the guy just said 'I've got some black squid ink risotto'. We drank lots of Croatian red wine with it. It was just so unexpected, and so memorable.\"\nStein is on his mobile now. Sounds like a food demo for local TV is still a bit unscrambled. But things will get sorted, as they do, and I leave him to it.\nMENU\nChiswick\n65 Ocean Street, Woollahra, Sydney\nCured ocean trout with horseradish, $20\nSeared scallops with artichokes, $22\nQuail ballotine with sourdough, $23\nYellowfin tuna tartare, $20\nGarlic flatbread, $6\n1 bottle Apani sparkling water, $9.50\n2 glasses Earth's End\nsavignon blanc, New Zealand, $24\n1 tea, $5\n1 long black coffee, $5\nTotal: $134.50", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:13:22.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
