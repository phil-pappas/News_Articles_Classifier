Traders increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates next month.\n“Today’s print keeps September firmly on the table and should continue to support the U.S. dollar,” said Matt Derr, a foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. “However, we still have some time and a number of other data prints before the September Federal Open Market Committee that we will need to get through.”\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4 percent to 1,219.83 as of 9:05 a.m. in New York, reaching the highest level since March 13. The greenback added 0.5 percent to $1.0869 per euro and climbed 0.2 percent to 124.93 yen.\nTraders are pricing in a 58 percent probability that the Fed will raise interest rates in September, based on the assumption that the effective fed funds rate will average 0.375 percent after the first increase. That compares with 48 percent Thursday.\n’Dollar Strength’ “There’s an upward bias towards dollar strength,” Michael Materasso, co-chairman of the fixed-income policy committee at Franklin Templeton Investments in New York, said by phone. “If the U.S. economy performs better than expected, as we think it could, I think that may give it an additional boost.”\nLabor Department data showed American employers added 215,000 workers in July. Economists had forecast a 225,000 increase, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Payroll gains averaged 235,000 during the past three months, the strongest since December through February.\nEmployee pay continued to track in the narrow range since the recovery began in mid-2009 showed a long-awaited pickup. Compared with a month earlier, hourly pay rose 0.2 percent to $24.99.\nLast month Fed Chair Janet Yellen said she expected the central bank to raise its benchmark rate this year, while emphasizing the pace of tightening will probably be gradual.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T17:30:12.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
