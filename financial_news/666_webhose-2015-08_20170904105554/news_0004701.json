Denise Meridith \nAugust 7, 2015, Arizona Diamondback fans appreciated the return of pitcher Anderson Chase in the 2-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, while bemoaning the less-than-exciting offensive effort. This year, loyal DBacks fans realize they can be riding a 5-game winning streak and suffering a 5-game losing streak within two weeks. But, also, this year, there are at least five things DBack fans can do to enjoy Chase Field, regardless of where the team is on the winning sine curve. \n1. Diamondback fans can reminisce about the glory days. Taking a selfie in front of the World Series trophy or wearing purple on Throwback Thursdays can make a fan forget the past few years. This year, fans get to celebrate the first induction of a DBack into the Hall of Fame. Today a huge crowd will watch the team retire his “51” jersey. \n2. Secondly, a fan can eat until he/she pukes. The All-You-Can-Eat seats still can provide all the hot dogs, nachos and soda one can consume. But, this year, there are new opportunities to bust one’s daily calorie limit. There is a $25 corn dog or, for those on a monetary, not caloric, budget, the $8.50, 1100-calorie churro dog . \n3. It is fun to participate in a voting contest. Last night, everyone’s favorite lemonade hawker— Derek Moore—won a nationwide popularity contest for vendors . DBack fans always smile when they hear him yell “Lemonade! Lemonade! Like Grandma made! You know you want it!” \n4. One can celebrate something that has nothing to do with baseball. August 7 was Zombie nigh t. There was a scary exhibit, a Zombie survival kit give-away, and Zombie make-up sessions. While there may be dwindling interest in the zombie fad, a lot of kids still had fun wearing their torn, bloody clothes and watching “zombified” photos of the players on the scoreboard. \n5. Finally, you can enjoy the DBacks outside the Stadium. Coach’s Corner Grill , a block away, has special events that attract a lot of pre-game ticket (and non-ticket) holders. On August 9, retired 2-time All-Star Shea Hillenbrand will greet fans before the Alumni Day game . \nThe DBacks, who do not benefit from the same unconditional love afforded the Cubbies, can be commended for keeping loyal fans engaged and happy, even when the team is not playing its best.
