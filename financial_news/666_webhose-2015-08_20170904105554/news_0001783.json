Here's the list. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet' s proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNote: Year-to-date returns are based on Aug. 12, 2015 closing prices. \n1. Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc. Sub-Industry: Asset Management & Custody Banks Market Cap: $3.4 billion Year-to-date return: -7.6% \nArtisan Partners Asset Management Inc is publicly owned investment manager. It provides its services to pension and profit sharing plans, trusts, endowments, foundations, charitable organizations, government entities, private funds and non-U.S. funds, as well as mutual funds, non-U.S. funds and collective trusts. \nGoldman Sachs 12-month price target: $52 Goldman Sachs said: As the stock still trades at a near-trough multiple of 13x 2016 P/E, we see significant room for shares to re-rate higher particularly as we are now seeing signs of a turnaround in flows at APAM. Its 6% dividend yields provides a source of support. \nTheStreet Ratings: Hold, C TheStreet said: \"We rate ARTISAN PARTNERS ASSET MGMT (APAM) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income and revenue growth. However, as a counter to these strengths, we find that the stock has had a generally disappointing performance in the past year.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: ARTISAN PARTNERS ASSET MGMT has improved earnings per share by 19.0% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past year. We feel that this trend should continue. This trend suggests that the performance of the business is improving. During the past fiscal year, ARTISAN PARTNERS ASSET MGMT continued to lose money by earning -$0.72 versus -$2.02 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.90 versus -$0.72). The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Capital Markets industry. The net income increased by 23.6% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $19.26 million to $23.80 million. 37.02% is the gross profit margin for ARTISAN PARTNERS ASSET MGMT which we consider to be strong. Regardless of APAM's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 11.25% trails the industry average. APAM has underperformed the S&P 500 Index, declining 12.25% from its price level of one year ago. Looking ahead, other than the push or pull of the broad market, we do not see anything in the company's numbers that may help reverse the decline experienced over the past 12 months. Despite the past decline, the stock is still selling for more than most others in its industry.
