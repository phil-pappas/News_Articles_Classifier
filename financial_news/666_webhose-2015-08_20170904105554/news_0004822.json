Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) had advertised that its Huggies Natural Care Wipes “clean better” than Pampers Sensitive Wipes, but P&G (NYSE: PG) challenged the claim before the National Advertising Division of the Council for Better Business Bureaus. The NAD, which is designed to settle disputes over ads while avoiding the expense of lawsuits, reported this week that it had recommended Kimberly-Clark stop making the claim on its television commercial, website advertising and email marketing. Kimberly-Clark said the ads were fair because a disclaimer noted the claim was based on a consumer home-use test of the Huggies and Pampers products. Irving, Texas-based based Kimberly Clark followed up by asking customers which brand they preferred. Cincinnati-based P&G argued that the test was flawed and unreliable because participants weren’t polled by Kimberly-Clark until after the 14-day period in which the wipes were used, which allowed for lapses in recalling which product was best. In addition, the test could have been biased because Kimberly-Clark covered up brand labels with tape instead of removing the wipes from the distinctive original packaging, P&G said. Following the test, 77 respondents preferred Huggies, 52 preferred Pampers and 51 replied “neither/don’t know.” P&G conducted its own testing and concluded the products “have no meaningful difference in cleaning performance,” the NAD reported. However, P&G said its technical testing showed that Pampers Sensitive Wipes were stronger and more flexible than Huggies Natural Care wipes, which P&G claimed were characteristics relevant to cleaning performance. P&G and Kimberly-Clark have had a series of disputes that focused on whether an advertising claim was supported by objective testing rather than based on the perceptions of consumers, the NAD said. In each case, Kimberly-Clark argued its advertising claims were best assessed by consumers who regularly used the products. Kimberly-Clark said each ad was supported by home-use studies and consumer questionnaires, but P&G said such claims couldn’t be proven. In the baby wipes dispute, the NAD determined that Kimberly-Clark’s advertising claim “should be substantiated with objective testing that goes beyond simply asking consumers for their opinions as to which product cleans better.” The “cleaning ability of a baby wipe can be objectively measured because its performance can be tied directly to a specific tangible benefit – the removal of mess from a child,” but Kimberly-Clark didn’t submit test results that might prove its claim, the NAD reported. Kimberly-Clark responded that it “continues to believe that cleaning efficacy is a product attribute that can be appropriately supported with consumer-use data.” However, “in the interest of industry self-regulation, current and future advertising materials will take the NAD’s recommendation into account,” Kimberly-Clark stated. The TV commercial that included the “cleans better” claim is no longer being used, Kimberly-Clark added. \nWant Cincinnati Manufacturing news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
