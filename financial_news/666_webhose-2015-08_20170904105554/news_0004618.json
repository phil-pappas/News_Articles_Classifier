Most of these complaints were about U.S. airlines (7,274 in total, up 21%, when compared with the same period last year).\nSo what’s bugging flyers? Lost, damaged and delayed baggage ranks No. 1. (That should come as no surprise, as recent data shows that more than 24 million bags are delayed, damaged, pilfered, lost or stolen under the airline industry’s watch each year .) That was followed closely by reservation, ticketing and boarding issues.\n5 things consumers hate most about airlines\nType of complaint\n% of complaints\nBaggage issues\nIncludes lost, damaged or delayed baggage; charges for baggage; and carry-on baggage problems\n14.9%\nReservation/ticketing/boarding issues\nIncludes airline or agent mistakes made in reservations and ticketing; problems making reservations or getting tickets and boarding problems\n13.4%\nFlight cancellations\n13.3%\nCustomer service\nIncludes rude and unhelpful employees, inadequate meals or cabin service and how delayed passengers are treated\n11.8%\nFlight delays\n11.6%\nSource: Department of Transportation; January 2015 to June 2015\nFor the first six months of this year, American Airlines ( AAL, +2.45% ) (this includes both American and US Airways, which have merged) received the most complaints (2,148 total), followed by United ( UAL, +1.26% ) (1,271), which makes sense considering their large market share. But when you look at the number of complaints per boarding, a different picture emerges — with fee-happy Spirit and Frontier leading the way.\n5 airlines flyers love to complain about\nRank\nAirline\nComplaints (per 100,000 boardings)\n1\nSpirit Airlines\n11.20\n2\nFrontier Airlines\n10.17\n3\nAmerican Airlines\n2.99\n4\nUnited Airlines\n2.78\n5\nEnvoy Air\n1.49\nSource: Department of Transportation; January to June 2015; data for U.S. airlines\nTo be sure, the number of complaints may have risen, in part, because more people are flying. But that probably doesn’t explain all of the 20% jump in complaints, experts say. Some of this uptick may be due to airlines doing more policing of their baggage policies this year and weather issues, says Rick Seaney, chief executive officer of FareCompare.com , a travel advice site and search engine for flight bookings.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/2015AugustATCR.pdf"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T23:58:43.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
