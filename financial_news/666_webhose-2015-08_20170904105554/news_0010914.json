It called a late-night press conference to announce that state-backed investors would continue to buy stocks to stabilize the market. \nIts indifference this time showed that the regulator had a new attitude about intervening in the stock market, another person close to the CSRC said. Officials \"no longer feel the imperative to comb through data for clues to what triggered the fall,\" that person said. \nThe source said he believed the CSRC has decided to be more cautious about intervention and do it less. \nThe fall of the A-share index preceded what turned out to the most turbulent day that many major stock exchanges around the world have seen in years. Many media reports linked this volatility to the Chinese bourse's performance, saying its crash exacerbated investor concerns about the country's economy. \nAnalysts cited two other factors as contributing to problems in China. The first was a weakening yuan and the other was slower manufacturing activity, as reflected by the early Caixin China Purchasing Managers' Index , which hit a 77-month low at 47.1 points in August. \nHowever, Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank in Washington, said neither a global nor a regional crisis is on the horizon, as some analysts have suggested. \nThe fall in the A-share market was predictable considering how fast it soared over the past year, he said, though he said it is hard to predict whether the correction will continue because it is unclear how much of the growth over the past year was driven by speculative investment and how much was due to improvements in business and economic conditions. \nEuropean stock markets overacted to signs of the Chinese economy slowing and would recover after the U.S. stock market stabilizes, Kirkegaard said. \n(Rewritten by Wang Yuqian) CSRC Said to Greet Latest Stock Market Crash with Calm No one worked overtime awaiting orders from higher-ups this time, person close to regulator says By staff reporter Mo Su and Washington correspondent Zhang Yuan'an SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T15:13:45.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
