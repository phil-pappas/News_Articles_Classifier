It has also sent economic shock waves throughout the country of more than 40 million. \nThe economy contracted by nearly seven percent last year and is projected to do even worse in 2015. Ukraine depends on Western financial assistance -- funds that primarily go to pay off old debts. \nFactory output is down by nearly a fifth from last summer and consumers are buying 25 percent less than they did a year ago. \nBut Verzhykhovskiy looks at his swaying stalks and smiles. \nUkraine's total crop production reached a post-Soviet record of 63 million tonnes in 2014 and is on course to nearly match that mark this year. \nThe battled-scarred nation -- so eager to wrestle itself away from Moscow and fully embrace the West -- managed to export an impressive 34.5 million tonnes of grain in 2014. \nThe Financial Times wrote last month that Ukraine was set to become China's top supplier of corn in the first half of this year. \nThe London business daily reported that close to an eye-popping 90 percent of China's maize imports came from Ukraine -- and not its direct neighbour and fellow agricultural power Russia. \nMoscow's exports have been particularly hard-hit by a trade war with the West that was sparked by the Kremlin's March 2014 seizure of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. \n- 'Prices are not good' - \nIt has helped that the fighting has left most cultivated fields untouched. A centuries-old farming tradition also inspires many Ukrainians to feel special pride in their land. \nBut some factors are well outside Verzhykhovskiy's control. A strong dollar has seen commodities lose value and the price of corn drop by about 15 percent since the start of the year. \n\"Prices are not good,\" the young farm boss conceded. \"We operate without a profit on most of our cereals.\" \nThis has cut off foreign investments and left Ukrainian farmers reliant on local banks for loans loaded with exorbitant interest rates few can afford. \n\"Last year was tough on investment,\" Deputy Agriculture Minister Oleksiy Pavlenko told AFP \nBut the minister is placing hope on $1 billion in new farming equipment that has been promised by the United States. Beijing and Kiev signed a $3 billion loan-for-corn deal in 2012 which Ukraine also hopes to extend. \nAll that machinery would find plenty of fertile land to plough. \nThe World Bank estimates that more than 70 percent of Ukraine's territory is arable for farming. The rate is Europe's second highest and bested only by small and impoverished Moldova. \n- High risk, low yield - \nBut economists and the agriculture ministry admit that the sector now needs a push that can only come from private investment. \nWorld Bank data also shows all Ukraine's cultivated land yielding about 4,000 kilograms of cereal per hectare (3,600 pounds per acre) -- about half the rate of Germany and similar to that of Canada. \nYet foreigners remain wary about ploughing money into even the peaceful parts of the unsettled east European country. \nTransparency International ranks Ukraine 142nd out of 175 nations on its corruption index. The court system's independence has been suspect for decades and investor rights are often ignored. \n\"The judicial system has to function before we see any foreigners come running,\" said ProAgro consultancy analyst Mykola Vernytsky. \nKiev plans to put up 254 state-held farms and agricultural businesses for sale this year. \nPavlenko says foreigners already have the right to sign seven-year land leases. He also encourages buyers to snap up properties before demand and land prices go up. \nBut analyst Vernytsky questions whether the privatisation programme will make the impact Kiev's pro-Western government anticipates. \n\"If we open up the agricultural property market but do nothing about the corruption... no one will want that land,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T11:54:04.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
