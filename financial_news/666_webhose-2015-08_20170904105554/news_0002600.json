However, those who will review their prices upwards are not likely to exceed 2%. \nSome analyst believe that what is happening is a clear testimony of the benefit of allowing importers and marketers to set their own price. \nThere are currently about 90 OMCs in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:36:09.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
