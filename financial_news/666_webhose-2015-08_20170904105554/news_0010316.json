Coincidentally I had always dreamt of designing an outfit for his Excellency, so I thanked God my dream had come true,\" Ms Sadiq reveals. \nGoing full time into business six years ago, Ms Sadiq seems to have a knack for catching the attention of high ranking dignitaries. At her showroom framed and hanging on the wall is a thank you note from former First Lady of the United States and former United States Secretary of State Ms Hilary Clinton, thanking Ms Sadiq for a table cloth with matching napkins made form tie and dye fabric. \n\"I had presented the tablecloth in 2012 during the African Women's Entrepreneurship Programme AWEP that was held in Washington. I had represented Tanzania,\" Ms Sadiq explains. \nThe African Women's Entrepreneurship Programme (AWEP) is an outreach, education, and engagement initiative that targets African women entrepreneurs to promote business growth, increase trade both regionally and to US markets through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), create better business environments, and empower African women entrepreneurs to become voices of change in their communities. \nThrough the AWEP, the US Department of State seeks to dismantle the obstacles to business opportunities and economic participation that African women face. \nLaunched in July 2010, the initiative identifies and builds networks of women entrepreneurs across sub-Saharan Africa poised to transform their societies by owning, running, and operating small and medium businesses, and by becoming voices for social advocacy in their communities. \nAnother major breakthrough for Ms Sadiq was when she was commissioned by the organisers of the Smart Partnership meeting that was held in Dar es Salaam in 2013. \n\"I was selected to design shirts with an African touch that reflected Tanzania for the high ranking delegates,\" Ms Sadiq recalls with a sense of achievement. \nAsked how she managed to pull the tender through, she said, \"I work with other designers and we first of all brain storm as a team on the desired outcome of the designs before the stitching takes off. It is hard work but I am happy if pays off at the end of the day. \nAnother dignitary she has dressed is Dr Stergomena Tax, the Executive Secretary of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) who wore Binti Africa design the day she was sworn in. \nMs Sadiq strongly feels that Tanzanians need to support indigenous fashion designers more and grow away for the feeling that clothes made by fellow country men and women are inferior. \nShe goes on further to explain that ready-made clothes that are imported into the country are mass production made and therefore a buyer hardly gets the perfect fit. \nSecondly she stresses that by buying Tanzanian, out of a collective effort employment opportunities for Tanzanians. Growing up in a single parent household, Ms Sadiq is reaching out to young girls through a foundation she is slowly building up. \nThe organisation shares life skills with school girls as well as information on health and reproductive rights. \"Next year I will officially launch the foundation at an event that will coincide with a fashion show,\" she promises. \nHaving kept a low profile over the last couple of years, Ms Sadiq says she is working hard on increasing the capacity of her workshop based in Bunju from the current workforce of 17 to 100. \n\"I feel it is so unfair for tailoring tenders awarded to Tanzanians to be taken up by sub contractors in Asia when we have people with the same skills back home, Ms Sadiq laments. \nWorking closely with the Vocational Education and Training Authority (VETA), Ms Sadiq intends to work closely with persons living with disabilities and provide them an opportunity to become financially independent. \nHaving studied Information Communication Technology (ICT) and having worked at telecommunication companies decided one and for all to take the plunge and become a full time fashion designer a decision she does not regret. \nAs an apparel brand, Binti Africa specialises in clothes for both men and women, ladies shoes, hand bags and other accessories made from African fabric. Binti Africa's products have gained loyal patronage Uganda, Kenya, Zambia and South Africa and beyond.
