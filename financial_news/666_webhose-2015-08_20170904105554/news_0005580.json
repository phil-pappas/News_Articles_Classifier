European equities and export-focused companies have benefited from a weaker euro this year after the European Central Bank began its bond-buying scheme to spur growth.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index and the euro zone's Euro STOXX 50 index both fell by around 1 percent. Germany's exporter-heavy DAX index lost almost 2 percent, falling to its lowest level since Aug. 4.\n\"What is good for growth in China is unfortunately bad for everybody else,\" said Bill McQuaker, co-head of multi-asset at Henderson Global Investors.\nGermany's ZEW survey failed to lift spirits. The economic sentiment reading was down from the previous month and below expectations.\nCarmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen sank 4 to 5 percent. Luxury goods groups Swatch and LVMH both fell around 4 percent.\n\"We have reduced our exposure to European export-led sectors, such as carmakers,\" said Francois Savary, chief strategist at Swiss bank Reyl.\nHowever, the Athens stock market - which has consistently underperformed this year amid Greece's debt problems - rose after Greece and its international lenders reached a new bailout deal.\nAthens' benchmark ATG equity index advanced 1.4 percent as the Greek banking index surged 8 percent, with National Bank of Greece shares up sharply.\nThe Greek ATG index remains down by around 15 percent since the start of 2015, but got a boost from the latest bailout agreement, which also eased pressure on sovereign borrowing costs. The pact could be worth up to 86 billion euros ($95 billion) in fresh loans for debt-ridden Greece.\nShares in Adecco fell after results from the world's biggest staffing group lagged market expectations.\nHowever, Finnish cranemaker Konecranes surged more than 20 percent after Konecranes agreed on a merger with U.S. peer Terex.\nEurope bourses in 2015: link.reuters.com/pap87v\nAsset performance in 2015: link.reuters.com/gap87v\nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T14:19:58.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
