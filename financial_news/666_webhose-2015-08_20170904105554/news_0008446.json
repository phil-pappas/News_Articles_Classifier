Follow @Kiplinger Photo by Poon Watchara-Amphaiwan \nWe know. You’re busy. Sometimes it’s a struggle just to round up the family for dinner, let alone tick off all the tasks on your to-do list. A plethora of Web sites and apps promise to ease the burden. They’ll take care of household chores and administrative tasks, prepare meals, pick up a few essentials at the grocery store, shop for clothes, even mail that birthday card so it doesn’t arrive two days late. Our staff tested 15 outsourcing services to see whether they fulfill their promise to save you time or, even more important, make your life less stressful.

If you've tried to hire a plumber to fix a leaky pipe or a gardener to weed a flower bed, you know how hard it is to get anyone to commit to a one-off $50 job. \nI have a long list of tasks at my house that I have been promising my wife I’d do at least since the last snow melted back in March—of 2012. One task near the top of my honey-do list was fixing a kitchen faucet with a leak that had been getting steadily worse over the past year. Now a new chore jumped to the top of the list: removing a small stump in our backyard. I had managed to cut down a junky tree, limb by limb, but the stump was better left to a handyman with a back that didn’t threaten to go out with the first swing of the pickax. Advertisement \nUsing my PC, I set up an account on Taskrabbit , scanned the categories (delivery, cleaning, general handyman, moving, event help), and entered the task, my zip code, the day and time I wanted it done, and a credit card number. \nFirst the stump: Under general handyman/yard work, three “taskers” who worked in my zip code were available to do the job. Their profiles, customer ratings and reviews, and hourly rates (from $35 to $80) were displayed. I went with Marcel, who charged $60 an hour and had a 99% positive rating. His profile said “ID verified,” and a perusal of his customer comments showed rave reviews—except for one star-crossed gig as a bartender. Taskrabbit also charges a 5% “trust and safety” fee, which covers a background check and insurance coverage of up to $1 million for property damage, bodily injury and theft. \nMarcel immediately sent a text message thanking me for hiring him and, a day or two later, asked for a photo of the stump. He arrived via bicycle right on time, but he looked distraught when he saw the stump. “I thought it would be old and decayed,” he said. I gave him a succession of tools—pickax, chain saw, drill—and after an hour and 20 minutes, we agreed that he would come back later to finish the job, after the stump had rotted and softened. I put him to work pulling ivy off the side of my house. After two and a half hours of work, the bill came to $157.50. Taskrabbit had my credit card info, so payment was automatic. \nI didn’t get immediate gratification with my faucet, either. I initially shopped for a plumber on Handy (formerly Handybook), which specializes in small plumbing and electrical jobs as well as in painting and household cleaning. But the online estimate to fix the leak in my faucet was two hours and $170, paid in advance. (There's a 24-hour full-refund cancellation policy and money-back guarantee; returning users pay day of service.) I didn’t see how fixing a leaky faucet merited two hours. On Taskrabbit, a search under plumbing turned up Craig T, at $69 an hour. \nOn the appointed day, Craig asked if he could come by the house early to see if I needed a part. He unscrewed the handle of the single-handle faucet and announced that it needed a new cartridge. He copied down a parts number and said he would check at a plumbing supply store. \nI heard from him the next day saying “they are looking for the part.” Six days after that, he said he would have to come by, dismantle the sink and take the cartridge with him so they could match it. Craig didn’t charge me for the half-hour fact-finding visit, and when he reassembled the faucet, he slowed the leak to a tolerable trickle. I’m thinking I can live with a slow leak. \nAlthough my test tasks weren’t completed, I would use Taskrabbit again. I like how easy it is to hire someone for small jobs and the fact that taskers are vetted. Taskrabbit has a wide range of other services that I might use to check off the items still on my honey-do list. — Mark Solheim", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T15:58:05.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
