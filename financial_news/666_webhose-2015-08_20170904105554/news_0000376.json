Darryl Peroni Share on twitter by Tess Ingram Contractors building Gina Rinehart's $10 billion Roy Hill project have been forced to send hundreds of workers to the Pilbara to try to avoid hefty penalty fees for delays finishing the project.\nHead contractor Samsung C&T and its subcontractors have been racing to ensure they meet Roy Hill's aggressive deadline to ship its first ore , which was slated for next month but now not expected until October.\nIf the first shipment does not sail by the end of October, Samsung faces penalty fees of almost $2 million for each day the project is late.\nSources said between 1000 and 1500 workers, unable to be accommodated at Roy Hill's onsite accommodation, were being housed in various sites around the Pilbara town of Newman, about a three-hour round trip from Roy Hill.\nA Roy Hill spokeswoman confirmed about 1100 workers were being housed in Newman \"and have been for more than three months as part of Samsung's efforts to meet schedule\".\nSources said sites housing the Roy Hill workers include Tribute Group's Kalgan's Rest and Whaleback Village.\nTribute Group declined to confirm if additional Roy Hill workers were staying on site, citing confidentiality agreements with contractors that use the accommodation.\nMore workers are understood to be housed in Port Hedland, five hours from the mine site.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

This added to the existing 2000-bed onsite village at Roy Hill and a 1200-person offsite camp.\nModular accommodation provider Ausco Modular, which built the overflow camp, confirmed the temporary accommodation remained onsite and in use.\nThe cost of housing and transporting additional workers could eat into Samsung's margins on its $5.6 billion head engineering, procurement and construction contract unless the extra costs are pushed onto subcontractors, some of which are in ongoing payment disputes with the Korean company.\nIndustry sources are speculating Samsung is about $1 billion over budget.\nSamsung would not comment on costs and progress, other than to say its \"extensive experience\" had enabled it to \"execute the construction of the landmark Roy Hill project\".\n\"We have been striving for smooth progress of the project which will deliver enormous benefits to the broader community for many years to come,\" a Samsung spokeswoman said.\nIncurring some extra costs could, however, save Samsung in the long run. Its contract with Roy Hill afforded a one month \"grace period\", which ends on October 30. After this day, Samsung must pay liquidated damages of $55.9 million a month, applied for every day the first shipment is delayed from October 30, up to a cap of about $390 million.\nIf the first shipment sails before October 30 Samsung will receive an incentive bonus of up to $78 million.\nLast week, Roy Hill chief executive Barry Fitzgerald conceded the project's deadline to ship its first iron ore by September 30 was unlikely to be met.\nThe Roy Hill spokeswoman said Samsung was still \"striving to ship first ore by September 30, despite delays; however the milestone is more likely to be met in October\".\nA senior industry source familiar with the progress of the project said the number of workers contractors had on site showed they had \"really manned up to get it finished\". Despite this, he said he believed delays could persist for months.\nRoy Hill is about 88 per cent complete and is expected to be about 92 per cent complete when its first ore is shipped, \"with further deliveries of the mining fleet and rolling stock in 2016 completing the project\", the spokeswoman said.\nAsked whether the project's lenders had raised concerns about delays, the spokeswoman said \"the project provides regular reports to the lenders and has responded to the queries that have [been] raised by them and their representatives\".\n\"The lenders representative also make regular site visits to make their own assessments,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TessIngram"], "published": "2015-08-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:04:05.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
