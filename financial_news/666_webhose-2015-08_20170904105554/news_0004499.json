Take the medicine. Pushing up in the future is going to create bigger problem.”\nAsked about banks hiding their true NPA levels, the central bank chief said, “We inspect the banks regularly and we figure it out if something that is not a standard asset is not declared an NPA. These are called divergences.\n“In some banks, there are more divergences than others, in which case they have a pretty strong discussion with deputy governor SS Mundra who hauls them up for doing what they did.”\n“Increasingly we are turning towards taking action on such divergences. It’s not that these things get done with impunity,” Rajan told reporters, but parried a direct answer.\nHe said RBI has put in place a number of checks and balances to ensure that NPAs which are announced by banks are true and give a fair picture.\nIt may be noted that many state-run banks, despite reporting massive drops in bottomline numbers, declared lower slippages during the June quarter even as they set aside more money as provisions.\nIn the quarter to March 2014, the system-level NPAs including restructured assets, crossed a whopping 11.5 per cent, led by public sector banks. In the June quarter, not only most of the large and mid-sized state-run banks but also many private players reported rising asset quality woes.\nRajan said there are certain sectors like power and steel which are still under stress.\n“We are certainly monitoring that process and trying to urge that restructuring when done is deep and is appropriate so project are put back on track. That is what we need for continuing health on banking system but the economy,” he said.\n“The central factors in this are power distribution companies. If they get resolved in a more permanent way, then that would alleviate some stress in the power sector.\n“Our focus is how can we resolve the distribution company stress in a proper way,” Rajan said.\nThe Governor said the RBI is examining the 5:25 rules to make sure it is used for right purpose. “The point is not to postpone problem into the future or postpone repayment way into future. We are insisting that there should not be a significant moratorium on repayment in the 5:25 rule,” the Governor said.\nTalking about the capital infusion into public sector banks, deputy governor SS Mundra said, the capital required will in the range of Rs 1.50-2.50 trillion over the period of four-five years for implementation of Basel III norms depending on credit growth.\nRajan said that sources of current stress are global overcapacity and power. “The central factors in this are power distribution companies.
