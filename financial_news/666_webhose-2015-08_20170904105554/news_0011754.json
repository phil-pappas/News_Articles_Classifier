BK, +3.37% , the largest fund custodian in the world by assets, are preventing the bank from pricing hundreds of mutual and exchange-traded funds, The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday . That means investors can’t value their holdings, making trading during one of the most volatile market weeks in a decade even more complicated. The report says some fund sponsors were attempting to manually price holdings in their funds, which may generate legal implications for them if they make a material mistake that goes out to investors. Fund-research firm Morningstar Inc. MORN, +1.62% told the Wall Street Journal 796 funds were missing their net asset values on Wednesday. Reuters reported that the glitch was caused by an accounting system the bank uses to calculate the prices of clients’ mutual funds and exchange traded funds. The software, called InvestOne, is used by financial institutions managing more than $28 trillion in assets and is owned by SunGard, a company being acquired by Fidelity National Information Services FIS, +1.21% . BNY Mellon outsources some of its net asset value calculations to SunGard. A Bank of New York Mellon spokesman did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nSunGard posted a detailed response to the issues on its website late Thursday saying that the issue “appears to have been caused by an unforeseen complication resulting from an operating system change” performed by the company last Saturday. SunGard president and CEO, Russ Fradin, commented: “We at SunGard apologize to BNY Mellon for the adverse impact this unfortunate incident has had on its operations and clients. We take this matter very seriously and truly appreciate the spirit of cooperation from BNY Mellon. We are committed to restoring the trust placed in us by BNY Mellon and all of our valued customers.”\nBlackRock BLK, +3.75% , the world’s largest fund manager, acquired “robo-adviser” FutureAdvisor . FutureAdvisor was founded in 2010 by two former Microsoft MSFT, +2.79% engineers. The software offers asset allocation advice to “people who cannot afford — or do not feel comfortable visiting — a traditional broker” or advisor, the report says. FutureAdvisor was valued at between $150 million and $200 million by the deal, the Financial Times reported . A Reuters report on Wednesday Quote: s a BlackRock executive saying the firm does not plan to offer the product to individual investors.\nThe growth in automated digital advisory platforms comes as the debate rages about who and how brokers and advisors give advice, especially to retirement account holders. The Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission both have floated proposals for requiring a fiduciary standard for all retirement advisors, in the case of DOL and for broker-dealers, in the case of the SEC. The broker-dealer industry, in particular, is resisting the new rules, saying they won’t be able to provide advice to low and middle income savers under a fiduciary standard on a cost effective basis.\nBarclays Plc BCS, +2.14% and the major exchanges won the dismissal of class action litigation in which pension funds and other investors accused them of manipulating data feeds and order types to benefit high-frequency traders, Reuters reported Wednesday . U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said federal law affords exchanges “absolute immunity” from the allegations because they did not meet the definition of “manipulative acts”. A Bloomberg report on Wednesday said the investors believed the New York Stock Exchange ICE, +1.15% , Nasdaq Stock Market NDAQ, +3.24% and venues operated by Bats Global Markets Inc. had violated the law by enabling high-frequency firms to exploit ordinary investors trading on the exchanges in return for which the firms directed their “considerable” trading activity to them. The judge disagreed, saying the plaintiffs had not provided enough evidence of how those actions could have affected the price at which securities traded in the dark pool. Several regulators are also investigating the so-called dark pools, including New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nA message to Barclays requesting comment was not immediately returned, while Bats and New York Stock Exchange spokeswomen and a Nasdaq OMX spokesman declined comment.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/26/us-futureadvisor-m-a-blackrock-idUSKCN0QV1HU20150826", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aa146994-4b61-11e5-b558-8a9722977189.html#ixzz3k1CAaggR", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/securities-pricing-problems-hit-u-s-mutual-funds-etfs-1440601913", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-26/barclays-stock-exchanges-win-dismissal-of-hft-lawsuits", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/26/bnymellon-funds-nav-idUSL1N1111QY20150826", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aa146994-4b61-11e5-b558-8a9722977189.html#axzz3k1g8c3ro", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/26/us-highfrequencytrading-lawsuit-idUSKCN0QV2EV20150826?mod=djemRiskCompliance"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:03:30.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
