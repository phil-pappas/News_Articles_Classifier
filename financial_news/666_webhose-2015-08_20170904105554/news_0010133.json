As an unbiased provider of financial wellness services, Financial Finesse has a pretty unique perspective during these types of market events that impact everyday investors. The unique aspect is found in the unbiased approach, meaning we do not sell any financial products or manage investments. This allows us to provide financial guidance to employees of various corporations and organizations without any potential conflict of interest or hidden agenda.In light of the recent market turmoil, it seems appropriate to ask my colleagues what they are telling concerned investors seeking guidance from Financial Finesse’s financial coaching line or during in-person financial planning consultations. (Before I share their responses, it is necessary to mention that this is my own go-to team for financial guidance and second opinions.) The questions posed to our team of CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professionals were simple:\nWhat are you telling concerned investors during this period of market volatility? t How do you personally deal with market corrections? Brian Kelly – “ A lot of the calls that I have received have come from people who are flat out ready to get out of the markets altogether and move to cash. They are very fearful of another 2008 and don’t want to lose half of their savings –again. I’ve been talking to people who are closer to retirement about looking at their 401(k) dollars in terms of how and when they are going to spend it. For money they will need in the next 3 to 5 years, it may be appropriate to move to a cash-like investment to avoid market risk and interest-rate risk, but one thing is certain. The costs of future goods are going to inflate and cash investments won’t keep up with the rising prices so for the money that is intended for later years, it is prudent to put those funds in a balanced portfolio based on their risk tolerance and objectives.” Cynthia Meyer - “If you follow a set investment strategy like me, have rebalanced your portfolio in the past year and have more than 4-5 years to go until you need the money, the answer is probably, “ take some deep breaths and don't do a thing .” You may want to sell to avoid more downside in your portfolio, but if you have a mix of well-diversified investments, it is generally better to ignore that impulse. Try not to sell into weakness. We have not had a market correction in the U.S. in several years and stocks are trading at fairly expensive valuations. It does not surprise me that there is some trimming back even though other economic indicators are good. In fact, I have my eye on a few high-quality dividend paying stocks and am planning to use some cash to buy them if they look like they are on sale! If you haven’t been paying as much attention to your investments and your portfolio is due for a rebalance, use an asset allocation calculator to check up on your risk tolerance and time horizon before you do anything. You may find that you are exactly where you need to be. If not, then think about rebalancing. Ups and downs in the stock market are completely normal. Consider turning off the financial news and not checking your accounts so often. Measure your success against your goals, not against the highest number on your 401(k) statement.” Doug Spencer – “The last couple of days have been crazy on our helpline and I have started pretty much every conversation with these two questions: “When do you plan to retire?” and “Have you ever taken a risk tolerance assessment?” If they say that they’re going to retire within 5 years then I stress the importance of having about 5 years worth of your income needs at retirement in a very safe, stable place like a stable value fund or the bank. Then make the rest of your investments based upon whether you’re an aggressive, moderate or conservative investor but if you’re calling today, you’re probably not an aggressive investor. As for me, I’m not doing anything right now with my investments. I’m more of a passive, long-term investor but if the market drops 20% from its high a few months ago then I will look for one or two stocks or market sectors that I think have been beat up too much and take a flyer on that. If I take that chance, then I will set a target price where I will sell at least half to lock in some profits – hopefully!” Paul Wannemacher – “ Like most planners, my volume of panicked market calls has dramatically shot up as the market has legged down. A few have asked to get out immediately while most have asked if their asset allocation is right for them. We all shouldn’t need a market meltdown to ask that question, but it’s just human nature. You never check the sump pump until the basement is full of water, do you? For clients investing for retirement, I emphasize the long term nature of the goal and how small these even 10% blips appear on the long-term chart of the S&P or composite indexes. I also share long-term returns for cash, high quality bonds, and equities. It’s easy to show that one way to guarantee you’ll never be able to afford retirement is to put it in cash at these rates. Almost nobody can save enough! So since the math just won’t work, we’re forced to use securities to give ourselves even a chance. The risk then is demonstrated using asset allocations over the long term on charts that show long term returns, best and worst years, and number of losing years. Vanguard has a good resource on their site as do Ibbotson, Morningstar , and other investment companies. Over years of helping investors with their accounts, I learned that nobody is worth a darn at market timing (me included), at least over sustained periods of time. I tell people to set expectations for how their asset allocations will do on how the indexes did in the long run. Any extra can be chocked up to luck, skill, whatever, but not expected, even if they use managed funds. I then set retirement funding requirements based on these lowered expectations. You might have to save more but I’d rather be conservative and beat my goal than be overly optimistic. Also, we can show that equity markets over the long haul have created more wealth than any other mechanism. 95 of the last 100 ten-year periods have been positive, with 2008 and 2009 among the 5 downers, so I like my odds if I can afford to wait. Finally, market corrections and business cycles typically have a 5-7 year “cleansing” period, so if I can hang in there for that long, I believe I will recapture most of the previous highs.” Kelley Long – “ I'm increasing my contribution percentage then pouring a glass of wine to toast buying stocks on sale!” Bruce Young – “ Knowing that if I need to have my money last around 14,600 days (40 years), I think I can deal with a drop in 5 of them (or .00034) of my total time horizon!” Erik Carter – “What you should do during a market downturn are the same things you should always do when it comes to investing. Start with your goals. Any money you need in the next 5-7 years, should be in cash and unaffected by the downturn. For longer term goals, make sure you’re property diversified. The easiest way to do that is by putting everything into a balanced or target date fund that matches your time frame and comfort with risk. If you have multiple funds, consider rebalancing your portfolio back in line with your target asset allocation. (If you don’t know what that means, use a balanced or target date fund.) Most importantly, don’t panic! That may mean not even looking at your account. The longest it would have taken to get your money back after previous downturns was 7 years and that was after the Crash of 1929. I think of market downturns as an opportunity to continue buying stocks while their prices are relatively low. If the market never comes back, we’re either living in a utopia where technology has finally ended the problem of material scarcity or in a post-Apocalyptic world where your investments will be the least of your worries!” One common theme that I picked up on from our planner team’s responses is why it is essential to frame any investment decisions in the context of short and long-term financial goals. However, the one missing link that often leads to anxiety and distress during a down market is a simple investment plan. If you continue to feel concern about the recent market volatility, the best course of action is to use those emotions to take action and review your investment plan. If you don’t have a plan, now is a good time to start. Putting your investment plan on a note card or creating an investment policy statement is a much more proactive alternative to panic selling.", "external_links": ["http://portfolio.morningstar.com/Rtport/Free/InstantXRayDEntry.aspx", "http://money.cnn.com/tools/assetallocwizard/assetallocwizard.html", "https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-allocations", "http://www.financialfinesse.com/blog/2013/04/is-your-investment-portfolio-missing-a-key-ingredient/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/22/your-money/stocks-and-bonds/advice-after-stock-market-drop-take-some-deep-breaths-and-dont-do-a-thing.html", "http://www.financialfinesse.com/blog/2015/08/can-you-put-your-investment-plan-on-a-note-card/"], "published": "2015-08-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T17:04:48.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
