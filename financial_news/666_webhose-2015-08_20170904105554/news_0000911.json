The US contract on Tuesday closed at the lowest level since March 2009. \nEuropean benchmark Brent oil for September delivery gained 48 cents to $US49.66 a barrel in London. \n\"We're back in positive territory, but overall the reaction is rather tepid,\" said Kyle Cooper of IAF Advisors. \nUS oil inventories dipped 1.7 million barrels in the week ending August 7, with domestic production falling 70,000 barrels a day to about 9.4 million barrels a day, according to data released by the US Department of Energy. \nOil prices also received support from a retreat in the US dollar Wednesday as China's move to devalue its currency against the greenback sparked speculation the US Federal Reserve will move more slowly to hike interest rates. \nA cheaper dollar lifts demand outside the US for crude oil, which is traded in the US currency on international markets. \nPRECIOUS METALS \nGold rose for a fifth session in a row on Wednesday, hitting a fresh three-week high as the dollar and global equities slid on concerns over China's devaluation of its currency. \nEarlier in the day, the People's Bank of China set the yuan's midpoint reference rate weaker than Tuesday's surprise two per cent devaluation. \nThe move sparked fears of a currency war and hit global equities, prompting some investors to seek assets perceived as safer such as gold. \nThe metal has now recovered more than 4 per cent from a five and a half year low of $US1,077 hit during a late-July rout. \nSpot gold rose as much as 1.2 per cent to its highest since July 20 at $US1,121.40 an ounce and was up 0.9 per cent at $US1,119.10. \nUS gold for December delivery gained 1.4 per cent to settle at $US1,123.60 an ounce. \nBASE METALS \nNickel, copper and aluminium recovered on Wednesday from six-year lows hit earlier in the session after China allowed the yuan to weaken further, prompting fears that metals demand from the world's top buyer would wither. \nLondon Metal Exchange nickel crashed 15 per cent overnight to $US9,100 a tonne as the news prompted a surge of chart-based selling in an illiquid market, but recovered to end at $US10,600, down 1.4 per cent. \nCopper plunged to $US5,062 but ended up 1.3 per cent at $US5,189.50, while aluminium sank to $US1,553.50 but ended up 0.1 per cent at $US1,588. \nChina's yuan hit a four-year low, falling for a second day after authorities devalued it, and sources said clamour in government circles to help struggling exporters would put pressure on the central bank to let it drop lower still. \nFears over a weaker yuan intensified after Beijing released weak factory output, retail sales and property investment data. \nFor metals, the knee-jerk response was widespread selling on fears that a weaker yuan will make imports more expensive for Chinese buyers, but the complex later recovered. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Fairfax profit down, digital income soars AAP \nFairfax Media has reported a 62.9 per cent drop in full year profit to $83.2 million after revenue decreased by â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T02:48:10.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
