It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was last at 123.935. \nThe probability of a September hike is now 45 percent from about 50 percent towards the end of July, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Fedwatch. \nThe euro climbed to a six-day high of $1.1149, while the dollar index was flat at 9.379 after an overnight loss of 0.7 percent. \n\"The minutes already reflected concern held by policymakers that inflation was not rising as desired even before the recent financial market turmoil,\" said Monex senior strategist Masafumi Yamamoto in Tokyo. \n\"The minutes have not factored in falling oil prices and events in China that have taken centre stage since the meeting in July. It would not be surprising if policymakers are even more dovish now in light of these events.\" \nInvestors will be able to gauge policymakers' latest thinking when San Francisco Fed President John Williams speaks in Indonesia later in the global day. \n\"Williams is a centrist and voter and as he is speaking in Asia, may address concerns around developments in China delaying Fed liftoff,\" wrote Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow in Sydney. \nIn contrast to the dollar, sterling continued to draw support on firmer expectations the Bank of England would raise rates as early as next year. \nHigher-than-expected core inflation in Britain along with outgoing policymaker David Miles saying a rate hike would come \"pretty soon\" supported the pound. \nCable was steady at $1.5681 and within reach of a seven-week peak of $1.5717 scaled Tuesday. \nThe dollar's broad decline cushioned commodity currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars, which had come under pressure earlier as oil prices plumbed fresh six-and-a-half-year lows and on persistent worries about China's slowing economy. \nThe Canadian dollar rose to C$1.3109 per dollar after hitting a low of C$1.3180 overnight. \nThe Australian dollar rebounded from a one-week low of $0.7312 to as high as $0.7373, but was cut short by a drop in Chinese stocks. \nThe Aussie, often used as a liquid proxy of China trades, stood little changed at $0.7347. \nIt touched a six-year low of $0.7217 last week after China devalued its currency, sharpening concern about the health of the world's second-largest economy.
