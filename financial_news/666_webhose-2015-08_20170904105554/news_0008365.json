Andrew Quilty Share on twitter by Kate Cowling The Tax Office is risk-profiling self-managed super funds (SMSFs) using intelligence from government and non-government agencies, with particular scrutiny placed on investors using aggressive tax strategies in the funds.\nSMSFs identified as high risk will be placed on an ATO watch list and the trustee could either be disqualified or fined up to $10,200 for breaking the rules covered in the Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) act.\n\"I really want to be clear – individuals looking to play the system and receive a present day tax benefit in their personal or business affairs should be on notice that through increasingly enhanced data capture techniques from the ATO … tax breaches that are related to regulatory breaches within the one transaction or arrangement will not be looked at in isolation,\" Kasey Macfarlane, assistant commissioner of the ATO, told a Tax Institute conference in Sydney.\n\"If we identify an aggressive taxation approach, coupled with a regulatory breach, there is a very, very strong likelihood that we will look to disqualify trustees in those circumstances.\"\nIn July last year, the ATO was granted new powers, which include financial penalties, education directions and \"rectification directions\", which Ms Macfarlane said give the tax office flexibility to use its discretion rather than taking \"blunt instrument\" approach to violations.\nSMSFs can also be wound up, enforceable undertakings accepted and trustees disqualified under the ATO's remit.\nIn relation to the ATO's surveillance actions, Ms Macfarlane said it's using a wider pool of intelligence back to July 2014 – when the new powers came into place – including dob ins from the public, income tax information and data from RP Data and Austrack, in addition to independent audits SMSFs have to submit each year.\nRisk scores are assigned to SMSFs after they register with the ATO based on the history of the trustee's SMSF involvement, past compliance problems, debt and lodgement history and superannuation balance.\n They are also given a questionnaire, then 40 different attributes are rated and weighted to determine how likely the trustee is to break the law.\n\"In the cases where we rate an SMSF as high risk, you can be assured we do that with a high degree of certainty,\" she said.\nBut she said the ATO looks kindly upon early action from SMSFs who pick up their own mistakes and stressed the financial penalties are not a revenue raising tool.\nData from the ATO shows in 2014-15, 662 trustees were disqualified, 44 SMSFs wound up due to compliance action and 361 enforceable undertakings were accepted.\nAmong the new powers, 54 education directions were given and 27 SMSFs were told to rectify something.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:49:08.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
