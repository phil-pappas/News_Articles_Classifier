Selfridges’ foodhall sells more than 25 brands of alternative water and Just Bee is the best-seller. \nMr Harper’s beekeeper father, Ron, was the inspiration for the business. “We were talking about how great a natural sweetener honey is but how you never see it in soft drinks,” said Mr Harper. “We also wanted to do our bit to help British bees, which are in decline.” * Bees contribute more to British economy than Royal Family * Young beekeepers - the new generation bringing back British bees All the test products were made using Mr Harper Snr’s honey from his four hives in the family garden but the business has already outgrown his supply. \n“He said it’s a hobby, he’s retired, and he doesn’t want to go back into full-time work, especially for his son,” said Mr Harper. A blend of honey is now sourced from a Liverpool-based distributor. \nJust Bee was predicted to turn over up to £200,000 in its first year but surprise orders could drive up revenues significantly. “We just had a huge order from Google Ireland,” said Mr Sugden. “Our forecasts are changing by the hour.” \nJust Bee has pledged to give 10pc of its profits to the British Beekeeping Association. The company is also giving away free packets of bee-friendly wildflower seeds from its website . \nMr Sugden and Mr Harper both worked in the business advisory sector for nine years before starting their business. The pair took advantage of the Government’s Growth Voucher scheme last year, securing £5,000 to develop their recipes. They have just booked in their third production run, doubling each order from the original minimum contract of 10,000 units. \n“We could branch out into other food and drink products, even health and beauty down the line but we keep having to stop ourselves because we need to walk before we can run,” said Mr Sugden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:52:39.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
