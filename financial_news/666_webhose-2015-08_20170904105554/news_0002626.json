Wayne Taylor by Perry Williams Casino chief Rowen Craigie has a pretty good sense of what drives James Packer.\nAfter working for years under James's father, the late Kerry Packer, and before that for the founder of Crown Resorts Melbourne casino, Lloyd Williams, the boss of Crown argues all three chairmen brought a different focus to the casino empire.\n\"Lloyd was the real design and construction aficionado, down to the very last detail. Kerry really focused on the customer experience and building up repeat business, while James is all about the numbers, he's across every detail of Crown,\" Craigie told AFR Weekend .\nBut after 10 years in the chair it seems the numbers were no longer enough.\nPacker dialled into Crown's board meeting on Wednesday evening to announce he would tender his resignation as Crown chairman in order to focus on his casino and technology interests overseas rather than his existing Australian gaming operations. He will be replaced by new lieutenant and former investment banker Rob Rankin, who already heads up Packer's private company Consolidated Press Holdings.\nWhile some investors read the removal of Packer at the helm of the casino juggernaut as a hugely symbolic moment, it came as little surprise to the Crown board.\nIt is believed Packer first broached the idea of stepping back from the chairman's role two years ago with several advisors to Crown. The reason? He was spending most of his time living outside Australia.\nThe view was firmed up in July when Packer and Rankin met in London at the Ashes cricket Test at Lord's.\n Rankin said he spoke with Packer about the longevity of juggling the chairman's role with his other commitments around the globe.\n\"I said to James, 'you've got to be in the one spot a bit more',\" Rankin told AFR Weekend . \"I don't think it was a sustainable model for the company over the next five years for James to be doing the miles and amount of travelling he was doing.\"\nRankin, who is based in Hong Kong, urged Packer to see the merits of having Crown's top executives dotted strategically around the globe rather than clinging to its Australian base.\n\"I said I think we can be really proud of our Australian heritage, our values, the business, the cashflow - we make a lot of our money in Australia - but your people have got to be of the right type in the right place.\"\nPacker will divide his time between Los Angeles, where his children live, with frequent visits to Las Vegas to ensure the successful start-up of a planned $4 billion casino on the strip. He will also devote time to Israel, where he owns a home, which has been the focus of new investment opportunities in cyber terrorism and other tech start-ups. And he's expected to spend more time in Hong Kong with Rankin given he will retain his co-chairman role within the Melco Crown joint venture.\nRankin says the management change strengthens Crown's influence as it looks to embark on a critical five-year development period with more than $5 billion of new casino developments in the pipeline including in Las Vegas, Sydney and possibly Japan.\n\"In some ways having James relieved from some of the formal aspects of the chairmanship and being able to focus on key projects and growth opportunities is even better from a shareholder value point of view,\" argues Rankin. \"I don't subscribe to this view that you can't run a big global business out of Australia, but I think what you need to do is to have your best people across different time zones.\"\nCraigie agrees it's a good result for the business. But when asked if Packer's new role will give him a more detailed understanding of the project pipeline, he breaks out in laughter.\n\"James is absolutely hands-on and he will continue to be hands-on,\" he says with his best poker face.\nWithin the Crown camp, Packer is famously known for his acute focus on the financial performance of the empire. He religiously scans the daily turnover numbers from Crown's Melbourne and Perth casinos to assess the underlying profitability of the two resorts.\n\"Getting those daily numbers means James has a daily insight into Crown's profit and loss,\" says one source. \"He devours those daily updates and if he doesn't receive them on time you will definitely know about it.\"\nPacker's familiarity with the numbers meant his enthusiasm for chairing Crown board meetings may have started to wane as he balanced the formal business of operations and strategy with his real love for networking, chasing deals and conceptualising the look and feel of new resorts in the pipeline.\n\"Normally the chairman turns up to a board meeting and there's a fairly extensive look at how the business is tracking operationally,\" said the source. \"But James already knew all of those details weeks before the rest of the board and you just got the sense that his real strengths lie in being on the ground and building the Crown brand.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:07:56.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
