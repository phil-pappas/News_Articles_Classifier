This is much cheaper than any air and much faster than any sea route.\" \nThe tiny country of around 850,000 people has bold ambitions to become the commercial hub of eastern Africa, building on its role as the main port for landlocked Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country. \nOther flights are scheduled next week to the Somali capital Mogadishu, to South Sudan's capital Juba and the Kenyan capital Nairobi. \nCurrently with only one aircraft, the company is due to take delivery of five aircraft later this year, including a Boeing 767, 737 and 757. \nIt plans to begin passenger flights in November with connections to Paris, London, Dubai and Mumbai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T03:26:34.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
