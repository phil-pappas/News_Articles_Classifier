Use your key for the next article Comment \nOn July 27, the City of Boston and the United States Olympic Committee announced that the USOC would no longer support the City’s bid for the 2024 Olympic Games. The same day Boston formally withdrew its bid to host the Games. Public support for the Bid was weak to non-existent and while a study was underway to determine the cost of hosting the Games, the City refused to sign an agreement underwriting any cost overruns resulting from hosting the Games. \nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh had initially indicated that the City would be willing to sign an agreement that would commit the City to financial support for the Games including guarantees that could put public funds at risk. The Mayor reviewed an agreement with a previously committed US city and his initial reaction was that Boston would be willing to consider signing a similar agreement. \nHowever, public support for hosting the Games failed to materialize and never rose above the fifty percent level. Governor Charlie Baker has not taken a public position on hosting the Games and had commissioned a study to determine the financial viability as well as the risks associated for the City and State. The study has not been concluded which causes timing problems for the US Olympic Committee, who must submit a bid to the International Olympic Committee in September. The study and presumably the Governor’s support would not have been in place prior to the USOC submission deadline. \nThe USOC was roundly criticized for selecting Boston as the 2024 Bid City particularly when other cities and regions appeared to have technically superior bids. Moreover, the USOC must now scramble to find a city willing to jump into the process and become the designated US Bid City for the 2024 Olympic sweepstakes. \nThe Boston withdrawal is not without precedent as Denver withdrew its bid for the 1976 Olympics in the face of severe public opposition. Given the reality that both New York and Chicago bid efforts were soundly defeated in previous years, the USOC is facing a real dilemma. They must now turn to one of the cities that were previously rejected in favor of Boston. \nMany Olympic insiders feel that Los Angeles had the best bid for 2024 which included an impressive resume of successfully hosting the 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games. Moreover, the infrastructure in Los Angeles, traffic notwithstanding, is in place and little construction would be required to host the Games. \nIn this writer’s opinion the Boston bid was ill fated from the beginning. Capital costs would have been enormous in the crowded northeast corridor as the Games would have been spread over a wide area of New England and substantial infrastructure would have had to be built. Worse, there was never strong public support for the Games and this is an absolute prerequisite for the IOC. One thing they do not like is public pressure and negative publicity is even worse. \nSo now we have to wait and watch as the USOC scrambles for another Bid city and they must do so from a weakened position. While several cities/regions had credible bids, Los Angeles seems to make the most sense. The simple fact is that the Summer Games have become so big that there are not many cities that can effectively and efficiently host the Games. It will be interesting to see what happens to the bid effort which seems far away in 2024. However, the decision to host those Games will be made in 2017 so the clock is ticking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T01:43:33.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
