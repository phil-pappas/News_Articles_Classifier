New York Federal Reserve chief William Dudley stoked speculation the Fed won't rush to raise interest rates, saying starting the normalisation process at the September FOMC meeting \"seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago\". Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell as the greenback rose. \"They are both struggling - there are plenty of people looking to sell into any rallies,\" said Mark Johnson, senior dealer at OMF. \"Both currencies succumbed to US dollar strength overnight.\" The New Zealand dollar slipped to 90.57 Australian cents at 5pm from 91.03 cents on Wednesday, to 77.14 yen from 77.63 yen and to 4.1210 yuan from 4.1627 yuan, but firmed to 56.65 euro cents from 56.49 cents.
