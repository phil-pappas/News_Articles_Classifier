Investors' wealth as measured by market capitalisation dropped by Sh60 billion to Sh2.05 trillion down from Sh2.11 trillion the previous week, a 3.01 per cent decline. \nResearchers at CfC Stanbic Bank said foreign investors are selling off shilling-denominated assets as the currency continue to be battered by the US dollar. \nBy June, the currency had fallen by about 13 per cent hovering towards 103 levels to the greenback.
