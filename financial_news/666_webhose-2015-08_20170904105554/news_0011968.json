The spread between bids and offers on the currency gapped to 2 U.S. cents, while the 8.3 percent intraday drop was the biggest in 30 years.\n“There was a complete lack of bids at that particular time, unlike a lot of the other crosses such as euro and yen,” said Sam Tuck, senior currency strategist at ANZ Bank New Zealand in Auckland. “I think it’s significant in that it reveals direction and the risks for the New Zealand dollar if the global markets deteriorate.”\nThe collapse in the kiwi came just before the U.S. stock market opened sharply lower amid panic about China’s share selloff and an economic slowdown that drove commodities to a 16-year low. While the Australian dollar also fell, its drop wasn’t as severe as the kiwi’s and there wasn’t a similar widening in the bid-ask spread.\nThin Trade “It was notable that the kiwi fell by far the most,” said Imre Speizer, currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in Auckland. “That’s a reflection of the smaller market for kiwi compared to Aussie. Illiquidity in both markets would have played a part.”\nOnly 164 trades took place in the kiwi at 61.50 U.S. cents and below, out of some 81,000 that occurred between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. Wellington time Tuesday and more than 1 million trades over a 24-hour period. The New Zealand dollar was at 64.91 cents at 1:15 p.m. in Wellington, little changed after its 3 percent drop Monday to close at 64.84 cents in New York.\nWhile the slide overnight corrected rapidly, Tuck said the lack of bids in kiwi contrasted with other currencies.\n“The New Zealand dollar is short positioned already and it went shorter, whereas euro is short positioned and it went up, and yen is short positioned and it strengthened,” he said.\nSlowing growth in China suggests weaker demand for commodities such as dairy products, New Zealand’s largest export. That has traders seeing a 98 percent chance the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates next month for the third time this year. If it signals further declines, that could send the local dollar lower still.\nAt the same time, weaker global growth and market volatility could delay an interest-rate increase from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which would tend to put upward pressure on the New Zealand dollar.\n“The Fed outlook is looking a bit shaky, which is slowing down the fall in the kiwi,” said Speizer. He still expects the New Zealand currency to fall to 62 U.S. cents in the next three months.\nAn RBNZ spokesman said the bank had no comment to make on currencies or any other markets at present.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T04:59:43.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
