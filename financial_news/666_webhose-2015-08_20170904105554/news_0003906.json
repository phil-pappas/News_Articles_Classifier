Standard Chartered was up 1.7 percent in a volatile session, slightly lower than before it released results in mid-morning trade. \nThe Asia-focused bank fell sharply before rising as much as 6.5 percent as investors digested the update. The bank halved its dividend in a move that traders said was necessary to bolster its capital position. \nThe FTSE 100 was up 46.73 points, or 0.7 percent, at 6,733.30 by 1402 GMT, 5.5 percent off all-time highs hit in April. \nThe index has been hindered in recent weeks by falls in mining stocks. However, FTSE 350 mining shares rose 3 percent, recovering from near six-year lows. \nWith copper also pinned near six-year lows, hit by concerns over demand from China and the prospect of a U.S. rate rise later this year, traders were not optimistic on the outlook for the sector. \n\"Miners have been hit quite hard, and must've reached a level where some see them as attractively valued,\" said Mark Priest, sales trader at ETX Capital. \n\"But we're not seeing a rebound in metal prices, there is talk the U.S. will raise rates and China is still a concern globally.\" \nAmong fallers, building materials group Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) dropped 2.7 percent after a downgrade from Citi to \"neutral\" from \"buy\". \nIt has dropped around 4 percent over the last two sessions after an update that reported results in line with expectations but gave little clarity on the outlook.
