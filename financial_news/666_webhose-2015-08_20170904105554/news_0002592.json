We expect to close this transaction in the first half of 2016. In connection with the transaction, we also entered into a bridge credit agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMCB\") as the initial lender and as administrative agent for the lenders from time to time who will be a party thereto (the \"Lenders\"), for a principal amount of �875.0 million or approximately $1.3 billion (the \"Bridge Loan\"). The Bridge Loan is dedicated solely for the acquisition of TelecityGroup and to satisfy funds certainty requirements. We intend to obtain permanent financing prior to the closing of the acquisition to replace and terminate the Bridge Loan. \nIn May 2015, as more fully described in Real Estate Investment Trust (\"REIT\") Conversion in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we received a favorable response to the private letter ruling (\"PLR\") request we had submitted to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") in connection with our conversion to a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year commencing January 1, 2015. \nIn April 2015, as more fully described in Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we entered into an amendment (the \"Amendment\") of our Credit Agreement dated December 17, 2014 (the \"Original Credit Agreement\"). The Amendment allowed for the conversion of the outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated principal amount of the term loan facility to an approximately equivalent amount denominated in four foreign currencies. In connection with the execution of the Amendment, on April 30, 2015, we repaid the U.S. dollar-denominated $490.0 million principal balance of the term loan facility and immediately re-borrowed under the term loan facility the aggregate principal amount of CHF 47.8 million, �184.9 million, �92.6 million and �11.9 million, or approximately $490.0 million. Table of Contents \nEquinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix's leading insight and data centers in 33 markets around the world for the safekeeping of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today's information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of June 30, 2015, we operated or had partner International Business Exchange (\"IBX\") data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the Americas region; France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\") region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. \nOur data centers in 33 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a \"marketplace\" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting \"marketplace\" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings. \nHistorically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 15 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of offerings. \nOur utilization rate was approximately 79% as of June 30, 2015 and 77% as of June 30, 2014; however, excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 82% as of June 30, 2015. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. \nStrategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and Table of Contents \nacquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis, and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. \nOur business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. During the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% and 2% of our recurring revenues, respectively. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 34% and 35% of our recurring revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36% and 34% of our recurring revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \nOur non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is recognized when no remaining performance obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. \nOur Americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and related interconnection offerings, and our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure offerings. \nThe largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Table of Contents \nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. \nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense. \nDue to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend that sees the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. \nReal Estate Investment Trust (\"REIT\") Conversion \nIn September 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a plan for Equinix to pursue conversion to a REIT. On December 23, 2014, our Board of Directors formally approved our conversion to a REIT effective on January 1, 2015. We completed the implementation of the REIT conversion in 2014, and as a result we have elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2015. In May 2015, we received a favorable response to the private letter ruling (\"PLR\") we had requested from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") in connection with our conversion to a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The REIT conversion includes almost all of our data center operations in the U.S., Europe and Japan; our data center operations in other jurisdictions will initially be designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\"). \nAs a REIT, we will generally be permitted to deduct from federal income taxes the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distribution on account of adjustments to the conversion rate relating to our outstanding debt securities that are convertible into our common stock, provided the deemed distribution is not a preferential dividend). The income represented by such dividends will not be subject to federal taxation at the entity level but will be taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, are subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\"). We are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally 10 years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to \"built-in\" gains with respect to the assets that we owned on January 1, 2015. Our ability to Table of Contents \nqualify as a REIT will depend upon our compliance with various requirements, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all. \nWe expect to incur a total of approximately $360.0 to $370.0 million in tax liabilities associated with a change in our methods of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes from our prior methods to methods that are more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. These liabilities have been and continue to be generally payable over a four-year period starting in 2012. As of June 30, 2015, we have settled $326.0 million of the estimated federal and state tax liability related to this recapture of depreciation and amortization expenses. The remaining tax liability is expected to be settled by the end of 2015. \nAs a REIT, we also expect to incur approximately $10.0 million annually in compliance costs beginning in 2015. \nOn October 16, 2014, we announced the declaration by our Board of Directors of a special distribution (the \"2014 Special Distribution\") of $416.0 million on our shares of common stock, payable in either common stock or cash to, and at the election of, our stockholders of record as of October 27, 2014 (the \"Record Date\"). Common stockholders elected to receive payment of the 2014 Special Distribution in the form of stock or cash, with the total cash payment to all stockholders limited to no more than 20% of the total distribution. The value of the 2014 Special Distribution, plus the value of the deemed distribution on account of the adjustment to the conversion rate relating to our outstanding 4.75% convertible subordinated notes that was made as a result of the 2014 Special Distribution (the \"2014 Conversion Rate Adjustment\"), exceeded our previously undistributed accumulated earnings and profits attributable to all taxable periods ending prior to January 1, 2015. \nWe intend to declare one or more special distributions in the fourth quarter of 2015 (the \"2015 Special Distributions\"), which would encompass various items of taxable income that we expect to recognize in 2015, including depreciation recapture in respect of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-REIT period and foreign earnings and profits recognized as dividend income. We estimate the aggregate amount of our 2015 Special Distributions, together with the expected value of the deemed distributions associated with any adjustments to the conversion rate of our outstanding 4.75% convertible subordinated notes resulting from the 2015 Special Distributions (the \"2015 Conversion Rate Adjustments\"), will equal approximately $580.0 to $680.0 million. The conversion of additional existing data center operations into the REIT and the addition of new entities into the REIT may also result in future special distributions. \nWe also paid quarterly dividends in 2015 in connection with our conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2015. On February 19, 2015, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.69 per share, which was paid on March 25, 2015 to shareholders of record on March 11, 2015. On May 7, 2015, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.69 per share, which was paid on June 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on May 27, 2015. On July 29, 2015, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.69 per share, which will be paid on September 16, 2015 to shareholders of record on August 26, 2015. \nWe continue to monitor our REIT compliance to maintain our status as a REIT. For this, and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert certain of our data center operations in Canada and additional countries in Asia-Pacific into the REIT in future periods. Table of Contents \nResults of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 Revenues. Our revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Three months ended June 30, % change Constant 2015 % 2014 % Actual currency Americas: Recurring revenues $ 353,605 53 % $ 325,152 54 % 9 % 11 % Non-recurring revenues 17,842 3 % 17,104 3 % 4 % 5 % 371,447 56 % 342,256 57 % 9 % 11 % EMEA: Recurring revenues 160,063 24 % 148,625 25 % 8 % 25 % Non-recurring revenues 13,904 2 % 8,537 1 % 63 % 89 % 173,967 26 % 157,162 26 % 11 % 29 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 113,023 17 % 100,381 16 % 13 % 23 % Non-recurring revenues 7,145 1 % 5,362 1 % 33 % 45 % 120,168 18 % 105,743 17 % 14 % 24 % Total: Recurring revenues 626,691 94 % 574,158 95 % 9 % 17 % Non-recurring revenues 38,891 6 % 31,003 5 % 25 % 35 % $ 665,582 100 % $ 605,161 100 % 10 % 18 % \nAmericas Revenues. Our revenues from the U.S., the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the period, represented approximately 92% and 91%, respectively, of the regional revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) approximately $2.7 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Atlanta, Miami, S�o Paulo and Toronto metro areas, and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real than during the three months ended June 30, 2014, resulting in approximately $9.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Americas revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to average exchange rates of the three months ended June 30, 2014. We expect that our Americas revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in Atlanta, Dallas, Rio de Janeiro and Washington D.C. metro areas, which are expected to open during the remainder of 2015 and 2016. Our estimates of future revenue growth take account of expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers' contracts. \nEMEA Revenues. Our revenues from the U.K., the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 39% and 37%, respectively, of the regional revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $7.5 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam and London metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $28.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Swiss franc, and Euro during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2014. We expect that our EMEA revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Frankfurt metro area, which is expected to open during the remainder of 2015 and 2016. Our estimates of future revenue growth take account of expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers' contracts.
