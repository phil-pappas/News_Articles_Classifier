The Nikkei's 200-day moving average stood at 19,031 as of Thursday market close.\nCommodity-related stocks led the rally after oil prices rocketed overnight and other commodity prices soared, with trading houses Mitsubishi Corp soaring 7.2 percent and Mitsui & Co jumping 6.2 percent.\nToho Zinc jumped 9.2 percent and Sumitomo Metal Mining surged 8.2 percent after prices of copper and zinc scored the biggest one-day gains in over two years.\nData on Thursday showed that the U.S. economy grew 3.7 percent in the second quarter - much faster than the previous estimate of 2.3 percent.\nAlso supporting sentiment is the prospect that a September U.S. rate hike was unlikely, which fuelled optimism that the worse of recent market turmoil may be over.\n\"For now, the majority of investors seem to think that the imminent U.S. rate hike is unlikely,\" said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities. \"But because U.S. yields are rising, there still are some bets that the Fed would raise rates so we shouldn't be overly optimistic.\"\nThe short-selling ratio on Thursday was a record high of 39.8 percent, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nTraders said that the high ratio signals that investors are still on edge.\nExporters rose, with Toyota Motor Corp gaining 3.5 percent, Honda Motor Co advancing 4.8 percent and Panasonic Corp adding 3.9 percent.\nBucking the strength, airline stocks languished on concerns that fuel prices will soon go up after oil prices soared more than 10 percent on Thursday and posted the biggest one-day gain in more than six years.\nJapan Airlines Co dropped 1.2 percent and ANA Holdings Inc declined 0.8 percent.\nFor the week, the Nikkei has dropped 2.1 percent so far.\nThe broader Topix gained 2.3 percent to 19,005.36 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 2.6 percent to 13,852.73.
