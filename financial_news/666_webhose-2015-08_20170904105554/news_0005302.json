This is despite the cedi's continuous depreciation against the US dollar and other major trading currencies. \nThe cedi has been depreciating against the dollar since July 16, the last time the prices of petroleum products were reviewed downwards. \nA dollar as at last week Friday was selling at 3 cedis, 90 pesewas representing a 65 pesewa depreciation of the cedi since July 17. \nHowever the price of crude on the world market for the first time in over six years tumbled to below 42 dollars a barrel before close of last week but has since edge up to 42.50 dollars. \nThe cedi's consistent slide against the dollar is to blame for today's upward review in prices of various petroleum products. The National Petroleum Authority (NPA) would be expected to monitor the pricing formula of the various OMCs keenly to ensure Ghanaian are not exploited. \nSource: Citifmonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:36:07.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
