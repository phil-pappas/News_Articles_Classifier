Treasury's advice was based on a joint agency evaluation of the savings scheme. \nThe Financial Services Council says its own research focused on people who were likely to have a lower standard of living in retirement. \nIt says it found that: Kiwisaver is likely to lead to an increase in net worth and a higher standard of living in retirement for middle and lower income participants; Kiwisaver is less likely to increase the savings of beneficiaries or high wealth individuals; Kiwisaver will lead to more diversified portfolios, shifting investment from housing to sharemarket and fixed-income investments. \nThe association's chief executive officer Peter Neilson says the report also raised concerns that the Government's evidence for cancelling the scheme was too narrow. \nHe says the data was only drawn from the years 2007 to 2010, a period which included the global financial crisis. \n\"A longer sample is required to disentangle the impact of financial market volatility from savings behaviour.\" \nPeter Neilson says one of the benefits of KiwiSaver has been that it has attracted young and low-income savers. \"These groups typically do not participate in formal savings schemes.\" \nHe argues that the Government also failed to properly look at the benefits of diversification. \n\"There is a large concentration risk in financing retirement given the composition of wealth in New Zealand which is highly concentrated in real estate and New Zealand assets.\" \nHe says KiwiSaver will significantly reduce this risk over time as portfolios include more shares and more fixed interest investments. The markets \nUS stock prices have surged, with much of the buying happening late in the trading day. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.95 percent, or 619 points. \nThe broader S&P500 gained 3.95 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq did even better, rising 4.24 percent. \nTo put this in perspective, the S&P500 had lost over 11 percent in the prior six trading days. \nAll 30 companies included in the Dow made gains, with Merck rising 6.4 percent. Apple, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Nike, Visa and ExxonMobil all gained 5 percent. \nThe US markets had opened higher, but unlike yesterday the upwards momentum continued. \nEuropean markets had closed earlier, finishing down. \nThe German DAX lost 1.29 percent. London's FTSE fell 1.68 percent and France's CAC40 1.4 percent. \nThe Shanghai Composite had another disappointing day, falling 1.3 percent yesterday, despite the People's bank of China announcing it would be cutting interest rates again. \nJapan's Nikkei rose 3.2 percent. The NZX50 finished 0.6 percent lower. Australia's ASX200 gained 0.7 percent. The dollar \nThe New Zealand dollar has fallen against the US dollar this morning. \nThe kiwi was trading at 64.31 US cents at 8am (the time when Wall Street closed), compared to around 64.80 yesterday. \nIt was 90.30 Australian cents, compared to 90.89 yesterday morning. It was buying 56.72 euro cents, compared to 56.27 euro cents yesterday. \nThe kiwi was 41.55 pence, compared to 41.30 yesterday. It was 77.10 yen. Air New Zealand profit soars \nCredit has to be given to Air New Zealand for its record profit result. \nThe airline industry is notoriously difficult and plenty of airlines are losing money. So Air New Zealand and its 11,000 staff have good reason to celebrate the record pre-tax profit of $496 million. That is an increase of 49 percent on a year ago. \nAir New Zealand says that was achieved by growing its sales revenue in Asia, the United States and Australasia. There has been a big improvement in sales and revenue across those markets. \nThe airline is also doing a better job of controlling its costs and it got a big lift from lower aviation fuel prices. \nBut there are challenges, including increased competition from airlines like Jetstar. \nThe lower aviation fuel prices are also likely to see more competition on some international routes. \nA big question is the impact of the China slowdown. \nChief executive Christopher Luxon says the answer is to focus on the higher wealth customers, particularly those who have not been to New Zealand before for a holiday. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:32:41.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
