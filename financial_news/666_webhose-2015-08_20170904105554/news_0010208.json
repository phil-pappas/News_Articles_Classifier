But listen up - present stock market turmoil aside - we are in a buoyant economy. Jobs are plentiful. Ask yourself this blunt question: is it time to quit? Experts are quick to offer positive signs that indeed it may be time. But first feast on the numbers from employment law firm Littler Mendelson’s 2015 Executive Employer Survey.

According to the bosses, 85% of supervisors said they had a problem with unhappy workers refusing to budge because of the constipated job market in 2012.

Mind you, don’t view quitting as losing. It’s often the very smartest move. You are your business. Run your career as a business. That may mean cutting loose a dead-end, negative employment situation. Are you in fact prime for quitting?
