My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the investors section of our website. Before we go further I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2. Now turning to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated earnings of $4.2 billion in the second quarter. We are delivering on our investment and operating commitments across our integrated portfolio. The Corporation's results demonstrate sound operations, superior project execution capabilities, and continued discipline in both capital and expense management. Downstream and chemical earnings increased significantly from the second quarter of 2014, driven by higher margins, continued strong demand, and the quality of our product and asset mix. Upstream production volumes of 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day were 3.6% higher compared to a year-ago quarter, and liquids volumes were up nearly 12%. Growth was underpinned by an increased level of new development start-ups over the last 18 months, largely in Africa, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. These results underscore the resilience of our integrated portfolio, and the benefits of our disciplined capital allocation. In the first half of 2015, the Corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $17.9 billion, with free cash flow remaining positive despite challenging market conditions. Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth improved in the second quarter of 2015. The US rebounded after contracting slightly in the first quarter. Europe improved marginally, amid concerns on Greece. China's economy stabilized, while Japan's growth tapered. Crude oil prices partly recovered during the quarter, while natural gas prices declined further. Refining margins continue to strengthen in both the US and Europe. Chemical commodity margins also improved, while specialty margins weakened. Turning now to the financial results, as shown on slide 5. As indicated, second-quarter earnings were $4.2 billion, which represents $1 per share. The Corporation distributed $4.1 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $1 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $8.3 billion which is in line with plans. We have remained focused on structural improvements through capital efficiency, as well as the capture of additional cost savings in a softer market. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.4 billion, and at end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.4 billion, and debt was $33.8 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $5.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing growing asset management program, yielded $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $7.1 billion, and shareholder distributions of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $500 million in the third quarter of 2015. Moving onto slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's second-quarter earnings of $4.2 billion were down $4.6 billion from a year-ago quarter. Lower upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger downstream and chemical results. Gains on asset sales were $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2014, reflecting the absence of the Hong Kong power and Canadian asset divestments in the upstream segment. I'll also note that our corporate effective tax rate was 45%, up 4 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter, and up 12 percentage points sequentially. This higher tax rate reflects the relative mix of income across geographies and tax regimes, as well as a one-time increase in the corporate income tax rate in Alberta, Canada. 1 of 15", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:30:48.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
