This also augurs well for Investa Office, Mirvac, Charter Hall, Abacus Property Goodman, GPT Group and Stockland,\" they said.\nAdvertisement \"More broadly, we expect Australian real estate investment trusts AREITs will increasingly look to capitalise on this strength in asset prices by selling non-core assets into it.\"\nGPT and Stockland will report next week.\nThe improved office conditions in Sydney, were also evidenced by the Mirvac result, where the new development at 200 George Street is well leased. Ernst & Young will be the anchor, with Mirvac also moving in as its new head quarters.\nBut agents say the demand is also strong in the Midtown and southern precincts of the Sydney CBD due to the areas' rental profile and busy atmosphere which distinguish them from the traditional financial core of the CBD.\nCBRE has recently been involved with a series of lease agreements in the CBD's mid-town region, including spaces at 66 Goulburn Street, 2 Park Street and 680 George Street, where Ernst & Young are moving from, which reflect this trend.\nChris Fisher, CBRE director office services, said a notable increase in tenant interest for offices space towards the Midtown and southern precincts has been identified.\n\"The vibrant atmosphere, access to retail amenities, proximity to public transport and availability of quality stock at competitive rental rates is underpinning the increasing tenant interest in the area,\" Mr Fisher said.\n\"World Square for example provides a comprehensive retail experience consisting of fashion, restaurants and bars in the heart of one of the most densely populated areas in Australia. There is always activity in this part of town, whether during the day or after hours.\"\nMr Fisher has also worked on leasing at 66 Goulburn Street to Copyright Agency Credit Investment Ombudsman, OMG and ICity Realty, among others.\n\"With the withdrawal of office stock or threat of withdrawal for residential conversions, tenants are being driven to locate alternative commercial sites, thereby increasing competition and demand in the Midtown and southern Sydney markets.\"\nThe Midtown and southern sectors have further been successful in attracting tenants from suburban locations and the city fringe.\n\"High quality office buildings providing accommodations at competitive rental rates have encouraged the migration of outlying tenants such as Tabcorp and Freelancer to 680 George Street and Unilever to 2 Park Street,\" Mr Fisher said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:39:48.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
