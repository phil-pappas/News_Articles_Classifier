James Alcock by Alan Mitchell They are being billed as the policy challenges that, together, could determine the outcome of the next election: tax reform, refugees, and climate change policy.\nThe potential impact of tax reform is most obvious; the roles of refugee policy and climate change policy are likely to be more subtle.\nAn increase in the GST or any of the other taxes capable of filling the fiscal gap will present a challenge for Prime Minister Tony Abbott even if the Premiers are willing to share the political responsibility.\nFor one thing, a bigger GST would again raise concerns about the fairness of the government's fiscal repair strategy â€“ the issue that enveloped the 2014 budget.\nBut dealing with the fairness issue would bring its own dangers.\nAny package that solves the fairness problem must burn the government's own supporters in an era when prime ministers seem more vulnerable to attack from within their own parties.\nAbbott could be forgiven for cursing the day he opened the door to tax reform and promised to put his decisions to the people in a general election.\nAnd yet, while pushing ahead with tax reform is dangerous, so is pushing ahead without it.\n Retreat from tax reform would leave Abbott with no credible plan to solve the nation's fiscal problem. Yet, for many voters, this was the problem that Abbott was elected to solve.\nWalking away from tax reform could be as dangerous for Abbott as walking away from an emissions trading scheme was for Kevin Rudd.\nThe argument about greenhouse policy currently seems to be going Abbott's way. Australia is on track to meet its 5 per cent carbon reduction target for 2020, despite the predictions of critics of the government's direct action policy.\nBut the pressure now is on Australia to agree to much more ambitious targets beyond 2020, which would expose the key weakness of the Abbott government's emissions purchasing program: its dependence on an already heavily stretched federal budget.\nUnfortunately for Abbott the scientific consensus in favour of action against climate change remains intact, as does the support for action by younger voters, both here and in the United States.\nFor his part, Labor leader Bill Shorten has embraced a 50 per cent renewable energy target. This is appalling policy that, if it were implemented, would impose costs on the Australian economy well in excess of any equivalent carbon tax. But it will win the approval of younger voters, who don't believe Abbott has a credible answer.\nAbbott is a victim of his own rhetoric. He started as opposition leader with a perfectly defensible policy: Australia should not incur the costs of an emission trading scheme in advance of the rest of the world, but should be prepared to review its decision when other nations were taking emissions reduction more seriously.\nAbbott clearly left open the possibility of eventually adopting an emissions trading scheme.\nOnly later, in his assault on Julia Gillard and Rudd, did he demonise the emissions trading scheme.\nHad he stuck to his original line and left Gillard's emissions trading scheme spinning harmlessly in reserve, he might now be in a better position.\nFor example, with countries adopting more ambitious targets, he could have credibly argued that the world was getting serious about greenhouse, and it was time to phase in an emissions trading scheme.\nIn its early stages, the scheme could have raised significant revenue for the budget with the revenue dedicated to greenhouse research.\nAt the same time, he could have modified the Gillard government's scheme to exclude exports but include imports, thereby reducing the burden on the economy: a consumption tax on carbon, if you like.\nThe obviously intended impact of Labor's new refugee policy is to remove asylum-seekers as a reason for blue-collar workers and their families to vote for Abbott. If it achieves that objective, it will play a significant role in the election.\nBut immigration is emerging as a potentially troublesome issue for both major parties.\nThe slowdown in population growth, which began in 2009 and now seems to be steepening, is lowering Australia's potential growth rate. This will combine with the falling terms of trade to make it even harder for the federal government to balance its budget.\nBeyond that, both the economy and the budget face the problem of accelerating demographic change.\nPart of the answer almost certainly will be increased immigration, preferably of educated, middle-class people who can quickly gain a foothold in the economy while posing least threat to blue-collar workers.\nMany of the economic migrants that we are busily towing back to Indonesia sound like just the kind of people we should be looking for.\nLabor is proposing a more generous refugee intake, which might appeal to both major parties as a way of undercutting the people smugglers and easing Australia's medium to longer term growth problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:04:05.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
