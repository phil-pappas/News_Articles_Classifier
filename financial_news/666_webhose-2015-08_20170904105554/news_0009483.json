Alex Ellinghausen by Phillip Coorey Primrose Riordan The Abbott government has rekindled the prospect of paying for its promised income tax cuts by increasing the GST, earning it the support of the NSW government, the ire of South Australia and the condemnation of the federal opposition.\nA week after Treasurer Joe Hockey flagged using spending cuts to fund the return of bracket creep , federal Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said any income tax cuts would be part of a broader reform package, potentially involving an increased GST, that would be taken to the election\n\"That is our objective to take to the next election a tax reform package,\" Senator Cormann told Sky News.\nHe said spending cuts alone would not be enough to fund a tax cut.\nNSW Premier Mike told The Australian Financial Review on Sunday that Senator Cormann's comments were consistent with this position. Jessica Hromas \"Right now we are focused on getting spending growth under control. That gives us some room, but obviously if we want to raise less revenue from one tax source you have to take from other areas and that is the conversation we are currently having.\"\nHe said there was a \"conversation to be had\" with the community on changes to the GST.\n\"The conversation is ongoing I am not going to pre-empt where we are going to land in terms of our reform package that we take to the next election but clearly there is a conversation to be had,\" he said.\n\"We have always said in relation to the GST that we would want to see a broad community consensus and a broad political consensus in the context of any such reform but certainly the conversation so far has been encouraging.\"\n Participants at last week's National Reform Summit were divided over the GST. Despite all present urging that all options should be kept on the table regarding tax reforms, unions and welfare groups were generally opposed to any increase while business groups supported an increase, but more to fund a cut in company income tax rather than personal income tax.\nFormer Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson told the summit it was indisputable that Australia's high reliance on company tax and personal income tax weighed on productivity and hence growth.\nThe NSW Liberal government and South Australian Labor government have been calling for the GST rate to be increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent and for the extra revenue to be spent on the growing cost to state governments of public health.\nTax cuts and welfare increases They also argue there should be compensation in the form of income tax cuts and welfare increases for those earning under $100,000, which is more than 90 per cent of income earners.\nNSW Premier Mike Baird told The Australian Financial Review on Sunday that Senator Cormann's comments were consistent with this position.\n\"I welcome the Finance Minister's comments. They reflect the NSW position â€“ that an increase in GST, with targeted tax cuts to quarantine the majority of families from the effect, is the best way to secure the future of our health services,\" he said\n\"This solution addresses the cumulative deficits looming for the Commonwealth and the states, while improving the overall competitiveness of the Australian economy\".\nBut SA Premier Jay Weatherill was unimpressed, saying Mr Baird's own modelling showed all the extra GST revenue would be needed for health while the Commonwealth should fund the compensation.\n\"We won't be part of increasing the GST to allow the feds to retreat further on health funding so they can fund pre-election tax cuts,\" Mr Weatherill told the Financial Review .\n\"Mr Baird's own figures show that after compensating low-income earners, we will need every cent of a GST increase to fund the health gap.\n\"You can have a fully funded health system or tax cuts. You can't have both.\"\nThe Abbott government has previously said that any increase to the GST would have to be offset by other tax cuts to ensure there was no overall increase in the tax take.\nSenator Cormann noted the amount of tax revenue collected as a proportion of the economy was already budgeted to rise over the next five years to almost 24 per cent and that income tax cuts were already built in to budget revenue assumptions.\nIncreasing the GST without cutting other taxes would exceed that forecast trajectory.\nThe tax-to-GDP ratio is currently just over 22 per cent, well below the 23.9 per cent peak reached during the Howard years.\nThe latest Intergenerational Report predicts that ratio to be reached by the end of this decade by when at least bracket creep would have to be returned.\nLabor, which has yet to release its full tax policy, is also working on the same tax-t-o-GDP trajectory.\n\"The tax-to-GDP ratio is going up under the current government and Australia needs a tax to GDP ratio which is adequate to fund important community services, not a dollar more, not a dollar less,\" shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said in April.\nOn Sunday, however, Mr Bowen said federal Labor remained emphatically opposed to any increase to the rate or base of the GST.\n\"Tony Abbott promised 33 separate times not to change the GST, prior to the last election,\" he said.\n\"Tony Abbott also promised to lower taxes and instead we've got the highest tax burden since the Howard Government and it's rising each and every budget year.\n\"Now Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey have a plan to increase taxes further through the GST.\"\nPreviously, the government has ruled out touching the GST without the approval of every state and territory.\nBut with Victoria and Queensland opposed, the Abbott government has started shifting its language, speaking instead of a broad consensus.\nSources said last week there was a mood to take a GST package to the election and use the promise of extra revenue to pressure the states which were opposed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T18:30:01.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
