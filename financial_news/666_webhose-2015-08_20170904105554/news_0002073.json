The bill must also be ratified by at least 15 states before it becomes law. \nJaitley suggested parliament could be reconvened before the winter session scheduled for late this year. \nHe also launched a scathing attack on the main opposition Congress party, saying it had deliberately hobbled parliament where the ruling BJP (Shanghai: 600578.SS - news ) lacks a majority in the upper house. \n\"It (Congress) seems to have a clear policy of hampering any government that isn't their own,\" Jaitley said. \nCompanies have long complained about India's unwieldy levies which they say deter investment and push up prices of locally made goods. The government says the GST, first proposed by Congress during its decade in power before 2014, would add two percentage points to economic growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T19:06:11.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
