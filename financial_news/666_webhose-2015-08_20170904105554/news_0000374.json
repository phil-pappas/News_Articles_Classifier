If you’re a boomer or GenX’er, the answer is likely “yes,” and interest in environmental sustainability is increasing. That’s why some forward-thinking retirement communities are offering residents everything from greener buildings to energy-efficient lighting to community gardens. And some towns are putting a focus on walkability.\nAccording to AARP surveys, such measures are important to a large segment of older Americans. Its 2014 House and Community Preferences of the 45+ Population survey, for example, found that 61% of respondents valued their community being “easy to walk,” with those over 65 most appreciating walkability. Roughly 30% wanted their community to be near transit with an equal portion wanting to be close to a park.\nTraditional retirement communities, though, have typically been built on the outskirts of town, leaving residents dependent on cars. And their manicured lawns and golf courses usually use plenty of chemical fertilizers and herbicides, not to mention water — a scarce resource in much of the nation.\nA recent New York Times story found that the supply for green retirement communities has not kept up with the demand. But that may be shifting.\nIf environmental concerns or saving money through energy-efficient housing matters to you, here are a few examples of what’s out there:\nLiving lightly One standout is Pennswood Village in Newtown, Pa., a Quaker continuing care retirement community founded in 1980. “Sustainability is one of our six founding Quaker principles,” says marketing director Jennifer Doone. “It was important to our founders, and it continues to be important to our residents and staff.” (The community is open to all, not just Quakers.)\nAmong the steps Pennswood has taken: It constructed a personal care (assisted living) building with LEED gold certification, the second highest level given by the U.S. Green Building Council; it installed a geothermal heating and cooling system for some common buildings; it supported a resident-initiated recycling program; it planted a community garden and, through a partnership with the nearby town, it created an award-winning, multi-million-dollar storm management system under its natural meadow that benefits Pennswood and the surrounding community.\nNew residents Lynne and Todd Waymon, in their 70s, were drawn to Pennswood in part because of its environmental ethic. They immediately joined the residents’ Environmental Concerns Committee, which developed a year’s worth of activities to encourage sustainable practices, such as reducing the use of plastic bags.\nWorking in partnership with the dining services staff, the committee found that residents and staff used 2,250 plastic bags in June, just for carrying leftovers from the cafe. After their campaign began, the number dropped to 1,750 in July.\nLynne Waymon, who had not been an environmental activist before retirement, says she views Pennswood as a microcosm and says she hopes to put the experience she gains there to use at the town or state level. “People get to a certain age and they think, ‘I’m done, I don’t have any influence or say,’ and that’s sad,” she says. “I want people to band together and feel powerful — and know that we can make a difference.”\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.pennswood.org/", "http://www.nextavenue.org/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/06/business/demand-and-expectations-grow-for-green-retirement-communities.html?_r=0"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:27:16.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
