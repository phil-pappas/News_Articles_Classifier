Commodity currencies have bounced as a result.\" \nIn local trade on Tuesday, the market will be closely watching the release of the minutes of the Reserve Bank's August board meeting. \nThe RBA has kept the cash rate unchanged at a record low of two per cent for the past three months and traders will be keen to see if the bank is done with its interest rate cuts. \nCURRENCY SNAPSHOT AT 0700 AEST ON TUESDAY \nOne Australian dollar buys: \n* 73.71 US cents, from 73.77 cents on Monday \n* 91.69 Japanese yen, from 91.77 yen \n* 66.54 euro cents, from 66.47 euro cents \n* 112.15 New Zealand cents, from 112.58 NZ cents \n* 47.30 British pence, from 47.08 pence \n(*Currency closes taken at 1700 AEST previous local session) \nSource: IRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:10:24.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
