If you became the trustee of a self-managed super fund since July 2007 you would have been required to complete the Australian Taxation Office's SMSF Trustee Declaration, and those words are lifted from its opening lines. If you were a trustee of your fund before that time, it is worth reading the declaration in any event.\nThe trustee declaration was introduced to ensure that as trustee of an SMSF you were aware of many of the responsibilities and obligations you take on. And if you have engaged with an advice professional in the running of your fund, it might also help explain why those professionals consistently talk about the important obligations you have.\nThe trustee declaration can also help you assess the quality and capability of the professionals you engage in running your fund. Do they understand all the different rules; can they explain them to you in simple terms; can they explain which of the obligations do and don't apply to you.\nIt is also important to ensure you don't get too caught up in following the words of the declaration too closely and missing anything else important. As an example, if you were to think about who the government-appointed regulator for SMSFs is, you would be correct in thinking the answer is the ATO. However, there are other regulatory bodies who publish information that is equally relevant for SMSF trustees.\nIn late July, the Australian Investments & Securities Commission published a report and two information sheets on SMSFs. While ASIC's focus was primarily in relation to advice provided to SMSFs by financial advisers, the information provided is of equal importance to all trustees.\nPoints to consider Information sheet 205 (IS205) discusses a number of the key risks that advisers should be considering and disclosing when giving SMSF advice. Given it is a consideration of risks, these points should be considered by all SMSF trustees regardless of whether or not you have chosen to seek professional advice.\nBy choosing to have an SMSF, you have essentially declared your intent to be independent, to go it alone and not rely on a professional trustee to manage your retirement funds. But in doing so, you need to be aware of what you are missing out on.\nAs an example, do you know as an SMSF trustee you have essentially elected to forego access to statutory compensation opportunities in the event of theft or fraud? This compensation is available to the non-SMSF market and can help trustees (and therefore members) to offset or reduce potential losses that may arise from theft or fraud.\nOf course, we don't expect to see theft or fraud taking place, and by seeking the appropriate advice you can mitigate the chances. But you need to be aware that this form of compensation is not available. You have the ability to try to seek damages but need to go it alone, and it can be a costly exercise.\nSimilarly, under the SMSF structure trustees don't have access to some complaints mechanisms. Of most note here is the lack of access to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT). This perhaps is not as big an issue when you first look at it. Essentially, a major purpose of the SCT is to give members an avenue of complaint when they are not happy with the decisions made or actions taken by the trustee of their super fund.\nWhen you are in an SMSF you are both a member and a trustee, so it is unlikely that you have justifiable reasons to complain to someone else about a decision you have made over your own investments. What it does highlight, however, is the need to really consider who else you have in your fund and how decisions are made. As a trustee you have the right (if not obligation) to be involved in all decisions, and leaving it to someone else (that is, another trustee of the fund) who you think has the expertise won't be an excuse if something goes wrong.\nMore importantly, if you are the only member of the fund you may have another person also acting as a trustee of your fund – and this is a requirement if you have individual trustees rather than a corporate trustee. It's important to think about who that other trustee is, and will they act in accordance with your wishes.\nAppropriately run, you can enjoy the independence of managing your own retirement savings through an SMSF, and having that independence doesn't mean you shouldn't seek and rely on appropriately skilled professionals to help. But as the ATO Trustee Declarations makes clear at the very beginning, ultimately you have responsibilities and they should be taken seriously.\nBryan Ashenden is senior manager, advice strategies and knowledge at BT Financial Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:00:31.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
