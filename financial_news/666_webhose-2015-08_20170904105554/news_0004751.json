Steven Siewert Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Tom Dawkins knew technology could play a powerful role in changing the world for the better but almost ruined his start-up's chances when a secretive launch strategy backfired and stunted its growth for years.\nDawkins had founded a series of not-for-profit organisations ranging from co-working spaces to youth media sites before launching StartSomeGood, a crowdfunding site for backing social action, four years ago.\nHowever the nightmare scenario for all start-ups raised its head right at crunch time: a rival with the same big idea.\n\"I had realised how fundamentally haphazard and tokenistic most social action was, and how a lot was bound up in this elitest myth about backing leaders,\" Dawkins tells Fairfax Media.\n\"But real social change won't be a small hegemonic group causing change; it'll be a gloriously diverse and chaotic mess of people and projects. We're just bad at backing those.\"\nSo when former colleague Alex Budak approached him for advice about the site that would become StartSomeGood, it didn't take long for Dawkins to join as a co-founder and begin to spend every spare hour on it.\nTerrible timing It was 2011 and crowdfunding start-up Kickstarter was capturing headlines and making millions. The pair was confident there was space for a similar platform for not-for-profit organisations.\n They spent six months building the site, grooming 10 social organisations to be their first fundraising projects and crafting a launch strategy. They identified news sites, blogs and individual influencers who could put their project in front of millions.\nUnfortunately for StartSomeGood, there was another company, called 33needs, in the final secretive stage of development, which was heart-breakingly similar.\nIt had an identical \"Kickstarter for social change\" and it launched a week before Dawkins' did.\n\"We were so excited about this idea that we had kept it as quiet as possible, so no one else would launch one. We knew making a big splash early was critical to gathering momentum,\" Dawkins says.\nWhile 33needs was more of an equity sharing club than a crowdfunding platform, it didn't matter: it took the internet and social activist communities by storm. StartSomeGood were starved of the headlines they had expected, and needed.\n\"33needs didn't last, but it was around just long enough to destroy us. I felt like we had been kicked in the guts. It was so frustrating it drove me kind of crazy,\" Dawkins says.\nCarry on regardless With thousands invested and 10organisations nervously preparing to launch their fundraising campaigns on the site, StartSomeGood had to launch as planned.\n\"We all had to keep going. We felt trapped and I felt tripped up for months,\" Dawkins says.\nIt took Budak and Dawkins two years and several site redesigns to build the company to where they hoped it would be a few months after their launch.\nDawkins continued to work a full-time social media management job in San Francisco and diverted a large chunk of his salary to pay Budak, who was working full time on StartSomeGood.\nDespite being in the start-up capital in the world, Dawkins was working on his own company in the evenings and sneaking out of the office to take phone calls. With only a few months left before his work visa expired, he decided to quit his job and use the remaining weeks fully focused on StartSomeGood.\nDawkins forfeited his working visa and lost his health insurance. Stressed but hopeful, he headed to South America for a two weeks to re-enter the United States on a tourist visa and returned to find their newly precarious lifestyle was going to be even shorter than he imagined.\nHeading back Down Under \"I came home and my wife told me she was pregnant, which was fantastic but we knew we had to face facts, pack up and head home to Australia.\"\nDespite being reluctant to move at first, Dawkins says operating in a smaller environment in Australia has enabled StartSomeGood to grow faster than they had hoped.\nThey have brought in $6 million for the more than 500 projects successfully funded through the site as well as signing a partnership with ING Direct and securing $400,000 in venture capital investment from Trimantium Capital.\n\"All the most positive things have happened because of people approaching us because of our brand, which would have taken 10 years to grow in the US,\" Dawkins says.\n\"We never got that hockey stick growth we hoped for at first but after a few years of wobbling, we're now definitely heading up and up.\"\nThis is part of an ongoing series of start-up War Stories.
