Analysts on average expected profit to be 34.59 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data. \nNet sales fell 6 percent to 601.8 billion rupees. \nStrong sales of its Jaguar Land Rover cars, especially in China, have long propped up profits at Tata Motors, which has been struggling with sluggish demand for its cars in the last couple of years in India due to an economic downturn. \nJaguar Land Rover's sales in China fell by a third to 21,920 vehicles during the April-June quarter, pulling down total sales at the luxury carmaker by 1 percent to 114,905. Sales in Europe rose 28 percent to 28,878 vehicles. \nGlobal automakers including BMW (Swiss: BMW.SW - news ) , General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co (NYSE: F - news ) have cut prices on their Chinese models in recent months to combat weak sales growth. \nChina's automakers association has cut its growth forecast in the country with sales expected to rise by 3 percent in 2015, down from 7 percent expected earlier, as a major slump in the country's stock market depresses sales. \nOperating profits at Jaguar Land Rover fell by a quarter to 821 million pounds ($1.27 billion) and revenues fell 7 percent to 5 billion pounds, the company said in a statement. \n($1 = 63.8125 Indian rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:25:17.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
