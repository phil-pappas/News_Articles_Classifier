In the 12-months through July, the CPI climbed 0.2 percent. \nIt was the second month the annual CPI increased after plunging crude oil prices pushed it into negative terrain in January. \nSigns of an ebb in the disinflationary trend, combined with a tightening labor market and strengthening housing sector could give the Federal Reserve confidence that inflation will eventually rise toward its 2 percent target. \nThe U.S. central is expected to raise its short-term interest rate next month. But given that inflation will likely remain tame because of a strong dollar, renewed weakness in oil and commodity prices, as well as China's devaluation of the yuan, the pace of monetary policy tightening is likely to be gradual. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.2 percent from June and gaining 0.2 percent from a year ago. \nThe so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, ticked up 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in June. Shelter, which recorded its biggest increase in nearly 8-1/2 years, was the main contributor to last month's rise in the core CPI. \nIn the 12 months through July, the core CPI increased 1.8 percent. It was the fourth time in five months that the 12-month change was 1.8 percent. \nLast month, gasoline prices rose 0.9 percent after rising 3.4 percent in June. Food prices gained 0.2 percent, slowing from a 0.3 percent increase in June as the impact of the bird flu on egg prices eases. \nEgg prices rose only 3.3 percent after a June's 18.3 percent surge, which had been the biggest gain since August 1973. The index for shelter increased 0.4 percent, the largest increase since February 2007, after advancing 0.3 percent in June. Declining homeownership and a rental vacancy rate near a 22-year low is driving rents higher. \nThere were increases in the cost of medical care and apparel, which had declined for three straight months. However, airline fares fell 5.6 percent, the largest decline since December 1995. Prices for used cars and trucks and household \nfurnishings and new motor vehicles fell. \n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:09:53.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
