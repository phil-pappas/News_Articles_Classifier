The Bloomberg Pay Index, a ranking of the 200 highest-paid US executives, tracks the current value of an executive's most-recent awarded compensation package. Awarded pay includes salary, cash bonuses and stock awards received during the fiscal year.\nNo executive lost more than Nick Woodman. The GoPro founder and chief executive officer, who is No 1 on the index, was granted pay in 2014 that lost 48.1mn in the rout. Anthony Bates, president of the San Mateo, California-based camera-maker and No 3 on the index, saw his compensation decline 25.3mn. Michael Fries, the CEO of Liberty Global, lost 16.1mn. He's No 2 in the ranking.\nThree of the 10 highest-paid executives, including Woodman, are billionaires who have substantial fortunes tied to their companies beyond what they were paid last year. Woodman's net worth had declined 402mn to 2.1bn through Monday, compared to August 17. Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk's fortune fell 1.4bn to 11.5bn and Oracle Corp founder Larry Ellison lost 3.8bn of his net worth, which declined to 39.9bn during the period, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nAwarded pay tracks what a compensation committee intended to pay an executive, not what was reported in a company's summary compensation table. It also accounts for changes in the value of pensions, and includes perks such as club dues and personal use of corporate jets. Awarded pay on the Bloomberg Pay Index is priced as of a company's fiscal year-end and is updated daily as of a company's most-recent closing price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:47:36.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
