Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The Labor Party and union movement will keep pressing for Dyson Heydon's removal from the trade union royal commission but also believe that his staying put is the best option from a political perspective because it will make it easier to discredit his final report.\nJustice Heydon a former High Court judge, is resisting calls from Labor, the unions, the Greens and some independents to step aside as commissioner following revelations last week that he had been booked to deliver the annual Sir Garfield Barwick address , an event which doubled as a NSW Liberal Party fundraiser.\nThe ACTU sought legal advice last week about either applying to the commission to have Justice Heydon stood down or resorting to legal action. Neither are likely to be pursued.\nThe first would be likely to fail while the risk with court action was the labour movement might lose and, along with it, its claim the justice was politically biased.\nSenior sources inside the Labor Party and the labour movement accept that Tony Abbott is unlikely to force Justice Heydon out. From a political standpoint it is more advantageous that he stays, putting pressure on Mr Abbott and further discrediting the commission's findings.\nShadow employment minister Brendan O'Connor told ABC's Insiders program on Sunday that Justice Heydon should disqualify himself because of an \"apparent conflict of interest\" relating to his \"direct association with the Liberal Party\".\nMr O'Connor said there was \"evidence of bias\" and \"any affected parties before the commission have to look at their rights here\" including possible legal action by unions against the royal commission and consideration of whether the commission had competence to continue.\n\"The proceedings to date are tainted entirely from beginning to end,\" Mr O'Connor said.\n Cross-examination Mr O'Connor said there were questions over the conduct of the commission, including inconsistent use of cross-examination and information being released to the media before it was given to affected parties.\nHe said testimony before the commission was uncontested because the commission refused to allow cross-examination, and allegations before it were later used as facts by politicians in question time.\nAllegations of serious misconduct or criminal misconduct were better left in the hands of bodies with coercive powers such as the Australian Crime Commission.\nAttorney-General George Brandis said there had been a campaign designed to smear Mr Heydon, \"a person who frankly doesn't deserve it\".\nHe said it would be dangerous if the matter ended up in the courts.\n\"I think we've seen that in America for some years, I think it's a bad development,\" he told Sky News.\n\"I think it's a bad development. I think that we should keep political disputes in the Parliament and leave the courts to resolve legitimate, bona fide legal disputes.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-16T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:57:09.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
