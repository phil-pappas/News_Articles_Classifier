Katie Orlinksy by Chris Mooney The village of Nenana, with a population of 600 and situated an hour's drive outside of Alaska's northernmost city of Fairbanks, has long been dependent on the Tanana River. Along the banks, huge fish wheels use the river's flow to catch salmon. On a July day, a barge was loaded up with supplies, perhaps to transport to even more remote communities – atop the stack of bulk goods was an all-terrain vehicle.\nEven when it's frozen, the residents use the river to hunt, travelling by dog sled or snowmobile. \"I have to use the river to trap beaver in the wintertime,\" says Victor Lord, the second chief of the Nenana tribe, which runs the town alongside a city government. \"It's a third highway for us.\"\nAnd one day, maybe, the river will serve as a kind of power line, too. This summer, researchers with the Alaska Centre for Energy and Power, a research institute at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, have come here with Oceana Energy, a small private energy firm, to test a \"hydrokinetic\" turbine that draws energy from the flow of the river. From a barge that's held in the water by a three-ton anchor, they lower the white, doughnut-shaped device (with short blades on the inside and out) through a moon door – and it starts to turn when water hits it. It kicks up a spray – at least until the turbine is submerged.\nAnticipation is high – renewable energy from rivers holds promise beyond traditional sources such as wind and solar, even if it's far from clear whether the current technology will rise above competition or succeed in the marketplace.\n\"Everybody uses the analogy of where wind was 15 years ago,\" the University of Alaska's Jeremy Kasper, who is leading the research at Nenana, says of river power. \"Everybody's trying to come up with a good design and drive down the cost of production.\"\nHarsh conditions sparks creative solutions Alaska, a vast landmass with harsh winters and many remote native towns and villages facing dramatic electricity costs, has become an important and unique innovator in renewable energy. The implications extend far beyond the state. From Africa to small Pacific island chains, successfully powering grid-less, remote or underdeveloped communities with renewable energy, and easing their reliance on fossil fuels, is one of the biggest energy challenges of the century.\n\"We prove up the technology, we prove up the economics, and then maybe it has application in Africa or the Canadian Arctic,\" says Gene Therriault, director of policy and outreach at the Alaska Energy Authority, the state agency that has put over $1 million into the testing of the Oceana Energy turbine at the Tanana River test site.\n President Barack Obama will visit Alaska this month. And while his full itinerary hasn't been disclosed, the president has said that he'll \"be the first American president to visit the Alaskan Arctic, where our fellow Americans have already seen their communities devastated by melting ice and rising oceans\".\nIn Kivalina, for instance, far to the north-west of Nenana and vastly more remote, 400 people live on a Chukchi Sea barrier island that is hammered by storms and intense erosion, threats accelerated by declining sea ice offshore.\nBut as the president may see if he visits one of these communities, a changing climate isn't their only challenge. Additional problems include sanitation (Kivalina lacks running water in most of its buildings) and what's primarily driving energy innovation in the state: dramatically high energy costs.\nFor a long time, Alaska's rural communities, living off the grid and in many cases not accessible by road, have overwhelmingly turned to diesel generators for power – and, when temperatures drop well below zero – simply to ensure safety. But transporting their fuel – by barge like the one moored at Nenana or by plane – is very expensive.\nSteep costs in remote villages Diesel fuel and heating fuel costs in remote villages can be as much as $10 per gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Alaskans overall paid an average price of 18.12¢ per kilowatt hour of electricity in 2013, according to federal data – second only to New York and Hawaii. In some remote villages, costs can be more than 40¢ per kilowatt hour – and that's after contributions from a state program designed to equalise energy costs.\nEven though Alaska is traditionally known as an oil state, \"remember that we're paying more for hydrocarbon energy than anybody,\" says Mead Treadwell​, a former lieutenant governor. \"The last thing people who live in a place known for cold, dark and distance need is higher energy prices.\"\nClearly, renewable energy would be a great benefit to Alaska's small villages, but there are also unique hurdles to deploying it. For one thing, renewable power solutions that are coming on strong in the lower 48 states don't necessarily work as well up here.\nSolar, for instance, is less useful in the long dark night of the northern winter. And that's when electricity costs, due to home heating, are highest. Large batteries are also problematic, says Brent Sheets, of the university's Alaska Centre for Energy and Power, which is operating the Tanana River test site. When they are past their working life, they can become a form of bulk waste, difficult and expensive to transport back and dispose of safely.\nBut Alaska has experimented successfully with microgrids – small electric distribution systems that can operate connected to or apart from a larger grid. A microgrid, for example, could be set up to provide power to a small community, an island or a military installation. Precisely because of its many remote villages and its weather extremes, Alaska hosts more than 200 of them, more than any other state, according to Navigant Research.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:56:37.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
