Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have until September 21, 2015 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against IDI, Inc. (NYSE MKT:IDI) if they purchased the Company’s securities between April 30, 2015 and July 21, 2015, inclusive (the “Class Period”).

About the Lawsuit IDI and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws. On July 21, 2015, Seeking Alpha published an article claiming that IDI’s Chairman Michael Brauser has a “long track record of fraud lawsuits, bankruptcy and shareholder wipeouts,” including suits by Equifax accusing him of “fictitious receivables” and by Softbank accusing him of “various frauds.” The article further claims that IDI faces a credible lawsuit from Transunion that, if IDI loses, will cripple the Company’s technology and business. On this news, the price of IDI’s shares plummeted by 46%. About Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC To learn more about KSF, whose partners include the Former Louisiana Attorney General, Charles C.
