This has lifted bank profits in recent years. However, rising bad debts would see bank profits reduced.\nIn a third quarter market update on asset quality and capital on Monday morning, Westpac said in the manufacturing and utilities sectors, a rise in stressed loans was \"isolated to a small number of names\", while in the retail bank a small tick-up in stressed loans \"aligns with the small increase in delinquencies\".\nThe higher delinquencies were seen in Western Australia and Victoria, Westpac said, which helped push up mortgage 90+ days delinquencies by 2 basis points to 49 basis points. Meanwhile, car loan 90+ days delinquencies were \"a little higher\".\nThe market had few concerns about the update: Westpac's shares rose 1.7 per cent to $31.86 in the first two hours after the release of the update.\nFairfax Media reported on Monday that Westpac is tightening credit policies for interest-only mortgages, an area where financial regulators have raised concerns about bank underwriting standards .\nThe banking bad debt cycle came into focus earlier this month, when ANZ increased provisions for bad debts to $366 million, up 32 per cent compared to the previous three-month period. ANZ chief executive Mike Smith told the bank's staff earlier this month this rise in provisions was not because more individual customers were falling behind but due to \"collective provisions\", which can indicate a general decline in loan quality. \"Although we need to work closely with our customers in this environment, our sense is we are bumping along the bottom of the credit cycle rather than seeing any fundamental shift,\" he said.\nMr Smith will provide a briefing to the market on Tuesday morning on the ANZ's operations for the nine months to June 30.\n Reports from other banks also suggest credit quality remains healthy despite concern about lacklustre economic growth. In its trading update earlier this month, National Australia Bank said charges for bad and doubtful debts fell 15 per cent to $193 million in the quarter.\nLast week, Commonwealth Bank of Australia said it had seen a small up-tick in bad debts in its personal lending book in Western Australia and Queensland, which was a function of unemployment in some areas, but across the bank, impairments remained at historic lows.\nWestpac said on Monday its stressed assets were down by $320 million or 3 per cent, to $9.85 billion. Australian credit card 90+ days delinquencies down 6bps, stress in the commercial property portfolio continued to reduce, and stress in mining was down with less than 1 per cent of exposures in default. Fewer loans are on Westpac's watch-list for substandard debt. The banks made no change to economic overlays.\nWestpac said its common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 9 per cent, which was up from 8.3 per cent a week earlier. Since May, all the big four banks have lifted capital. CBA is raising $5 billion in a rights issue, ANZ is raising $3 billion, NAB raised $5.5 billion in May while Westpac raised $2 billion through its dividend reinvestment plan also in May.\nOnce the changes to mortgage risk weights are stripped out from the reported CET1s, Deutsche Bank analyst Andrew Triggs said last week Westpac has the lowest CET1 of the big four, at 8.5 per cent, while CBA has the highest at 9.5 per cent (with ANZ and NAB both at 9.2 per cent). While there was some speculation in the market last week that Westpac might be forced to lift capital even higher, it is understood it feels no immediate pressure to add to the $2 billion raised in May.\nRetail shareholders consider CBA, ANZ offers Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ANZ Banking Group also made statements to the ASX on Monday morning relating to thier capital raisings.\nCBA said the institutional component of its $5 billion rights issue had ben completed, raising around $2.1 billion and attracting \"strong demand\" with around 90 per cent of entitlements being exercised by eligible institutional shareholders. Those that did not exercise their rights received $6.50 in cash for each entitlement sold in the institutional bookbuild. The retail component will open next Monday and is expected to raise around $3 billion.\nCBA shares have come back on the market, opening at $80.50, 1.5 per cent below their adjusted last closing price of $81.77 (to take into account the dilution of the raising). The stock climbed during the morning session to $81.19 by midday, which is down 0.7 per cent from the last adjusted close.\nMeanwhile, ANZ said on Monday applications for its share purchase plan offer to raise $500 million (part of its $3 billion raising) will open next Monday with eligible shareholders able to purchase up to $15,000 worth of stock. ANZ said it reserves the right to scale back applications if total demand exceeds $500 million.\nANZ continues to defend its decision to conduct its institutional raising via a placement, which dilutes retail shareholders. Mr Smith said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange:\n\"We considered all the options available and determined that, on balance, a share purchase plan in conjunction with our institutional placement supports our loyal retail shareholders and completes the capital raising in a fair, timely and efficient way.\n\"Most of our retail shareholders will be able to apply for more shares through the share purchase plan offer than under a pro-rata rights issue, while many of our largest retail shareholders would have already had access to placement shares through their brokers.\"\nANZ shares were up 0.7 per cent at $29.50 at midday, but still 9.5 per cent below the $32.58 close before its capital raising was announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:09:43.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
