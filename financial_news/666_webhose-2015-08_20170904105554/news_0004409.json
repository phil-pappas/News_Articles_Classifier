Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Employment surged last month by almost four times what was expected, but not enough to stop the jobless rate matching the highest level in almost 13 years after a surge in the number of people entering the workforce.\nIn a labour force report that left financial market traders confused - the dollar whipsawed after the result - the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated that 38,500 jobs were created in the month.\nThe unemployment rate bounced to 6.3 per cent from 6.1 per cent in June, which was revised up from 6 per cent, with the proportion of people either in jobs or looking for work climbing to 65.1 per cent from 64.8 per cent.\nWhile the headline jobless rate has again deteriorated, many analysts - including at the Reserve Bank of Australia - will be buoyed by the strong surge in employment, which has grown more than 2 per cent over the past year.\nThe Australian dollar initially jumped after the ABS report from around US73.52¢ to US73.93¢ before falling to US73.35¢.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-08-06T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:10:54.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
