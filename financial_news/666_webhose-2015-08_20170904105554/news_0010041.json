Banks charge this to those borrowing 80 per cent or more. The only way to avoid it is by having a deposit of 20 per cent plus or a parental guarantor.\nOffset Account\nA transaction account linked to your loan. The credit balance of your transaction is offset daily against your outstanding loan balance, reducing the interest payable. This can be handy as it allows you to take money in and out, while also limiting the interest you have to pay. Watch out for loans that charge withdrawal fees.\nFirst Home Owners Grant\nThe State Government currently offers a $10,000 grant for first home builders and a $3000 grant for existing properties. However, before the end of the year they will cut the $10,000 grant to $7000 and scrap the $3000 grant. If you buy now, you are still eligible.\nStamp Duty\nBuyers pay the State Government when they purchase land or a property. First home buyers are exempt if they purchase a house for less than $430,000.\nHome Loan Application Fee\nA bank fee when you apply for a home loan that varies between banks.\nClick here to download the full guide\nRead More\nOriginally published as First-time buyers borrow more in WA ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-wa-borrows-more-for-first-homes-than-any-other-state/story-fndbaln9-1227503350229?sv=31f334a4162f55da8a633f53a4f2c49a&title=First-time+buyers+borrow+more+in+WA", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-wa-borrows-more-for-first-homes-than-any-other-state/story-fndbaln9-1227503350229?sv=31f334a4162f55da8a633f53a4f2c49a", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=First-time+buyers+borrow+more+in+WA&c=WA+first+home+buyers+are+among+the+nation%26%238217%3Bs+biggest+borrowers%2C+with+nearly+60+per+cent+of+buyers+borrowing+more+than+90+per+cent+of+the+cost+of+their+home.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-wa-borrows-more-for-first-homes-than-any-other-state/story-fndbaln9-1227503350229?sv=31f334a4162f55da8a633f53a4f2c49a", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/realestate/news/first-home-buyers-wa-borrows-more-for-first-homes-than-any-other-state/story-fnhlgriw-1227503350229", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-wa-borrows-more-for-first-homes-than-any-other-state/story-fndbaln9-1227503350229?sv=31f334a4162f55da8a633f53a4f2c49a&title=First-time+buyers+borrow+more+in+WA", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-wa-borrows-more-for-first-homes-than-any-other-state/story-fndbaln9-1227503350229?sv=31f334a4162f55da8a633f53a4f2c49a", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-wa-borrows-more-for-first-homes-than-any-other-state/story-fndbaln9-1227503350229?sv=31f334a4162f55da8a633f53a4f2c49a&h=First-time+buyers+borrow+more+in+WA", "http://media.perthnow.com.au/fe/2015/pdf/FirstHomeBuyer_MegaGuide.pdf"], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:44:56.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
