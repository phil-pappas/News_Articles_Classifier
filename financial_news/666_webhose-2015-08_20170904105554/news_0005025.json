We often hear people say that they already have a savings account and don't need another and there's no recognition of a TFSA season like there is an RRSP season. The fact of the matter is there are a lot of other uses of a TFSA that most people are not aware of.\"\nFor example, it can be used for cash flow sharing. A higher income spouse could gift money to a lower income spouse who could contribute the money to their TFSA and grow that money over time tax free.\nYou could use a TFSA to save and grow money and then take it out and use it to contribute to a registered charity (and receive a charitable donation tax credit) or to supplement savings in a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) for your children's education.\nBecause you can withdraw contributions and then put them back into the account in the following year TFSAs can be used like a revolving line of credit and a way to save and grow money and then use it to pay down debt.\nThe survey also asked Canadians about their attitudes toward the TFSA and found that among those who do not have one 64 per cent said it was because they don't have enough money to invest and 26 per cent said they don't know enough about them.\n\"Canadians aren't motivated to know all the details of the TFSA program and that's where the help of a financial adviser can be invaluable to ensure people are truly maximizing the opportunity to invest and grow their savings,\" Bezaire says. \"Advisers can help explain how TFSAs work and also provide strategies to maximize investments.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:21:14.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
