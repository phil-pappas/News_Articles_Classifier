Mike Duffy .\nNovak, a long-time aide to Harper, was promoted to chief of staff after Nigel Wright left the post as part of the fallout of Canadians learning he had personally given Duffy the $90,172 needed to reimburse inappropriate living expenses in 2013.\n“These are the actions of Mr. Duffy and Mr. Wright. You hold people responsible for their own actions. You certainly don’t hold subordinates responsible for the actions of their superiors. These are the two people responsible and they are being held accountable,” Harper said during a campaign stop in Hay River, N.W.T., Friday.\nEmails released this week as evidence presented at the trial of Duffy show that Novak was kept in the loop on much of the plan to have Duffy — then a high-profile member of the Conservative caucus — tell Canadians he would repay the money and blame the mistake on ambiguous expense forms.\nDuffy has pleaded not guilty to 31 charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust and the trial is ongoing. Wright was investigated by the RCMP but never charged.\nOne email showed Novak, who was deputy chief of staff at the time, was copied on a message that made it clear it was Wright, not Duffy, who intended to pay the money.\nConservative campaign spokesman Kory Teneycke told reporters Thursday that Novak never saw that particular email sharing details of the plan.\nHarper rejected the premise of questions that Novak had been involved in deceiving the public, or hiding the truth of the situation from Harper.\n“The reality is that there are two people who are responsible: his superior, Mr. Wright, and Mr. Duffy. They are being held accountable for their actions,” Harper said Friday.\nHarper was also reminded by a reporter that even after the truth of Wright’s involvement had been made public, cabinet ministers continued to say in the House of Commons that Wright was the only person who knew and there were no documents regarding the transaction.\n“Why did you allow that to continue when you knew that it wasn’t the truth (and) that there were more people involved?” Harper was asked.\n“We were all told that Mr. Duffy had repaid his expenses. Mr. Duffy said that on national television, he had borrowed money from the bank, etc.” Harper said, referring to a statement Duffy had provided to CTV News as it was investigating the story that it was in fact Wright who had paid.\n“That is what we all understood to be the truth. That is what the vast majority of, that’s not only what the entire caucus thought, and I thought, that’s what the vast majority of our staff also believed was the case,” Harper said.\n“When I found out that was not the truth, we made that very clear to the Canadian public. There are two people responsible for this. They are, obviously, Mr. Duffy himself and Mr. Wright. And those are the people being held responsible and accountable,” said Harper.\nMore on thestar.com\nDrug-maker seeking approval for female libido pill once ran afoul of FDA rules\nSmallest visible exoplanet is still twice as big as Jupiter", "external_links": ["http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1428602&ThemeId=16875", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T20:45:28.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
