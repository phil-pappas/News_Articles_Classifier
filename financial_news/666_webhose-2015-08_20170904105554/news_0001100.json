In 2014, it sold over 7 million vouchers with redemption rate of 97 per cent among its customers, it said. \nOver one lakh merchant locations were featured in the year with a merchant retention rate of over 70 per cent. \nMobile has been a key driver accounting for over 40 per cent of Groupon India's business, up from less than 10 per cent a year ago. \nAnkur Warikoo, chief executive of Groupon India, will now hold the position of chief executive and founder of 'nearbuy'. \n\"The local commerce market in India is growing at a never-seen-before pace, and mobile penetration is facilitating that,\" said Warikoo. \nThe 'nearbuy' leadership team will have six co-founders: Ankur Warikoo, Sumeet Kapur as the chief financial officer, Snehesh Mitra as the chief technology officer, Sachin Kapur as the chief marketing officer, Ankur Sarawagi as the chief executive of travel and products, and Ravi Shankar as chief executive of local commerce. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T19:28:41.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
