There is in fact a big difference between college rankings and ratings, as a proponent of the latter explained to me. If Edward \"Ted\" Fiske didn't create the college guidebook genre 31 years ago, he may well have perfected it. The Fiske Guide to Colleges 2016 started off as The New York Times Selective Guide to Colleges when he was Education Editor of the Times. Because Ted has been looking at this landscape for decades, I asked him some questions. Along the way, he explained why ratings are better than rankings.Q: Your headmaster urged you to attend a top Ivy League school, but you chose Wesleyan instead. Why did you do that, and which young people would you advise to do the same today?A: I wanted a really good small liberal arts college in New England because I wanted to be able to do a wide range of things without sacrificing academics. I knew that if I went to a larger school, I would have to focus on one or two activities. As it turned out, I played varsity soccer and squash as well as rugby, edited the newspaper, sang in the glee club and joined a fraternity. Whether or not there were graduate students around never really occurred to me, but I do think there is wisdom in being at a place where what you are (i.e. an undergraduate) is the major focus. That’s certainly the case at liberal arts colleges. Q: What do you make of the current emphasis on Return On Investment (ROI), especially as it relates to career-oriented majors at the undergraduate level by contrast to the liberal arts?A: The best return on investment is an education that is going to prepare you for a career, not for the worst job you’ll ever have—which is to say your first job out of college. The best investment is in developing thinking and skills that are going to prepare you for jobs that you cannot even conceive of when you first go to work. Most people are not only going to change jobs but change careers. Preparing for a technical job that won’t continue to exist is not good return on investment. You need the skills to adapt to different situations. I remember conversations comparing liberal arts and technical education with CEOs of major corporations. They want liberal arts graduates with broad general educations, whom they will later train. They will also admit, however, that they sometimes have trouble getting this message through to their people who do their hiring, which they find frustrating.One young liberal arts graduate I know went for an interview at a top financial services firm, where the interviewer asked why he should be hired when he had no specific financial services training. He responded that he’d looked at the biographies of the senior managers of the firm, seen that everyone at that level had a liberal arts education, and said that if it was good enough for them, he believed it would be good enough for him. He was hired and has done well.Q: What has changed the most since you first started the Guide three decades ago, and how would you advise families to handle it?A: The most obvious change is the growing cost, which is out of control not only at private schools but public universities as well. I’m not a financial expert so I have don’t have a lot of wise things to say about this. I’m sure people at Forbes have a lot more to suggest on this point. Students come away with a lot more debt than they used to, which is an awful problem.Q: How have the content of the narratives in the Fiske Guide changed since you started?A: Starting maybe 15-20 years ago there was growing concern about physical safety on campus, so we added items on our questionnaires to students on security issues. Since then, there has been a huge proliferation in student amenities on college campuses; it’s as if colleges are running hotels, resorts, or country clubs. If you look at the construction on campuses today, it tends to be in science and technology buildings, or facilities to make student life more comfortable. Housing, fitness centers, student centers are the way schools now compete with one another. We lived in Europe for a time, and these amenities are something you just don’t see at universities there. The competition here appears to be to make students more comfortable.My advice? Look beyond the amenities. Make sure you’re not snowed by the student center or impressed with how good your meal is. Make sure your education is the best it can be. Find out if the college is spending on faculty salaries and the things that really matter for education.Q: What do you think of various college rankings, current media coverage of higher education, and how would you advise students and parents to find what will be most helpful as they try to understand their options?A: I would basically ignore the rankings. US News & World Report editors have recalled that the rankings started as “a journalistic parlor game.” If you look at the rankings, they are asking the wrong questions: They are not asking “What’s the best college for YOU?” Their rankings are based on a value system that may not be YOUR value system. Why would you let US News or any ranking service tell you what’s best for YOU?A rating, however, is not a ranking. The Fiske Guide uses more of a “restaurant guide model”: “Here are some categories for you to consider, and here’s how we rate each college in those categories.” Nowhere do we say, “College A is better than College B is better than College C.” Now, you might be able to use US News ’s data and create your own ranking, but even then, the US News definition of quality correlates very highly with institutional wealth. That’s a major reason why so very few public institutions are in their top group, and the number is declining over time. Really? NO great public universities? That’s silly….You might use rankings to suggest a group of college to consider, but after that, pay no attention.Q: If you ran College Admissions and could change one thing, what would it be and Why?A: I would restore Need-based aid to the role it used to have and drastically curtail Merit-based aid. The merit system is not being used to bring new students into higher education. It is being used to affect who will go where, but not who will attend in the first place. In that sense, we are reverting back to the system that existed before the 1960’s. I believe that aid should be used to maximize the number of students going to higher education, not changing who goes where.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T13:05:36.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
