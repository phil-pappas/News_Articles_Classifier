The unexplained fire was in the hardwood walls.\n“What happened to us is sad, so sad. Eddie had no ability to manipulate as he was autistic, his love was just so pure,” Ms Ginn said.\nEdison’s sisters, Francesca, 13, and Freya-Grace, 10, made the decision easier for their mum to put their house block up for sale, saying it was just too sad for them to stay there and rebuild.\nPeter Chew, of RE/MAX Innovation – Jindalee, said the 875sq m block, including the existing pool at 5 Hilliup St, Westlake, would go under the hammer on September 12.\n“Here is your chance to design and build your dream home that ticks all your boxes,” he said.\nEdison Hellmuth, 11, who was killed in a fire in his Westlake home with his mum Jillian Ginn. Source: Supplied\nMs Ginn, who is now renting a house in Westlake, said it was a wonderful community and a wonderful street.\n“The block will suit another family and it is also big enough that you could subdivide,” she said.\n“When we moved into this home in January, 2014, I promised my kids a bedroom each, a pool, a cul de sac so they could ride their bikes and I needed privacy as Eddie used to love to jump naked on the trampoline.\n“On the morning of the fire we sat on the front veranda and Eddie and I looked at a double rainbow. It was a beautiful one.”\nIt would have been Edison’s 12th birthday this Sunday, August 30.\n“I had three kids in three years and one week, so my children are so close,” Ms Ginn said.\n“The level of destruction was total. I spent hours on my hands and knees going over what was Freya-Grace’s bedroom to find one thing that belonged to her. I couldn’t find one thing. Nothing, all gone. We have lost everything.”\nMs Ginn said her bond with Edison was hard to describe.\n“The level of attachment we had was completely incomparable to anything else. It’s not like I have just lost a third limb, its much more than that. It’s redefining my family.”\n“I am a Christian and he’s still with us without a doubt.”\nMs Ginn, a busy single mum who is the state general manager of IT company Sable 37, said Edison “taught me more in his short life than both of my degrees”.\n“The house went up in four-and-a-half minutes. The firies said it was the worst house fire ever seen in Australia. I was sobbing, but when Eddie died he wasn’t all charred, he looked like an angel.”\nDonations can be made to:\nEdison’s Family Recovery Fund\nANZ Bank\nBSB 014 215\nAccount 294620028\nOriginally published as Fresh start from the tragic ruins ", "external_links": ["http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/fatal-housefire-block-to-be-sold-so-family-can-rebuild/story-fnihpu6h-1227498303813", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-residential+land-qld-westlake-201264489", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/fatal-housefire-block-to-be-sold-so-family-can-rebuild/story-fndbalka-1227498303813?sv=8d728beac1fa318d8ff5fb26c3e89e63", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/fatal-housefire-block-to-be-sold-so-family-can-rebuild/story-fndbalka-1227498303813?sv=8d728beac1fa318d8ff5fb26c3e89e63&title=Fresh+start+from+the+tragic+ruins", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Fresh+start+from+the+tragic+ruins&c=FOUR+and+a+half+minutes+changed+Jillian+Ginn%26%238217%3Bs+life+forever+when+her+son+perished+in+a+housefire.+Now+she%26%238217%3Bs+made+the+tough+decision+to+sell.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/fatal-housefire-block-to-be-sold-so-family-can-rebuild/story-fndbalka-1227498303813?sv=8d728beac1fa318d8ff5fb26c3e89e63", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/fatal-housefire-block-to-be-sold-so-family-can-rebuild/story-fndbalka-1227498303813?sv=8d728beac1fa318d8ff5fb26c3e89e63", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/fatal-housefire-block-to-be-sold-so-family-can-rebuild/story-fndbalka-1227498303813?sv=8d728beac1fa318d8ff5fb26c3e89e63&title=Fresh+start+from+the+tragic+ruins", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/fatal-housefire-block-to-be-sold-so-family-can-rebuild/story-fndbalka-1227498303813?sv=8d728beac1fa318d8ff5fb26c3e89e63&h=Fresh+start+from+the+tragic+ruins"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:35:46.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
