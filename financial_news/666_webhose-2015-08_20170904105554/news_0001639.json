The views expressed are his own. \nAug 19(Reuters) - There is a good chance today that one part of the Greek bailout saga will end with a relative whimper. \nThe parliaments of Germany and the Netherlands are expected to approve an 86 billion euro ($95.15 billion) bailout for Athens, the country's third. \nThere may be some tub-thumping, grandstanding and barely concealed fury about Greece's supposedly lackadaisical attitude to budgetary rigour. But it should get through, nonetheless. \nIn the short term, this will allow Greece to pay 3.2 billion euros to the European Central Bank tomorrow. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also removes the chance of Greece crashing out of the euro zone anytime soon. That was in no one's interest - hence the fact a deal did eventually get done. \nThere are, however, lots of loose ends. \nPolitically, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras lost about a third of his parliamentary party when the bailout came to a vote in the Athens legislature. This means he will ask for a vote of confidence. If he does not get it, he will call elections. \nIn and of itself, this should not affect the bailout - it is hard to image the no-bailout crowd winning outright power. But it will add uncertainty which is not particularly useful. \nThere also may be political fallout in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel may have to rely on lawmakers not of her party to get the bailout through. \nGreece's banks, meanwhile, remain in serious need of recapitalisation. That will come by the end of the year, but what the future shape of the Greek banking sector is, indeed how many banks there are and what will happen to all the bad loans, is up in the air. \nFinally, there is the International Monetary Fund. Europe wants it to participate. The IMF says it won't unless Greece gets some form of debt relief. Big powers in Europe (Germany) say no to actually cutting Greek debt. \nSo cue a series of long meetings in September and October to decide how to cut the debt burden without actually appearing to have cut it. \nThe whimper you hear today may actually be officials gearing up for the next rounds ($1 = 0.9038 euros) (Editing by Andrew Heavens)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:12:03.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
