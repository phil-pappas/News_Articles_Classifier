I don’t want people to worry that just flossing is going to cause them an infection in their prosthetic joint,” Dababneh said.\nDoctors in the report said that it’s rare to find an S gordonii infection on a prosthetic; just about 2 per cent of late-onset prosthetic joint infections involve the bacterial group streptococci.\nMost infections on prosthetic devices (57 per cent) are related to the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are frequently found on the skin or respiratory tract.\n 25, 2015 10:59 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:47:54.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
