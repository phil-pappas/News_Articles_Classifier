US stocks finished lower for the sixth straight session, with the Dow posting another triple-digit decline after a morning rally fizzled.\n“We’re not clear of the woods yet in terms of how far the unwind in China is going to extend and the authorities’ capabilities to stop that,” he said.\nCURRENCY SNAPSHOT AT 0700 AEST ON WEDNESDAY\nOne Australian dollar buys:\n* 71.30 US cents, from 71.82 cents on Tuesday\n* 84.73 Japanese yen, from 85.56 yen\n* 61.89 euro cents, from 62.15 euro cents\n* 110.14 New Zealand cents, from 110.67 NZ cents\n* 45.44 British pence, from 45.52 pence\n(*Currency closes taken at 1700 AEST previous local session)\nSource: IRESS\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Australian+dollar+is+lower&c=THE+Australian+dollar+has+been+dragged+down+as+traders+remain+cautious+about+how+far+China%26%238217%3Bs+stockmarket+will+unwind.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-dollar-is-lower/story-fn6t6wad-1227499310024?sv=90c2aec9c95a2d0392ab908b8afc39da", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-dollar-is-lower/story-fn6t6wad-1227499310024?sv=90c2aec9c95a2d0392ab908b8afc39da&h=Australian+dollar+is+lower", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-dollar-is-lower/story-fn6t6wad-1227499310024?sv=90c2aec9c95a2d0392ab908b8afc39da", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-dollar-is-lower/story-fn6t6wad-1227499310024?sv=90c2aec9c95a2d0392ab908b8afc39da&title=Australian+dollar+is+lower", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-dollar-is-lower/story-fn6t6wad-1227499310024?sv=90c2aec9c95a2d0392ab908b8afc39da&title=Australian+dollar+is+lower", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-dollar-is-lower/story-fn6t6wad-1227499310024?sv=90c2aec9c95a2d0392ab908b8afc39da"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:35:59.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
