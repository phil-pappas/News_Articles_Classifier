Core earnings were C$1.47 per share.\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of C$1.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nEarnings for the international banking business climbed 11 percent, helped by loan growth across Latin America and higher fee income.\nThe Canadian unit's profit fell due in part to a gain recorded in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, the segment grew 15 percent.\nBut the lender's global banking and markets division recorded a 20 percent drop in profit, reflecting weakness in investment banking and higher provisions for credit losses.\nScotiabank also increased its quarterly dividend.
