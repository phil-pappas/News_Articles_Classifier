The left had to either escape or take huge responsibilities and prove it can help society,\" Health Minister Panagiotis Kouroublis told local radio, calling for snap elections to lock in popular support. \n\"After this deal the prime minister should call for elections, so that the Greek people can vote on whether they approve the programme or want something else,\" he said. \nThe European Commission confirmed a deal had been struck at a technical level and that political assessment would follow. \nEuro zone finance ministry officials taking part in the so-called Euro working group agreed to recommend approval of the bailout when euro zone finance ministers meet on Friday, a source at the Italian Treasury said. \nStill, officials in sceptical northern European countries remained cautious, pending final approval of the deal. \n\"There remains work to be done with details,\" said Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb. \"We must take one step at a time. Agreement is a big word.\" \nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was due to hold talks later on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. \nMisgivings about giving yet more money to Athens run deep in Germany, the euro zone country that has contributed most to Greece's two bailouts since 2010. \nGerman Deputy Finance Minister Jens Spahn told Reuters the deal should be able to stand for the next few years rather just a few months. \nPAINFUL CHAPTER \nApproval of the agreement would close a painful chapter for Greece, which resisted the austerity terms demanded by creditors for much of the year before relenting under threat of being bounced out of the euro zone. \nAfter a deal in principle last month, talks began in Athens three weeks ago to craft an agreement covering details of reform measures, the timeline for their implementation and the amount of aid needed. \nA Greek Finance Ministry official said the pact would be worth up to 85 billion euros ($94 billion) in fresh loans over three years. Greek banks would get 10 billion euros immediately and would be recapitalised by the end of the year. \nAn EU diplomat said the agreement was worth between 82 billion and 85 billion euros. \nTsipras wants parliament to approve the deal by Thursday, before euro zone finance ministers meet on Friday. This would pave the way for aid disbursements by Aug. 20, when a 3.2 billion euro debt payment is due to the European Central Bank. \nThe latest round of talks with inspectors from four creditor institutions -- the European Commission, European Central Bank, the European bailout fund and the International Monetary Fund -- progressed smoothly, in contrast to the bad-tempered encounters of earlier in the year. \nIn talks that dragged through Monday night, the sides agreed on the three main sticking points - dealing with non-performing loans held by banks, setting up an asset sales fund, and deregulation of the natural gas market. \nThe talks also agreed on final fiscal targets that should govern the bailout effort, aiming for a primary budget surplus -- which excludes interest payments -- from 2016, a government official said. \n($1 = 0.9074 euros) \n(Additional reporting by Karolina Tagaris and Lefteris Papadimas in Athens, Giselda Vagnoni in Rome; Writing by Michele Kambas and Deepa Babington; Editing by Peter Graff and Giles Elgood)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:05:55.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
