Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Aspiring Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump only ever attempted a property play once in Australia. He failed, but only by the smallest of margins – just 48 hours.\nWithin a similar heated atmosphere of the recent billion-dollar bids for casino developments along Australia's east coast, Mr Trump was after a casino – the Darling Harbour casino in Sydney.\nIt was late 1986 and Mr Trump, who is now leading a race to become the most powerful man in the world, teamed up with Barry Paul, the entrepreneurial Brisbane developer and founder of Kern Corporation.\nThey planned a bid in response to the NSW government's request for an international-class casino for Sydney on a three-hectare site near Pyrmont Bridge, now home to Echo Entertainment's The Star casino.\nMr Trump and Kern lodged an impressive offer and were shortlisted with four other consortiums including Australian Federal Hotels and Sabemo; Malaysia's Genting Berhad with Civil and Civic; Harrah with Leighton and Pennant; and the Hong Kong Macau Sydney consortium then led by the Chinese gambling magnate Stanley Ho.\nBut within a year the whole government-run bidding process collapsed after legal action surrounding information that the FBI and New Jersey division of Gaming Enforcement was investigating one of the bidders – Harrah – over claims of involvement with organised crime.\nHigh stakes Mr Trump, who in 1988 was a spritely 41-year-old and worth a cool $3.5 billion would not give up. He visited Australia soon after the failed process, hoping for talks with then premier Nick Greiner to start a whole new casino tender.\n A year later, a new tender process was started with Mirvac, Kern Corporation, Hooker, Lendlease, Merlin and Concrete Constructions all in the mix. The shortlisted developers spent about $1 million each preparing submissions which was a big spend by today's standards. Echo Entertainment spent $9 million on the most recent casino bid.\nKern and Mr Trump were said to have topped the bidding with an offer and a financial package that would have guaranteed payment to the government.\nCorrs Chamber Westgarth lawyer Andrew Lumsden, who was a director on the Kern-Trump joint venture company, remembers the bid was strong.\n\"We had Harry Seidler design the casino and it was a very compelling bid,\" Mr Lumsden said.\nBut it wasn't to be.\nThe big money and flash design was not enough to win the big race as Mr Trump may find out in the United States presidential campaign.\nThe Darling Harbour Authority and the Department of State Development were only prepared to give the Kern-Trump joint venture 48 hours to alter certain conditions in its top offer. But they did not and instead Lendlease stole the show in 1989. But even then Lendlease's development did not get up either and the casino today is in a different place.\nThe company that Mr Trump and Kern's Mr Paul were joint directors of was finally deregistered in 1992 and Mr Trump's interest in Australian property has been non-existent ever since.\nIn an interview with The Australian Financial Review during the dark days of the financial crisis, Mr Trump said he was always open to having another go Down Under.\n\"Maybe I'll even get involved in Australia,\" he said. \"If I do something in Australia, I'd want to have a partner in Australia.\"\nWith the popularity of Mr Trump as a potential US presidential candidate, that next partnership in Australia might be one of a more diplomatic kind than he thought seven years ago.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-08-26T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:09:48.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
