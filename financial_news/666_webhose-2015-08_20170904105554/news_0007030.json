Analysts predict Eurozone gross domestic product rose 1.3% year-on-year in the second quarter, compared to the previous three month's 1% gain. \nA final reading of the consumer price index is expected to be confirmed at 0.2% in the year to July. It has remained well below the ECB's target of just under 2% growth but has risen since January, when it contracted 0.6%. \nIn its account of the governing council meeting in mid-July, released on Thursday, the ECB said the Eurozone is finally seeing a pick-up in inflation. \nPolicymakers pointed to a \"growing number of indications that a turning point [on inflation] might well have been reached\". They said it was too soon to tell, however, and \"additional observations would be needed\". \nThe officials also expressed some concern that financial developments in China could have a larger-than-expected adverse impact, given the country's prominent role in global trade. \nThe central bank said the risk could be compounded by negative knock-on effects from interest rate by the US Federal Reserve on growth in emerging market economies. \nOn an upbeat note, the ECB said risks stemming from developments in Greece appeared to be generally contained. \n\"It was also felt that recently improved prospects for the negotiations of a third financial programme for Greece could be expected to contribute to a firming of confidence across the euro area,\" it said. \nFriday 14 August INTERIMS Afarak Group (Helsinki: AFAGR.HE - news ) (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ), Biofrontera AG (Xetra: 604611 - news ) (DI), Fondul Proprietatea S.A.
