Aust bonds mixed on US inflation data AAP â€“ 40 minutes ago Print \nThe Australian bond market is mixed, after US inflation figures met market expectations. \nUS consumer spending rose slightly in July as incomes continued to grow at a steady pace, while underlying inflation remained tame. \nConsumer spending, which drives about 70 per cent of activity in the world's largest economy, rose 0.3 per cent, following an upwardly revised 0.3 per cent gain in June. \n\"It didn't cause too much movement,\" Commonwealth Bank of Australia fixed income quantitative strategist Philip Brown said. \nMr Brown said the local data calendar was heavy in the week ahead. \n\"GDP (gross domestic product) data will provide more information on where the economy actually is, particularly when the labour force has been a bit up and down and it's hard to get a proper read,\" he said. \n\"That will be more telling data, and, of course, everyone will be watching China as well.\" \nShanghai ended the week 4.8 per cent firmer on Friday following a tumultuous week of heavy share losses. \nAt 0830 AEST on Monday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.245 (implying a yield of 2.755 per cent), up from 97.235 (2.765 per cent) on Friday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.160 (1.840 per cent), down from 98.170 (1.830 per cent). \nKEY MOVEMENTS: \n* CGS 5.5pct Jan 2018, 1.798pct, from 1.798pct on Friday \n* CGS 4.25pct April 2026, 2.804pct, from 2.804pct \nSydney Futures Exchange prices: \n* September 2015 bill futures, 97.890, from 97.900 \n* December 2015 bill futures, 98.020, from 98.040 \n(*Closes taken at 1630 AEST previous local session) \nSource: IRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T02:22:54.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
