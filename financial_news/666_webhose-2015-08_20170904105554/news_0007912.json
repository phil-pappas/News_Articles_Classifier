ECOWAS, through its special agency on renewable energy and energy efficiency called ECREEE, is working with member states for the development of national action plans for renewable energy and energy efficiency within the framework of SEE4ALL,\" said the energy minister. \nHe said the availability of a reliable system of energy supply that is efficient, affordable and environmentally sound is one of the vital components of The Gambia Government's development agenda which focuses on poverty alleviation and the achievement of Visions 2016, 2020 and MDGs. \nWith the recognition of the vital role played in the socio-economic development of the country, Minister Sanneh said, the Government of The Gambia has been doing all what is possible to provide the vital services of energy to the doorsteps of the communities in the country. \nHyacinth Elayo, Energy Policy Analyst from ECOWAS Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE), on behalf of the Executive Director of ECREEE, thanked the Gambia government for the impressive strides taken in the area of sustainable energy development. \n\"The partnership between ECREEE and The Gambia Government will complement The Gambia's efforts to increase energy access for our homes, businesses and industry and lead to greater socio-economic development,\" said Mr. Elayo. \nHe noted that the ECOWAS Regional Renewable Energy Policy aims to ensure increased use of renewable energy sources such as solar, winds, small-scale hydro and bioenergy for grid electricity supply and for the provision of access to energy services in rural areas. \nThe success of these action plans, said the ECREEE official, will require that they are based on national potentials and socio-economic assessments underpinned by concrete laws, incentives and measures as well as clear financing strategy and technically well designed interventions. \nHe reiterated ECREEE's firm commitment to supporting The Gambia to successfully implement action plans that are relevant to the country's sustainable energy development aspirations thus promising that they will continue to encourage all stakeholders, particularly the private sector and civil society to engage with this process. \nThe validation was held at the Boabab Hotel Resort in Bijilo.
