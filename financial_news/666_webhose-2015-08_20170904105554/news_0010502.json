The report also added that apart from the banks since no other stakeholder promoter, tariff authorities and tax authorities -are interested in resolving the case, it delays the resolution further.\n\"The judicial process, despite a variety of creditor-friendly bills like the SARFAESI Act, further tends to hamper the ability of creditors to collect their just dues from influential promoters,\" the report stated.\nRBI has also been nudging bank for an early recognition of NPA so that provisions can be made accordingly. Regulatory forbearance, where RBI makes it easy for banks to extend and pretend is not a solution, it added in the report.\nAs per RBI, the overall stressed advances in the system have inched up to 11.1% at the end of March 2015 compared to 10% a year ago.\nApart from this RBI also once again pointed out that there is mismatch in the rate at which the central bank reduced the key policy rates and banks bring down the base rate. Base rate is the benchmark rate to which all loan rates are linked.\n\"The willingness of banks to cut base rates - whereby they forego income on existing borrowers in order to attract more new business -is muted,\" said the RBI annual report.\nIn this calendar year RBI has reduced repo rate (the rate at which it lends to banks) by 75 basis points where as banks have reduced the base rate by only 25-30 basis points.\nNot only RBI but even the government had questioned banks asking them to explain their reluctance in cutting base rate.\nBankers say that the increase in bad loans has been putting pressure on the margins as increasingly the interest-earning assets are slipping into the non-performing class. This in turn has deterred banks from cutting loan rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T17:02:26.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
