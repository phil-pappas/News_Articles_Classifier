I admired their confidence in my longitivtiy! Perhaps that’s the real fountain of youth … pay your cards off at the minimum rate and they will assure you of staying alive for many many more years. Hehe. Reply Bret @ Hope to Prosper October 2, 2011, 1:24 PM \nThe minimum payment warning was part of the new CARD Act that passed in the U.S. to reform the credit card industry. They did it because some people didn’t realize it would take decades to pay off their cards by making the minimum payment. \nI didn’t realize they would use it in Canada. bigcajunman October 2, 2011, 1:40 PM \nGuess we got that one for free. Reply Traciatim September 26, 2011, 5:26 AM \nI think if you look at the question from the opposite direction you;ll find the answer to why credit card rates are so high. \nIf you had a million bucks and you want to earn 6% per year on your money by lending it to people. You know somewhere between 10%-15% of those people will not pay you back. What interest rate do you have to charge to earn 6% on your money taking in to account your losses? Reply bigcajunman September 26, 2011, 9:35 AM \nAgreed, just a surreal time frame to see on a credit card bill. My first mortgage didn’t have that term!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:56:39.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
