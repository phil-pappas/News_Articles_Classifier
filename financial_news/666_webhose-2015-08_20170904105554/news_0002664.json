Its normalised net profit, which removes volatility linked to big spending gamblers, also fell 19 percent to A$518.7 million, missing analysts estimates of A$531 million.\nCrown's earnings were hit by an industry-wide slowdown in gambling revenue growth in the world's biggest gambling hub Macau following a Beijing government crackdown on lavish spending and corruption.\nProfit from Crown's one-third stake in its Macau-focused Melco Crown Entertainment fell 44.6 percent, the company said.\nCrown said it was optimistic about the long-term prospects of its Macau business, where Packer will remain as co-chairman.\nIn Australia, where casino gambling has attracted many of the wealthy Chinese gamblers that left Macau, Crown said its main floor gaming revenue increased by 6.9 percent at its Melbourne casino but only 2.6 percent at its Perth casino.\nCrown's results come a day after Echo Entertainment Group Ltd posted a 59 percent leap in annual net profit on Wednesday but its shares fell as much as five percent on concerns that a busy renovation schedule could bite into the next year's earnings.\n($1 = 1.3554 Australian dollars) (Editing by Stephen Coates and Miral Fahmy )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T05:02:47.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
