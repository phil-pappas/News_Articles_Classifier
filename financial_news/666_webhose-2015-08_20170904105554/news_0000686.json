Hundreds of AP and P2P professionals are expected at the four-day event, which encompasses two days of general sessions and two days of workshops and certifications, interspersed with networking opportunities and professional recognition. The conference will open its first day of general sessions on Monday, October 26, at 8:30am with keynote Dan Lier. Lier’s high-energy presentation, entitled “Maximizing Your True Potential,” will kick off the conference with strategies to increase performance in both business and life. The presentation will focus on the psychology of a top performer, the power of a winning attitude, and Lier’s formula for success. Lier, based in Las Vegas, is a best-selling author, human behavior expert, and internationally recognized motivational speaker. He has presented over 3,500 talks at events around the globe and appeared regularly on HSN as America’s Coach, where he shared his strategies for success with millions.\nThe conference’s second keynote, on Wednesday, October 28, at 4:00pm, will be delivered by Doug Sleeter - Founder and President of The Sleeter Group, author, thought leader, publisher, columnist for CPA Practice Advisor, and seven-time recipient of Top 100 Most Influential People in Accounting. Sleeter’s presentation, entitled “The Future of Accounting,” will focus on leveraging the constant changes of technology and accounting software to help businesses become more successful and agile.\n“The AP Network consciously made a decision for the fall 2015 AP & P2P Conference to feature two keynote speakers; one to speak specifically about technical AP strategy, and one to inspire, motivate, and humor the attendees,” said Brian Cuthbert, Executive Director of The AP Network. “The spring 2015 conference followed the same outline, and it was a huge success with attendees. They really appreciated the advice and expertise of an AP ‘celebrity’ of sorts, but they also enjoyed connecting on more of a personal level with someone who could coach them about self-betterment in any walk of life,” he added.\nMore information about the AP & P2P Conference & Expo’s keynotes, full program, and a comprehensive program guide can be found at http://www.iofm.com/conference-fall . Early Bird pricing for attendees is in effect until midnight on Friday, August 14, 2015.\nAbout The AP Network\nThe AP Network is the largest global community for Accounts Payable, Procure-to-Pay and Financial Shared Services practitioners.
