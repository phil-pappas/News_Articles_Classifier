The 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell Monday, then rose steadily throughout the week before settling at the current rate. \n\"Mortgage rates fell last week to their lowest levels since May after China's yuan devaluation, but strong U.S. data helped rates quickly recover most of the drop,\" said Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgages at Zillow. \"This week, markets will focus on inflation data and commentary from Fed officials about developments in China.\" \nZillow's real-time mortgage rates are based on thousands of custom mortgage quotes submitted daily to anonymous borrowers on the Zillow Mortgages site and reflect the most recent changes in the market. These are not marketing rates, or a weekly survey. \nThe rate for a 15-year fixed home loan is currently 2.95 percent, while the rate for a 5-1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is 2.76 percent. \nPurchase Mortgage Application Activity \nZillow predicts tomorrow's seasonally adjusted Mortgage Bankers Association Weekly Application Index will show purchase loan activity did not change from the week prior. Zillow combines loan requests made on Zillow Mortgages last week with the previous week's Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Application Index to predict the MBA's Weekly Application Index for purchase loans, which will be released tomorrow. For more information about this prediction, visit http://www.zillow.com/research/mortgage-app-index-part-one-7016/ . \nBelow are current rates for 30-year fixed mortgages by state.
