Athens wants to set up a \"bad bank\" to handle this, while creditors want non-performing loans bundled and sold to distressed asset funds. \nOfficials also said the two sides had yet to agree on setting up a sovereign wealth fund in Greece designed to raise 50 billion euros from privatisations, three-quarters of which would be used to recapitalise banks and to decrease the debt. \nBoth sides had agreed to deregulate the country's natural gas market, sources said. \nGreek banks could get an initial capital injection soon after a bailout deal is clinched, as much as 10 billion euros, even before the ECB completes a stress test, a euro zone official said on Monday. \nThe official said a test may not be finished before October, but that it was recognised that Greek banks urgently need capital to normalise their operations. \nPopular misgivings run deep in Germany, the euro zone country that has already contributed most to Greece's two bailouts since 2010, about funnelling yet more money to Athens. \nBerlin wants a deal that includes an ambitious budget plan, a credible privatisation strategy and a sustainable pension reform, Finance Ministry spokesman Juerg Weissgerber said. \nGreek officials have said they expect the bailout accord to be approved by Greece's parliament on Wednesday or Thursday and then be vetted by euro zone finance ministers on Friday, paving the way for aid disbursements. \nThe bailout pact will be voted on in parliament as one bill with two articles - one on the loan agreement and memorandum of understanding and the second on the so-called prior actions that must be completed for aid to be released, a separate Greek official said. The negotiations began on July 20. \nThe two sides have agreed to set a budget surplus target before interest payments of zero percent this year, and expect the economy to shrink between 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent, a Greek official told Reuters. \nIn addition, the sides had agreed to a baseline scenario of a primary budget surplus of 0.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2016, and a primary surplus of 1.0 percent of GDP in 2017. The same scenario projected a 0.5 percent economic contraction in 2016, before registering 2.3 percent growth in 2017. \n(Additional reporting by Karolina Tagaris, writing By Michele Kambas, editing by G Crosse)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T02:23:32.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
