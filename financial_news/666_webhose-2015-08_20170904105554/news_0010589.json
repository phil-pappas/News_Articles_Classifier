Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl China's financial market turmoil has produced a wave of warnings that we are about to experience a case of history repeating itself with a round of contagion like that which produced the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\nBut anyone worried about the future of Asia would be better off looking at the reasons for a structural decline in Asia's growth potential identified by the International Monetary Fund and important changes to the production chains which drive the regional economy rather than repeated history.\nMuch has been made of the way the region may be facing a repeat of the 1994 Chinese devaluation which undermined the competitiveness of Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Malaysia – the countries at the centre of the turmoil three years later.\nThere is a similarity between the real (rather than nominal) depreciation then and what is happening now but there were other more important causes of the broader 1997 crisis.\nThe core countries all had overvalued currencies and high levels of short term foreign currency debt which made them highly vulnerable to a change of foreign investor sentiment which is much less the case today.\nIn addition we will not see a repeat of the tough reforms imposed by the International Monetary Fund which drove them into recession because they mostly have their own fiscal, monetary and foreign reserve fire power today alongside better regional procedures and crisis support.\nThe other fundamental change for investors since the late 1990s is that developing countries now account for more than half of world GDP and developing Asia alone has grown from around 15 per cent to 30 per cent.\nThis means that the time has arrived when emerging markets need to be examined in a more detailed way rather than as a single asset class that just moves in the one direction.\n This is illustrated by the way the commodities downturn which is seen to be generally undermining emerging markets is actually a much more mixed development in the Asian region. That's because most major regional countries are energy importers and stand to benefit from lower prices.\nIndeed Japan is likely to be forced into even more extraordinary monetary policy due to lower energy prices to have any chance of meeting its growth objectives.\nLooking back to 1997 is the wrong way to frame Asia's challenges in the current circumstances because the key faultlines from that period have been addressed.\nThe main currencies with some exceptions are flexible which is already preventing the need for sharp disruptive adjustments and that is a process China has joined with its recent change to the yuan.\nWhile there have been currency declines of more than 10 per cent against the US$ this year, this is a fraction of what occurred in 1997.\nAt the same time foreign currency reserves in Asia outside Japan average around 30 per cent of GDP which is much more than two times the pre-1997 level as is the multiple of import cover compared with that time.\nForeign currency debt has been substantially reduced in most countries as a share of GDP – although not all, banking systems have been more consolidated and better budget management means most countries have a lot space to expand spending if necessary given relatively low public debt outside Japan.\nThe modern challenges are different. For example, while foreign currency debt seems under control, domestic private sector debt has increased rapidly towards a regional average of twice the level seen before the Asian crisis of in Asia ex-Japan.\nMore fundamentally the warning in the latest IMF outlook of a two percentage point decline in emerging market growth potential seems to occurring in Asia reflecting a wide range of long term factors from the general decline in world trade growth, to less efficient capital use due to cheap credit and a shift towards ageing demographics in some countries.\nAt the same time the regional production chains which have played a key role in Asia's rise as the factory of the world even without formal trade agreements seems to be undergoing a significant change. Some new research points to a shift of low cost production out of China at the same time that other high end manufacturing is clustering – particularly in China - without going through the old supply chain process so much.\nAs Asian countries become a bigger part of the global economy these are the sort of shifts which require more individual country analysis of both economic fundamentals and political capacity to manage change rather than a resort to history.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl", "http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2015/apd/eng/pdf/areo0415c2.pdf", "http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/update/02/"], "published": "2015-08-26T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:09:28.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
