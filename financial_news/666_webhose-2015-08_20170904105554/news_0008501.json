Coming on the heels of weaker-than-expected data in July, it stoked fears of a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.\nU.S. stock futures fell to a 6 month low after the survey, while Japan's Nikkei stock index fell 3 percent.\nThe FTSEurofirst 300 is down 8.5 percent since China devalued its currency last week.\n\"Global markets are in panic mode as the full scale of China's slowdown becomes clearer,\" Angus Nicholson, market analyst at IG, said in a note.\n\"The word on everyone's lips is deflation - poison for equity markets.
