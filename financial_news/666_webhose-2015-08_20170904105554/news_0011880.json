Hockey says 'be calm' ahead of market open AAP â€“ 10 minutes ago Print \nFederal Treasurer Joe Hockey has urged investors to \"be calm\" ahead of what's expected to be a hefty fall in the Australian stock market. \nThe local bourse is looking at a plunge of up to four per cent after trading begins at 10am on Tuesday. \nAsked if he was spooked, Mr Hockey said \"to be calm is good advice\". \nHe played up Australia's economic credentials and played down fears of slower growth in China, which has given international financial markets the jitters. \n\"I'm absolutely confident, absolutely confident that the fundamentals of the Australian economy and the global economy are still good,\" he told Nine Network. \n\"Last week, I met with one of the most senior economic figures in China. \n\"He reassured us, from his lips to our ears, that China would use whatever tools it has available to make sure that it grows relatively strongly this year ... There is no doubt.\" \nUS and European markets sold off heavily for the second consecutive session on Monday night amid growing anxiety about a slowdown in China's economy. \nThe sell off followed a more than eight per cent dive in the Shanghai Composite on Monday, the latest in a series of falls that have wiped trillions off the Chinese market. \nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 dropped almost four per cent overnight while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dived 3.6 per cent and the Nasdaq fell 3.8 per cent. \nIn Europe, London's benchmark FTSE 100 index sank almost 4.7 per cent, while Paris' CAC 40 in Paris plunged more than 5.3 per cent and Frankfurt's DAX 30 lost 4.7 per cent. \nMr Hockey said some bourses had looked \"pretty topsy\" lately. \n\"It is a correction,\" he said. \nAustralia's key S&P/ASX 200 index is projected to fall 3.66 per cent on Tuesday, after losing four per cent on Monday in what was the bourse's worst day of trading in six years. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T02:14:56.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
