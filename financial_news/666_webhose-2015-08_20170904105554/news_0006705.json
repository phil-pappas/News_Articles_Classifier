HAVANA—The three retired U.S. marines who lowered the flag at the American embassy here in 1961 helped raise the Stars and Stripes once again Friday at the seven-story building alongside Havana’s seaside Malecon boulevard.\nSecretary of State John Kerry arrived Friday morning in Havana—along with a U.S. delegation including senior State, Treasury and Commerce department officials—for a 10-hour visit, the first by a U.S. secretary of state in 70 years. Lawmakers in favor of the opening, Cuban Americans and representatives from U.S. businesses are also on hand for the events under the hot Caribbean sun.\nThe U.S. and Cuba officially restored diplomatic ties last month, and the U.S. embassy here opened then. But Friday’s flag raising marks the symbolic start of a new chapter in the two nation’s relations, with flags now flying once again in both countries after 54 years. The Cuban embassy in Washington, D.C., raised its flag on July 20.\nThe American and Cuban anthems were played, just as they were at Cuba’s ceremony in Washington last month. Cuban dissidents weren’t invited to the morning ceremony at the embassy, but will attend a later reception and a second flag raising at the chief of mission’s residence. U.S. officials said the dissidents couldn’t attend the morning flag raising because of space restrictions.\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/american-flag-raised-at-u-s-embassy-in-havana-1439563151"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:02:41.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
