WEEK AHEAD The stragglers for the earnings season - Home Depot, Wal-Mart and a few others - will report results to close out the quarter next week, with expectations that retailers would see decent sales after recent revisions show better-than-expected activity in the second quarter. The markets will also continue to watch the Chinese yuan after its unexpected devaluation this week, with anticipation that the dollar will strengthen a bit more, boosting bond-market activity in what is otherwise expected to be a slower week. Fed minutes are released on Wednesday and will be parsed for clues of an interest rate rise. The Changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets.

Also on Tuesday, TJX Cos Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The off-price retailer is expected to be helped by lower gas prices, wage growth, and higher traffic to its stores as more consumers hunt for bargains. A hike in the number and quality of brands in its stores and merchandise that reflects popular fashion trends is also expected to drive sales. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on industry trends and plans to expand in international markets. Home Depot Inc, the world's No. 1 home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimate on Tuesday. Strong housing market data over the last few months is expected to have kept overall demand for home improvement goods steady. However, record rainfall in May and June in large parts of the United States is likely to have kept a lid on sales of products in the home exterior improvement categories, such as paint and gardening supplies. Lowe's Companies Inc, the second-largest U.S. home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimates on Wednesday.

Out of fashion merchandise and a general lack of trendy products have led to a decline in sales at the company's flagship Gap brand, leading to heavy discounts. Shipment delays caused due to disruptions at the West Coast ports early this year and a strong dollar are also expected to hurt the company's results in the quarter. Investors will look for comments on recovery at the Gap brand and performance in the current quarter. On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The earnings beat is expected to be driven by trendy, fashionable merchandise, lower discounts, benefits from lower cotton prices and tight inventory controls.

Falling U.S. farm income and weak commodity prices have reduced spending on new equipment by farmers. In May, Deere forecast a fall in global sales for its farm equipment in 2015 and said it would close plants and cut jobs. When the company reports its third-quarter results on Friday, the investors will be looking for an update on the company's plans to shutter more factories to adjust to lower demand, as well as whether it is expected to take a hefty charge on a tractor recall announced earlier in August. They will also be looking for more information on a fire in a chemical warehouse in China last week that left some Deere workers critically injured.

However, Estee has to increase promotions in its flagship Clinique and Estee Lauder brands which have shown some weakness. The company's smaller brands such as Smashbox and Bobbi Brown have seen a rise in demand, helped by their extensive online presence. Even as sales in overseas markets like the UK and China grow by double digit percentages, a stronger dollar in the past few quarters has stripped their value. The company is expected to beat revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter. Investors will be keen on 2016 forecast, updates on acquisitions and the impact of the dollar. Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales slightly above analysts' average estimates. The beat is expected to be driven by strong performance at the flagship Urban Outfitters brand, which accounts for a majority of sales, but margins are expected to be pressured by higher promotions at the Anthropologie brand, where sales growth has slowed in recent quarters. The company is also benefiting from investments in its fast-growing e-commerce and online division. Investors will look for commentary on sales recovery at the Anthropologie brand, promotions, and updates on performance for the back-to-school shopping season.
