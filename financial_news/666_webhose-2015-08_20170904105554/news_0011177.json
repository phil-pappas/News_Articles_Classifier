They said Third Point did not file for such clearance until Sept. 16, 2011.\nLoeb ultimately engineered the installation of current Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer to replace Carol Bartz.\nHe also won a board seat, which he relinquished in July 2013 when Third Point sold 40 million Yahoo shares to the Sunnyvale, California-based company at a large profit.\nLed by Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, the FTC majority found a \"significant public interest\" in ensuring that investors follow HSR rules that are enforced consistently and transparently.\n\"The public interest does not hinge on whether Third Point's acquisitions of Yahoo stock were likely to produce any competitive harm,\" the majority said.\nThe Republican dissenters, Maureen Ohlhausen and Joshua Wright, said that \"as a matter of prosecutorial discretion\" no punishment was warranted.\nThey said the majority's finding \"is likely to chill valuable shareholder advocacy\" by subjecting transactions that are \"highly unlikely\" to raise antitrust issues to heightened disclosure requirements.
