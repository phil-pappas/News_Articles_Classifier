The monthly inflation change rate for July 2015 was 2.3 percent compared to the 1.8 percent recorded for June 2015. \nGovernment Statistician Dr. Philomena Nyarko, addressing a media conference in Accra, explained that the main price drivers for the non-food inflation rate were housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels which recorded the highest rate of 27.1%, followed by transport’s surge to 25 %. \nAdditional upward pressure came from clothing and footwear, 24.9%; miscellaneous goods and services, 19.1 %; restaurants, cafes and hotels, 20.5%. \nOn food inflation, the main price drivers were mineral, water, soft drinks, fruit and vegetable juices which recorded 14.5%; coffee, tea and cocoa recorded 14.3%; food products had13.9 percent; the while figure for sugar, jam, honey, chocolate and confectionery stood at 13.8 percent. \nMeat and meat products recorded a figure of 11.6 %; milk, cheese and eggs had 9.6 %; and vegetables stood at 9.3 %. \nFor imported items, the inflation rate was 21.2 percent in July 2015 – the same as the rate recorded in June 2015 but 1.2 times that of the inflation rate for locally produced items, which stood at 17.0 percent in July 2015 compared with 15.5 percent recorded in June 2015. \nOn regional inflation, four regions including Central, Ashanti, Volta, and Upper East recorded inflation rates higher than the national average of 17.9%. \nAshanti Region recorded the highest food inflation rate in July 2015, while Volta Region record¬ed the highest non-food inflation rate in July 2015. \nThe Central Region recorded the highest year-on-year inflation rate of 19.8 percent, while the Northern Region recorded the lowest of 14.3%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T19:51:55.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
