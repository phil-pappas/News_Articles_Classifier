He said his forecast remains in place and will likely remain so until after the Fed hikes and the economy proves it can stand it. In terms of what exchange-traded funds to buy in the U.S. that correspond with a rangebound market, Schutte recommends the Powershares Buywrite ETF ( PBP ) . The PBP writes call options against the U.S. stock market and will see options prices increase with volatility while returns accrue in a sideways market. Outside the U.S., Schutte said increased bank lending and confidence in the Eurozone are still supportive of a further improving economy. He added that lower oil prices are stimulative and the weakened euro is helping exports. Similarly, he said, Japan is seeing continued progress on dislodging the corporate cash that has helped deflation become embedded in the system over the past few years. \"When you add the economy, the policy and the valuation together we continue to believe that Europe and for that matter Japan will outperform the U.S. for the rest of the year,\" said Schutte. Regarding the emerging markets, Schutte said he is neutral to very slight overweight despite the recent choppiness because the valuation likely reflects many worries that currently exist. In his view, emerging market economies will continue to struggle but lower rates and weaker currencies will help.
