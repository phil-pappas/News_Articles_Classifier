At least, that’s what most of the experts will tell you. You can get that foreign exposure very cheaply from the funds at the top of this list.With a $57 cost over ten years on a $10,000 investment, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ( VEA ) is the winner in efficiency. That’s not much more than you’d pay to own its mainstream U.S. stock fund ( Total Stock Market , VTI ).Second on our list, Vanguard Total International Stock ( VXUS ), differs from VEA by including emerging markets. Schwab International Equity ( SCHF ) is another respectable choice. It falls lower on the cost ranking, despite an attractive expense ratio, because of other cost factors (bid/ask spreads and the offset from securities lending).Not all investors are attentive to cost comparisons. The biggest foreign-stock fund is iShares MSCI EAFE ( EFA ), with $60 billion, notwithstanding that it costs nine times as much as VEA.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 VEA Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets 28,466 0.09 57 VXUS Vanguard Total International Stock 4,837 0.14 99 SCHF Schwab International Equity 4,243 0.08 106 VEU Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US 14,442 0.14 119 IEFA iShares Core MSCI EAFE 6,285 0.12 168 IXUS iShares Core MSCI Total Intl Stk 1,669 0.14 213 VT Vanguard Total World Stock 4,653 0.17 223 CWI SPDR MSCI ACWI ex-US 900 0.3 409 WDIV SPDR S&P Global Dividend 70 0.4 409 URTH iShares MSCI World 219 0.24 446 GWL SPDR S&P World ex-US 783 0.34 446 ACWX iShares MSCI ACWI ex-US 1,990 0.33 511 EFA iShares MSCI EAFE 60,388 0.33 513 ACWI iShares MSCI ACWI 6,404 0.33 518 IEIL iShares Enhanced International Large-Cap 82 0.35 535 DBEF Deutsche X-trackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Eq 12,921 0.35 567 HEFA iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EAFE 2,846 0.39 630 IOO iShares Global 100 1,748 0.4 666 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
