The company invited journalists to a Sept 9 event, where it is expected to unveil new iPhones.\nTesla was up 6.8 percent after its Model S P85D received the highest possible score in tests by Consumer Reports magazine.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,755 to 349. On the Nasdaq, 2,225 issues rose and 597 fell.\nThe S&P 500 showed one new 52-week high and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 15 new highs and 41 new lows.
