This project uses a combination of new facilities and training to help people run their businesses more effectively.' \nThis new facility in Ekpu is the latest example of Kosmos Energy working together with communities to create value and build the best foundation for sustainable businesses. A similar facility was commissioned and handed over to a 152-member women's group in Ankobra, in the Ellembele District, in January 2014. \nKosmos Energy is a leading independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on frontier and emerging areas along the Atlantic Margin. Its assets include existing production and other major development projects offshore Ghana, as well as exploration licenses with significant hydrocarbon potential offshore Ireland, Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal, Senegal, Suriname, and Western Sahara. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:36:09.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
