Spiritual awareness varies throughout the day: Study Selfies can give clues to your personality Researchers have identified a biomarker in pre-diabetic individuals that could help prevent them from developing Type 2 diabetes.\nThe researchers discovered that pre-diabetic people who were considered to be insulin resistant – unable to respond to the hormone insulin effectively – also had altered mitochondrial DNA.\nResearchers made the connection by analysing blood samples taken from 40 participants enrolled in the diaBEAT-it programme, a long-term study run by multiple researchers in the Fralin Translational Obesity Research Center at Virginia Tech, US.\nParticipants did not have diabetes or cardiovascular disease, but were pre-diabetic and showed signs of insulin resistance.\nBlood samples showed that participants had lower amounts of mitochondrial DNA with a higher amount of methylation – a process that can change the expression of genes and mitochondrial copy numbers in cells – than healthy people.\nMitochondrion is responsible for converting chemical energy from food into energy that cells can use.\n“If the body is insulin resistant, or unable to respond properly to insulin, it could affect a person’s mitochondrial function and overall energy levels,” said Zhiyong Cheng, an assistant professor of human, nutrition, foods, and exercise in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Tech and a Fralin Life Science Institute affiliate.\n“Mitochondrial alterations have previously been observed in obese individuals, but this is the first time we’ve made the molecular link between insulin resistance and mitochondrial DNA changes,” Cheng said.\nCheng and collaborator Fabio Almeida, an assistant professor of human nutrition, foods and exercise in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Tech and a Fralin Life Science Institute affiliate, believe this link could be important for treating pre-diabetic individuals to prevent Type 2 Diabetes.\n“There is no known cure for Type 2 diabetes, and early diagnosis and intervention is critical to prevent this disease,” said Almeida.\n“Discovery of the biomarker in obese, pre-diabetic individuals advances our understanding of how diabetes develops and provides evidence important for future diagnosis and intervention,” Almeida said.\nThe study was published in the journal Clinical Epigenetics.\n 22, 2015 7:40 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T22:28:11.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
