The company sells some of the most popular cigarette brands, including Dji Sam Soe and U Mild, in Indonesia, a country where smoking remains widespread. Sampoerna competes with PT Gudang Garam Tbk and Djarum Group in Indonesia.\nThe Indonesian stock exchange requires all listed firms to have a free float of at least 7.5 percent by Jan. 30, 2016. Sampoerna can meet the rule if Philip Morris renounces its rights.\nThe share sale would be the biggest in Indonesia since a $4.4 billion deal by PT Bakrie & Brothers Tbk in April 2008. It would also be the largest in Southeast Asia since Singapore lender Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp raised $2.6 billion from shareholders to bolster its capital last September.\nCredit Suisse, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Mandiri Sekuritas are working on the Sampoerna deal, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, has said.
