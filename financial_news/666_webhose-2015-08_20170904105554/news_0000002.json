Still, the S&P index is up 62 percent since the Fed last raised interest rates nearly a decade ago.\nThe euro zone's blue chip Euro STOXX50 index ended up 0.18 percent for the week and is up 15.9 percent for the year. The MSCI world equity index lost 1.0 percent for the week and is up only 1.2 percent for the year.\n\"The sharp declines in oil and metal prices were particularly harmful to energy, industrials, and materials companies, while consumer-driven firms cited little incremental increases in consumer spending on the back of lower gasoline prices,\" Goldman Sach's David Kostin noted.\n\"A stronger US dollar continued to serve as a headwind to earnings, a trend which managements expect to persist,\" he said.\nCorporate revenues remain a worry also but with S&P500 index companies such as General Motors, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, IBM, Proctor & Gamble, Citigroup, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Oracle, and Caterpillar all reporting revenues down year-over-year, investors can no longer blame the energy sector alone for negligible returns this year.\nAfter 80 percent of U.S. companies reported for the quarter, S&P500 index company sales are seen declining year-over-year by 3.1 percent, the second consecutive quarter of negative growth.\n\"The last two times we saw declines in revenue growth were back in 2008 and 2001, during U.S. recessions,\" Charlie Bilello, research director at Pension Partners LLC in New York noted. \"Today the U.S. economy is still expanding, but corporate sales are not,\" he said.\nThe U.S. stockmarket is up 215 percent from its March 2009 low and there are many explanations for what is continuing to support prices, with share buybacks seen as one of the main props.\nLast year alone, U.S. companies spent $553 billion in stock buybacks, the second-largest amount on record. Deutsche Bank's Binky Chadha argues that the resulting shrinking supply of stocks is one of the main supports for U.S. equities.\nThe volume of stock buybacks is outweighing the increasing pace at which private equity funds are taking advantage of high U.S. equity valuations to unload businesses.\nIn the first half of this year U.S.-based private equity firms unloaded $195 billion worth of stock, according to a report by the Private Equity Growth Capital Council. Private equity \"exit volumes\" are up 46 percent from the same period in 2014 and up 275 percent from the same period in 2013.\nHistorically, high margin debt levels have often preceded trouble in many asset classes and after a decline earlier this year to below 2007 levels, the ratio has climbed again to heights above those of 2000.\n\"None of this is necessarily an indicator of trouble, but it's worth noting that risks appear to have increased over the past several months,\" said Brad McMillan, of Commonwealth Financial Network in Massachusetts.\nOIL MARKET RUNNING OUT OF STORAGE\nMeanwhile the energy sector continues to suffer from a fresh slide in crude oil prices.\nInternational benchmark Brent crude also lost another 7.0 percent to $48.50 a barrel last week and like the U.S. benchmark WTI is now not far from the six year low seen earlier this year.\nThe worry now is not just an oversupplied world oil market but the lack of further storage capacity.\n\"We estimate that the industry has added around 170 million barrels of petroleum to crude and product storage tanks since January and around 50 million barrels to clean and dirty floating storage,\" Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie warned.\n\"Historically, once storage capacity is breached across all crude and products, supply must be brought back below demand immediately,\" he said.\nThe result is U.S. energy companies are planning more layoffs and more than $200 billion in spending on new oil projects have been cancelled or suspended, according to energy sector consultants Wood Mackenzie.\n(Reporting by Clive McKeef; Editing by Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:15:56.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
