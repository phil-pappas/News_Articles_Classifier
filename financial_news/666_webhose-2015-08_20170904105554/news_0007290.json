Around midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.38 percent, the S&P 500 lost 1.78 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank 2.06 percent. \n\"Panic selling has hit US stock markets which tanked on the open as global growth concerns continued to weigh on sentiment following disappointing Chinese economic data,\" said Lawler. \n- 'Catching falling knives' - \nWeak Chinese manufacturing data gave Asian stock markets a heavy knock Friday, adding to fears about the health of the world economy. \nShanghai shares closed down 4.27 percent at 3,507.74 points, ending their worst week since 2011 as worries over the flagging Chinese economy and the possibility of weaker government support weighed on sentiment. \nHong Kong fell 1.53 percent to finish the day at 22,409.62 points -- its lowest point since May 2014. Tokyo shares fell 2.98 percent to 19,435.83, a more than three-month low, down 5.28 percent on the week. \n\"With more Chinese-led carnage on the markets today only the very brave are venturing into equities as buying stocks is currently like catching falling knives,\" said Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor. \nMeanwhile on foreign currency markets, the dollar slipped against the euro after the US Federal Reserve earlier this week dampened expectations of a US interest rate rise next month. \nThe euro jumped to $1.1354 -- after earlier hitting $1.1363, its highest level in two months -- from $1.1141 late on Thursday in New York. \nThe European single currency strengthened despite renewed unrest in Greece, where Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced his resignation on Thursday and called for snap elections. \nTsipras went on the offensive to defend the country's massive bailout after it triggered a rebellion within his own hard-left party. \nA leader who remains popular with the electorate, Tsipras had been widely expected to call polls in a bid to regain office with a stronger hand. \n\"Having secured... funding to help pay the ECB yesterday and also help recapitalise the banks the path now remains clear for the still fairly popular Greek prime minister to refresh his mandate,\" Hewson added. \nTsipras' announcement came on the same day the debt-crippled country received its first 13 billion euros ($14.7 billion) in bailout cash, effectively starting the mammoth rescue package agreed to last month, worth around 86 billion euros over the next three years. \nThe money arrived just in time to allow the Greek government to make a key debt repayment of 3.4 billion euros to the European Central Bank. \nAthens' main stocks index on Friday sank 2.49 percent to close at 635.31 points (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:40:33.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
