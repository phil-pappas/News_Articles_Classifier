Glenn Hunt \"We do get an influx of tourists, but there is just our store and a few retail outlets here,\" Mr Rees said.\n\"The region does have high unemployment. They are just lazy bastards – if you want a job you can find one.\"\nAcross the country, mortgage arrears are at below usual levels, due in large part to a low cash rate of 2 per cent and no recent rate rise surprises.\nThis means that most people who have fallen behind in their mortgage repayments have been affected by a change in job circumstances, marital or relationship status, or have faced an unexpected expense.\n Budgewoi is the worst-performing post code in the country. Simone De Peak SDP Fitch analyst James Zanesi​ said most of the worst performing areas were either in low socioeconomic areas, or were heavily reliant on single industries such as tourism which can be volatile.\n\"Often the postcodes which are the worst performing are different to the rest of the nation,\" Mr Zanesi said.\nFitch's quarterly report showed a nine basis point rise in delinquency rates compared with the previous quarter; a common trend for the March report given over-spending during the December holiday period can push home owners into arrears at the start of the calendar year.\n\"Christmas spending and the general cost-of-living affected the mortgage performance of regions in states that showed strong sensitivity to mortgage rates – such as north-west of Melbourne and south-west of Brisbane – due to socio-economic factors like high unemployment,\" the report said.\nAFR Graphic \"The only exceptions were those in Sydney, where the booming housing market has significantly benefited mortgage performance.\"\nThe strong Sydney and Melbourne property markets appear to have given some home owners breathing space on their mortgage repayments, given they have suddenly found themselves with additional equity in their own homes.\nThis contrasts with Tasmania, which currently has the second highest unemployment rate of any state at 6.6 per cent (seasonally adjusted), and low house price growth.\nSouth Australia's unemployment rate is 7.9 per cent.\nHomeowners in strong markets like Sydney are reporting fewer mortgage arrears. Inner city residents are also unlikely to be behind on their mortgages. iStock There is evidence that the slowdown in the resources sector is biting home owners with properties in resources towns. A previous hotspot for mortgage arrears, Queensland's Gold Coast is improving in line with property prices, while there is more mortgage stress outside of Brisbane.\n\"Given that similar developments are taking place in regional Western Australia and Northern Territory, it is likely that the slowdown of the Australian mining industry is among the reasons for the trend,\" the report said.\nMost inner city areas fared well in the survey. Central Perth, and regions around inner Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne were among the nation's best performing areas, with very few home owners in arrears.\nRead next: The top 100 postcodes at risk of mortgage default", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:05:12.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
