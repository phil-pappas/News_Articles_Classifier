Healthcare-related deal-flow at both the mega-deal level as well as in the middle-markets continues to lead almost all other sectors. All of these issues will be the focus of iiBIG's fall \"Investment and M&A Opportunities in HEALTHCARE” conference in Indianapolis November 5-6th. \nFor example on the mega-deal side Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly recently announced plans to significantly increase its footprint in the San Diego biotech corridor; Teva announced plans to acquire Allergan's generic drug division; Anthem strikes a deal for Cigna; and Pfizer and AbbVie continue to stalk deals. In the middle-markets hospital/hospital mergers and hospital acquisitions of physician practices are robust; and healthcare products and services companies are pursuing growth-through-acquisition and tuck-in strategies in record numbers.  Perhaps one of the most interesting the phenomenon of payer/provider convergence is becoming more widespread as cost-containment continues to be a major deal-driver.\nIndianapolis home to a high concentration of healthcare-related businesses is becoming recognized as one of the nation's leading healthcare hubs.  Moreover Indianapolis has been the center of some of the most active and interesting M&A deal-flow in recent months.
