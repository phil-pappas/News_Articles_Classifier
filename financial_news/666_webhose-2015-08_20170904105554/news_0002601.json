This was revised up from an initial estimate of 0.6pc. \nThe second quarter figure was lower than the 0.2pc expansion predicted by economists. Many said France was unlikely to post growth of much more than 1pc this year. \nINSEE, France's statistics office, said the marked deceleration was driven by a sharp slowdown in consumer spending , which grew by just 0.1pc during the quarter, following growth of 0.9pc in the first three months of 2015. \nPublic and private investment slowed, and INSEE said domestic demand contributed just 0.1 percentage points to GDP growth in the second quarter, which was much lower than the 0.6 percentage points contribution in the previous three months. \nMichel Sapin, the French finance minister, said France remained on track to reach its growth target of 1pc this year, with the \"rhythm of growth\" expected to pick up to 1.5pc by the end of 2015. \nMr Sapin highlighted that growth in the first half of 2015 was the fastest in three years, although he expressed concerns that the current rate of expansion was not enough to reduce unemployment, which has remained above 10pc for almost three years. \n\"Today’s zero figure is a rather bad surprise, dampening hopes of significantly above 1pc GDP growth this year,\" said Julien Manceaux, an economist at ING. \nIt came as official figures showed Germany expanded by 0.4pc in the second quarter, which was slightly lower than estimates for growth of 0.5pc. \nThe European Central Bank's €1.1 trillion bond buying programme , which has helped to weaken the euro in recent months, boosted German exports in the second quarter. \"Exports of goods recorded a particular increase compared with the previous quarter,\" Destatis said in a statement. \nEurozone finance ministers will meet in Brussels today to ratify Greece's third bail-out in five years. Greek MPs voted in favour of the rescue package after an all night parliamentary session in Athens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T11:34:13.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
