Beijing's official growth target is 7 percent for this year, but some economists estimate current levels are closer to half that. \nCombined exports and imports for the first seven months of 2015 fell 7.2 percent from the same period last year, compared with Beijing's full-year target of 6 percent growth. \n\"The possibility of exports to see year-on-year decline in some months could not be ruled out. But we will still see export growth for the whole year,\" Commerce Ministry spokesman Shen Danyang told a regular monthly briefing. \n\"For the whole year, the foreign trade will face more severe situation than we expected.\" \nOnly last month, the ministry predicted exports would improve in the second half of this year from the first half. \nCENTRAL BANK INJECTS LIQUIDITY \nThe Shanghai market closed up 1.2 percent and Shenzhen jumped 2.2 percent. The benchmark CSI300 index , comprising blue-chip stocks from both markets, rose 1.6 percent. \nThe rebound followed news the central bank would offer more medium-term funds to banks, in addition to a 120 billion yuan ($19 billion) injection of funds into money markets on Tuesday. \nSources familiar with the medium-term funding plan said this would help offset the drain on liquidity caused by China's unexpected devaluation of the yuan last week. \nThe prospect of further weakening has prompted investors to swap yuan into U.S. dollars. \nCapital outflows from China are expected to increase as investors grow more pessimistic over the outlook for the currency and the economy, and calls are growing for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to ease policy more swiftly and aggressively. \nHighlighting growing anxiety, money-market interest rates ticked higher on Wednesday, despite the fresh fund injections from the central bank. The weighted average benchmark seven-day repurchase agreement rate rose four basis points to 2.53 percent. \nThe PBOC devalued the currency on Aug. 11, within a few days of the poor July export data and other official figures showing factory-gate prices continued their three-year slide in July, touching a six-year low. \nA week later, the central bank is still struggling to control the fallout. Though it insists the yuan has no reason to fall further, most economists believe there is political pressure to let it slowly slide, which will put more competitive pressure on China's export-reliant Asian neighbours. \nThe yuan has fallen 3 percent against the dollar since the eve of the devaluation, but that marks only a partial reversal of its gains over the past 12 months, especially against currencies of major trading partners Japan and the euro zone. \nBank of America Merrill Lynch said on Wednesday the yuan could be allowed to depreciate to 6.5 to the dollar by the end of this year and 6.9 by end 2016, from around 6.40 now. \nThe devaluation last week triggered falls in other Asian currencies such as those of Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan, fuelling fears of a currency war. \nOn Wednesday, Vietnam devalued the dong for the third time this year as authorities sought to support a languid export sector facing fresh challenges from the Chinese devaluation. \n($1 = 6.3993 Chinese yuan) \n(Additional reporting by Xiaoyi Shao in BEIJING and Kazunori Takada in SHANGHAI; Writing by Mark Bendeich; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T11:29:33.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
