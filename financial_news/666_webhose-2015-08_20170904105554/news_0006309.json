It can also help unlock the money kept for relief,” he said.\nAmarnath said Bihar faced major floods in 1987, 1995, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2008. Around 1.5 crore people in the state are affected by floods every year, which also cause damage to 3 lakh metric tonnes of paddy.\nThe project aims to integrate hi-tech modelling and satellite imagery with other data to predetermine flood thresholds, which could lead to effective compensation payout schemes for low-income, flood-prone communities.\nIWMI has partnered International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Institute of Water Modelling, Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), IRPI, MCII, various insurance companies, foreign universities and several stakeholders, and has plans to implement the project in South Asian countries, Amarnath said.\nRajya Sabha member and former Union Minister CP Thakur praised the efforts by IWMI in this regard and suggested they broad-base the concept to include landless poor engaged in agriculture activities as, otherwise, the scheme will not be successful.\n“IBFI should consider the poor also and focus on the plight of agriculture after floods. It could be successful only if poverty is also alleviated,” Thakur added.\nNagan Prasad of the Flood Management and Improvement Support Centre (FMISC), Pramod Aggrawal of IWMI, Pramod Kumar Joshi from IFPRI, Sebabrata Sarkar from SwissRe – India and several other experts from the field of water, flood management and insurance sectors spoke on the occasion.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 3:51 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T01:30:23.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
