Activist investors have been around for years, of course. David Herro, who now leads Harris Associates, became one of the forefathers of the scene after a bruising battle with the founders of advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, for instance. Yet, despite expectations that activists would become the principal scourge of sleepy, underperforming UK companies, these self-styled corporate crusaders have to date mostly engaged in skirmishes. \nThe only really notable campaigns have been those waged against First Group, the bus and train operator; Electra (Tel Aviv: ELTR.TA - news ) , the private equity house; and RSA, the insurer. It’s probably fair to say that those few had mixed results. Certainly, none resulted in any major changes. \nHowever, 2015 could turn out to be the year that war broke out and boardrooms across the FTSE found themselves under full siege. \nThe San Francisco-based fund ValueAct has become the largest shareholder in Rolls Royce (LSE: RR.L - news ) in the last few weeks and also built a big position in Smiths Group, the engineering company. At the moment, it is unclear what ValueAct’s plans are but it has a history of pressing for companies to put themselves up for sale. \nThe manoeuvres should at least ring immediate alarm bells across the City. If stake-building fails to rouse British boardrooms, then consider the scale of some of the targets that find themselves in the firing line. \nDespite the 42pc fall in its share price since the start of the year, Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) is still valued at £23bn, while Rolls Royce has a stockmarket value of nearly £15bn, and Smiths - at £4.7bn - is hardly a minnow. These are all big, established UK companies, so suddenly it seems like all but the upper ranks of the FTSE are fair game. \nThe funds leading the charge against corporate Britain have, however, shifted tactics. For years, they attempted to bully and shame their targets into submission, often publicly. \nSome campaigns have been brutal. In October 2013, after becoming Sotheby’s largest shareholder, Daniel Loeb, founder of Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund giant, effectively declared war on William Ruprecht, who had led the venerable auction house for more than three decades. \nLoeb has made it his life’s work to publicly humiliate chief executives he thinks are suppressing shareholder value through greed, or incompetence. \nIn a letter, later published in full in the press, he demanded Ruprecht’s resignation. Loeb claimed Sotheby’s had suffered from “a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels,” and slammed Ruprecht’s generous compensation package, including perks such as a country club membership, which he said “invokes the long-gone era of imperial CEOs”. \nHowever, Loeb’s greatest moral indignation was saved for a dinner held by the company’s senior management at one of Manhattan’s top restaurants, where he claimed they “feasted on organic delicacies and imbibed vintage wines” and racked up a bill of several hundred thousand pounds. \nAlthough few activists are as outspoken as Loeb, most tend to be more confrontational than the typical so-called “long” institutional investors. However, the brash approach has been less effective in the more conservative and stuffy boardrooms of Europe and the UK, where pushy outsiders can find it difficult to exert any real influence. \nAs a result, some activists including Loeb have softened their tone and adopted a more civil style in preparation for a new era of transatlantic crossings. The more merciful style has already boosted their success rate back home. \nAccording to research by JP Morgan, the average number of board seats sought by an activist per campaign increased to 3.7, up from 3.2 in 2010, while the average number of seats won per campaign increased to 44pc from 23pc over the same period. \nThe improved results have come amid a surge in the number of funds pursuing activist strategies. In 2015 alone, 50 new activist investors have emerged and the number of activist campaigns had reached a six-year high. \nThe amount of capital raised by activists has also jumped since the start of decade. In the second quarter of 2015, activist hedge funds had almost $130bn under management, a 177pc increase from $46.8bn in 2010. \nSo who else then might be targeted? There are rumours that the drinks giant Diageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) could be vulnerable under new boss Ivan Menezes as investor impatience with sluggish growth builds. Hedge funds have also been circling the big supermarkets for the last couple of years as they struggle against massive structural decline. \nActivists will often propose a more radical strategy such as a sale of the company or a break-up but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right path for a company follow. But if it means management are forced out their comfort zone then their input should be welcomed - even when they, sometimes, forget to be polite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T22:15:44.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
