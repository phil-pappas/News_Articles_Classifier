Edwina Pickles Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Lower company tax and a review of generous superannuation tax concessions won broad support from business, unions, welfare and community groups, which urged all political parties to put the country ahead of self-interest and undertake meaningful economic reform.\nThe participants at the National Reform Summit in Sydney urged that every option for tax reform remain on the table and none ruled out \"for reasons of political expediency\".\nAmid warnings from such key economists such as Ross Garnaut and former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson that the forecast return to surplus early next decade was fraught, the summit concluded in its final statement that there needed to be a realistic plan to return the budget to structural surplus over the next decade.\n\"Governments should achieve real progress in fiscal reform, not paper progress through unrealistic budget assumptions,\" said a statement agreed to by the main participants.\nRBA governor Glenn Stevens, Martin Parkinson and Peter Harris. Louie Douvis They proposed using the next two years to set out a plan for returning to structural balance, followed by an eight-year transition period.\nThe summit, sponsored by The Australian Financial Review , The Australian and KPMG, sought to focus on areas of common agreement and skirted around more contentious areas of climate change and industrial relations.\nHowever, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens told the summit the nation could not avoid looking at industrial relations changes to help boost growth and employment without hurting basic fairness.\n\"There is no avoiding the need to have the right labour market arrangements,\" Mr Stevens told the 90 delegates representing unions, business, industry, welfare and seniors groups.\n Ross Garnaut advocated an economy-wide carbon price to pay down debt while Labor leader Bill Shorten used his speech to say climate change had to be part of any reform discussion. Louie Douvis Carbon tax Professor Garnaut advocated an economy-wide carbon price to pay down debt while Labor leader Bill Shorten used his speech to say climate change had to be part of any reform discussion.\nThe summit was organised amid growing frustration with the glacial pace of economic reform in recent years. Business is especially frustrated by many options for tax reform already being ruled out by the government and opposition while the tax white paper process is still underway. For example, Labor has ruled the GST off limits while the government will not touch superannuation tax breaks.\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said at the conclusion of the summit that everyone agreed \"we're not going to stand by and let another election be a race to the bottom of what we are not going to do\".\nGed Kearney and Martin Parkinson in discussion. Louie Douvis Mr Parkinson said Australia was at risk of \"sleepwalking into a mess\".\nDuring his contribution to the tax reform debate, Mr Parkinson said Australia's tax system was fundamentally the same as it was in the 1950s and had become too reliant on company income tax and personal income tax.\nBoth, he said, were \"inimical to productivity and participation and inimical to growth\".\nIn a spirited defence of lower company tax rate, Mr Parkinson said one half of a company tax cut \"ends up in the hands of workers\" through jobs and wages.\nTony Sheldon and Catherine Livingstone Louie Douvis While there was a general agreement on company tax, there remained disagreement on how to fund any cut. Most business figures advocated a GST increase while the ACTU and the Australian Council of Social Services were opposed.\nDrag Rio Tinto managing director Phil Edmands said Australia's 30 per cent company tax rate was simply uncompetitive compared with nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Asia. \"It's going to have to come down if we don't want to disincentivise investment,\" he said.\nHe said replacing the revenue with an increased GST would represent overall less of a drag on the economy.\n\"By moving to greater reliance on the GST, we could significantly increase Australia's capacity to compete and grow\" while improving services and the social safety net.\n\"We have to take the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be,\" he said.\nGrattan Institute chief executive John Daley said there should be no more proposals to cut taxes unless they were accompanied by suggestions on which taxes to raise to replace the revenue. The GST was off limits, he said, because it had effectively been spent four times already through various proposals.\n\"Unless we compel people to talk of trade-offs in tax, they will continue to talk their own books,\" he said.\nThe summit was forthright about the need to examine superannuation tax concessions as part of a broader review of the retirement income system. This will put pressure on the Abbott government which has ruled out making any changes this term or the next after Labor promised to take to the next election plans for concessional tax increases for the highest earners and a 15 per cent tax on all earnings above $75,000 in retirement.\nMr Shorten hit back at calls by NSW and South Australia to increase the GST to fund health, saying increasing a tax to generate revenue was not reform.\n\"If reform was as simple as increasing the GST, we should all go home,\" he said. \"There are plenty of low-performing economies with high GSTs, where the only net economic benefit here would be a small dividend on consumption.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-26T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:41:46.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
