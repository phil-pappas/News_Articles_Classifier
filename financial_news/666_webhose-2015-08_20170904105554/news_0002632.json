Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in the company, whose reputation was tarnished when it failed to deliver security at the London Olympics in 2012, closed 14.5p, or 5.4pc, lower at 255.4p. \nIn the broader market, equities bounced back after the People’s Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) attempted to ease investor concerns by claiming there was no further basis for further depreciation of the currency. However, David Madden of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) warned “the move higher in the stock market feels more like bargain hunting rather than a genuine feeling that China’s economy will improve, despite its overnight bounce”. \nThe CAC in Paris jumped 1.3pc, while the German DAX advanced 0.8pc. Despite making gains in early trade, the FTSE 100 was dragged lower in the afternoon, closing 2.86 points lower at 6,568.33. * How China devalued the yuan for the first time in two decades, and why it matters CocaCola Hellenic Bottling Company became the darling of the FTSE 100, climbing 97p to £14.20, after half-year results impressed investors . Volumes grew by 3.8pc, with strong performances from Nigeria, Romania and Ukraine more than offsetting the weakness in Russia. Only last week, Goldman Sachs downgraded the drinks bottler, citing a subdued consumer environment in Russia and Nigeria. \nTUI AG (LSE: TUI.L - news ) also recorded significant gains, up 69p to £11.14, as third-quarter pre-tax profits rose by 18pc to £194m . Despite the impact of the terror attacks in Tunisia earlier in the summer, which wiped €10m off earnings, the group said full-year profit growth would come in at the upper end of its guidance. \nHowever, Mike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, warned “uncertainty remains over the other favourite Greece, with performance hindered by painful bail-out negotiations, a referendum and imposition of painful capital controls”. \nElsewhere, a number of stocks were hit by trading ex-dividend. Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) , which has also been bruised by falling commodity prices, slipped 95.5p to £24.59, BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) fell 20p to £10.80, Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) lost 15p to close at £11.51 and Diageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) slid 13p to £17.62. On the mid-cap index Greene King (Other OTC: GKNGY - news ) lost 21p to finish at 845.5p, while Berkeley Group was off by 59p. \nEquipment rental group Ashtead , which was also trading ex-dividend, was knocked as two brokers revised its target price downwards. UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) revealed, through its research team Evidence Lab, the level of competition Ashtead faces in the United States. \nThe bank reckons the average Sunbelt branch, which Ashtead acquired in 1990, faces competition from around 12 other branches within a 30 minute drive, whereas its rival United Rentals (NYSE: URI - news ) has only 2.8 branches in the same radius. Rory McKenzie, of UBS, said “we struggle to believe Ashtead will not be affected by the increase in rental equipment supply and localised demand weakness in the oil and gas markets”. \nSeparately, Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its target price to 820p from 1,000p due to comments made by rival United Rentals, which pointed to weakening trends in the equipment rental space. Shares fell 27p, or 2.8pc, to 951p. \nCineworld , 7.4pc better at 589p, enjoyed a blockbuster day, rising to the top of the mid-cap index. Traders were buying into news of double-digit growth in the box office , with Jurassic World, Fifty Shades of Grey and Fast (Shanghai: 600391.SS - news ) and Furious 7 among the strongest titles released in the first half of the year. With half-year pre-tax soaring 74pc to £39.3m, Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) hiked its target to 620p from 540p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T04:50:51.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
