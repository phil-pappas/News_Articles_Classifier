There is no impact on the employees and the facilities,\" it told AFP in an emailed statement. \"Operations at Airbus Tianjin run normally today.\" \nBut it added: \"The potential impact on logistics via Tianjin Port... is currently under investigation.\" \nJapanese auto giant Toyota has a joint venture car plant in Binhai, but an executive with the operation told AFP the factory was on summer vacation and was not affected in the explosion. \nNeither Volkswagen nor Renault officials were immediately available to comment when contacted by AFP Thursday. \nThe Binhai New Area covers 2,270 square kilometres (876 square miles) and has a coastline of 153 kilometres (95 miles), the website says. \nIt is focussed on eight main industries including aerospace and aviation, electronics and information, equipment manufacturing, petrochemical and new energy and material. \nChinese supercomputer Tianhe-1A was also shut down, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing officials at the National Supercomputing Centre in Binhai. \nThe machine itself was intact after the explosion and running normally, Xinhua said, but the building housing it was damaged and it was switched off due to security concerns (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:33:28.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
