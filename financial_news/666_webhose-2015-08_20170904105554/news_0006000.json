MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThe following is a discussion of our business, financial position and results of operations as of and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") contained in our 2014 Form 10-K. In this MD&A, \"$\" means U.S. dollars unless specified otherwise. Restatement of Previously Reported Condensed Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements As disclosed in the Company's 2014 Form 10-K, the Company restated its condensed unaudited consolidated statement of operations, condensed unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed unaudited consolidated balance sheet and condensed unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows for the three month period ended March 31, 2014 and presented these restated results in Note 2 - Independent Investigation of the Audit Committee and Related Restatements of the 2014 Form 10-K. The condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this report, along with the related notes thereto as of and for the three month period ended March 31, 2014, as well as the financial information in this MD&A reflect these restatements. The restatement adjustments had the following effects on the 2014 period: � a reduction of $6.2 million in revenue associated with changes in cost-to-complete estimates on a large and complex Electrical Transmission segment project accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method; \n� an increase in costs of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $0.3 million, and an increase in other income, net, of $0.1 million; \n� a reduction in income tax expense of $2.4 million representing the tax effect of the adjustments; and \n� a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.05 cents each. \nIn addition, there were the following balance sheet effects: � a reclassification adjustment associated with cost-to-complete estimates that decreased costs and earnings in excess of billings and other current liabilities by $4.2 million; and \n� a reclassification of a $6.8 million earn-out liability that had been earned as of March 31, 2014 from long-term to current liabilities, as well as other immaterial adjustments within various segments. \nBusiness Overview We are a leading infrastructure construction company operating mainly throughout North America across a range of industries. Our primary activities include the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of communications, energy and utility infrastructure, such as: wireless, wireline/fiber and satellite communications; petroleum and natural gas pipeline infrastructure; electrical utility transmission and distribution; power generation; and industrial infrastructure. Our customers are primarily in these industries. Including our predecessor companies, we have been in business for more than 85 years. We offer our services primarily under the MasTec service mark and, as of March 31, 2015, we had approximately 16,400 employees and 475 locations. We have been consistently ranked among the top specialty contractors by Engineering News-Record for the past several years. We provide our services to a diversified base of customers. We often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs that require the construction or installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system. Revenue from non-recurring, project specific work may experience greater variability than master service agreement work due to the need to replace the revenue as projects are completed. If we are not able to replace work from completed projects with new project work, we may not be able to maintain our current revenue levels or our current level of capacity and resource utilization. We actively review our backlog of project work and take appropriate action to minimize such exposure. We manage our continuing operations under five operating segments, which represent our five reportable segments: (1) Communications; (2) \nOil and Gas; (3) Electrical Transmission; (4) Power Generation and Industrial and (5) Other. This structure is generally focused on broad end-user markets for our labor-based construction services. In the first quarter of 2015, we reevaluated the segment classification of a non-controlled Canadian joint venture that we acquired in 2014. The results of operations of this joint venture were formerly reported within the Oil and Gas segment and now will be reported within the Other segment. Accordingly, throughout this report, segment information for prior periods has been updated to conform to the current period presentation. The Communications segment performs engineering, construction and maintenance of communications infrastructure primarily related to wireless and wireline/fiber communications and install-to-the-home customers. We perform engineering, construction and maintenance services on oil and natural gas pipelines and processing facilities for the energy and utilities industries through the Oil and Gas segment. The Electrical Transmission segment primarily serves the energy and utility industries through the engineering, construction and maintenance of electrical transmission lines and substations. The Power Generation and Industrial segment primarily serves energy, utility and other end-markets through the installation and construction of conventional and renewable power facilities, related electrical transmission infrastructure, ethanol facilities and various types of industrial infrastructure. The Other segment primarily includes a proportionately consolidated joint venture and other small business units that perform construction services for a variety of end-markets in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere internationally. \nSee Note 14 - Segments and Related Information and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for details pertaining to segment classifications, as well as operating results by segment and significant customer concentrations. Backlog Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog includes amounts under master service and other service agreements in addition to construction projects and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue attributable to a contractual joint venture that we proportionately consolidate. We determine the amount of backlog for work under master service and other service agreements based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. The following table presents 18-month backlog by reportable segment as of the dates indicated, which has been updated to conform to the current period presentation. March 31, December 31, March 31, 2015 2014 2014 Reportable Segment (in millions): As Restated Communications $ 2,862 $ 2,965 $ 3,000 Oil and Gas 850 756 605 Electrical Transmission 212 296 400 Power Generation and Industrial 261 298 202 Other 25 31 17 Estimated 18-month backlog $ 4,210 $ 4,346 $ 4,224 \nWe expect to realize approximately 60% of our March 31, 2015 backlog in 2015. Our backlog estimates include amounts under master service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services; and most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Approximately 63% and 69% of our estimated backlog as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, represented amounts under master service or other service agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we experienced a combination of cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements within our Communications segment as a result of changes in current and planned wireless customer spending. There can be no assurance as to our customers' requirements or that our estimates are accurate. In addition, timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer delays, regulatory requirements and other project related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. For example, due to recent volatility in the oil markets, certain oil and gas projects initially planned for 2015 were canceled or deferred. \nBacklog is not a term recognized under U.S. GAAP; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Economic, Industry and Market Factors We closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers. General economic and market conditions can negatively affect demand for our customers' products and services, which can lead to rationalization of our customers' capital and maintenance budgets in certain end-markets. Fluctuations in market prices for oil, gas and other fuel sources can affect demand for our services, in particular, pipeline and power generation construction services. These fluctuations, as well as the highly competitive nature of our industry, particularly when work is deferred, can result, and in recent years, has resulted, in lower bids and lower profit on the services we provide. In the face of increased pricing pressure, we strive to maintain our profit margins through productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Fluctuations in market prices for oil, gas and other energy sources can affect demand for our services, in particular, pipeline and power generation construction services. Other market and industry factors, such as: (i) changes to our customers' capital spending plans; (ii) mergers and acquisitions among the customers that we serve, such as the July 2015 acquisition of DIRECTV� by AT&T; (iii) access to capital for customers in the industries we serve; (iv) changes in technology, \ntax and other incentives; (v) renewable energy portfolio standards; and (vi) new or changing regulatory requirements affecting the industries we serve, can also affect demand for our services. While we actively monitor economic, industry and market factors affecting our business, we cannot predict the impact such factors may have on our future results of operations, liquidity and cash flows and we may be unable to fully mitigate or take advantage of changes in these factors. \nImpact of Seasonality and Cyclical Nature of Business Our revenue and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations. These variations are influenced by weather, customer spending patterns, bidding seasons, project schedules and timing, in particular, for large non-recurring projects and holidays. Typically, our revenue is lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions cause project delays. Revenue in the second quarter is typically higher than in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity. The third and fourth quarters are typically the most productive quarters of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and weather is normally more accommodating to construction projects. In the fourth quarter, many projects tend to be completed by customers seeking to spend their capital budgets before the end of the year, which generally has a positive impact on our revenue. However, the holiday season and inclement weather can cause delays, which can reduce revenue and increase costs on affected projects. Any quarter may be positively or negatively affected by adverse or unusual weather patterns, such as excessive rainfall or warm winter weather, making it difficult to predict quarterly revenue and margin variations. \nAdditionally, our industry can be highly cyclical. Fluctuations in end-user demand within the industries we serve, or in the supply of services within those industries, can impact demand for our services. As a result, our business may be adversely affected by industry declines or by delays in new projects. Variations in project schedules or unanticipated changes in project schedules, in particular, in connection with large construction and installation projects, can create fluctuations in revenue, which may adversely affect us in a given period, even if not in total. In addition, revenue from master service agreements, while generally predictable, can be subject to volatility. The financial condition of our customers and their access to capital; variations in project margins; regional, national and global economic and market conditions; regulatory or environmental influences; and acquisitions, dispositions or strategic investments can also materially affect quarterly results. Accordingly, our operating results in any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period. Critical Accounting Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Given that management estimates, by their nature, involve judgments regarding future uncertainties, actual results may differ from these estimates if conditions change or if certain key assumptions used in making these estimates ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Our accounting policies and critical accounting estimates are reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Refer to Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference, and to our 2014 Form 10-K for discussion of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our accounting estimates pertaining to revenue and cost recognition from percentage-of-completion projects, including related project profit or loss; allowances for doubtful accounts; fair value estimates in connection with business acquisitions, in particular, estimated values of net assets acquired and estimated liabilities for future earn-out obligations; valuations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets; income taxes; self-insurance liabilities; and litigation and other contingencies are the most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and require significant or complex judgment and estimates on the part of management. Results of Operations Comparison of Quarterly Results The following table reflects our consolidated results of operations in dollar and percentage of revenue terms for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in millions). Our consolidated results of operations are not necessarily comparable from period to period due to the impact of recent acquisitions and the impact of certain other items, which are described more fully in the comparison of results section below. \nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 2014 As Restated Revenue $ 1,003.3 100.0 % $ 957.8 100.0 % Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization 886.4 88.4 % 841.3 87.8 % Depreciation and amortization 42.6 4.2 % 33.5 3.5 % General and administrative expenses 74.0 7.4 % 53.3 5.6 % Interest expense, net 11.0 1.1 % 12.0 1.3 % Other income - - % (2.1 ) (0.2 )% (Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes $ (10.7 ) (1.1 )% $ 19.8 2.1 % Benefit from (provision for) income taxes 4.4 0.4 % (7.5 ) (0.8 )% Net (loss) income from continuing operations $ (6.4 ) (0.6 )% $ 12.3 1.3 % Net loss from discontinued operations - - % (0.2 ) 0.0 % Net (loss) income $ (6.4 ) (0.6 )% $ 12.1 1.3 % Net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests (0.1 ) 0.0 % 0.0 0.0 % Net (loss) income attributable to MasTec, Inc. $ (6.3 ) (0.6 )% $ 12.1 1.3 % \nWe review our operating results by reportable segment. See Note 14 - Segments and Related Information in the notes to the condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. Our reportable segments are: (1) Communications; (2) Oil and Gas; (3) Electrical Transmission; (4) Power Generation and Industrial and (5) Other. Management's review of reportable segment results includes analyses of trends in revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. We calculate EBITDA for segment reporting purposes consistently with our consolidated EBITDA calculation. See discussion of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures following the comparison of results discussion below. The following table, which has been updated for prior periods to conform to the current period presentation, presents revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin by reportable segment for our continuing operations for the periods indicated (dollar amounts in millions): For the Three Months Ended March 31, Revenue EBITDA and EBITDA Margin 2015 2014 2015 2014 Reportable Segment: As Restated As Restated Communications $ 469.9 $ 447.1 $ 51.7 11.0 % $ 43.4 9.7 % Oil and Gas 326.8 379.8 21.5 6.6 % 34.6 9.1 % Electrical Transmission 116.0 73.9 (2.5 ) (2.1 )% (2.7 ) (3.7 )% Power Generation and Industrial 84.3 54.2 (8.9 ) (10.5 )% 0.6 1.1 % Other 6.6 2.8 (5.1 ) (77.8 )% 0.2 5.8 % Eliminations (0.3 ) (0.0 ) - - - - Corporate - - (13.9 ) NA (10.8 ) NA Consolidated Results $ 1,003.3 $ 957.8 $ 42.8 4.3 % $ 65.3 6.8 % \nThe following discussion and analysis of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 Revenue. Consolidated revenue increased to $1.0 billion from $958 million, an increase of approximately $45 million, or 5%, for the three month period ended March 31, 2015 as compared with the same period in 2014. Electrical Transmission revenue increased by $42 million, or 57%, Power Generation and Industrial revenue increased by $30 million, or 55%, Communications revenue increased by $23 million, or 5%, and Other segment revenue increased by $4 million. These increases were offset, in part, by a decrease in Oil and Gas revenue, which decreased by $53 million, or 14%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $120 million of increased revenue, while organic revenue declined by $75 million as compared with the same period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily attributable to expected lower levels of revenue in our Oil and Gas segment, coupled with the negative effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our Canadian operations, as well as expected lower levels of wireless projects in the Communications segment. A discussion of revenue by segment follows below. Communications Segment. Communications revenue was $470 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015, as compared with $447 million for the same period in 2014, an increase of $23 million, or 5%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $68 million of increased revenue, whereas organic revenue declined by $45 million as compared with the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of expected lower levels of wireless services due to changes in our wireless customers' capital spending plans. The decrease in wireless revenue was partially offset by increases in wireline and install-to-the-home revenues. Install-to-the-home revenue increased as a result of diversification into home security initiatives. \nOil and Gas Segment. Oil and Gas revenue was $327 million for three month period ended March 31, 2015, as compared with $380 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $53 million, or 14%. Acquisitions contributed $53 million of increased revenue, while organic revenue declined by $106 million as compared with the same period in the prior year due to expected lower levels of pipeline work and the negative effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our Canadian operations as compared with the same period in the prior year. The decline in organic revenue resulted from completion of a large long-haul pipeline project in 2014 for which there was not a replacement project in the first quarter of 2015 and from the deferral/cancellation of certain projects as a result of the decline in oil prices. Electrical Transmission Segment. Electrical Transmission revenue was $116 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015, as compared with $74 million for the same period in 2014, an increase of $42 million, or 57%. The increase was primarily due to project timing as compared with the same period in the prior year. In the first quarter of 2014, Electrical Transmission revenue was unfavorably affected by winter weather disruptions, which affected timing of project startups. In the first quarter of 2015, we continued progress on a major transmission line project and completed work on a separate major transmission project. Power Generation and Industrial Segment. Power Generation and Industrial revenue was $84 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015, as compared with $54 million for the same period in 2014, an increase of $30 million, or 55%. The increase was driven by higher levels of renewable power projects as compared with the same period in the prior year as a result of the renewal of the federal production tax credit for qualified wind facilities in late 2013. Other Segment. Other segment revenue totaled approximately $7 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015 as compared with $3 million for the same period in 2014, an increase of $4 million, driven primarily by increased operations in Mexico. Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization. Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $45 million, or 5%, to $886 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015 as compared with $841 million for the same period in 2014. Approximately $40 million of this increase was due to higher revenue and approximately $5 million was driven by decreased productivity. Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue increased by approximately 50 basis points, from 87.8% of revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2014, to 88.4% of revenue for the same period in 2015. The basis point increase was driven by decreased project profitability in our Power Generation and Industrial, Other and Oil and Gas segments. Costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue, increased in our Power Generation and Industrial segment due to project losses of approximately $16 million on a troubled wind project in Canada and in our Other business segment from project losses of approximately $6 million on a non-controlled Canadian joint venture. Our Oil and Gas segment also experienced decreased productivity due to lower levels of organic revenue, as previously discussed. These increases in costs of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percent of revenue as compared with the same period in the prior year were partially offset by productivity improvements in our Communications segment due to cost reduction efforts taken in the latter part of 2014 to right-size our wireless project resource levels due to changes in our customers' capital spending plans, and from slightly improved levels of cost utilization in our Electrical Transmission segment from increased project revenue. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $43 million, or 4.2% of revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2015 as compared with $33 million in 2014, or 3.5% of revenue, an increase of approximately $9 million, or 27.2%. Acquisitions contributed $8 million of increased depreciation and amortization expense, whereas organic depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1 million as compared with the same period in the prior year. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $74 million, or 7.4% of revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2015, as compared with $53 million, or 5.6% of revenue for the same period in 2014, an increase of approximately $21 million, or 38.8%. Acquisitions contributed approximately $4 million of incremental general and administrative costs, exclusive of acquisition integration costs associated with the WesTower acquisition. Acquisition integration costs contributed $9 million of the increase in general and administrative expenses. Additionally, we incurred $3 million of costs in connection with the Audit Committee investigation in the first quarter of 2015. The remaining increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increases in various administrative costs, including employee and legal costs. . . .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T10:08:25.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
