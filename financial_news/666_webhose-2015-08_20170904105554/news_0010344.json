The FTSE 100 index ended yesterday within 60 points of last week’s closing level, despite some of the largest price moves since 2011 throughout the week. \nThe index of London’s biggest listed companies rose 55.91 points or 0.9pc on Friday to end at 6,247.94. After losing almost 5pc of its value on Monday, the blue-chip index was caught up in a global fight to put a price on the increasing fear that China’s economy was slowing . Yesterday there were signs that trading activity was returning to normal, with many of the biggest-moving stocks driven by events and results. \nThe Chinese stock markets closed higher for a second day in a row on Friday, rising 4.9pc, although it has some way to go before the Shanghai Composite recovers the 37pc losses sustained since peaking in June. Over the week, the overheated market fell by more than 11pc as Government authorities struggled to prop up prices with an interest rate cut and laxer rules on banking reserves. \nInmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) ’s shares were rocketing in London alongside the launch of its third Global Xpress satellite, which went into orbit yesterday to help complete the firm’s next-generation broadband internet network. \nThe company was forced to delay lift-off by several months in May after another rocket exploded at the same launch site in Kazakhstan. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) closed 4.9pc higher at 981p, taking its gains for the past year close to 40pc. \nOil companies spent the day on the coat tails of a fresh rise in the price of crude following heavy falls earlier in the week’s frantic trading sessions. BG Group rose 32.8p to 994.6p while its suitor Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) increased 47p to £17.07. \nOther commodity firms including Randgold Resources (up 33p to £39.59) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (up 29.5p to £11.32) were also among the largest risers. Tui (LSE: TUI.L - news ) and Easyjet , leisure firms with significant fuel bills, closed 2.8pc and 1.3pc lower respectively. \nDebenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) led the falling stocks on the London market yesterday, down more than seven percent to 75.7p after a downgrade to “sell” from analysts at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) . The analysts said the FTSE 250 high street chain “has accepted the need for change but appears to be struggling in the execution”, with a portfolio of shops that is too large for its needs and an over-reliance on special offers. \nMeanwhile, UBS tipped the furniture retailer Dunelm as ready to spring out of bed, after two years of investment in its online and mobile services. Shares in the group jumped 36.5p to 931.5p. \nBwin , the betting firm that has agreed to be taken over by 888, rose 1.1p to 116.4p as it heads into the closing stages of a takeover battle. The company reported better-than-expected earnings for the first six months of the year, having invited rival bidder GVC to make its best offer. \nPart of a wave of consolidation in the gambling industry, Bwin said talks were continuing with GVC despite the board recommending 888’s offer. GVC , which also posted results yesterday, rose 13p to 448p. \nResults from Restaurant Group sent its shares down 12p to 666.5p, while building supplies firm Marshalls (LSE: MSLH.L - news ) rose 18.5p to 335p after reporting a busy start to the year. \nInnovation Group (Other OTC: INVGF - news ) soared 9.9pc to 38.75p after it confirmed a £500m takeover approach from the private equity group Carlyle. The software group said it was in talks with its suitor about the 40p-per-share proposal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:57:29.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
