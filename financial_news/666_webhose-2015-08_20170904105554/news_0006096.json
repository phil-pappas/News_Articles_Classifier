Photo: Philip Gostelow\nWesfarmers' underlying net profit rose 8.3 per cent to $2.44 billion in 2015 as strong earnings growth at Bunnings, Kmart and Coles, combined with a long-awaited rebound at Target, offset weaker earnings in the conglomerate's coal and industrial and safety operations.\nAfter an 8.3 per cent increase in underlying net profit in the December half, earnings growth was maintained in the second half, aided by improving consumer sentiment and the federal government's small business tax incentives.\nEarnings before interest and tax from continuing operations rose 5.4 per cent to $3.76 billion, slightly ahead of consensus forecasts of $3.75 billion, underpinned by 11.1 per cent profit growth at Bunnings and 18 per cent at Kmart.\nAt Coles, earnings rose 6.6 per cent, half the rate of growth in recent years, falling short of some analysts' forecasts.\nAdvertisement At Target, where earnings have fallen for four years, EBIT grew 4.7 per cent as like-for-like sales stabilised and the company reaped the benefit of job cuts and supply chain savings.\nEarnings also improved in chemicals, energy and fertilisers for the first time in several years, rising 5.4 per cent.\nHowever, earnings in coal and industrial and safety fell for the third consecutive year, weighed down by weaker coal prices prices and the impact of the mining downturn on demand for energy and safety equipment.\nWesfarmers managing director Richard Goyder is redistributing resources away from the coal and industrial businesses into Bunnings and Coles.\nReported net profit fell 9.3 per cent to $2.44 billion, reflecting the loss of earnings from the insurance operations, which were sold for $3 billion in 2014.\nThe underlying net profit compared with consensus forecasts around $2.4 billion.\nWesfarmers declared a final fully franked dividend of $1.11, compared with $1.05 in 2014, taking the full-year distribution to $2. The dividend will be paid on September 30.\nWesfarmers shares have slipped 3.2 per cent this year, closing on Wednesday at $40.38.\nMore to come", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:34:52.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
