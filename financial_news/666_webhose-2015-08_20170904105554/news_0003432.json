It was an issue dear to my heart as my wife and I had two children in college. We still do, although our son is also now a Marine, I’m proud to say. Anyway, I thought I’d revisit the question of textbooks as students get ready to head back to school.\nThis time let’s explore the issue by searching for the best deal on a single book. I’ve chosen Calculus, Single Variable - 6th edition by Deborah Hughes-Hallett (ISBN13: 978-0470888643). It’s a popular text for the college crowd and who doesn’t love single variable calculus. My starting point was Amazon.\nTo buy the book new as an Amazon Prime Prime member will set you back $117.11 . You can buy it used for as little as $99.48 and rent it for as little as $23.99. Keep in mind when you consider the rent versus buy question that many purchased textbooks can be resold at the end of the semester.\nI started with Amazon for a couple of reasons. First, as the Internet’s #1 online shopping destination, most people are very comfortable shopping online at Amazon. Second, it claims to save you as much as 90% on textbooks. That’s a big claim, and I wanted to put it to the test.\nNew\nWith Amazon as a baseline, I decided to focus next on buying new. Using a free textbook search tool on MyNextCollege.com (a site I own) powered by CampusBooks.com, I quickly learn that Amazon does indeed offer the lowest price for the Calculus text. It’s not a 90% savings. In fact, Barnes & Noble Noble offers the book for the same $117.11. But after B&N, the prices rise to $133.20 and go up from there. The popular Chegg charges $150.98 and eCampus a whopping $199.37 with tax.\nUsed\nTurning to the used textbook market, prices fall but not as much as one might expect. Amazon Marketplace again offers the best price, weighing in at $103.47 with tax. There are several alternatives that come close to Amazon’s price, and the prices go up from there topping out at about $125. The net result is that buying used in this case can save about $15, and Amazon again comes out on top.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.mynextcollege.com/cheap-textbooks/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470888644"], "published": "2015-08-03T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:07:49.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
