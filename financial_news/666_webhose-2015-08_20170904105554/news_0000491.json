Within the index, 26 stocks rose, 15 fell and nine were unchanged. Turnover was worth $121 million.\nMeridian was up 3 per cent to $2.25 ahead of Rio Tinto-owned New Zealand Aluminium Smelter making a delayed decision on Monday whether to end its power contract for the Tiwai Point smelter. As part of the $30 million government grant it received to stay open two years ago, NZAS was given until now to decide on its future and that of its 800 workers. The market seems optimistic that Tiwai still stay open. \"A lot of investors are keen to see what happens with the contract,\" said Grant Williamson, a director with Hamilton, Hindin, Greene. Scales Corp, New Zealand's biggest apple exporter, rose to a record $2.04 after it said its Mr Apple unit had nearly completed packing of the 2015 harvest and export grade apple volumes were around 13 per cent ahead of prospectus forecasts. Mr Williamson said Scales' share price had risen on the news and with the impact of the lower NZ dollar on exporters' receipts. \"It's going to be interesting as the market heads into reporting season to see the outcome for a lot of exporting companies, and those with offshore operations, of a lower NZ dollar,\" he said. MightyRiverPower rose 3 per cent to $2.75 and Spark rose 2.5 cents to $2.96. Mr Williamson said that reflected investors buying in on the basis of dividend yield in the low interest rate environment. A lot of money is coming out of banks and investors are looking for conservative, high-yielding stocks and the utility sector is where a lot of these can be found, he said.
