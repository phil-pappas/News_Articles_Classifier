Telegraph Money has written extensively about the problems that Npower’s customers have faced in recent years. Many were sent wildly inaccurate bills, while others weren’t billed at all. Some households received multiple bills for varying amounts, none of which matched up to meter readings. Npower failed to properly investigate customer billing complaints, leading over 300,000 customers to change supplier over the past year alone. This has caused profits in the first half of 2015 to fall to £38m, down 65pc from £109m in the second half of 2014. The problems at npower, which is owned by RWE of Germany, have been rumbling on for some time. In December 2013, npower blamed billing errors on the switch to a new billing system. Npower chief executive Paul Massara said 700,000 customers were affected but promised that nobody would lose out financially as a result. But thousands of customers have been unable to resolve their billing problems despite repeated attempts. Many said their bills or direct debit payments shot up unexpectedly, their regular payments were adjusted incorrectly or they discovered large debts had built up on their account even though they were making sizeable regular payments. Customers were forced to wait on hold for long periods – more than an hour in some cases – before being connected to customer service staff, who customers said were unhelpful, rude and unwilling to investigate obvious errors. Unsurprisingly, the firm has been regularly named the worst energy company in the UK for customer service. • 'Npower error cost my family a mortgage' Investigations by Telegraph Money have won thousands of pounds back for wronged customers, but this newspaper is still receiving scores of emails and letters from npower customers who are desperate for help. Regardless, npower claimed this week that it is making \"good progress\" in improving its customer service. It said the number of complaints it has received since the start of this year has halved and complaint numbers are now at their lowest level since December 2011. Mr Massara said the first half of 2015 had been “very tough”. “The main part of our drop in profits has been due to the continued impact of the systems issues that hit our domestic business last year,” he said. “The challenges that we have faced where tougher than we expected but we know what the problems are and are taking the right steps to fix them.” • The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter Telegraph Switching Services» Telegraph Digital Switching Telegraph Energy Switching Find the best broadband, TV and home phone deals for you See the best gas and electricity deals and switch online Compare now » Compare now »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:02:34.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
