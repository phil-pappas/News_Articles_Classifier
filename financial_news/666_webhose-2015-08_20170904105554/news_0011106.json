Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Treasurer Joe Hockey will help spearhead a renewed push for a republic, putting him at odds with Prime Minister and staunch monarchist Tony Abbott.\nMr Hockey, along with ACT Labor Senator Katy Gallagher, will co-convene a new Parliamentary friendship group pushing for a plebiscite before 2020 on having an Australian head of state.\nMr Hockey has been co-opted by his good friend and new Australia Republican Movement chairman, Peter Fitzsimons, who made the announcement on Wednesday to the National Press Club.\n\"The Australian Republican Movement wants a national plebiscite on an Australian head of state by 2020. We're getting the band back together, and gearing up to ask the Australian people the question again, Mr Fitzsimons said.\nJoe Hockey, along with ACT Labor Senator Katy Gallagher, will co-convene a new Parliamentary friendship group pushing for a plebiscite before 2020 on having an Australian Head of State. Graham Tidy GGT \"In the 21st century it is ludicrous that we still have a system where no Australian child will ever be good enough to become the Australian head of state, because they are not born into the British royal family. We must call that for what it is â€“ not right, and simply not fair.\"\n\"In every other part of our national life, we honour those who have a go, who rise on their hunger, their talent, their application of three parts elbow grease to two parts gumption. We exalt the whole idea of the fair go, and in just one part, one sole part of our national life do we say 'no Australians need apply'.\"\nMr Hockey supported the republican push at the November 1999 referendum when he was a member of the Howard government. The nationwide vote went down to a 55 per cent defeat.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-26T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:10:54.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
