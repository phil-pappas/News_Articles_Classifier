Bloomberg by Michael Smith The falling Australian dollar is bad for that Christmas skiing holiday in Colorado you were planning, but it has created plenty of upside in stocks with foreign currency exposure.\nThe trick is picking the stocks where the benefits have not already been factored in by the market, not to mention avoiding the pitfalls of betting on sharp currency fluctuations.\nBlindly picking companies because they have exposure to offshore earnings is no silver bullet. Volatility can undermine this strategy and some strategists suggest steering clear of companies such as Flight Centre Travel Group and BlueScope Steel because they have performed badly in the past when the dollar fell.\nAt the time of writing, the Australian dollar was trading below US73¢ as the greenback continued to rally on strong US economic data. This is a 23 per cent decline in the last year.\nReturns would have been higher and closer to last year’s exceptional returns except for the higher than expected value of the Australian dollar and falling iron ore prices. Bloomberg The question is: how much further has it got to go?\nFalling commodity prices, deteriorating confidence in the Chinese economy and the likelihood that the US Federal Reserve will start raising rates all suggest the Australian currency is not about to mount a meaningful turnaround any time soon.\nPredictions vary on how much further it will fall, but further declines are on the cards. Westpac expects the dollar to fall to US70¢, while Deutsche Bank has tipped a decline to US60¢.\nRoss Garnaut, the economist who correctly predicted China’s appetite for coal three years ago, also believes the currency will depreciate, giving trade-exposed industries outside resources the leg-up they badly need.\n The local currency’s decline is good news for many, but it has also been a wasted opportunity for most Australian companies that failed to capitalise on the outbound acquisition opportunities when the dollar was trading above parity in 2012.\nThose that do have exposure to offshore earnings are in favour, however.\nUBS equity strategist David Cassidy is overweight US-dollar earners based on the view that the Australian currency has further downside to US70¢ by the end of this year. There are medium-term risks though, he says, given that purchasing power parity is US67¢ to US68¢.\nBut valuations are not excessive and this means companies such as gaming group Aristocrat Leisure, CSL, ResMed, Incitec Pivot and QBE Insurance Group offer buying opportunities.\nIn early July, Macquarie published a list of stocks that historically are good performers when the Australian dollar is dropping. These included CSL, Ramsay Health Care, Amcor, AusNet Services and Telstra Corporation.\nBut it also warned that stocks with high volatility that have not done so well in the past when the dollar is falling include Flight Centre Travel Group, Transpacific Industries Group, Challenger, Fortescue Metals Group and Bluescope Steel.\nThe indirect impact of a falling currency on companies such as Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia Holdings is also harder to predict.\nThe airlines are quietly confident the lower currency will generate an influx of tourists to Australia which will benefit their business. However, this could take a while to play out as passengers tend to book flights months in advance.\nOn the other hand, Flight Centre risks losing business if Australians travel less offshore as their spending power declines.\nGoldman Sachs said on July 24 that ASX-listed “offshore earners” have risen 19 per cent this year compared with a 5 per cent rise in the S&P/ASX 200 Index.\nThe median forward price-earnings ratio of stocks in this category is 19.5 times, or at a 10 per cent premium to the ASX 100 industrials, it says.\nGoldman Sachs compares current prices to the three-year forward earnings per share growth profile forecast by analysts. Based on this measurement, Ramsay Health Care, Cochlear, IRESS, ResMed, Sonic Healthcare, Amcor and James Hardie Industries look expensive.\nThere is more value potentially in stocks such as Incitec Pivot, BlueScope Steel, QBE, Orica, SAI Global and Computershare.\nOther stocks that gain from a lower Australian dollar include Ansell, Brambles, Crown Resorts, Macquarie Group, Treasury Wine Estates and Westfield Corporation.\nThe proportion of revenues that come from offshore is also important. The upside is less if it is under 20 per cent of revenues. UBS estimates about 13 per cent of ASX 100 companies have 50 per cent or more of total revenues from offshore.\nAmcor\nTotal shareholder returns in packaging giant Amcor have increased more than 300 per cent over six years. That kind of growth will be hard to replicate. With a $2 billion acquisition pipeline, there is more growth to come and the company has announced deals this year in China and India. With chief executive Ken MacKenzie moving on, the company is entering a new chapter under chief financial officer Ron Delia.\nAristocrat leisure\nDeutsche Bank says poker machine group Aristocrat Leisure will report a 20 per cent lift in earnings for 2014-15. But the stock has already risen by about 80 per cent since the start of 2014, making it expensive. Every 1¢ movement in the US currency boosts Aristocrat’s earnings by about 1 per cent.\nComputershare\nThe global share registry business is expected to post flat earnings for the year due to lower corporate activity and interest rates, but it is seeking growth in new businesses. It dominates the local share registry market but has decent market share in almost every continent.\nCochlear\nHearing implant manufacturer Cochlear has had a stellar run for 11 years and remains leveraged to offshore earnings. But there is nervousness regarding the company’s prospects as its long-serving CEO Chris Roberts prepares to step down and as new competitors break into the US market. Cochlear is often touted as the next $100 stock; however, it was trading at the $91 mark at the time of writing. Analysts are bearish, with Bloomberg’s panel of analysts revealing two buys, five holds and seven sells.\nOrica\nFollowing the sudden and spectacular departure of CEO Ian Smith in March over his aggressive management style and a falling-out with the board, the highly-regarded former BHP Billiton executive Alberto Calderon has taken the reins. The business faces many challenges, however, and Calderon will need to do a lot more than continue his predecessor’s cost-cutting drive. Analysts are split over its prospects, according to Bloomberg, with five holds, six buys and five sells on the company.\nRamsay health care\nEstablished by the late Paul Ramsay in 1964, the hospital operator has been an outstanding performer for shareholders, returning more than 500 per cent before dividends since 2009. Much of the company’s recent outperformance can be credited to successes in overseas markets as it pushed ahead with expansion in Britain, France, Indonesia and Malaysia. A sky-high price-earnings ratio above 40, however, suggests that there is little room for error when it comes to meeting expectations.\nResmed\nResMed’s strong performance in the fourth quarter delighted investors, although the stock has not been able to hit its April 12-month high of $9.81. The $11 billion company is dual-listed on the Australian and New York stock exchanges. It sells ventilation machines and masks that treat sleep apnoea. Strong sales of new sleep therapy products in the Americas have been positive, offsetting a clinical trial failure that hurt the company’s share price earlier in the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T07:07:52.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
