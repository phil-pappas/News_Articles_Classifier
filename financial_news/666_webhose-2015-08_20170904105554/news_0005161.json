Picture: PUXLEY MAKGATHO Related articles New visa rules a danger to future of tourism, panel tells Hanekom SA’s new visa rules led to drop in tourism, says minister Biometrics on arrival visa approach more cost effective In this article Companies and organisations: Department of Tourism People: Derek Hanekom TOURISM Minister Derek Hanekom praised the country’s hospitality sector on Monday and said the Cabinet was reviewing new visa regulations.\nMr Hanekom said: \"The new visa regulations have had an impact on tourism. Of course, they have. But Cabinet has decided to assess the unintended consequences of these regulations.\n\"I am confident that we will approach that meeting with an intention of finding solutions. I don’t think we should downplay the impact that this has had on our industry.\"\nThe minister was addressing delegates at the Southern African Association for the Conference Industry in Cape Town.\nHe said despite the drop in tourist numbers from outside of SA, the general tourism sector should still work to attract domestic tourists and encourage them to visit local tourist attractions.\nFurther, he said conferencing was on the rise and SA was expecting to host an increasing number of international conferences, which would be attended by academics, captains of industry and professionals from different sectors around the world. This was an opportunity to market SA as a leisure tourism destination to people who were here on business.\n\"Up to 177 association conferences have been secured for the next five years. These conferences will be attracting up to 253,128 professionals, spanning 753 days and will have a potential impact of R3.5bn,\" he said.\nMr Hanekom conceded last week that the new visa regulations had negatively affected tourism. However, his Cabinet counterpart, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, does not agree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:45:28.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
