This suggests that there are downside risks to our already below consensus forecast of 1.7% for full year GDP growth.\" \nDemocratic Alliance Shadow Minister of Finance David Maynier said the economic slowdown means that the projected economic growth rate may fall below the 2% projected by the National Treasury, \"which is far short of the 5.4% economic growth envisaged in the National Development Plan\". \n\"This will, in turn, impact negatively on revenue collection, which the South African Revenue Service reported this morning had fallen short by R2.94bn, or 0.9% of the revenue collection target, in the first quarter of 2015. \n\"However, most importantly the economic slowdown and possible recession is likely to lead to further job shedding, destroying the prospects of employment for the 7.6 million people looking for work in South Africa.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:31:06.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
