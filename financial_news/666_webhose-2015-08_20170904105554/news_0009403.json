Dick Smith managing director Nick Abboud. Small business doesn't dig on Dick Smith Just how important is the small business market to electronics retailers? That question might remain open but the reaction to the otherwise respectable results of former Woolworths subsidiary Dick Smith suggests shareholders are starting to take sides. Unlike arch rival JB Hi-Fi, Dick Smith's results revealed no discernible benefit from the Federal Government's small business tax incentives.\nDick Smith sells similar products to JB Hi-Fi, its prices are comparable and its stores are arguably more shoppable than JB Hi-Fi's down-and-dirty format. But while JB Hi-Fi's same-store sales surged 8.12 per cent in the June quarter, according to analysts (with June sales alone estimated to have jumped 15 to 20 per cent), Dick Smith's same-store sales went backwards, falling as much as 3 per cent in the June quarter, according to Deutsche Bank. Analysts believe the slump was partly due to Dick Smith's decision to pare back aggressive discounts on Apple products to protect margins. The shares got smashed.\nAt JB Hi-Fi, CEO Richard Murray has clearly decided business sales as a major growth opportunity. Dick Smith managing director Nick Abboud is going all out for retail growth - busily building a database of 2 million retail customers while opening new stores and shifting into small appliances - but has made it clear he's not prepared to sacrifice margins to drive sales. Watch this space. Sue Mitchell\nSydney Airport will do well from its T3 deal, but it won't be from burger and coffee sales. Andrew Meares Sydney Airport's not-so-key takeaway Who'd have thought it? Business travellers are the holy grail for airlines, but not so hot for airports. How does that work? Along with its strong result and optimistic outlook , Sydney Airport announced its $535 million purchase of Qantas's lease over Terminal 3. That means Sydney Airport will now also operate the retail, food and beverage concessions in the terminal. But that opportunity is perhaps a little less exciting than it sounds due to the passenger mix.\nT3 is used heavily by business travellers, many with lounge access that gives them free food, drinks and reading material. They also tend to arrive at the airport as late as possible to catch their flights. In contrast, leisure passengers on the likes of Jetstar and Tigerair Australia in Terminal 2 tend to travel as families, arrive early and buy food at the airport that they would otherwise have to pay for on the plane. That makes them bigger airport spenders.\nBut lest you pity the airport, it has another way to milk cash from the terminal. Because T3 has nicer amenities for business travellers like automated baggage drops, it can charge a higher fee per passenger than in T2. Jamie Freed\n SAI Global goes from hunted to hunter What a difference a year makes. The new boss of SAI Global Peter Mullins originally missed all the fun and games when Pacific Equity Partners came calling in early 2014 with a $1.1 billion buyout proposal. That bid came to nought, but now Zimbabwean Mullins is keen to go hunting himself.\nExpect to see a bit of Mullins and co lurking around the Rio de Janeiro airport because Brazil is high on the list of places where he wants to get the chequebook out and buy businesses. South America and Asia are at the top of the list of regions in which SAI is looking to expand, with a specific eye on opportunities in the food sector.\nSAI is assessing large strategic acquisitions and \"bolt-on\" smaller purchases, Mullins said. Brazil, the world's fifth-largest food producer, was of particular interest but Mr Mullins said SAI would be disciplined. \"We won't get excited by the next shiny thing that comes past,\" he said. Hopefully for Mullins a crackdown on food standards ahead of the Olympics might work in his favour. Simon Evans\nFor InvoCare, death is no certainty in the US of A For Australia's largest funeral homes and crematorium operator InvoCare, the business of dying is 'robust' at home and in Singapore, but a bit dead (sorry) in their US expansion in San Diego.\nSure, it's hardly a blow-out of National Australia Bank or Foster's Group proportions when it comes to corporate expansion by Australian firms in the United States. But new InvoCare chief executive Martin Earp will be looking very closely at the Californian business of Australia's largest funeral operator .\nInvoCare expects losses from its San Diego funeral business to be US$3 million in calendar 2015, up from the US$2 million originally forecast. Good thing that plenty of people are dying in Australia where the InvoCare business is a good performer.
