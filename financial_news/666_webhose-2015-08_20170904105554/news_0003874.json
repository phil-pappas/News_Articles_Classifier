The market will be volatile.\" \nImport-related sectors weighted on China's main indexes, which jumped over 4 percent on Monday on hopes of state sector restructuring. \nTop carriers China Eastern, China Southern and Air China all slumped more than 4 percent in Shanghai, and tumbled over 10 percent in Hong Kong. \nOil giants PetroChina and Sinopec lost over 1 percent in Shanghai. \nExporters such as trading house Shanghai Materials Trading Co and Garment makers Luthai Textile Co surged by their 10 percent daily limit by midday. \n\"There has been a gap between the strength of the yuan and China's economic fundamentals,\" said Du Changchun, analyst at Northeast Securities. \"The recent trade data was ugly.\" \nTraders generally brushed aside the market impact of a possible change in China's top securities regulator, Xiao Gang. Sources told Reuters that China's ruling Communist Party has begun looking for an eventual replacement for Xiao, who faces internal criticism over his handling of this year's boom and bust in Chinese stock prices. \nStocks rose in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng index added 1.0 percent to 24,755.51 points, and the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gaining 1.5 percent to 11,461.84. \n(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Pete Sweeney; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T08:15:14.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
