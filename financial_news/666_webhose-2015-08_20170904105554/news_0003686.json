But the company said Volt owners use only battery power for more than 90% of their trips, drastically reducing their trips to the fuel station. \n\"We pushed to get every one-tenth of a mile we could,\" said Pam Fletcher, GM's chief engineer for electrified vehicles, in an interview at the Center for Automotive Research Management Briefing Seminar in Traverse City. \nFor the 2016 Volt, the team developed a new Voltec extended range propulsion system. \n\"We knew we had to get 50 miles,\" Fletcher said. \nFeedback from current Volt buyers showed range is the top reason for buying the car. \"At 50 miles, most people will be in electric mode most of the time,\" she said. 7 CONNECT 22 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1N81teJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T21:29:55.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
