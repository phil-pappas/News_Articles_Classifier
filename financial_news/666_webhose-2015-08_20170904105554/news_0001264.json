Tullow Oil may also be forced to flare the gas. \nTICO decision to use crude could increase its input cost, a development that might also utility tariffs. \nAccording sorces close to Tullow Oil, it was planning to increase gas supplies from the current 54 million standard Cubic feet of gas from the jubilee field to about 120 million. \nThe T2 plant currently generates a little over 300 mega watts of power .
