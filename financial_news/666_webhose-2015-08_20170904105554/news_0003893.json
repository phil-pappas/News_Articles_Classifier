At least 20 people were injured when a section of bridge and two cranes collapses onto a row of houses in a residential area. \nFortunately, accidents like this may be avoided in the future. An expert at Safety-Xperts.com inferred that most construction accidents are preventable and can be avoided if proper safety protocols are followed. \nWhat is the biggest cause of construction safety issues? \nIt’s easy to point out where things went wrong in hindsight, but identifying the core root of construction accidents can be a bit more challenging. \nThomas E. (TED) Boyce, Ph.D, of CBA Safety, works with clients whose employees are at risk for injury in the construction and mining industries. He believes the cause of construction safety issues is very simple. “Scheduling and push for production/ time pressure [is the biggest cause of safety issues,” he said. \nIn other words, slow down, pay attention. Deadlines are never as important as someone’s life. \nHow can accidents be prevented? \nUnderstanding safety issues is one thing; preventing them is completely another. Proper training for inexperienced employees can also be a leading factor in preventing construction safety accidents. \n“The best way to combat an inexperienced workforce is to identify a robust educational strategy that can be implemented for all new hires. Identifying individuals for hire is a key component that requires a robust hiring practice. Once onboard, a new employee orientation prior to the start of work is valuable as well as a test to determine an initial understanding. Of course, sitting down with a new employee for an hour or two won’t guarantee success by itself. An ongoing training program and mentoring program helps to ensure that new employees continue to learn the work process while partnering with a more experienced co-worker. Ultimately, working with new employees to go from inexperienced to experienced over the course of several months can lead to a safe and efficient working environment for all employees,” explained Western Construction Group's Safety Director Eric Olson. \nHow can businesses ensure they are OSHA compliant? \nPotential accidents aside, construction companies also need to ensure their safety standards are OSHA compliant. \n“There is no silver bullet to ensure 100% compliance, but businesses that prioritize safety, quality, and productivity equally are better positioned in the event of an OSHA inspection. Documentation, proof of training and ways to demonstrate that there is a systematic process for each regulatory standard will help a site during an inspection,” said expert Guy Gioino, Senior Vice President and Senior Risk Consultant for HUB International , a leading global insurance brokerage. \nAnother option is to find a company that offers OSHA safety training , to ensure compliance. \nConstruction safety accidents can result in fines, injury and in the worst cases, loss of life. Following proper safety protocol should be at the forefront of all construction projects to avoid accidents like the unfortunate crane accident in the Netherlands.
