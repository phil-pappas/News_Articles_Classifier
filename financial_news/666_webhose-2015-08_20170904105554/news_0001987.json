Translation: If your 401(k) offers New Horizons, run, and do not tarry, to buy shares today. \nThe small-company growth fund has delivered stunning results in recent years under manager Henry Ellenbogen. Since he took over in March 2010, the fund has returned 21.0% annualized, which outdid all other small-company funds except two (AllianzGI Ultra Micro Cap and Lord Abbett Micro Cap Growth). This is no one-hit wonder: In every calendar year from 2010 through 2014, New Horizons has ranked among the top 22% or better of its category. \nEllenbogen is a versatile stock picker. He likes small, fast-growing companies that cater to niche markets and have solid footholds in their industry. But he isn’t afraid to bet on burgeoning companies before they go public. He invested in Twitter, for instance, before its initial public offering. And he’s willing to hang onto winners even after they grow into midsize- or large-company territory. Top holding O’Reilly Automotive, the auto parts retailer, has been in the fund since before Ellenbogen came on the scene and now has a market value of $24 billion, thanks to a 60.2% advance over the past 12 months. \nWith $16.2 billion in assets at last report, it’s no wonder the fund closed to new investors. New Horizons is the largest actively managed small-company fund in the country. Ellenbogen hasn’t let the asset creep affect his stock picking too much (the fund had roughly $6 billion in assets when he came on in early 2010). But it’s worth noting that the 191 stocks in the fund have an average market value of $4.2 billion. That falls within the range—albeit at the top—of firms in the Russell 2000. \nIn any case, the fund has proved to be a hardy performer in good years and bad. In 2013, a bang-up time for small-caps, Ellenbogen walloped his competition with a 49.1% return (10.3 percentage points better than the Russell 2000). In the next year, a tough one for the category, the fund gained 6.1%, 1.2 percentage points ahead of the index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:56:43.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
