Photo: Bloomberg\nGlasenberg unable to 'read China' as Glencore slumps to huge loss Mining company Glencore's sharemarket float minted six billionaires in 2011, with Ivan Glasenberg and five other executives together controlling stakes worth $24 billion ($32.7 billion).\nToday, only three remain in the elite club -- based on the value of their holdings in the company -- and two of those are on the brink of losing their status after the shares of the leading commodity trader lost 70 per cent since the IPO.\nThe May 2011 offering generated more wealth than the IPOs of some of Wall Street's most prominent firms, including Goldman Sachs Group in 1999. Since then, Glencore's share price has fallen every year, a decline that's accelerated in recent months as concern China's economy is slowing has seen commodity prices plunge.\nAdvertisement Glencore dropped 9.7 per cent in London to close at a record low on Wednesday after the company reported a 56 percent drop in first-half profi t.\nChief executive Glasenberg remains an undisputed billionaire, but the value of his stake has dropped from $US9.4 billion in May 2011 to $US2.8 billion now, according to Bloomberg estimates based on public data.\nHis colleagues have fared worse: the stakes controlled by Tor Peterson, head of coal, Alex Beard, head of oil, and Gary Fegel, the former head of aluminium who left Glencore in 2013, are each worth less than $US1 billion today.\nDaniel Mate, head of zinc, and Telis Mistakidis, head of copper, are just above the billionaire line, with stakes worth $US1.04 billion and $US1.03 billion, respectively, down from about $US3.6 billion four years ago. If the shares drop another five per cent, they will become multi-millionaires.\nGlasenberg and some of his executives have bought more shares over the years, re-investing their dividends.\nGlencore declined to comment on the wealth of its directors.\nBloomberg News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:27:52.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
