So it's too little, too late,\" Mercy For Animals President Nathan Runkle told the news conference. He said the farm typically housed over 120,000 chickens.\nSparkman said T&S Farm had not received an award since 2008 and that it was recognized for a regional honor.\nMcDonald's has said it would phase out its use of chickens raised with certain kinds of antibiotics at its 14,000 U.S. restaurants as part of a major restructuring plan to reverse a long sales slump.
