(It's worth noting that U.S. consumer back to school spending has risen 42% over the past decade, according to the NRF.) This year, mom and dad want to focus more on comparison shopping and honing in on discounts and tax-free shopping holidays before they start signing any credit card scanners. They also want to be more discriminating on what back to school supplies the family needs. \"As seen over the last 13 years, spending on back-to-school has consistently fluctuated based on children's needs each year, and it's unlikely most families would need to restock and replenish apparel, electronics and supplies every year,\" says Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation. \"Parents this summer will inventory their children's school supplies and decide what is needed and what can be reused, which just makes good budgeting sense for families with growing children.\" Consumer analysts do say 2015 should be a good year for back-to-school discounts and coupon hunting. \"Stores are looking to clear the racks of summer apparel to make room for fall and back-to-school clothing,\" notes Howard Schaffer, vice president of merchandise at Offers.com. \"For example, shop the clearance section for the greatest savings -- as much as 80% -- and take advantage of tax-free weekends and back-to-school sales.\" Amazon is offering 20% off backpacks and other school bags from August 7 to 13 to Prime members. Non-Prime members can avail of the discounts by signing up for a 30-day free trial. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T07:45:06.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
