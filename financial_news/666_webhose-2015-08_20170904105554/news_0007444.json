I do not expect the coal oversupply currently experienced in Poland to last forever.\"\nPrairie Mining sees its coal output in Poland at 6 million tonnes, which some experts say equals Poland's current coal surplus.\nStoikovich also said demand remains despite sluggish in economies across the European Union and that Prairie Mining would seek out new customers.\nPrairie also sees production costs at $37 per tonne. This is far lower than costs of Poland's domestic miners such as Kompania Weglowa, which is around $72 per tonne.\n\"The demand for coal is still impressive,\" Stoikovich said. \"Last year the European Union consumed over 700 million tonnes of coal. We will be targeting not only power producers, but also industrial companies.\"\nPrairie Mining has secured up to A$83 million ($60.80 million) from UK private equity fund CD Capital to finance the mining project, for which it was granted exploration concessions by the government in 2012.\nThis means the company will not need to raise new capital from public markets when it debuts on the Warsaw and London stock exchanges by the end of the current quarter, Stoikovich said.\nThe Australian firm is competing for a mining concession in the area with Poland's Bogdanka, whose coal mines are nearby.
