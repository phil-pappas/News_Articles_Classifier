Christopher Pearce by Joanna Mather Jacob Greber Business leaders agree the 50 per cent discount on capital gains needs to be wound back, a move that would make negative gearing less attractive but encourage bank savings.\nThe Business Council of Australia is the latest influential group to back changes to the capital gains tax discount , which has been blamed for fuelling a voracious investor appetite for housing.\nThe BCA's submission to the government's tax review says it is worth considering a reduction in the CGT discount to 40 per cent or making the first $10,000 of capital gains tax free for individual taxpayers.\n\"The 50 per cent discount on nominal capital gains can distort investor behaviour, particularly at a time of rapid capital gains, such as in a housing or equity boom,\" the submission said.\n\"On the other hand, if capital gains lag inflation, the current regime works in the opposite direction to penalise investors.\"\nThe group joins a growing list of groups and public figures who say the discount deserves review including the Reserve Bank, Group of 100 , KPMG , former bank chief David Murray and government adviser Tony Shepherd.\nWhile capital gains and superannuation are taxed lightly within the system, bank savings are taxed at full marginal rates.\nAlong with calling for a 25 per cent corporate tax rate and measures to combat bracket creep, the BCA submissions says there is a case for \"more neutral, concessional treatment of savings\".\n \"Negative gearing and the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount should be considered in the context of any recalibration of taxation of savings more broadly but their removal would likely be inefficient and not address fundamental drivers of housing prices,\" the BCA submission said.\nAccounting firm KPMG has proposed a 25 per cent discount on bank savings, net rental income and unfranked dividends to even out the tax treatment of savings.\nReplacing the existing 50 per cent CGT discount with a $10,000 CGT-free threshold would increase government revenue by $1 billion a year, according to modelling by the University of NSW.\nSetting the threshold at $1000 would add $1.4 billion a year, even when behavioural changes are taken into account.\n'Capital gains enjoyed disproportionately' The work was done by UNSW tax professor Chris Evans, who told the tax review in a submission that \"personal capital gains are ultimately enjoyed, disproportionately, by the wealthier sections of society\".\n\"[Professor Evans] â€¦ suggested the introduction of a CGT-free threshold, such as in the UK, to enhance the equity, efficiency, simplicity and fiscal sustainability of the system,\" the BCA submission said.\n\"To illustrate, the authors estimate that a threshold of $10,000 would remove around 70 per cent of taxpayers. The revenue costs would obviously need to be weighed against the compliance savings.\"\nBCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott said there was a need for a comprehensive decade-long plan to broaden the tax base, including the GST, and lower income and company taxes.\nShe said reform of the tax system should not be about generating additional revenue for government but aimed at encouraging economic growth.\n\"We would argue that if you get this right, and you have a focus on growth, you will get more revenue,\" Ms Westacott said.\n\"And you'll get a lot more revenue in a much more sustainable way than if you simply fall over the line saying we're a $1.50 in surplus.\n\"If we don't have a really clear eye to growing the size of the economy and getting the right incentives in place for investment savings and companies to start getting their animal spirits back, as Glenn Stevens says, that's a sure-fire way of making sure you don't have enough revenue.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:10:20.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
