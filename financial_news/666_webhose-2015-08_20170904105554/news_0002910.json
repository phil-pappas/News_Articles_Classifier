Duke Realty Corp. is looking for buyers for its four remaining office development sites in the market. It plans to sell the sites on Sept. 24 through a CBRE Group-managed online auction. The sale will mark the end of Indianapolis-based Duke's 26-year stretch as an office-development leader in the region. Here are the office properties for sale, all in northwest Franklin County: 14.38 acres in Dublin’s Tuttle Crossing park on Blazer Memorial Parkway west of Rings Road. 16.2 acres in Tuttle Crossing off Emerald Parkway west of Woerner-Temple Road. 16.6 acres in Tuttle Crossing on Parkwood Place at Woerner-Temple overlooking Interstate 270. 6.3 acres in Hilliard at Hayden Run Road and Britton Parkway. Duke (NYSE:DRE) also plans to sell a 13-acre industrial development parcel at Route 317 and Rohr Road. “The sale of these parcels is in alignment with our strategy of reducing our investment in Midwest suburban office assets,” Art Makris , vice president of leasing and development for Duke’s Columbus office, said in the press release. Proceeds of the CBRE (NYSE:CBG) auction, Makris said, will be redeployed into new industrial development in Duke’s distribution markets, including Columbus. The real estate investment trust in the last few years had sold off office holdings in the Tuttle and Easton office parks. It still has significant industrial land holdings near Rickenbacker International Airport as well as within its Park 70 at West Jefferson in Madison County. Duke entered the market in 1989 with the construction of a build-to-suit office building for Midwest long-distance provider LiTel Communications, Inc. – later renamed LCI International – as the first major project at the newly minted Tuttle Road interchange off I-270. \nWant Columbus Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
