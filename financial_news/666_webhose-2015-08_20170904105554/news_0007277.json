And while the amount of Americans earning graduate degrees has more than doubled since 1990, according to the US Census Bureau , it seems that personal finance acumen has fallen by the wayside. Student debt continues to rise – doubling since the recession to $1.19 trillion – yet the topic of graduate school debt is rarely broached, despite the disproportionate amount of it. [tweet_Quote: display=\"While only 14% of students in higher education are earning postgrad degrees, their debt accounts for 40% of total debt\"]While only 14 percent of students in higher education are earning postgraduate degrees, their debt accounts for 40 percent of total student debt.[/tweet_Quote: ] “I think you need to do that cost-benefit analysis to answer the question [of], ‘is this going to pay off financially,’” says JJ Montanaro, a certified financial planner at USAA, whose wife recently completed a graduate program to become a nurse practitioner. Previously, she was registered nurse. [caption id=\"attachment_965\" align=\"\" width=\"670\"] Graduate school debt accounts for 40 percent of all student debt in the US.[/caption] Since her degree was “the key to a new career” that offered more income and different opportunities, Montanaro says that there was a clear financial benefit to continuing her education. Josh Cahan, a newly accepted resident at Northwestern Neurology, was also comfortable with paying close to $200,000 in tuition for his medical school degree, because he knew that his prospects of securing a job after graduation were fairly high. In addition, Cahan was attracted to the field of medicine because it is a life-long, engaging practice that serves a practical purpose. “People are willing to take on debt because they are passionate about it in the beginning,” says Cahan. There is a “faith in the value of the profession as a social duty.” However, don’t go into it for the big bucks. Cahan says, “Between the high tuition, years of training, and uncertainty due to Obamacare it is not for just anybody. Plus, you need a strong stomach.\" [tweet_Quote: display=\"When a graduate program does not provide a new career, it is more important to secure it in a cost-effective manner.\"]When a graduate program does not provide a new career – like an Masters of Business Administration (MBA), Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) or Masters of Public Health (MPH) – it is even more important to secure the degree in the most cost-effective manner.[/tweet_Quote: ]\n“Put a premium on schools that offer funding and stay true to it regardless of where you’re accepted,” says Carmen Petaccio, who received his MFA in Fiction from Columbia University. Since some MFA programs offer partial or even full funding, as well as living stipends, Pettaccio says that, “[tweet_Quote: display=\"Securing funding alleviates a healthy majority of the pyramid scheme paranoia a paying student feels in an MFA Program\"]securing funding alleviates a healthy majority of the pyramid scheme paranoia a paying student feels in an MFA Program.[/tweet_Quote: ] ” “Exhaust all options before opting for a loan. Or better yet: wait another year. The savings account I don’t have badly wishes I did,” Petaccio continues. “If there is not going to be any necessarily any tangible financial payoff than I think it puts a premium on doing the preparations, doing the savings, looking at all avenues in terms of funding the school,” says Montanaro. He recommends looking at organizations that are associated with your field of study or local organizations like the Lions Club. “Those aren’t necessarily going to be on the radar of the financial aid office,” says Montanaro. Another way to diminish debt is to approach your employer to see if they offer pay back programs or will foot the bill altogether. “Certain companies have very well advertised sponsorship programs, mostly the consulting firms,” says Darcey O’Halloran, a second year student at University of Chicago Booth School of Business. She worked for Deloitte who, if she returns, will pay for her entire degree program. Regardless of if your company pays for it or not, O’Halloran believes that a top MBA degree is worth it. “I think people know that the MBA pays for itself eventually,” she says, citing an average six figure salary for graduates of top programs. Don’t forget to analyze the opportunity cost of attending a full-time program versus a part time one. For some tracks – like medical or law school – there is no part-time option. If there is flexibility, it might be better to work while attending school. Although there is the risk burning out, it lessens the financial burden. “You need to lay the groundwork in advance,” says Montanaro, whose wife was able to work for two years into her nurse practitioner's program before taking classes and training full-time. “The whole conversation is about looking at your own situation and and coming up with a plan to do this the best way possible,” says Montanaro. “Do it in a prudent way and you can really better yourself.” This is the first in a series on postgraduate debt. The next post will focus on ways to pay down student loans as fast as possible. Alexandra Talty is a freelance journalist living in Southampton, New York.
