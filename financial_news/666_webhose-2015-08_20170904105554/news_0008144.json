For savings-savvy shoppers, the hunt for the best discount consumer shopping sites is both a valuable one (yes, you can save money) and a fun one (who wouldn't get a kick finding that Hermes scarf or Calloway 3-wood at 90% off?) The challenge is cutting through the myriad discount and coupon sites and slicing the wheat from the chaff. In that spirit, let's through our hat in the ring with some top nominations for the best discount online consumer shopping site in the U.S. Snagshout - In the company's own words, Snagshout creates a social connection between shoppers and brand owners. \"With Snagshout, shoppers can 'snag' a deal for their favorite products (up to 90% off) and then write an honest review to help other potential customers make a decision,\" the company says in a statement. Snagshout works alongside Amazon to serve as a product discovery platform for shoppers to purchase consistently updated products ranging from groceries to clothing in exchange for their honest review, the company reports. FatWallet - FatWallet is popular among shoppers for its cash-back reward program. According to the company, FatWallet works with retailers to let customers know about thousands of special offers, discounts and coupon codes. When a customer takes advantage of a deal, the brand receives commission that they return back to customers as a cash back reward. \"It's really a triple threat for deal hunters and saves the average shopper the time of doing all the research, with hot deals and insider tips from your peers (deal forums), coupons and discounts from retailers, and cash back from FatWallet,\" says Brent Shelton, spokesperson for FatWallet. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T23:10:34.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
