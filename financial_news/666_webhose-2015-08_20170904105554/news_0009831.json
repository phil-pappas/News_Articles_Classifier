In his second article, AdviceIQ Network member Jeff Rose, the founder of Alliance Wealth Management in Carbondale, Ill., shows how they can control spending to get where they want: Our first article looked at how adults born between 1980 and 2000, Generation Y, must use more innovation, attention and creativity to build a financial future. Here are additional ideas. Save your next windfall. This simple concept becomes hard when the check is in your hand. Yet rather than spend your next tax refund or salary bonus, deposit it into your emergency fund or your individual retirement account, converting temporary income into permanent savings. Entertain yourself more simply. Entertainment likely constitutes the biggest black hole in the average household budget: $70 to $80 to take a family of four to the movies; $200 to attend a professional baseball game; $100 per ticket for the concert of a hot band or performer. Look for attractions closer to home and more basic. Spend more time with family and (your more frugal) friends, take up hobbies such as reading and gardening or learn to window shop. Don’t completely swear off more pricey forms of entertainment, but keep them to a minimum. Learn to cook. Picking up this domestic skill kills several financial birds with one stone:•tYou eat in more, which means you eat out less, saving a small fortune on restaurants.•tYou create another activity to occupy your time so you’re not out spending and filling the hours with high-priced entertainment.•tYou make hosting family and friends easier in your home, saving even more on entertainment. Visualize being debt-free then write it down. This entirely mental activity can pack a punch. Imagine how freedom from debt will feel, particularly the absence of stress in combination with greater freedom. That gives you something real to aim for. Refer to what you write down as frequently as necessary. Keep your clunker another year. Most people want a new car, but don’t necessarily need one. Unless your car is certified for the scrapheap, keep it: one more year without a car payment, one more year to save money for a larger down payment (and lower monthly payment) on your next vehicle. Brainstorm with someone whose financial goals resemble yours. If you establish money goals different from what you had, you need company to help stay on track. Find someone with similar goals and regularly – try for at least monthly – brainstorm various ways to make your plans work. Start exercising. Spending money sometimes substitutes for more productive pastimes. If you start a regular exercise program, you’ll probably find that you feel better about yourself and will have less time – or need – to spend. You also improve your health and become less dependent on costly medical care. Spend less than you earn. No progress is possible unless you arrange your budget to squeeze out extra money each month: the source of capital you’ll use to increase savings and investments and pay off debt. Get serious about your emergency fund. Your retirement fund is not for emergencies and credit lines only lead you deeper into debt (which in turn sets up your next money emergency). Pump even more into your pot meant to cover six months’ expenses and, once you have the fund, tap it for legitimate emergencies only. Lighten up TV time. How does your watching television affect your finances? Maybe everything: A major purpose of TV is advertising; advertising gets you to buy things. The less time you watch TV, likely the less money you spend. Buy big through Craigslist. Your nearest box store is quick, hassle-free – and expensive. Before you buy anything big brand-new, check what’s for sale on craigslist or a similar site that offers many items at a fraction of retail prices. You may not be able to cut spending on every major purchase this way, but just a few can save you a lot. Release past sins. Do you agonize over your financial mistakes? The failed business, previous bankruptcy or the bygone job with the salary you never made again? Move forward and create the best life possible – a harder task if you still ruminate over mistakes you made years ago. Shop without credit cards. Use your debit card for routine shopping and save credit cards for when absolutely necessary, like when you need travel insurance on airline tickets or a buyer’s protection plan on a major item. This keeps your card balances from ballooning after impulse buys. Earn extra cash via the Web. Multiple income streams become more important as job security generally continues to fade in our economy. One of the best places to begin making extra money: the Internet.In addition to managing social media freelance for other sites and companies, you can use the Web to find and market your own services, from dog walking to selling your own handmade crafts. Learn at least one new work-related skill. List the skills that might make you more valuable to your employer or to a future employer. Choose one that is most valuable or easiest for you now and begin work to master it. Do this every year from now on.", "external_links": ["http://www.adviceiq.com/", "http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/"], "published": "2015-08-28T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T22:03:16.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
