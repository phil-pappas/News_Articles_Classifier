He also urged the government to convene a meeting of tour operators of both the countries while agreeing to support Kerala’s efforts to increase inflow of Chinese tourists to the state. He also responded positively to Kerala’s request to facilitate chartered flights from China to Kerala.\nChandy said, “The state government would send a detailed proposal to Beijing on various investment possibilities in Kerala, including the tourism sector.\nJiji Thomson noted that Kochi’s membership of WTCF, which has 135 members the world over, is a new milestone for the Kerala government and the tourism department. “The new partnership offers tremendous growth opportunities to Kerala’s tourism sector,” he pointed out.\nThe government sought Yucheng’s support to bring in Chinese film production companies to India, especially to Kerala, given the state’s scenic locations, good connectivity and hotel room density. It also raised the issue of lack of Chinese language guides in Kerala and also suggested possible cooperation in training Indian guides in Chinese language.\nWTCF is a non-profit, non-governmental international organisation voluntarily formed by tourism cities and organisations of various countries and regions from around the world. The WTCF was founded in Beijing on September 15, 2012, and is the first international tourism organisation to focus on cities in the world.\n 12, 2015 5:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:28:24.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
