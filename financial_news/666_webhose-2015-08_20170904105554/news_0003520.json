It’s awesome,” Brett told AAP.\n“I am just hoping to play the way I know I can and then see what happens. If I put up my best I don’t think the cut should be an issue but it is my first major so we will see.” While excited to have the opportunity to play, older brother Brett has no desires to become a regular on the US tour.\n“I am 40 and have a family with kids so I am not prepared to drag them around and try to be a tour member but getting into this tournament each year is a goal for me,” the New South Welshman said.\n“I have been close the last few years before this and hopefully this is not a one and done and I can play in it a few more times in my career.”\nMatt never doubted this day could come and believes his brother can make the cut without a doubt if he keeps his nerves in check, but the 35-year-old younger brother has loftier goals.\n“I am playing well right now. If the course firms up to separate the field a little more I think I can really aim for something big, worst case top 10,” Matt said.\n“Something big is really close. Golf is a fickle game and changes quickly but if I can control my ball and trajectory I will be happy. When I have control of it I can be confident.” The last time the pair played a professional event together was the now defunct Jacob’s Creek Open in Adelaide in 2006, where they both Monday-qualified for two open spots.\nOn that occasion, they both missed the cut with Matt shooting 76-72 and Brett 79-79.\nOriginally published as Aussie brothers make history at PGA", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/golf/pga-championship-matt-and-brett-jones-make-history-at-whistling-straits/story-fni2frh2-1227481293599"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T00:06:18.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
