Bloomberg by Rose Powell Some well received profit results and a bounce in the big banks helped offset more weakness in resources stocks on Monday, allowing the sharemarket to record modest gains.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index closed up 11 points, or by 0.2 per cent, to close at 5367.7 points. The All Ordinaries index added 9 points to 5386.6.\nThree of the four big banks recorded strong gains after heavy selling last week, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 1 per cent from its Tuesday close of $82.12, finishing at $81.27 on Monday after emerging from a three-day trading halt to raise $5 billion.\nThe ANZ Banking Group closed up 0.8 per cent on $29.52, while the National Australia Bank finished up 1.6 per cent at $32.26 and Westpac Banking Corporation 1.9 per cent to $31.94.\nRail freight company Aurizon and financial services company Flexigroup bounced on the back of their full-year earnings reports, with Aurizon up 3.6 per cent to $5.24 and Flexigroup up 4.4 per cent to $2.64. Newcrest Mining jumped 4.5 per cent to $11.44, on the back of a much improved full year underlying profit of $432 million.\nMeanwhile, stem cell medical company Mesoblast slumped 2.7 per cent to $3.61, after posting a $119 million loss.\nA strong start on the ASX was hampered by weakness among oil and gas companies such as Oil Search and Woodside Petroleum, as global oil prices continued to languish at six-year lows.\nRio Tinto finished the day down by 0.5 per cent at $50.89. BHP Billiton also finished 0.5 per cent lower at $25.20.\n The fate of the Australia's listed significant mining companies is key to the market's performance this year following an earnings season characterised by little-to-no earnings growth.\nCiti head of equities Tony Brennan said he was maintaining his forecast of 6000 points by the end of 2015 because it was still reasonable to anticipate a lift in earnings in 2017, provided the mining companies stabilised.\n\"We've had a very large fall in commodity prices and associated stocks so it finishing at 6000 is still possible if resource earnings can start to stabilise,\" Mr Brennan said. \"However, we are seeing growth outside of resources is facing some strong headwinds.\"\nDespite relatively in-line earnings results, UBS head of equity strategy David Cassidy said what cost Ansell, Cochlear, Downer, ComputerShare and Navitas after reporting last week was their forward guidance.\n\"Guidance is the key this reporting season, particularly in relation to the foreign exchange translation risk with the weaker Euro,\" Mr Cassidy said.\n\"The market has been very favourable to companies that report in US dollars, but under-predicted the pressure on euro earnings and didn't properly account for its weakness.\"\nSuncorp economist Darryl Conroy said the ASX's so far lacklustre reporting season was part of a broader and ongoing trend of Australia falling back in line with global trends now commodity prices have fallen.\n\"The international scene reveals global growth is leaving stocks and certain sectors are feeling the impact. Previously we have been somewhat immune, but as China joins the slow growth lane, so too does Australia,\" Mr Conroy said.\nMr Conroy said the remaining weeks of reporting season would continue to see a levelling out between sectors as utilities, real estate and consumer discretionary companies surged while previously more popular stocks struggled.\n\"The recent darlings in healthcare saw a jump in negative earnings revisions, similarly it's been a rough ride for the financials.\"\nAmong the biggest gainers on Monday were Transfield Services, up 6.7 per cent to $1.20 as it recovered part of the way after suffering heavy falls last week.", "external_links": ["https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif"], "published": "2015-08-17T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:04:05.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
