Compared to the same month one year ago, the SBLI is up 19%. “The small business economy is leading the charge for growth within an overall economic environment of slow progress that has defined the current expansion,” states William Phelan, president of PayNet. “Strong financial health means small businesses will find easier access to credit and more of them will find borrowing needs met” Phelan added.Small businesses kicked it up a notch last month: Businesses in Transportation (+25.7%), Construction (+13.8%) and Accommodation and Food Services (+15.6%) sectors showed the highest growth. Agriculture (-14.8%), Mining (-5.2%) and Wholesale (-1.2%) sectors lag the national trend. A recent PayNet study shows improved credit markets could boost GDP upwards toward 3%.
