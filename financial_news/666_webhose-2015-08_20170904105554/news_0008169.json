Photo: Louise Kennerley\nQBE Insurance Group has completed the sale of its Argentinian workers' compensation business, closing a painful chapter in the group's South American operations .\nQBE, which has a market valuation of $19.4 billion, offloaded the company to La Caja Aseguradora de Riesgos de Trabajo ART SA in Argentina on Monday.\nThe total proceeds from the sale, after a settlement of pre-disposal dividend, is about $US55 million ($74.3 million). QBE will post an overall loss of about $US73 million after the depreciation of the Argentina peso and the way the sale was recorded on the company's balance sheet.\nQBE's John Neal is mindful of 'reasonable range of downside scenarios' Photo: Rob Homer\nThe sale marks a close to QBE's problems in the Argentinian workers' compensation market, which has been hit by regulation changes in 2012 that allowed employees to table a wide range of claims.\nAdvertisement QBE, which in 2014 controlled about 6 per cent of the sector, had to reprice their policies on a monthly basis to keep up with raging inflation while lawsuits exploded across the sector relating to workers' compensation cases.\nAround one in three claims relating to workers' compensation went through the Argentinian court systems last year - more than six times that of North America. There were around 75,000 lawsuits recorded in 2013 compared with 5000 cases in 2005.\nThe sale, which was flagged in February, is the latest in a string of divestments at Australia's biggest global insurer as it seeks to simplify its business. Last month, the company announced the $90 million sale of its loss-making North American mortgage and lender-services business to National General Holdings.\nThe deal is expected to leave the company a $120 million loss this financial year. \"As previously advised, we have been evaluating a range of strategic options with regards to the M&LS business in North America,\" chief executive John Neal said.\n'Pleasing result' \"The sale of this business is a pleasing result as we look to focus on commercial lines and significantly build out our specialty underwriting capabilities in North America.\"\nQBE expanded aggressively across the glove under the leadership of former long-standing chief executive, Frank O'Halloranâ€‹. Mr Neal, who took over from Mr O'Halloran in 2012, has been busy selling off underperforming divisions in a bid to simplify the business.\nThe company also flagged the potential partial float of its Australian lenders' mortgage insurance arm, although those ambitions were put on ice after rival Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia lost one of its major customers, Westpac, earlier this year.\nThe group is set to reveal its half-year results on August 18.\nJames Coghill, UBS insurance analyst, said \"soft pricing\" or weak prices to insurance policies across global insurance markets remains a key risk for QBE.\n\"Once again we are approaching a QBE 1H result where top-line risks appear skewed to the downside, but more importantly we believe cyclical margin pressures can be offset by cost initiatives and exiting loss-making lines,\" Mr Coghill wrote in a note to clients.\n\"The moderate nature of the soft cycle in the US should ensure that GWP [gross written premium] is not too far off QBE guidance, but we continue to see downside to top-line expectations, particularly in Australia and Europe.\"\nUBS expects QBE to post $US891 million in net earnings for the first half of 2015.\nQBE's share price has risen from about $10.73 in August last year to close at $14.10 on Tuesday.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/insurance/insurance-companies/qbe-cries-for-argentina-20140729-j6xlu"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:45:40.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
