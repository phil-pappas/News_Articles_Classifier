Some institutions, however, have much, much more. \nHarvard University boasts the biggest university endowment fund, valued at $35.9 billion as of June 30, 2014. The University of Texas' endowment is $25.4 billion, Yale University's is $23.9 billion, Stanford University's is $21.4 billion and Princeton University's is $21 billion.

The economic recovery in the wake of the Great Recession has resulted in the return of what some call mega-philanthropy , and higher education has not been the exception. \n\"Giving to universities tends to increase when the economy expands,\" said Ann Kaplan, a director at the Council for Financial Aid to Education, an organization that maintains a database on fundraising outcomes at higher-education institutions. \nAccording to CAE's research, 26% of funds donated to universities in 2014 went to endowments with restrictions (meaning income from these endowment gifts is designated by donors to a particular purpose), while 1.6% went to endowments without restrictions on the use of income. \nFifty percent of gifts went to restricted current operations, and 7% were completely unrestricted; 13.5% of donations came in the form of or were for the purchase of property, buildings and equipment, and 1.8% were newly established deferred gifts, which include charitable gift annuities, pooled income funds and charitable remainder trusts. A small percentage of gifts were made to funds that loan money to students and faculty, called loan funds. \nIt is the larger universities with already sizable wallets that often receive the most. \n\"The institutions that spend the most money get the most, because they have the most case to make for support,\" Kaplan said. \"A university, you could think of it as a multipurpose nonprofit institution.\" \nTake a look at 11 of the biggest gifts to universities made over the past decade -- endowments and otherwise. \nSanford and Joan Weill: Weill Cornell Medical College, $250 Million, 2007 \nFormer Citigroup Chairman and CEO Sanford Weill and his wife Joan have given more than $600 million to Weill Cornell Medical College and Cornell University over the years.
