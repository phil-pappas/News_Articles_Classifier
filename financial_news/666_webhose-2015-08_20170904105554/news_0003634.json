Twelve of the respondents forecast that two of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee would vote for a rate increase and that seven would back no change.\nTraders had become increasingly bullish on the timing of an increase to the BOE’s 0.5 percent main rate in recent weeks, with forward contracts based on the sterling overnight index average, or Sonia, implying a move next May. BOE Governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference at 12:45 p.m. in London to explain the decision.\n“The market will be disappointed,” Neil Jones, head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in London, said before the decision was announced. “Something needs to feed the bulls or they’ll sell out.”\nThe pound weakened 0.5 percent to 70.25 pence per euro as of 12:08 p.m. London time. It touched 69.36 pence on July 17, the strongest level since 2007. Sterling fell 0.6 percent to $1.5517.\nThe benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.94 percent. The 5 percent bond due in March 2025 rose 0.37, or 3.70 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 126.665.\nFresh Approach Thursday -- dubbed “Super Thursday” by traders and strategists -- marks the realization of Carney’s push to revamp communications at the BOE by releasing all elements of the MPC’s decisions at once. Officials voted on Wednesday before releasing simultaneously the breakdown of votes, minutes of the policy meeting and the bank’s new economic forecasts.\nSpeculation the U.K. will be among the first developed nations to increase borrowing costs after the financial crisis has bolstered sterling in recent months. The pound is the best performer over the past six months in a basket of 10 peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, strengthening about 7 percent.\nSix out of the 20 forecasters in Bloomberg’s survey predicted that three policy makers would vote for a rate increase this month. One respondent forecast that four officials would back tighter policy.\nThe BOE hasn’t raised its key rate since July 2007 and the benchmark has been at its current, record-low rate since March 2009. Carney said last month the end of all-time-low borrowing costs was in sight and that the timing of a shift would become clearer by the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:22:33.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
