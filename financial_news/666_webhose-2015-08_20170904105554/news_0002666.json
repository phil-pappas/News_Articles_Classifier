Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Tim Dodd Influential higher education consultant David Phillips has warned of \"a very large moral hazard\" in the federal government's university deregulation package which Education Minister Christopher Pyne is still pushing to pass in the Senate .\nMr Phillips, who Mr Pyne brought in to advise on the reforms before they were rejected by Senate in March, singled out private higher education providers, saying they should not have open access to government student subsidies and the HECS loan system.\nMr Pyne's deregulation package would expand government support to private providers to provide competition to universities. But Mr Phillips said he did not support this \"open slather\" approach.\n\"I'd extend funding to non-university higher education providers but I'd do it on a contracted basis,\" he told a forum on higher education financing at the Australian National University.\n\"I would try to establish some criteria to allow new institutions to qualify.\"\nThe federal government has recently had to crack down on private vocational education providers which have abused government-provided VET FEE-HELP loans, which are similar to HECS loans in higher education.\nMr Pyne has said the government will reintroduce the university deregulation legislation to the Senate in the current parliamentary sessions. It was rejected in March when Mr Pyne failed to win backing from enough independent senators.\nThe government has contracted former education department deputy secretary Robert Griew to negotiate with independent senators to formulate a package which would pass.\n Mr Phillips said there was a major challenge in \"finding a way to have meaningful price flexibility [in fees] while retaining HECS and funding research adequately without excessive student fees\".\nHe said that he favoured retaining fee caps, rather than Mr Pyne's plan to deregulate fees, but with caps set at a higher level than they are currently.\nBut if fees were deregulated there should be a levy on universities which increased fees excessively and possibly also a process to justify fee rises, he said.\nMr Phillips said one problem with Mr Pyne's plan was that education providers received the full government subsidy for educating a student as long as they stayed in the course until a specified census date.\n\"They don't even have to graduate,\" he said.\nMr Phillips said that a major challenge for higher education funding was the unfairness of the current situation in which student fees were used to fund university research .\nAustralia's elite Group of Eight universities, which perform most high-level research, increasingly rely on student fees to maintain their research funding.\n\"I would increase direct funding for research to try to reduce the pressure for cross subsidy,\" Mr Phillips said.\nNobel prize-winning astrophysicist Brian Schmidt, who will take over next year as ANU vice-chancellor, agreed, telling the conference that he didn't think \"students are necessarily getting value for their tuition dollar because of that distortion\".\n\"When I talk to students I cannot justify to them why they should be paying my salary as an astronomer. Why should their student fees be paying for research? I don't have an answer for them,\" Professor Schmidt said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimDoddAFR", "https://plus.google.com/+TimDoddSydney"], "published": "2015-08-13T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:37:25.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
