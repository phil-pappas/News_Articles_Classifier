Photo: Glenn Hunt\nBank of Queensland has joined the push to raise investor home loan rates, bumping its standard variable rate up 0.29 per cent in line with other banks.\nBut it has effectively raised rates on its existing loans, known as the \"back book\", while keeping most of its new loans at the same rate. It hopes to boost squeezed margins but also take some market share.\nHigh mortgage competition in recent years has hit small lender margins harder than the big banks. BoQ's net interest margin – the difference between its funding costs and interest income – was the worst of all the majors and regional banks in 2014 at 1.82 per cent, according to Bell Potter analyst TS Lim.\nThe bank, which has about a $25 billion mortgage book, said it would raise its standard variable investment housing rate for residentially secured investment loans from 5.56 per cent to 5.85 per cent on August 10.\nAdvertisement However, rates on its Clear Path loans – which already incorporate a discount of more than 1 per cent below its variable rate – will remain unchanged. This is offered to both investors and owner-occupier borrowers and constitutes the bulk of its new mortgages.\nThis means BoQ will effectively retain the same rate on new loans for all mortgages but raise rates on its existing investor loans.\nHead of retail banking, Matt Baxby, said BoQ has room to grow its investor loans, but it is balancing its own growth objectives with \"recent market developments\" and regulatory requirements.\n\"We are adopting a prudent position that is aligned with the market and balances our own growth objectives with the risks associated with investor lending in general and the overall growth of investor lending in market as a whole,\" he said in a statement.\nAll of the big four banks and some smaller banks , including Suncorp, ING Direct and AMP, have already announced rate rises on investor loans of between 0.27 and 0.3 per cent. The majors and Suncorp raised the rate for new loans and their existing loans, which will add to profits.\nFive per cent growth BoQ's investor home loans are growing at about 5 per cent, or half the banking regulator's effective cap of 10 per cent a year set in December. According to the latest figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the major banks are all growing at about 10 per cent or above. Suncorp's investor loan book is growing at about 11 per cent.\nAnalysts expect BoQ will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the rate rise since 44 per cent of its mortgages go to investors, a similar proportion to Westpac, which has the biggest investor mortgage book among the majors.\nBoQ said it will also be increasing the \"risk requirements\" on deposits and for any variations to variable rate investor loans, meaning there will be less room to negotiate on rates.\nIn a note to clients on Monday, Credit Suisse estimated that the major banks will get a 1 per cent to 3 per cent addition to earnings with the rise in investor lending rates, while Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, and Bank of Queensland would add about 3 per cent to 5 per cent.\nEarlier analysis by Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated a 0.27 per cent rise in interest rates on BoQ's investor loans would provide up to a 7 per cent boost to its earnings per share.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/westpac-jacks-up-interest-rates-for-housing-investors-20150731-giovt2"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:31:21.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
