We shall act promptly to deal with such situations' he stated, adding that, any rate above 30/32 per cent given by any Microfinance Institution per annum is a bit on the high side and they will have to prove to the BoG how they get the money to pay such rates. \nHe also stressed that, the bank was collaborating with the Financial Intelligence Centre and Security Agencies to track down, arrest and prosecute Directors, Shareholders and Management of unlicensed institutions, and may also include Media houses that advertised these illegal institutions for abetment of crime. \n'Henceforth the Bank of Ghana shall close any illegal institutions reported to be taking deposits, with the support of security agencies.' \nSome of the unlicensed institutions identified by the Bank are Care For Humanity International, Buoyant Investment Limited, God Is Love Fun Club, Perfect Business Fun Club, Perfect Edge Group, L.P.M Eye Adom Fun Club, Creative Fun Club, Little Drops Helping Hand Association, Financial Giants Fun Club and Great Winners Fun Club. \n'The general public is cautioned not to transact any business with them as they do so at their own risk,' the Bank said in a statement. \nOther challenges facing the industry included poor loan recovery, resulting from the granting of credit to customers without proper credit appraisals, security and in amounts higher than prudential limits in a quest to increase income or profits. \nThis he said had affected liquidity due to high non-performing loans. Some MFIs had also embarked on branch expansions without adequate capital, thus putting customers' deposits at risks, whiles some have voluntarily closed and/or are facing serious liquidity challenges. \nMoreover, weak corporate governance structures and inexperienced management had resulted in weak management oversight, with its attendant mismanagement and fraud. Some shareholders, Directors and management of some MFIs continue to engage in insider lending and exposing themselves to third party transactions contrary to provisions of the banking act, with such related exposures, usually not repaid and interest understated. \nMr. Amanfu said the Bank will set up help desks at each of its regional offices across the country to help quickly address issues relating to the Microfinance Institutions, especially unlicensed ones. \nMr. Amanfu conceded however that, some of the MFIs were performing very well. Total assets of the sector was GH¢1,290.1 as at June 30, 2015, which accounted for about 1.7 per cent of total assets in the banking industry. Loans and advances accounted for 45.5per cent or GH¢587 million, which is deployed to various sectors of the economy while 7.7 per cent or GH¢99.3 million is invested in government securities. \n'With this modest growth levels, MFIs have a role to play in bringing banking to the doorsteps of our populace and promote financial inclusion. I therefore urge you, as the media, to also highlight the good work of the industry,' he stated. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T03:13:50.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
