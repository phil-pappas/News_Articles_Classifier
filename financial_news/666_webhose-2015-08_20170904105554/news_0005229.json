Those lauding the system are not alone. How else to explain the positive trend in e-toll income?\" asked Mona. \n\"There are a number of South Africans who support the system, particularly following the announcement of the new dispensation which addressed what we understood to be the concerns of most motorists.\" \nMona explained that the celebrity endorsers are part of a campaign to identify some of those compliant South Africans that could lend their voice in support of the revised e-tolling system. \n\"In choosing this approach, Sanral has simply exercised its freedom of commercial expression. This may be an unfamiliar concept in South Africa, but one well established within other jurisdictions,\" he said. \n\"Sanral stands by the campaign, and would like to thank the hundreds of thousands of compliant Gauteng motorists for their continued support.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T03:26:07.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
