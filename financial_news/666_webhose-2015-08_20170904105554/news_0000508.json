You exercise regularly, eat right, and have regular checkups. You have to stay active; being a couch potato is not in your makeup. You know that your lifestyle will result in living a longer, more happy and fruitful life. So it must burn you just a bit when you buy life insurance to have to be lumped into ratings categories where you are not recognized for your healthy living. \nWell, grumble no longer. John Hancock , in conjunction with Vitality ( http://www.thevitalitygroup.com ), recently released their newest life insurance solution - one that rewards health living. Now you can get immediate discounts on your premiums, as well as support, resources and online tools to help you live that happy healthy life. For doing what you are already doing, you'll also receive rewards, such as half-priced stays at Hyatt Hotels, and discounts from cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Crystal and Celebrity Cruises. Like gift cards? These rewards offer you Starbucks, Amazon and iTunes, among others. You even receive a free Fitbit wrist device to help you monitor your lifestyle choices. \nSo, why are they doing this, you ask? 2 reasons. The first was driven by the fact that the amount of Americans with no or insufficient life insurance is growing, not just in the younger age groups, but across the board. The second is that we as a society, on average, are 5 years older than our actual age, largely because of unhealthy lifestyle choices. Research has shown that things like heart disease, cancer and diabetes can be directly linked to inactivity, poor diet, alcohol abuse and smoking. (World Health Organization, 2015) Think about this: it is estimated that 2/3 of all deaths in the United States are substantially or primarily driven by behavioral choices, from a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. ( http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6317.pdf) If we can change these choices even a little bit, we increase our abilities to live longer and better lives. \nAdditionally, science has shown that motivation to change can be enhanced through rewards and incentives. Global studies have found that when you incentivize people to engage in physical activity, they become more active. This may be nothing more than walking the do every day. These studies showed that inactivity decreased by 10%, while gym use actually went up by 22%. \nThis is not the first time this has been used in the insurance industry . Some auto insurers provide devices to track safe driving habits, rewarding them with reduced premiums. Some health insurers also reward those who live more healthy lifestyles. So it made perfect sense to extend this to life insurance, perhaps the most important insurance you will ever own. And, it's a \"win-win-win\" for society as a whole, John Hancock, and you, as the insured. A healthy society uses less health care and drugs, and is in everyone's best interests. John Hancock wins, since they pay out fewer death claims each year, thereby being able to continue to reinvest premium dollars. And you win, since you get up to a 15% discount on your premiums at issue; even if something in the future prevented you from continuing to live as healthy, you can be assured that your premiums will never be at the level for someone who did not get a discount. And all you have to do is what you already do - annual checkups, stay active, and eat the right foods. To put this in the respect to dollars and cents, let's say your premiums are $3,000 per year. If you were to receive a 10% discount, that would mean a savings to you of $300 per year. Over a 20 year period, that's $6,000 that you'd have for other, more important things. \nThis column has said this before - that most people look at insurance as a bill to be paid, not a benefit to enjoy. The gripe against life insurance has always been that \"I have to die for it to benefit anyone.\" Now, through the John Hancock Vitality program, you can reap rewards while you live, and live longer than ever before.
