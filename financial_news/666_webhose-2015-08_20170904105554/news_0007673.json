Lockhart's comments also prompted investors to book profits before the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for July, widely expected to influence the Fed's timeline on tightening policy.\nGerman 10-year yields, the euro zone's benchmark, jumped 6 basis points to 0.69 percent, bouncing further from a two-month low hit on Tuesday. Yields on other top-rated euro zone bonds were 4-5 bps higher.\n\"Dennis Lockhart's comments were hawkish, that's why we have this selloff in Bunds and maybe somewhat technical correction because Bunds have been performing quite well in the last couple of weeks,\" said Natixis strategist Cyril Regnat.\n\"While everybody is looking at the Fed, we also have the BoE (Bank of England)tomorrow and it's also one of the central banks that could hike rates and if we have a hawkish inflation report that could be a risk for European government bonds.\"\nThe BoE's monetary policy meeting on Thursday comes with the publication of its August inflation report, quarterly economic forecasts and minutes to the meeting expected to show at least some of its policymakers voting for a rise in rates this month.\nJUGGLING POSITIONS\nEarlier on Wednesday, Germany saw improved demand at a sale of 3.265 billion euros of 5-year bonds compared to the paper's debut auction last month which drew less bids than the amount of debt offered.\nIn peripheral euro zone bonds, Spanish and Italian bond yields also bounced off their lowest levels in over two months and were 3-4 bps higher at 1.81 percent and 1.90 percent, respectively.\nPictet Asset Management said earlier it cut its exposure to European government bonds to neutral from overweight, citing low yields following their rally in recent weeks while NN Investment Partners said it upgraded its euro zone bond positioning to neutral from a \"small underweight\".\n\"The drop in commodity prices and low wage pressures limit inflation expectations. Global monetary policy remains accommodative,\" NN Investment Partners said in a statement.\n\"Despite the stabilisation in Greece and China, we did not see any upward pressure on bond yields, which makes us wonder whether there are other, less visible forces at work.\" (Editing by Andrew Heavens and Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T15:03:34.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
