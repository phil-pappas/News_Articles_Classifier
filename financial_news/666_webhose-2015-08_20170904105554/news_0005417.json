He said steps could be taken to reassure the IMF on the sustainability of Greece's debts and ensure its involvement.\n\"I am very sure that we will come to a common assessment and I am also sure that the IMF, whose role we have described as indispensable, will take part in this programme.\"\nAsked if a Greek exit from the euro was now off the table, Schaeuble said this was up to Greece.\n\"If Greece does everything that we have agreed, then this programme is designed over the next three years to bring Greece back onto a sustainable path,\" he said. \"Greece should then be able to fund itself on the financial markets without guarantees from the European rescue fund.\"\nEarlier, sources involved in party talks told Reuters that conservative lawmakers largely supported the new bailout plan but that top party officials wanted to be sure the IMF would take part - something that Merkel tried to reassure them of on Sunday.\nThe Bundestag is due to vote on the 86 billion euro ($95 billion) aid package on Wednesday.\nGermany's approval of the deal is not in doubt because of the support of parties such as the Social Democrats, Merkel's junior coalition partner, and the opposition Greens.\nBut a rebellion by a large number of lawmakers from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), would be a blow to her authority.\nLast month, a record 65 lawmakers from Merkel's conservative camp broke ranks and refused to back negotiations on the bailout. The daily Bild estimated that up to 120 CDU and CSU members out of 311 might refuse to back the deal now agreed.\n(Writing by Paul Carrel and Erik Kirschbaum ; Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T11:19:01.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
