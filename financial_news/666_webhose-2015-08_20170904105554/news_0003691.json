RBS shares closed at 337.6p on Monday, so the shares were sold at a 2.3 percent discount. \nBritain rescued RBS with with 45.8 billion pounds of taxpayer cash at the peak of the credit crisis in 2008. The sale cut its holding to 72.9 percent from 78.3 percent. \n($1 = 0.6409 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T10:32:03.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
