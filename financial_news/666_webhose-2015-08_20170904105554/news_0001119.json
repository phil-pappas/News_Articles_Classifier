This merger is to ensure transparency in the monetary policy stance of the Bank of Ghana,\" a statement issued by the central bank said. \nAt the end of the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting in July, the central bank maintained its policy rate - which signals interest rate trends - at 22 percent. \nBut the central bank says it does not expect banks to adjust their lending rates accordingly with the change in monetary policy regime, as the Bank of Ghana itself has kept the rate at which it lends to commercial banks. \nThe central bank explained: \"These changes, in effect, do not reflect a change in monetary policy stance, since the maximum lending rate of the Bank of Ghana remains unchanged at 25 percent\". \nThe Bank of Ghana has also introduced a seven-day Reverse Repo (lending) Facility, available to all banks to help them manage liquidity more effectively. \nAccording to the Bank of Ghana, the Reverse Repo Facility will be the principal instrument through which the central bank injects liquidity into the banking system during periods of general liquidity shortage. \nThe attempt by the Bank of Ghana to have absolute control of money circulating in the country reflects the continued rise in inflation, which is of grave concern to managers of the economy and necessitates the Bank of Ghana reducing demand for credit facilities. \nInflation for the month of June increased to 17.1 percent, up marginally from 16.9 percent recorded in May this year. The depreciating cedi has fuelled import inflation, threatening the government's end of year inflation target of 13.7 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T21:03:50.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
