Year-on-year figures were in line with expectations, however, with headline CPI up 0.2%, and up from the 0.1% annual growth recorded in June. \nApplications for US home mortgages grew last week, data released on Wednesday showed. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of application activity, which covers home purchase demand and refinancing demand, climbed 3.6% in the week ended 14 August. \nGermany backs third Greek bailout Elsewhere, European stocks fell amid disappointing earnings and ongoing worries about China, although there was some good news as it emerged the German parliament has backed Greece's third bailout. \nThe dollar fell by 0.5% against the yen, dropped almost 1% against the euro and nudged up almost 1% against the pound, while gold futures rose 1.54% to 1,134.10. \nOil prices slid, with West Texas Intermediate losing 4.5% to $ 40.77 a barrel, while Brent shed 4.1% to $46.89 a barrel. \nIn company news, Peabody Energy Corp rose by 25.89% after climate philanthropist George Soros invested millions in the company. \nCrude Oil prices sank for a second day, putting pressure on Chevron Corporation (Xetra: 852552 - news ) , which was down 3.02%.
