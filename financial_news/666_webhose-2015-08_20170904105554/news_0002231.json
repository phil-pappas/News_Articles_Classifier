The agency has signed 91 cooperation agreements since 2010 and three cooperators have actually testified in court. In a speech in May the SEC’s Director of its Division of Enforcement Andrew Ceresney said that the agreements “allow the Commission to secure specified remedial measures and other undertakings, to provide additional assurance of forward-looking compliance with the law.” Critics, the Wall Street Journal says, worry that the SEC’s administrative law process does not have the same safeguards for the use of cooperators that criminal proceedings in federal courts provide.\nCriticism of the SEC’s use of its own administrative courts—where the agency brings the cases, appoints and pays the judges, has first say on appeals and the power to decide what to fine the cooperator after he or she testifies—has been gaining judicial support. Earlier this week in an insider-trading case, The Wall Street Journal reported that a federal judge gave the SEC seven days to say if it will change the way it appoints its administrative law judges. That’s the second in the past two months to raise concerns about the constitutionality of the SEC’s process. An Atlanta federal judge in June also found the SEC in-house court is “likely unconstitutional” and agreeing to temporarily halt of an insider-trading administrative case. According to Cornerstone Research, the SEC sent 82% of its cases to its in-house judges in the six months through March. That number was less than half as large in the fiscal year ended September 2005.\nIt didn’t take long after the SEC adopted the Dodd-Frank pay ratio rule for media to use the disclosures to start “naming and shaming” companies over CEO pay that SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher warned . Media outlets including MarketWatch and Broc Romanek at the CorporateCounsel.net tweeted their expectation that these ratio rankings would become popular once the rule was in force. That, says Regina Olshan, the global head of law firm Skadden Arps’ executive compensation and benefits practice, was exactly what companies were afraid would happen. “The ratio could be, at worst, potentially very misleading without providing much meaningful information. The SEC allowed a lot of flexibility for the calculation that did not reduce the administrative burden much but will probably contribute to significant variations between companies even within the same industry.”\nWe can look forward to new Top 10 Lists in a couple years. Highest and lowest pay ratios.\n— Broc Romanek (@brocromanek) August 5, 2015 To-do list, for March 2017 or so -- rank CEO-to-median pay. Maybe a slideshow? http://t.co/D8FkpUpLc7\n— Steve Goldstein (@MKTWgoldstein) August 5, 2015 While The Wall Street Journal was airing the gripes of detractors in one story it was comparing pay ratios in another, a hour after the rule was passed. The CFO Journal looked at five companies that have already begun to disclose the information in “A Closer Look at Companies Pay Ratio Disclosures So Far” and found that the CEO-to-median pay ratios fell on a wide range. “In 2014, Noble Energy posted an 82-to-1 pay ratio, while Whole Foods revealed that in 2014 its CEO received a total compensation of $1, resulting in a 1-to-39,853 ratio.” Before the rule was passed on Wednesday, companies could pick and choose what types of compensation to include—or exclude.\nThe SEC issued guidance on whistleblower retaliation protections this week, the Wall Street Journal reported . The agency reinforced its position that whistleblowers who report possible wrongdoing internally to their company are still protected by retaliation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Attorney Steve Quinlivan of Stinson Leonard Street writes, “According to the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Act was ambiguous...The interpretive guidance states that for purposes of implementing the anti-retaliation provisions, an individual’s status as a whistleblower does not depend on adherence to [a definition that relates to only to the award and confidentiality provisions] and is determined solely by Rule 21F-2(b)(1).” That provision is specifically designed to implement the anti-retaliation rules. In a speech in April , SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White reminded companies that when the SEC was writing the whistleblower rules, companies raised concerns companies’ internal compliance programs would be undermined. Some commenters urged that internal reporting be made a pre-condition to a whistleblower award. “That was not done,” White said, “but the final whistleblower rules established a framework to incentivize employees to report internally first…Dodd-Frank expanded the protections and remedies for retaliation against whistleblowers that were first laid out in Sarbanes-Oxley…This provision reflects Congress’ recognition of the severe chilling effect retaliation has on whistleblowers if their company is able to fire or demote them because they have reported a possible violation of law to the SEC.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-prosecutors-try-flipping-witnesses-1438813529", "http://blogs.wsj.com/cfo/2015/08/05/a-closer-look-at-companies-pay-ratio-disclosures-so-far/", "http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/chair-white-remarks-at-garrett-institute.html", "http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2015/08/05/sec-guidance-backs-protection-for-internal-whistleblowers/", "http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/sec-cooperation-program.html", "http://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2015/34-75592.pdf", "http://www.sec.gov/news/statement/dissenting-statement-at-open-meeting-to-adopt-the-pay-ratio-rule.html", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/another-court-tells-sec-to-reconsider-how-it-names-its-judges-1438625510", "http://t.co/D8FkpUpLc7", "http://dodd-frank.com/sec-bolsters-whistleblower-anti-relation-rules-through-interpretive-guidance/", "https://twitter.com/brocromanek/status/629071378117992449", "https://twitter.com/MKTWgoldstein/status/628962654359580672", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-set-to-approve-final-ceo-pay-ratio-rule-1438783961"], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:44:05.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
