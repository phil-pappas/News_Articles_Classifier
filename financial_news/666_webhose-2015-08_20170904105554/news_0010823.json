Those bonds were trading close to par earlier this month.\nPemex bonds have been relatively resistant to downward price pressures, but traders think further price depreciation is on the cards given how tight the company is trading to US peers.\n\"A downgrade has been long in coming,\" said a US-based trader.\nMoody's warned that Pemex's leverage is set to jump unless the government injects equity capital or eases the company's tax burden.\nDiminishing cash flows will impact leverage for a company that has failed to improve production levels and operating efficiencies, the agency said.\n\"Moody's expects Pemex to have much greater borrowing needs in 2016 and 2017, which will push debt balances far above historic levels at a time when production is stagnant and profitability and cash flow are very weak,\" it said.\nElsewhere in the region, Brazil corporate credit spreads were a touch tighter but prices remained under pressure as investors maintained their hands-off approach to the country.\n\"Many people are concerned that the Real will go to 4.00 (against the dollar) and they don't want to step in until they have more certainty regarding Brazil,\" said Spielkamp.
