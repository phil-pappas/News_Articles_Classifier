Revenue rose to 4.7 billion euros, up 1.5 million euros from the first half of 2014, the company said Wednesday.\nThe return to profitability was likely driven by a steep decline in fuel prices, said Paul Bingham, a trade economist with Economic Development Research Group Inc. He noted that the company’s average freight rates were down from a year ago, so savings on fuel likely rescued the company from further losses.\nMr. Bingham said Hapag-Lloyd is reporting profits at just the right time.\n“The management has a stake in this,” he said. “Everybody is going to try to make sure the market receives an IPO well.”\nIn a statement, Hapag-Lloyd said earnings received a boost from cost savings tied to the acquisition of Chilean shipping line Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores , VAPORES 9.88 % which sent the combined company to the number four spot among the world’s container shipping lines.\nThe company cautioned that global growth in shipping capacity, particularly for Asia-related trade, is expected to outpace demand, making it difficult to raise freight rates. Volumes are likely to be flat for the firm in 2015 due to “uncertain growth prospects in Asia in particular,” the company said.\nMr. Bingham said Hapag-Lloyd’s acquisition of CSAV and its routes between North and South America could mean the company is “a little more insulated from the rate bloodbath on Asia-to-Europe trade.”\nWrite to Erica E.
