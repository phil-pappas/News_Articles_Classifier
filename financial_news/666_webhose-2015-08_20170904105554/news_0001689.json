( FCE.A - Get Report ) has secured an extension of a forbearance agreement on debt linked to the Brooklyn Nets, indicating a sale of the basketball team could be near. The real estate owner, developer and manager, a minority owner in the National Basketball Association franchise, on Wednesday, Aug. 12, announced an amended forbearance agreement through Sept. 8 on payments due to the Nets' majority owner, Mikhail Prokhorov. A previous forbearance deal had been set to expire Wednesday. The parties first reached a forbearance deal in 2013, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. \n\"The team is obviously on the auction block, and my guess is they are extending this agreement because there might be a deal close at hand,\" said Paul E. Adornato, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets Inc. who covers Forest City. \"What this tells me is that there could be a larger deal for the sale of the team and the sale of the arena.\" Bruce Ratner's Forest City, which with minority investors owns a 20% stake in the Nets through subsidiary Nets Sports and Entertainment LLC, owes a $31.3 million payment to Prokhorov investment vehicle Onexim Group. If Cleveland's Forest City had defaulted on the payment of $25 million in debt and $6.3 million in capital calls, NS&E's stake would have been diluted from 20% to 8%. (Forest City owns roughly 62% of NS&E, which also owns 55% of the Nets' home, the Barclays Center.)\"They could pay it off if they wanted to, but I think they are holding out for a sale,\" Adornato said. Forest City had $334.85 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, according to its latest Form 10-Q, filed Aug. 4. Forest City president and CEO David LaRue referenced the potential 12% dilution of Forest City's stake in the team on a conference call with investors Aug. 5 to discuss the company's second-quarter earnings.\"We think that the 12% dilution that NS&E would incur as a result of not making that payment would be detrimental to us being able to realize the correct value ... of that [Nets] transaction,\" LaRue said on the call, adding the company could pay off the loan and the capital calls if it absolutely needed to. Adornato said Forest City is working hard to keep its stake in the team and the Barclays Center intact because there is greater desirability, and potentially a greater price point, if both the team and the arena are included in a sale. As reported in February, the Barclays Center would be crucial to the team's owners getting top value for the Nets because the team itself was losing money, reportedly more than $144 million in 2014. Prokhorov and Ratner have since confirmed that the Barclays Center indeed would be included in the sale. If Forest City were successful in selling its stake in the team, the company would be eligible to receive proceeds from the sale. NS&E, however, first would have to satisfy any capital calls it owes Onexim and pay off about $400 million in debt ($50 million related to the Nets franchise and $350 million related to the Barclays Center), according to the 10-Q. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T18:56:41.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
