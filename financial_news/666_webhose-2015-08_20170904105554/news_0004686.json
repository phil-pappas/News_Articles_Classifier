Denise Meridith View all 10 photos \nMaybe because every day is the same—hot and sunny-- time goes fast in the desert. It seems like yesterday that ASU welcomed 25 Mandela Washington Fellows to their six-week stay in Arizona. On July 30, 2015, ASU held an emotional closing ceremony for the fellows at the A.E. England Building in downtown Phoenix. \nMost of the fellows, adorned with colorful, traditional clothing, said goodbye to community members, whom had helped with hosting and educational sessions. The fellows talked excitedly about their upcoming meeting President Obama, networking with other fellows from around the country, follow-up internships in various states, and, ultimately, returning home to share what they have learned. \nThe highlights of the closing were ten selected presentations, which described the projects fellows are directing back home. For example, Sallieu Timbo, from Sierra Leone, is empowering women in the aftermath of the Ebola epidemic. Young women there are suffering from the same challenges—early marriage, teenage pregnancy, social isolation, domestic violence and high school dropouts—as youth in Arizona. \nIkuba Ona described the impacts of unemployment rates over 23% affecting 40 million people in Nigeria. Amel Lebatt gave an emotional talk labeled “Hello, my name is Failure” to describe how, despite many setbacks, she was able to achieve success and participate in the Fellows program. Alieu Jaiteh created Start Now, which assists people with disabilities, like himself, access education and employment. Kelvin Mutize showed how his YaliCreatives is using the Internet to provide a place of hope in Zimbabwe, where 14,000 are infected daily with HIV. \nOne person from each of the fellowship programs around the country is chosen to present their project to the national group in Washington. Ejiro Okotie, who is blind, received that honor. She closed out the ceremony with an inspiring talk of how she and her organization empower underprivileged women and youth to achieve productive lives. \nThis is the second year ASU has been fortunate to be selected to host a Mandela Fellowship Program. While it is a great opportunity for the young Africans to see what US life may be like from the deserts of Tucson and Phoenix to the depths of the Grand Canyon, it is a greater opportunity for Arizonans to learn about the talented people and socio-economic successes, as well as the challenges which are similar to our own, of a continent not usually discussed in American civic classes.
