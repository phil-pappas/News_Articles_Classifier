Saves having to watch the show. The Australian covered it too, just for good measure.\nThe resolution is a fine document, displaying the hard work done over the past year by ACOSS and the Business Coalition for Tax Reform, led by Cass Goldie and Tom Pockett respectively, in finding common ground about the reform direction Australia needs to take. They have more recently been supported by the ACTU and the Business Council of Australia.\nThere are and will be differences about the detail, but these groups, with very different stakeholders, have shown what is possible when the nation's future is put first.\nToo bad about the only people with the power to put the resolution into action: our politicians.\nAdvertisement Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey and opposition leader Bill Shorten are addressing the reform summit, but both the Coalition and Labor are doing so from pre-set political positions with the primary motive of winning and holding the keys to the Lodge.\nShorten will criticise climate change being absent from the resolution – it's a political point of difference. Hockey, if his effort is as bad as Monday's tax speech, won't actually say anything.\nThe coalition, champions of negative politics in opposition, is keeping the title in government.\nIts consideration of genuine retirement income reform was ditched because Labor stuck its hand up for tinkering with some of superannuation's excess – the opportunity for a political wedge preferred to better policy.\nLabor plays the same game on either broadening or increasing GST. Gee, opposing the GST won an election a couple a decades ago – maybe it will again.\nThe lack of integrity on both sides is displayed by their unwillingness to tackle even the no-brainer of replacing stamp duty (\" the pantomime villain of tax reform \") with a broad land tax – part of today's resolution.\nI've suggested before that our major parties, by putting their goal of political power ahead of the national interest, are guilty of treason, the individual politicians betraying their oaths of office.\nIf ACOSS and the BCA can agree to seek common ground in areas of conflicting but genuinely-held beliefs, how much easier should it be for politicians to try reaching compromise over largely confected​ positions of mere political theatre and tactics?\nOh, silly me.\nNothing better illustrates our lack of political leadership than that it has come to this: civil society being forced to try to drag our politicians to the starting gate. They're not even much chop at following, so what hope leadership to formulate and communicate change?", "external_links": ["http://blogs.unsw.edu.au/cityfutures/blog/2015/08/get-rid-of-stamp-duty-but-dont-expect-improved-housing-affordability/", "http://www.afr.com/news/politics/national-reform-summit-leaders-declare-that-tax-and-super-reform-is-urgent-20150825-gj74nh"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:31:00.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
