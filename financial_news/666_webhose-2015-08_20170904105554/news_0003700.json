Sean Davey Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders When Australia's biggest iron ore miner reports its interim profit on Thursday afternoon, investors will be looking at much more than the expected halving of profit. Analysts see Rio's underlying earnings at $US2.4 billion ($3.3 billion), against $US5.1 billion in the year earlier period.\nAll eyes will be on the company's capital expenditure and cost cutting plans - two of the big levers Rio can pull to blunt the squeeze on its cash flow. The ongoing attacks of Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg over the mining giant's strategy has increased Rio boss Sam Walsh's focus on delivering on costs and productivity, as well as protecting shareholder returns.\nHere are five things to watch out for in Rio's result:\n1) CAPITAL SPENDING Rio could unveil a new round of cuts to capital spending on its already reduced targets of \"less than\" $US7 billion this year, and \"around\" $US7 billion in 2016 and 2017. But the crunch on its spending is not expected to compromise Rio's key growth projects in iron ore, copper and aluminium. Deutsche Bank is tipping the miner could drop its 2015 capex forecast to $US6 billion, and $US5 billion, for 2016. Rio's spent $US8.2 billion in 2014.\n2) GROWTH While costs cuts and productivity improvements are the order of the day, investors will want updates on the miner's growth prospects. What is the timeline on Rio's massive $US6 billion underground expansion of its troubled Mongolian copper mine, Oyu Tolgoi? Rio is seeking financing of $US4 billion for the project, and some banks have already committed. But investors will want an update on the funding deal. Oyu Tolgoi is seen as one of the best growth projects available to any of the major mining companies at the moment.\nIn its iron ore business, Rio has three times deferred a decision about investments on its high-grade $US1 billion new mine in the Pilbara, called Silvergrass, which it needs to develop to hit its ultimate expansion target of 360 million tonnes a year. Investors will want some clarity on when Rio will make a decision, and what changes in market conditions would be required for the project to make the cut.\n 3) COST CUTTING TARGET Investors are expecting Thursday's numbers will show the iron ore giant is on track to beat its 2015 cost cutting target of $US750million. A new, higher target could be set for the year. The big fall in the Australian and Canadian dollars against the greenback is allowing Rio to carve out more, faster. The oil price collapse is also helping the cause.\nBut investors will be hoping for a sense of how much more the miner can cut, and how much its productivity drive can save.\nNet debt is also key. The company's gearing was reduced to 19 per cent as at December 2014, but Rio has said it is comfortable with a range of 20 to 30 per cent. Net debt is expected to have crept back up by $US2 billion to $US14.5 billion in the latest half.\n4) OUTLOOK How does Rio see the market in its key commodities playing out over the next six months or so? Could all the savings from capital spending reductions and cost cutting pave the way for another share buyback in 2016, as Deutsche Bank has suggested?\nWill the miner sell assets in the December half to help streamline its operations and raise some additional cash? Rio's Hunter Valley coal business is unofficially on the market, with the likes of Glencore and X2 sniffing around. Can we expect some clarity on Rio's price expectations?\n5) DIVIDEND Rio will likely stick to its progressive dividend policy, which ensures the dividend is maintained or increased in US dollar at each half-year payment.\nIt is expected to cost Rio $US4.1 billion this year, and has attracted criticism from many Australian investors who argue it doesn't make sense for a resources company and restricts the miner from making counter-cyclical acquisitions or investments.\nTo stay true to the policy, Rio's interim dividend must be half of its last full-year payout, which was $US2.15 for the calendar year 2014. The miner will probably keep its dividend flat this year, after lifting it 12 per cent in 2014.\nDeutsche Bank is tipping the company will pay $US1.08 for the June half. An analyst consensus forecast suggests the miner will pare its dividend slightly to $US1.06, with estimates ranging from US96c to $US1.08.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-08-06T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:03:53.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
