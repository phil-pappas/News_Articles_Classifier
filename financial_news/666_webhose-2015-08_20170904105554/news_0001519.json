The anticipated writedown represents around 10 per cent of the value of its goodwill, which is a valuation of a company's reputation and brand. WorleyParsons said in May its earnings during the second half of 2014/15 were likely to be about 50 per cent weaker than the first half profit of $104 million. Deutsche analysts have previously predicted a 41 per cent fall in WorleyParsons' full year net profit to $156 million. The global company, which announced 2,000 job cuts in May following a drop in oil prices, will release its full year results on August 26. Its shares were down 24 cents, or 2.8 per cent, at $8.45 at 1300 AEST. WorleyParsons has employees in 46 countries and has axed 6,000 jobs since 2013, the majority in north America working in the oil and gas sector. WorleyParsons has previously said job cuts and downsizing would save $75 million and $100 million each year from 2015/16.
