Louie Douvis by Jonathan Shapiro Sarah Thompson Slater & Gordon will change one of its accounting policies as a result of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's probe into the company's book-keeping, sources have told the Australian Financial Review.\nHowever the corporate watchdog's investigation into the company's accounting is set to continue, with some matters yet to be fully resolved.\nThe embattled \"no-win no-fee\" law firm will report its annual results on Friday, four days later than initially planned. It has faced pressure from regulators and short-sellers about its accounting policies and its controversial $1.3 billion acquisition of the professional services division from UK law firm Quindell.\nThe results will provide an eagerly anticipated update into the investigation by ASIC to shareholders. The stock has been clouded in uncertainty since June 30, when Slater & Gordon confirmed AFR reports that it was the subject of a probe while admitting it had found a book-keeping error tallying to $90 million over a three-year period.\nThe company said the error overstated cash payments and receipts as a result of a miscalculation of tax. Slater & Gordon said the issue had no impact on its net cash balance. The mistake, however, rattled sharemarket confidence in the once-high-flying law firm, triggering a collapse in share-price.\nOn Thursday, Slater & Gordon shares traded flat at $2.96, 60 per cent down from its April peak of $7.85, reached days after the Quindell acquisition was announced.\nASIC is understood to have begun asking questions of Slater & Gordon's accounting policies as early as April, at the time of the company's acquisition of Quindell's PSD unit. Slater & Gordon had hoped the investigation would be concluded by the end of July, but on August 6 told the market its \"engagement\" with ASIC was ongoing and progressing in \"a timely manner\".\nThe regulatory investigation has added to pressure in Melbourne based audit firm Pitcher Partners which signed of on the 2015 full year accounts that would have included an assessment of goodwill and work in progress assets acquired as part of the Quindell acquisition.\n An ASIC spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation. A Slater & Gordon spokeswoman had yet to respond to requests for comment at the time of writing.\nFriday's results will allow Slater & Gordon managing director Andrew Grech to address concerns raised by short-sellers including Sydney based VGI Partners that have questioned the contribution of \"work in progress\" and an aggressive acquisition strategy in delivering earnings growth.\nShort interest in Slater & Gordon has risen substantially since June 30 from 28 million shares to 51 million, or 15 per cent of the share-register.\nWhile VGI has asked questions about Slater & Gordon's accounts, other short-selling hedge funds are betting that the company's bold United Kingdom acquisition will destroy value.\nIn April, Slater & Gordon bought Quindell's professional services division for Â£637 million , ($1.3 billion), raising $890 million of equity to fund the purchase. While the firm has its critics, several large investors have continued to back the company's management and strategy. The company's lenders, too, have appeared comfortable with its books.\nThe release of Quindell's restated accounts for 2013 and 2014 appeared to vindicate those concern s as the firm's auditors showed large losses and negative cash flows over the period for the acquired businesses. Quindell is itself the subject of an investigation by the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office.\nHowever, Slater & Gordon has continued to state it is comfortable with the due diligence it performed on the Quindell's business.", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB0QFjAAahUKEwip1dm3t8jHAhWhdKYKHWZ3Cgg&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Fbusiness%2Fslater--gordon-under-scrutiny-ahead-of-investor-day-20150623-ghvjzk&ei=B5PeVem1A6HpmQXm7qlA&usg=AFQjCNGZQELqKc7pA3AKisyOL6AgkgF6SQ"], "published": "2015-08-27T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:12:02.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
