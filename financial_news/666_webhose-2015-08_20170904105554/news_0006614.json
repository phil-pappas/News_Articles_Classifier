The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index declined by 0.5 percent. \nCarlsberg was the worst performer on the FTSEurofirst, falling 9 percent after cutting its profit forecast. \nMiner and commodities trader Glencore sank 8 percent after profits fell on a slide in metal and oil prices. The company said capital spending next year was expected to be lower than this year. \nWorries about China have come to eclipse those about Greece's debt problems in recent weeks, with China's devaluation of its yuan currency on Aug. 11 adding to investors' unease about the state of the Chinese economy. \nWith price-to-earnings multiples for European equities well above their historical averages, growth fears are making a dent. \n\"I would struggle to get enthused with the valuations one is being asked to pay in developed-market equity,\" said Nick Lawson (Other OTC: LWSOF - news ) , Managing Director at Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) , in a note to clients. \n\"There is nothing ... that attracts me to the equity market at present except equity (dividend) yield.\" \nChinese stocks reversed sharp declines and ended higher on Wednesday after the central bank injected more funds into the financial system for a second day in a bid to calm panicky markets. \n\"While there is continuing concern that the current slowdown seen in Chinese economic growth might be spreading across the region, it also seems that a lack of confidence that the Chinese government and People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) will take sufficient measures to turn things around are hurting stocks,\" said Peregrine & Black senior sales trader Markus Huber. \nThe FTSEurofirst and Euro STOXX 50 both remain up by around 10 percent since the start of 2015, helped in part by economic stimulus measures from the European Central Bank (ECB). \nHowever, they also both remain nearly 10 percent below their peaks for 2015, reached in April, because of worries about the global economy. \nInvestors were also awaiting the minutes later in the day of the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Federal Reserve's last meeting, for clues on whether it might raise interest rates next month. \nHigher interest rates can often hurt equity markets, as they boost the returns on bonds and cash, and can result in increased debt payments for companies listed on the stock market. \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:08:12.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
