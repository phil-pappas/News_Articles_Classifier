Chief Financial Officer, Simon Henry, acknowledged in April that while Shell would look at assets, it did not have \"a lot of cash left to be doing much more\" on acquisitions. \nVan Beurden says spending will be selective. \n\"We will be doing quite a bit of portfolio high-grading on the back of the BG deal and it doesn't necessarily mean getting out of stuff. It may also mean selectively deepening in areas where we can continue to build on our strengths,\" van Beurden told reporters last week. \n\"You always look at whether a portfolio is deepening positions in areas or whether it is disposing of positions that are due for restructuring or where we don't see the strategic fit any more. That hasn't changed on the back of the BG deal.\" \nA Shell spokesman said the company does not comment on specific portfolio activity. \nPETROBRAS \nAlong with international peers Exxon Mobil (Swiss: XOM.SW - news ) , Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) and BP among others, Shell has shown interest in Petrobras' producing oil fields as well as operating rights in Brazil's coveted offshore \"subsalt\" basin, according to industry sources. \nPetrobras brought in Bank of America Merrill Lynch in June to help manage its divestment plan. \nBrazil's huge deepwater oil reserves are set to become a key source for meeting growing global demand over the next few decades. \nShell and BG's combined oil production in Brazil is expected to reach 550,000 barrels per day by the end of the decade, from around 200,000 bpd at present, and will account for around 20 percent of the company's global production. \nIn the face of its share price slump, Shell used last month's quarterly results to outline a 20 percent cut in spending this year, or capex, to $30 billion and billions of dollars in cost savings to boost the balance sheet. \nIt plans to increase borrowing levels and has indicated it will significantly reduce planned 2016 capex for the combined group after completion of the deal, expected early next year.
