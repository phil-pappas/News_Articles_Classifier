Photo: Jim Rice\nThe corporate regulator has banned another former Macquarie Equities adviser from providing financial services, after finding Shawn Hickman created false records and engaged in unauthorised discretionary trading over a three-year period.\nMr Hickman, of Middle Cove, NSW, was a representative with Macquarie from early 2008 until March 2013.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission banned Mr Hickman for six years, saying said it found he engaged in discretionary trading – which has been banned at Macquarie since 2004 – on six client accounts from 2009 to 2012.\nDiscretionary trading allows a client to give an adviser discretion to make investments on their behalf without the need to receive instructions before each transaction. When contacted by Fairfax Media, Mr Hickman said he was awaiting legal advice and wouldn't comment until he received it. He has a right to appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\nAdvertisement ASIC said Mr Hickman beached financial services laws by telling the six clients that he was authorised to operate discretionary trading accounts.\nThe regulator also found Mr Hickman created order records that \"falsely indicated\" he received execution-only instructions from clients when he had not, and that he engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by witnessing the signature of a client he had never met in person.\nIn May, ASIC banned Brett O'Malley , of Sunshine Beach in Queensland, from providing financial services for five years after he engaged in unauthorised discretionary trading and created false records.\nMr O'Malley was also a representative of Macquarie.\n\"Investors should feel confident that financial advisers are acting within the authority given to them by their licensee at all times and appropriately representing their interests. ASIC will act to remove advisers who fail to do so,\" ASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell said in Thursday's statement.\nMacquarie is conducting a review to compensate clients of Mr Hickman for any losses suffered as a result of his conduct.\nThat is part of a broader remediation process by the firm after it accepted a two-year enforceable undertaking in January 2013 to improve compliance, employee training and other shortcomings. The undertaking led ASIC to scrutinise a group of former Macquarie employees.\nMacquarie last month disclosed it had so far paid out $11.1 million in total compensation. Mr Hickman is the founder of Hammer Research, according to his LinkedIn profile, and two years ago, jointly kicked off an investment newsletter and website called Market Matters.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/asic-bans-former-macquarie-adviser-brett-omalley-for-five-years-20150525-gh8yx0.html"], "published": "2015-08-06T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:50:51.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
