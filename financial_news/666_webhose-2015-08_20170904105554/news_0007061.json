Rob Homer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Sydney's fast house price growth is close to ending, according to the chief executive of one of Australia's largest residential developers.\nMirvac Group's Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz said that the Sydney house price cycle was now above historical cycles and that \"it has to be close to an inflexion point.\"\n\"It does seem that the Sydney market is close to the point at which the strong upward trajectory will end,\" Ms Lloyd-Hurwitz said at Mirvac's financial results briefing on Thursday.\nHer comments reflect the Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens description of parts of Sydney's property market as \"crazy\" but that its excesses were not reflective of the entire country.\nMs Lloyd-Hurwitz, who has presided over a record $2 billion in residential sales in the last year at Mirvac , said volumes of home sales could fall away by 15 per cent.\n\"Previous cycles would suggest that activity, i.e. volume of sales, will moderate for a year or two by 15 per cent, but importantly we don't believe this will lead to price falls rather we expect price growth to moderate away from the double-digit growth rate that it has been experiencing.\"\nShe also took to task the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's rules on lending to investors because she felt such rules were hindering first home buyers.\n\"We do welcome any efforts to strengthen market stability and avoid the risk of a sharp downturn but blunt measures such as stricter lending standards for investors can in some circumstances be a cause for concern.\"\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...
