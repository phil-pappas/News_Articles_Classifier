Photo: AFP \nThe best bet for skirting stagnant growth and heaping bad debt at home for China’s banks might be to get out of China. \nThe biggest of the lenders are doing just that but Bank of China was far ahead in the game and projected to hold on to that lead, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report on Friday, the first of its kind by the rating agency to address the push overseas for Chinese banks. \nAn expected 20 per cent expansion abroad over the next three to five years had positive credit implications for the lender, China’s fourth largest by total assets but the biggest in terms of overseas assets. Moody’s also said it expected the bank to issue up to US$30 billion in offshore debt between 2016 and 2018. \nChina Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) over the past five years have been actively acquiring overseas financial institutions. Between 2010 and 2014, ICBC’s total assets abroad have growth at an annualised rate 34 per cent, compared to just 18 per cent for Bank of China. \nICBC is in the process of finalising a deal for a 75 per cent stake in Turkey’s Tekstil Bankasi. CCB acquired 72 per cent of Brazilian bank Banco Industrial e Comercial last year. \nStill, BOC has been pushing abroad for several decades. By the end of 2014, 23 per cent of Bank of China’s pre-tax profit and 30 per cent of its total assets, or about 4.5 trillion yuan, were accounted for by businesses outside of mainland China, Moody’s data showed. The same figures were less than 10 per cent for its peers in China, despite their rapid growth outside of the mainland since 2010. \nBOC also derives 16 per cent of its fee income from offshore businesses, as opposed to less than 5 per cent for peers. Operations abroad are set to become crucial for Chinese banks as the mainland economy slows hand in hand with bank profits. \nChina’s gross domestic product growth is expected to slow to 6.9 per cent this year. China’s banks, which notched double-digit profit growth for years as the economy revved at a similar pace, have since entered a pronounced slowdown. \nProfit growth for Agricultural Bank of China between January and March slowed to 1.3 per cent, a steep fall from about 14 per cent just a year earlier. ICBC grew by 7 per cent. \nBOC maintained stronger profit growth at 11 per cent in the first quarter. Those figures will be increasingly lifted by offshore businesses. So will asset quality. Moody’s noted that BOC’s impaired loan ratio for its offshore book was 0.15 per cent compared to 1.47 per cent for its domestic book. China’s sector-wide average non-performing loan ratio at the end of June was 1.5 per cent. \nUnlike its peers, BOC has not made major acquisitions abroad as a means of boosting its global presence. Instead it has slowly built out an organic branch network overseas, a strategy that Moody’s likes. \nBy buying up platforms abroad, players such as ICBC have made quick work of expanding overseas. At the same time, those acquisitions come with challenges. While the targets of the buyouts have been new offshore platforms and global expertise, they come along with many unwanted additions. \n“You acquire talent that you want as well as staff and systems that you don’t want,” said Christine Kuo, a senior vice president at Moody’s in Hong Kong and an author of the report.
