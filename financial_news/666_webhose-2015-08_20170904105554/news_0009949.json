Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Throwing Joe Hockey under a bus may not be enough to save Tony Abbott's leadership should the Coalition lose the September 19 Canning byelection, disgruntled Liberals are warning.\nWith the party rife with speculation about what happens in the aftermath of Canning, sources said the \"massive campaign\" to undermine the Treasurer and replace him with Scott Morrison was being pitched so Mr Abbott could stay as Prime Minister.\n\"It's to head off Tony being challenged,\" said one source.\n\"People going against Tony will give him another chance if he had Morrison.\"\nBut the person said it was ultimately Mr Abbott who was unpopular with the electorate and sacrificing Mr Hockey would be \"a short-term fix\".\n\"I haven't had too many people raising the Treasurer with me,\" said the MP.\nOther backbenchers are promoting Mr Morrison as a foil to Malcolm Turnbull should the Coalition lose Canning and Mr Abbott be deposed as leader.\nMr Hockey called his critics \"fringe whingers\", Morrison dismissed the talk as \"speculative nonsense\" while Mr Abbott, who rang Mr Hockey on Monday, said \"not a single person has raised this issue with me\".\n \"He has my full confidence, he has the full support of the cabinet, he's doing a fine job.\"\nThe last Treasurer to be sacked was John Kerin in December 1991.\nWhen the Liberal Party voted on a motion to spill the leadership in February, both Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey would have been replaced had the motion passed.\nAnxiety levels high Beset by an entrenched poll deficit and almost weekly bungles and crises, the Coalition's anxiety levels are again high ahead of the Canning byelection.\nIf the government loses the seat, which it holds by a margin of almost 12 per cent, the general view is that there will be another move on the leadership.\nIf there is a large swing against the government but it holds the seat, Mr Abbott will be under pressure to significantly reshuffle his frontbench before Christmas.\n\"He won't do it before Canning. At Christmas, everything will be re-evaluated, there will be a serious reshuffle,\" said one of the Prime Minister's colleagues.\n\"The minute Canning's over, that will be the topic.\"\nSenator Arthur Sinodinos lashed out in a statement on Monday in which he urged Mr Abbott to sack those seeking to set up Mr Hockey as a scapegoat for Canning.\n\"Ministers should be working hard to win the Canning byelection rather than backgrounding against a colleague to scapegoat a potential loss,\" he said.\n\"Holding out the prospect of a reshuffle and even a double-dissolution election smacks of defeatism and a lack of focus on the substantive issues of governing.\n\"The Prime Minister should sack any minister or adviser who is engaged in such deliberate leaking and destabilisation.\"\nLast week, after Mr Hockey announced he would be advocating for Australia to become a republic , the internal criticism of him grew with several reports on Friday mentioning a growing mood to remove the Treasurer as part of a reshuffle.\nOn Monday, Fairfax Media Quote: d unnamed ministers prevailing on Mr Abbott to dump the Treasurer should the Coalition fare poorly in Canning .\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen said he regarded Mr Hockey as inept but sacking a Treasurer mid-term would be bad for confidence and the economy.\n\"The Treasurer should be replaced but he should be replaced at the next election with the election of a Labor government,\" he said.\nSenator Sinodinos, who served as John Howard's chief of staff for a decade, was made assistant treasurer in 2013 but had to stand aside when he became embroiled in ICAC hearings in NSW.\nHe urged colleagues to consider Andrew Hastie, who has given up a career in the SAS to run for Canning as the Liberal candidate .", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-being-urged-to-consider-dumping-joe-hockey-and-calling-a-march-election-cabinet-ministers-20150830-gjaysw.html", "https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-31T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:07:22.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
