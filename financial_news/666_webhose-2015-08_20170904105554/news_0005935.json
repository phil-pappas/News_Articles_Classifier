Louie Douvis by Phillip Coorey Joanna Mather Former prime minister John Howard says the federal opposition should assist the government by advocating economic reform, while Treasurer Joe Hockey argues the electorate is not ready for change and that business should be doing more to make the case.\nWriting in Monday's The Australian Financial Review , Mr Howard argues that during his long years in opposition between 1983 and 1996, the Coalition in opposition was largely supportive of the reforms ushered in by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.\n\"My two Labor predecessors as prime minister deserve praise for the economic reforms they achieved. So does the opposition of that period because it gave bipartisan support to so many of those reforms,\" he writes.\nMr Howard listed such Labor reforms as privatisation, handing the Reserve Bank the power to set interest rates, floating the dollar, deregulating the banking sector, the introduction of HECS and cutting tariffs.\nHe said Labor opposed these in opposition but embraced them in government and their success was dependent on bipartisan support.\n\"Labor's most courageous economic policy reform between 1983 and 1996 was to cut tariffs. This was very sensitive with many of its core supporters as they clung to the instinctive belief that tariffs protected jobs,\" he writes.\n\"When the Hawke government announced tariff reductions in two stages, the opposition, first under my leadership, and then under that of John Hewson, so far from attacking Labor's decision, argued that the reform process should go further.\"\nMr Howard notes that when he came to power, \"none of this extensive bipartisanship\" was reciprocated.\n \"The Labor Party opposed all of our major economic reforms, including the GST, workplace relations changes and reform of the waterfront. It also voted against measures to rein in the huge deficit bequeathed to us.\"\nWith the Abbott government struggling, Mr Howard contends that \"political leaders and parties have a responsibility to advocate sound policy in opposition as well as in government\".\nLabor opposed much of the Abbott government's budget cuts at first but, in July, passed almost $10 billion in savings.\nThe Abbott government has yet to detail its tax reform plans but has already ruled out a GST increase without associated reform, or touching superannuation. Labor has ruled out the GST but has proposed superannuation tax changes is is considering changes to negative gearing and capital gains concessions for property investors..\nIn an interview with the Financial Review Mr Hockey said the public was not ready for wholesale tax reform.\n\"The challenge is that the electorate is not there yet,\" he said.\n\"There is a policy disconnect between the policy development phase on tax and where the electorate is at. The electorate are looking for stability and certainty, they are looking for reforms to be evolutionary rather then revolutionary.\"\nHe urged business and community leaders to act less like \"constructive critics\" and more like \"convincing advocates\" for economic reform.\n\"It's not just the business community; it's all those people who believe we've got to have a more productive, more diverse, contemporary economy, right?\" Mr Hockey said. \"And if they could move from criticism to advocacy and that's not about talking to each other, it is about convincing the everyday Australian that reform is important because if we stand still we will be left behind.\n\"There are plenty of critics but we need advocates. There's plenty of advice, we actually need the support of people that are going to work hard to help us to bring the community with us on this very significant reform agenda.\"\nAbout 80 business, union and social services leaders will meet in Sydney this month for the national reform summit, which is sponsored by the Financial Review and The Australian . The aim is to find a way out of the policy paralysis blamed for limiting economic growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:09:03.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
