Free operating cash flow amounted to $88.8 million for the three-month period. After tax adjusted operating income amounted to $67.9 million for the three-month period.“With three quarters of our new business volume coming out of the US market, these second quarter results reaffirm the significant influence US economic growth has on our business,” said Steven Hudson, Element’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our steady growth in earnings and assets has benefited from the fact that our revenues are heavily weighted to the US economy while our corporate costs are predominantly based here in Canada,” added Mr. Hudson.Overall, new originations amounted to $1.8 billion for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 versus $1.5 billion reported in the previous three-month period ended March 31, 2015.
