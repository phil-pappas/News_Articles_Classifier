Let him do it,\" he said. \nZoe Konstantopoulou, parliament head: \nA feisty and charismatic lawyer, 38-year-old Konstantopoulou has frequently interjected her opposition to the austerity measures. But, she has always taken pains to underscore that she is not targeting the Greek government but the new bailout pact, which she has described as a \"crime against humanity\" that could usher in \"social genocide\". \nHowever, in her last appearance in parliament she lambasted Tsipras saying she could no longer back a premier \"who has joined the cohort of his predecessors who had accepted the memoranda, throwing his comrades to the dogs\". \nEducated at top Greek, French and US universities, Konstantopoulou has a formidable political pedigree: she is the daughter of Nikos Konstantopoulos, a renowned lawyer who led one of Syriza's factions between 1993 and 2004. \nHer frank speech and candour have gained her both praise and criticism and her forceful interventions had fuelled calls in the past for her sacking. \nElected the head of parliament this year -- the youngest person to hold the post -- Konstantopoulou is keeping her cards close to her chest leaving people guessing as to what her future strategy will be. \nYanis Varoufakis, former finance minister: \n\"He blows hot and cold,\" a party member said of Varoufakis, who has warned that the latest bailout deal was doomed to fail. \nThe controversial politician and self-described \"erratic Marxist\" resigned the day after Greeks voted against a proposed bailout in a July 5 referendum, accusing the country's creditors of \"terrorism\". \nIn recent interviews he has voiced his disappointment that Tsipras did not take a harder line with creditors. \nThe maverick former minister had a rock star allure arriving for EU summits in leather jackets and untucked shirts. He was also known for his straight-talking style that produced memorable moments and soundbites. \nDespite his man-of-the-people stance, Varoufakis's background is anything but common. His 90-year-old father still heads one of Greece's biggest steel producers and he attended a posh school. \nHe has said he will give up his seat in parliament if asked by Syriza, of which he is no longer a member. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Three key figures in Greek ruling party's internal war AFP \nThe split appears complete between Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and close to a third of the 149 lawmakers â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T05:51:19.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
