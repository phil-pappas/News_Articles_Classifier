Brent Winstone Share on twitter by Jamie Freed Qantas will combine its first and business class international lounges at Brisbane Airport into a new premium lounge along the lines of its award-winning Singapore and Hong Kong lounges as part of a multi-million dollar upgrade for its facilities at the airport.\nThe airline will also increase the capacity of its domestic terminal at Brisbane by 30 per cent, including the redesign of the existing Qantas Club lounge and the construction of a new business lounge and Chairmans lounge. Construction will begin by the end of this year, with the projects to be completed on a staged basis throughout 2016 and early 2017.\nQantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the upgrades were part of the airline's continued transformation, which also includes opening a new domestic lounge at Perth Airport later this month.\n\"During the past two years we have invested in new lounges, upgrades to our A330 aircraft and rolled out more in-flight entertainment options than ever before,\" he said on Friday. \"Brisbane is a crucial hub providing connections between our major domestic routes and services into regional areas as well as international flights to Los Angeles, Singapore, Hong Kong and as of a few weeks ago, daily flights to Tokyo.\"\nQantas has maintained first class international lounges in Sydney, Melbourne and Los Angeles, but it has abandoned that concept in Singapore, Hong Kong and now Brisbane in favour of mixed lounges at those ports.\nQantas does not offer first class on any of its international flights from Brisbane, but it does have platinum frequent flyers who are allowed access to first class lounges where they exist.\nIts existing first class lounge in Brisbane â€“ a separate room with more personalised service than the neighbouring the business class lounge - has been considered dated by travellers and far inferior to its top-notch Sydney and Melbourne first class lounge offerings .\nRival Air New Zealand, an alliance partner of Virgin Australia, is planning a refurbishment of its Brisbane international lounge in the near future.\n In addition to refurbishing lounges, Qantas has also been adding new business class seats to its A330 aircraft used on domestic and international flights at its Brisbane heavy maintenance facilities. To date, 10 aircraft have been refurbished with new seats. Two more are in the hangar now, with 16 expected to be completed by the end of this year and all 28 by the end of next year.\nVirgin is also installing fully-flat business class seats, all with aisle access, on its own fleet of A330s used on trans-continental domestic flights and some seasonal flights from Sydney to Fiji. After some initial delays, the first refitted aircraft will fly from Sydney to Perth on Monday, with the remaining five in its fleet to be completed by November.\nQantas has also begun updating its Boeing 737 aircraft , the number one workhorse in its domestic fleet. It is installing wireless Q-streaming in-flight entertainment systems that will allow passengers to stream entertainment to their own devices in the 38 aircraft that lack seatback screens. It will also add six extra seats per aircraft by reconfiguring the galleys and installing slimline toilets, increasing the capacity of its 737 fleet by 3 per cent. The refits will take up to a year to complete.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/virgin-qantas-step-up-battle-for-business-travellers-20140924-10lesy.html", "http://www.ausbt.com.au/qa/hi-all-i-am-flying-to-hong-kong-from-via-brisbane-qf508-then-", "https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/qantas-adds-more-seats-smaller-loos-on-domestic-fleet-20140731-zyvc5.html"], "published": "2015-08-14T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:10:03.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
