It probably isn't,\" he said. \nTAXPAYER BAILOUT \nLloyds was rescued by the government during the 2007-09 financial crisis at a cost of 20.5 billion pounds to taxpayers, leaving the government with a 43 percent stake. \nIts performance has since been turned around by Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, who has simplified operations to focus on lending to British businesses and households. Lloyds is now the third-biggest bank in Europe by market value. \nIts attractiveness to retail investors was boosted on Friday after it said it will look to return surplus capital to shareholders from the end of this year having already resumed dividend payments. \nOne factor behind the government's enthusiasm for a retail share offer may be the impending sale of its 78 percent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), a significant chunk of which may be sold to retail investors, industry sources say. \nSources with knowledge of government thinking say the finance ministry is keen for investors to buy Lloyds' shares and benefit from the bank's turnaround as that may encourage them to buy RBS shares, too. \nRBS is still counting the costs of past misconduct and has yet to pay a dividend. However, Osborne has set a target of selling at least three-quarters of the stake in the next five years. \n\"The Treasury won't be able to get the RBS disposal programme done without retail and if you're going to sell RBS shares to retail in the future it would be nice to have a successful transaction concluded where retail participated and felt good about it,\" one source said. \nRBS was bailed out at a cost of almost 46 billion pounds to taxpayers and the government's stake is worth about 31 billion at current share prices, meaning a potential loss of 15 billion pounds from its investment. \nOther fund managers have said they would not object to a Lloyds retail sale especially if it offered the fastest route to full private ownership but only if it was done at a 3-4 percent discount which would be comparable to those typically offered in placings of large volumes of stock. \n\"Without a block placing, then you are looking at least another year before all the stake is sold. We'd be supportive of any mechanisms to speed that up, within sensible parameters. It is all about the terms,\" said Mike Fox, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. \n(Editing by Jason Neely)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T06:50:59.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
