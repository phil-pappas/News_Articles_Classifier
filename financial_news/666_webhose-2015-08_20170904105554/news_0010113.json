PUBLISHED: 15:35, Fri, Aug 28, 2015 | UPDATED: 15:41, Fri, Aug 28, 2015 GETTY Now's the time to start saving for Chrismas \nThere are just 17 weeks until Christmas when Britons will splash out an average £469 on gifts and celebrations, found research from Halifax. After overspending on last year's festivities, more than one in four people racked up debt that was expected to take until April this year to clear. Separate research recently suggested that around one in five people are still feeling the effect of last Christmas.

Another option is to start shopping now, which allows plenty of time to spot good-value gifts in the end of summer sales and helps to spread the cost of buying presents. Giles Martin, head of Halifax Savings, said: \"While Christmas is unlikely to be at the top of people’s priorities as they return from their summer holidays, with the cost of the festive season nearing £500 and the hangover stretching for some into April, it’s never too early to think about how you will pay for it.“Christmas can put real pressure on people’s finances, but putting money aside each month can really help to spread the cost. If you can afford to save regularly then the earlier you start the less you need to find each month.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T18:12:07.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
