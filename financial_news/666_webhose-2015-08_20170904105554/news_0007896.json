This should serve as encouragement for potential e-commerce companies to start realigning their business strategy for the future,' he said. \nMr Hesse said e-Commerce has the potential to expand the country's economy by creating jobs in courier, shipping, IT services industry and expressed the hope that the youth would seize the opportunity and run with it. \nHe assured the public of continuous efforts to ensure the security of all transactions and said they had implemented a cardholder authentication system to ensure protection from fraud and also reduce the incidence of chargeback for online merchants. \n- GNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T19:22:07.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
