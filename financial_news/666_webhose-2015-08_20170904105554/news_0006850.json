Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Ben Potter Australian companies are forced offshore or taken over because of investor and tax system bias against foreign expansion, ANZ Banking Group chief executive Mike Smith said.\nMr Smith said technology company Atlassian, job-search group SEEK and ports operator Asciano had been either forced to shift their base offshore, pressured by local investors not to expand offshore or gobbled up by a foreign company because the tax system was more suited to a bygone era.\nSEEK's shares were marked down as much as 10 per cent on Wednesday even though earnings grew 6 per cent and revenues 20 per cent, because some investors thought the company was betting too much on offshore growth at the expense of earnings.\nMr Smith said this typified the insularity of the local market. SEEK \"actually had pretty good results and yet they get whacked because their strategy was offshore\".\nAtlassian, a software development company originally based in Sydney, had \"moved to Britain of all places\" for \"better access to capital and a better tax structure for international firms\". Asciano has been bought for $8.9 billion by Canada's Brookfield Infrastructure , following transport group Toll Holdings into foreign ownership.\nAtlassian, a software development company originally based in Sydney, had \"moved to Britain of all places\" for \"better access to capital and a better tax structure for international firms,\" Mr Smith said.\n\"There was an investment community who understood what they wanted to do and and a tax regime where they were not getting taxed twice on the same income.\"\nHe said the Australian tax system was out of date.\n \"It's relevant to the 20th century and maybe the 19th but it certainly is not relevant to the 21st century. We have really got to do something about it,\" Mr Smith said.\nTax break plan launch He was speaking after launching a plan for a tax break on offshore income to overcome a tax system bias against local companies investing offshore.\nMr Smith urged companies and individuals not to throw their hands up in despair at poor prospects for reform. If they did that, \"nothing would happen so then we have got no reason to complain\".\nBut he said governments had to grasp reform ideas – such as the plan for a 20 per cent tax credit on foreign income designed to mimic the imputation tax break on dividends from local income.\n\"This is quite an easy change to make and will have a fundamental effect on lifting the economy in this country. It will create more growth and it will create more jobs,\" he said.\n\"Now if governments are not interested in that, then there really is a problem.\"\nThe Australian Financial Review will co-host a National Reform Summit next Wednesday in a bid to tackle the dearth of economic reform.\nUnder imputation, dividends come with a tax credit reflecting the amount of local taxes paid, which shareholders can offset against income taxes on the dividends.\nBut no credit is available for taxes on income derived from offshore, creating a disincentive for local companies to invest offshore because they face a tax penalty of up to 30 per cent on offshore income.\nMr Smith said companies had an obligation to pay a fair amount of taxes, and blatant tax avoidance by multinational companies had to be dealt with.\nIssue hijacked But he thought the issue had been hijacked to \"colour the whole tax … subject, and therefore sensible reform ideas, which are going to help drive growth in the economy and create more jobs are being ignored.\"\nThe plan for a 20 per cent tax credit on foreign income has been around since a 2003 report from the Board of Taxation. The ANZ boss said the community lacked an understanding of how offshore investment by local companies boosts the domestic economy and tax receipts, and creates more benefits onshore than offshore.\nANZ released a report – Winning the Away Game – with modelling suggesting the tax credit would create a net economic gain of $1 billion a year within two years, after offsetting upfront revenue costs of $1.75 billion.\nSEEK is backing the push along with Computershare, Cochlear, Amcor, Bluescope, Brambles, Carsales, Coca Cola Amatil, CSL, and Village Roadshow – all companies with large offshore operations.\nGrant Wardell-Johnson, head of Australian tax at KPMG, said: \"This is a really big issue for the future of Australia because if we are going to succeed we need strong multinationals with their headquarters in Australia.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-08-20T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:45:05.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
