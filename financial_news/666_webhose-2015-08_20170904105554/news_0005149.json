Ltd (Singapore), said in an interview. State elections later in the year may also temporarily slow the pace of reforms, she added.\nEdited excerpts:\nIn line with market expectations, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept key policy rates unchanged in its third bi-monthly policy review. Was the reaction from industry, analysts and market watchers a bit overdone?\nRBI left policy rates unchanged on 4 August, and this was in line with expectations, given that June’s headline and core inflation rates had ticked up. The headline Consumer Price Index accelerated to a quicker-than-expected 5.4%, year-on-year, from 5% in May. Indian equities lost 0.4%, the Indian rupee gained 0.5% versus the US dollar and the 10-year benchmark Indian government bond was sold (down) with yields rising 3 basis points (bps) to 7.84%, although most of these movements were witnessed in the lead-up to (rather than after) the RBI policy statement. (One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)\nThe reaction in the financial market is understandable to a certain extent given that there has been some uncertainty over the trajectory of Indian monetary policy—especially since the US Federal Reserve is expected to start normalizing interest rates and as RBI is continuing to focus on inflation management as well.\nHowever, investors in Indian assets with a medium-to-long term horizon should not be deterred by near-term dynamics. Inflation remains within RBI’s 2016 target of 6% and we anticipate possible measured rate cuts in India going forward. Chances are RBI may also be awaiting the Fed’s next policy guidance in September before it plans its moves.\nBut is governor Raghuram Rajan erring too much on the side of caution by keeping rates unchanged?\nGovernor Rajan does appear to be erring on the side of caution and we think he wants to avoid a repeat of the peak inflation rates of over 11%, which were seen back in November 2013. At that time, high inflation and a wide current account deficit posed obstacles to growth. RBI recognizes that curbing inflation once and for all is a key step towards ensuring sustainable growth. For real economic growth to pick up, we need to see not just lower borrowing costs transmitting into lower deposit and lending rates at banks, but also continued reform momentum.\nThe new (Narendra) Modi government has had to deliver against very high expectations. There has been progress in terms of raising foreign direct investment limits in various sectors, introducing administrative measures to increase the ease of doing business, and approving infrastructure-related projects. The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund was also set up to support equity financing for such projects. Still, there is more to be done in terms of the finalization of the goods and services tax, the important land acquisition bill and labour market reform as well as building India’s manufacturing sector.\nWhatever pace the reforms decide to take, we expect that monetary policy in India will be biased towards further easing, albeit slowly and in a measured way. This will ensure the government’s efforts are complemented and that the impact of the Fed rate normalization is also taken into account.\nDo you see room for rate cuts in the second half of this fiscal?\nYes, we expect there will be 50 bps worth of cuts to the benchmark repo rate in 2HFY16, which has yet to be priced in. One-year overnight index swaps have barely moved, suggesting the market has not built in further rate cuts into expectations just yet. Although inflation has risen lately, the better-than-expected monsoon rainfall has eased concerns over food price inflationary pressures and should provide room to ease policy. Moreover, the real interest rate in India is at around 2%—policy rate accounted for inflation—which is deemed still too high for an economic cycle that has so far lagged. This further supports the case for easing. Oil prices remaining lower for longer is an added positive for India’s oil import bill and, hence, its current account deficit and inflation—which again paves the way for further rate cuts.\nIndia’s financial markets have been subject to volatility due to a host of factors over the past month. Yet, you remain overweight on Indian equities—can you explain your position? The Coutts’ investment office is also of the view that the Indian markets may see a 7-10% correction in the next quarter—why is that so?\nIndia is more of a buy-and-hold investment and the long-term case for Indian assets remains intact. We were overweight on India in the lead-up to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi’s election victory and maintain this stance as foreign flows are still broadly supportive and there is confidence in the new government’s reform delivery.\nWhile we remain overweight on India, there are nuances within this view for asset allocation. For instance, those who invested in Indian equities in May 2014 would have made 22% returns to-date in dollar terms, versus Asia ex-Japan equities returning 3.2%. Those who have made gains can consider profit taking and selling into any current signs of strength. However, those looking for current buying opportunities will need to be selective with sector picks, given the expensive broader market valuations. Private banks and select state lenders with lower ratios of non-performing assets are preferred. The automobile and construction-related sectors, the latter being a beneficiary of higher infrastructure spending, are also favoured.\nHowever, for gaining or re-gaining exposure to the broader market as a whole, investors may want to look out for better entry levels over the next quarter. Technical analysis suggests a 7-10% correction may be possible due to muted earnings...so far being a drag on the market, the possibility of near-term disappointments in reform announcements, especially around key bills such as land acquisition, and uncertainty over newsflow regarding the new monetary policy committee framework proposed by the government. State elections later in the year may also temporarily slow the pace of reforms.\nCurrently there appears to be different opinions on the Indian markets among analysts. Earnings are yet to pick up, valuations appear high and, added to it, there is a policy paralysis in Parliament. So where do you stand on Indian equity markets, compared with the rest of the region?\nEarnings...so far have been mixed and valuations are expensive on a relative basis. Indian equities are trading at 14.7x 2016 forward price-to-earnings versus the rest of the region trading at 11.1x, and is the second most expensive Asian market after the Philippines. However, looking beyond the next few months, longer term prospects for corporate profitability should be supported by easier policy, which should spur companies’ capex cycles. Furthermore, the cuts to corporate taxes outlined in this year’s Union budget will also help. We continue to like Indian equities as a longer term investment proposition, while growth plays catch-up over the next two years.\nIt looks like the goods and services tax (GST) will miss the 2016 deadline as the bill remains stuck in Parliament. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had done a major U-turn on the land acquisition bill. Added to this, the proposed changes to Indian Financial Code, where the government wants to clip RBI’s wings. Looking at all this together, is a negative perception being created about India? The investors you speak to here in Singapore, what do they say?\nInvestors are definitely asking questions about what these developments would mean for India, Indian assets, and its impact on expectations. However, investors also recognize that the Indian macro story still looks promising, if we look beyond the near term.\nIf the GST bill does not get passed into law in the current monsoon session, which ends on 13 August, it is likely to be tabled for discussion again in the winter session of Parliament. The land acquisition bill is an important bill and also the most highly contested. We believe some form of it will be passed, but again, also likely to be discussed further in the winter parliamentary session.\nThe revision of the government’s Indian Financial Code, which proposes changes to the RBI’s monetary policy committee has also sparked jitters among investors as it is seen as a possible dilution of the RBI governor’s veto powers in decision-making. However, investors also recognize that it is too early to judge the impact that such a change would have on central bank credibility. This is still a draft and RBI is likely to oppose. We expect that even if such changes were to materialize at the end of the year, it would be in the government’s interest to respect inflation objectives whilst in pursuit of growth, to maintain credibility.\nWhen you talk to clients and investors here in Singapore, do you get the feeling that lacklustre earnings and macroeconomic numbers are making investors impatient?\nRather than the lack of earnings and a lagged economic cycle, it is the volatility and risk that investors are more concerned about. They are prepared to be patient to see returns but are more interested in understanding how to manage near-term risks and where those risks could come from.\nYour take on the rupee—medium-term and long-term. Assuming the Fed increases rates in September, what could the implications be for India?\nIn our view, the rupee may not completely escape the brunt of Fed rate normalization, However, it does stand better against its peers, in terms of being cushioned against massive exchange-rate volatility. There will likely be some depreciation against the US dollar as the Fed tightens policy and as dollar strength continues. We expect USD-INR to settle close to 64.50 by year-end. A weaker currency bodes well for exporters but from a portfolio perspective, investors need to be mindful of hedging strategies. In the longer term, there is scope for modest appreciation, based on the expectation that growth should come through and reform momentum will pick up.\nA strong dollar will cap the magnitude of rupee appreciation. What we think is the key takeaway here is that rather than currency direction, RBI is more concerned about currency stability. This is why efforts were made to increase foreign reserves and to limit FX volatility. Large moves for the rupee are not favoured and we have also seen intervention in the past, where state-run banks have been reported to sell dollars at levels above 64 to curb dollar strength. A very strong rupee is also not preferred as it would hurt exporters. We expect any movements for the rupee to be modest.\nWhat is your take on China? Will the bloodbath in the Chinese markets lead to investors shifting to other markets in the region like in India?\nRather than rotating between the two, investors are actually trying to make sense of the two markets on a separate basis. Both markets have witnessed volatility and many Asian investors have exposure to both. The freefall in China’s stock market has been a concern to investors more recently, in comparison to events and developments in India.\nChina is another core market that we like for the longer term and we view dips as buying opportunities. The market rout was amplified due to the unwinding of leveraged positions. While this volatility may continue in the near-term, we do not see reasons to change our fundamentally positive long-term view on Chinese equities.\nCleaning up the financial system to promote a healthy and stable financial market, for instance by curbing margin lending and speculative activity, is part and parcel of the government’s long-term reform agenda. Alongside these reforms, policy support from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) will also likely continue.\nUnlike India, the PBoC’s easing may be relatively more aggressive with further cuts to the reserve requirement ratios and lending/deposit rates to spur liquidity. This should underpin Chinese asset prices. China’s H-shares remain attractively valued versus A-shares. In fact, the valuation argument is more supportive of China rather than India.\nIf investors have taken profit on India, they could consider picking up exposure to China gradually. There is a case to be made for both India and China but investors just need to be mindful of near-term factors of volatility for both these major Asian markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:54:06.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
