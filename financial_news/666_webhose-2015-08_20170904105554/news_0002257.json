Economists had expected a 0.3 per cent gain. In a separate report, the Federal Statistical Office said that exports dropped 1 per cent - worse than the forecast 0.3 per cent decline - while imports were 0.5 per cent lower. Germany's trade surplus slipped to 22 billion euros ($A32.73 billion) from 22.8 billion euros in May. UniCredit economist Andreas Rees described the drop in production as a \"statistical fluke\" rather than providing any evidence of an impact from slowing growth in China.
