Together with his existing shareholding, this will give Rakishev an effective 56.75 percent stake, the bank said. \nForbes magazine describes Rakishev, 36, as Kazakhstan's 10th richest man, with assets of $684 million. \nHis business interests include the industrial holding SAT & Company, where he is majority shareholder and chairman. He is also a co-founder of Genesis Angels, a venture capital fund for high-tech start-ups in Israel.
