The bank has sold at least $106 billion of its $3.7 trillion trove of reserve assets in the last two weeks, including Treasuries, according to an estimate from Societe Generale SA.\nYield Block As a result, yields on Treasuries, a benchmark for corporate and consumer borrowing costs, are higher than they’d otherwise be as investors have sought a refuge from flailing stocks.\n\"By selling Treasuries to defend the renminbi, they’re preventing Treasury yields from going lower despite the fact that we’ve seen a sharp drop in the stock market,\" David Woo, head of global rates and currencies research at Bank of America Corp., said on Bloomberg Television. \"China has a direct impact on global markets through U.S. rates.\"\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year note yields 2.18 percent, equivalent to its one-year average, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Yields haven’t closed below 2 percent in the past two weeks even though traders have slashed the probability that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, to 24 percent from 50 percent three weeks ago.\nAt 2.93 percent, 30-year yields exceed their 2.87 percent average of the past year.\nReserve Calculus Societe Generale’s estimate of $106 billion of reserve asset sales comes from its calculation of how much liquidity the PBOC will add to the country’s financial system through Tuesday’s reduction of interest rates and the reserve-requirement ratio. The assumption is that the central bank aims to replenish the funds it drained when it bought yuan to stabilize the currency.\n“When equity markets tumbled on Monday afternoon, some emerging-market currencies almost collapsed and the central banks sold Treasuries and maybe European government bonds as well,” said Eric Vanraes, a fund manager in Geneva at EI Sturdza Investment Funds, which oversees about $2.7 billion. “That’s why we didn’t experience such a big rally in bonds.”\nGross didn’t respond to an e-mail message Wednesday seeking comment on his tweet.\nChina, with $1.27 trillion of Treasuries as of June, is the biggest overseas holder of the debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nIn a sign that international buyers’ appetite for Treasuries may be fading, purchases from non-dealer bidders, a group of investors that includes foreign central banks and mutual funds, fell at auctions this weak. Their demand for five-year notes at a sale Wednesday was the lowest since October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:24:20.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
