Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires Just one week into August and a $3 billion capital raising exercise and savage cost-cutting measures to satisfy demand for dividend payouts are setting the tone for the rest of the reporting season, fund managers say.\nFidelity Australian Equities Fund portfolio manager Paul Taylor said the spotlight was shone on big banks' capital this season, as tougher requirements from the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority loomed.\n\"When we look back on reporting season I would think the capital position of the banks is probably going to be a theme of the season,\" he said.\n\"Particularly with the regulation change, the increase in margins and a focus on getting to their required capital levels as soon as they can,\" he said.\nThat was kicked off by ANZ Banking Group on Thursday. It unveiled its third-quarter profits, which at $5.4 billion were weaker than expected, but its stunning $3 billion capital raising, to avoid being rushed into a \"fire sale\" of assets closer to the July regulatory deadline, left investors reeling.\nIts shares fell as much as 8.5 per cent on Friday after they were released from a trading halt.\nThe effects of a 40 per cent plunge in the iron ore price in the past year was evident in Rio Tinto's results on Thursday. It reported a 43 per cent fall in half-year underlying profit to $US2.9 billion, but came in ahead of analysts expectations.\nExplosives maker Orica on Friday blamed \"extremely challenging\" conditions in the mining sector on a $1.65 billion writedown , and said the expectation of 2014-15 profits of $490 million was too high, with the realistic number up to 15 per cent lower.\n Engineering services company Downer EDI, meanwhile, reported a net profit after tax of $210.2 million, in line with expectations, but warned of a weak 2016 forecast of $190 million.\nWilson Asset Management senior analyst Martin Hickson said any company exposed to mining was under pressure, and as well as the expected, such as Downer EDI, it also included companies not necessarily directly related to the industry.\n\"ANZ pointed to the fact there was weakness in mining and agriculture, Genworth did a similar thing, they have seen a pickup in delinquencies, largely in Western Australian and Queensland, the areas most exposed to mining,\" he said.\n\"The key theme there is there's still weakness in mining and things are going to get tougher than what has been expected.\"\nInsurer and banking group Suncorp impressed with its results , despite a year which it called the worst on record for natural disasters.\nIt lifted its dividend payout a cent higher to 76Â¢ a share, after posting a full-year net profit of $1.13 billion on Tuesday, surging from $730 million the previous year despite challenging conditions.\nBut Watermark Funds Management analyst Omkar Joshi said Suncorp also made it clear that cost-cutting was \"a pretty big focus\" for the company.\nHe also noted that bad debts were on the rise and a weakening in asset quality.\n\"Retail non-performing loans increased almost 10 per cent, that's a pretty significant uptick,\" he said.\nMr Joshi said the company did not identify a specific reason for the increase, but it was an across the board issue. ANZ also noted an increase in bad debts which had until recently been at historic lows.\n\"That's not a good sign,\" Mr Joshi said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-08-07T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:04:38.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
