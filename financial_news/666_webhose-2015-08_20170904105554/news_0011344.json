But the Japanese rice wine appears to be gaining newfound respect and attention as a sip worth savoring at all sorts of occasions (and with all sorts of foods). There are now sake festivals everywhere from Las Vegas to Honolulu. (And at a 2014 New York event, Japan’s Miss Sake even put in an appearance.) Trendy bartenders are also incorporating sake into cocktails. (Ever heard of a saketini ?) And there’s a push to promote made-in-the-U.S. craft sakes .\nThere’s also TY KU, an upstart brand that has been aiming to give sake a sleek, contemporary appeal. The brand is known for its unique packaging, with bottles that have a distinctive, triangular design. It also launched a campaign to promote sake as the perfect “après yoga” sip. And now, TY KU is innovating on another front — the flavor one. That is, it’s introducing flavored sakes (like flavored vodka but with, well, sake). It previously rolled out a coconut sake. And just in time for summer, it launched a cucumber sake. The brand says the latter flavor plays especially well into the post-yoga concept, adding that it’s like the alcoholic equivalent of the water-with-cucumber slices offering you’ll find at many a spa.\nNo matter how the cucumber sake is received, TY KU seems to be finding a thirsty audience for its other sakes (the brand has more traditional premium and super-premium ones). In all, the brand says its sales have grown at a rate of 34% a year for the last five years. “Our mission is to put sake on the mainstream map,” says TY KU brand executive director Guillaume Cuvelier.\nWhat we think about it: We prefer our sake in the more traditional, unflavored form because that’s how you can best appreciate its subtle, often slightly floral or fruity taste. But TY KU Cucumber works if you think of it more as a sake cocktail in a bottle — it delivers a nice mouthful of sweet cucumber flavor in mildly alcoholic (12%) form. It could also be a good substitute for a pre-dinner glass of white wine.\nHow to enjoy it: This is definitely a sip to be served chilled, since it’s all about refreshment. (And while you can opt for the traditional sake cup, TY KU folks say a wine glass is an appropriate serving vessel.) If you want to take things to another level, TY KU suggests using the cucumber sake as a base for cocktails — say, a Half Moon Mojito (with cucumber sake, lemonade and basil leaves) or a Warrior Breeze (with cucumber sake and muddled watermelon).\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saketini"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T16:40:59.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
