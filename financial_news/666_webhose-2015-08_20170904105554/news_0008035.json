When asked if the China shake-up was made in preparation for such a move, Blum said, \"No.\"\nSu will serve as an executive adviser through February 2016 to assist with the management transition. Su will remain on Yum's board of directors, Yum said.\nThe company also announced that Joey Wat, 44, was promoted to CEO of KFC China. She was previously president of KFC China. Peter Kao, 58, was promoted CEO of the Pizza Hut brand in China. Kao was previously senior vice president and brand general manager of Pizza Hut China.\nJ.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe said in a client note in May that he came away from Yum's recent China investor conference with sense that a spin off of the China business was more a \"probability\" than a \"possibility.\"\nHedge fund Corvex Management, which has been urging Yum to spin off its China operations, has said the business could be worth more than Yum's share price suggests.\nCorvex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nYum's China business has been fighting to recover from a meat quality scare at one of its minor suppliers.\nBlum, the spokesman, said sales at established restaurants in China have turned significantly positive in the current quarter.
