Daniel Munoz by Sally Rose The heads of Westpac and AMP have told a Senate committee they would back moves to force them to pay into a compensation scheme to provide a safety net for victims of their smaller rivals who have been left destitute, and pay higher licensing fees to help fund policing of their industry.\nLate on Friday, AMP Ltd chief executive Craig Meller and Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer both told the Senate committee into scrutiny of financial advice they would support the establishment of a last-resort scheme for investors unable to receive the compensation awarded to them by a court for poor financial advice because their financial planner had gone broke or was refusing to pay.\nTwo of the big four domestic banks have now contradicted peak body the Australian Bankers' Association, which earlier last week fended off the suggestion, arguing there was \"no urgent need\". ANZ deputy chief executive Graham Hodges told the Senate hearing last week that his bank would also support such a scheme.\nHowever, Mr Meller and Mr Hartzer both linked their support to a call for the government to lift standards, ensure higher capital buffers, and tighten professional indemnity insurance requirements at their smaller rivals to limit the burden on large institutions of subsidising a compensation scheme.\n\"While I have great sympathy sympathise with customers of other providers who have not had their determinations paid, that sympathy does not extend to their providers,\" Mr Meller said.\nCommittee chairman Senator Sam Dastyari said an industry-wide scheme might provide a \"safety net\" for those who slipped through the net at the smaller end of the industry.\nPlug funding gap Senator John Williams said the committee was also considering recommending that businesses be charged an additional $500 annual fee per planner to help the regulator plug the $27.2 million a year gap in funding for its investigations from licence fees.\n \"In principle charging the industry for compliance costs would be appropriate. ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) should weight the costs to those providers with the most risk, as this would be fairer and also encourage higher standards,\" Mr Meller said.\nOver the past five years AMP had terminated 17 advisers over misconduct, and reported all of those individuals to ASIC as being in breach of the licence requirements, he said. Over that period the wealth management giant had 3800 advisers working under its licence.\nAbout 1000 past and present AMP client files had been earmarked for review in relation to the 17 sacked advisers, with 37 having received compensation payments already, Mr Meller said.\nMr Hartzer said that between January 1, 2009 and July 15, 2015 the Westpac Group had fired 11 planners for \"inappropriate serious concerns\" and had made $2.5 million in compensation payments so far to 61 clients in relation to poor advice provided by those 11 former employees. Head of Westpac's advice business BT Financial Group chief executive Brad Cooper said a further 2300 client files were currently subject to a review that was expected to take 12 months, with 550 of those clients already contacted over the past three months.\nThe AMP and Westpac Group executives all agreed with suggestions that more needed to be done to alert the public via ASIC's new financial adviser register when an adviser had been terminated because of misconduct, with \"bad apples\" showing up working at rivals an ongoing problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:28:37.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
