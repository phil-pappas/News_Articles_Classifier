The number of neighbourhood transactions also increased very significantly in 2014, having risen to 71 transactions from 43 in 2013.\"\nMr Rooney said there was strong demand for assets from a widening range of institutional and private investors.\n\"The heavy focus on the non-discretionary based neighbourhood sector at present reflects the attractiveness of defensive assets which provide long term stable income returns and strong potential for capital growth,\" he said.\nJLL Research shows neighbourhood yields nationally range between 6.25 per cent and 9.25 cent and a weighted average mid-point of 7.55 per cent as at the second quarter of 2015.\nThe research indicates that sub-regional rents showed signs of a rental recovery in the second quarter of 2015; while average CBD, neighbourhood and bulky goods rents increased further.\nThe average rent for neighbourhood centres is about $500 per square metre per annum.\nAverage regional rents remained stable this quarter. Yield compression was recorded across all monitored sub-sectors in the second quarter of 2015, to a greater degree in the neighbourhood and large format store sub-sectors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:07:02.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
