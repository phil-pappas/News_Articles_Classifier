Yes, just $20. \nIf one is in a rush to the airport, then it would be cheaper to run from the police and pay the $20 on your way back. \nThe point here is that our tickets are ineffective as a deterrent. \nGoing through a red traffic light is a pretty egregious offence, but the fine is no more than a slap on the wrist. \nThis sends a rather simple message, if you are in a rush take the risk and beat that red light, if you are caught the fine is insignificant. \nEven if our tickets were more effective, the fact that the police do not have a centralised system means you could get 50 tickets in a year and not lose your licence. \nWorse still, our police have no way of actually checking if someone has a licence or not. \nA person without a licence can easily tell a police officer they left their licence at home and that would be the end of it. \nNothing is stopping the police from contracting some clever young developers to write them a small application that runs off USSD like Ecocash and can check if a person actually has a licence. \nCost cannot be the reason why these things are not being done because these solutions are relatively cheap to deploy. \nSo why are these simple solutions not being implemented? \nI suspect the answer lies in how performance evaluation and employment contracts are structured. \nIf the police officer in charge of traffic was evaluated on the percentage drop in road fatalities, things would quickly improve because such an officer would have a sense of urgency in seeking a solution. \nAt one time the Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede ran the most inefficient Government operation in this country. \nLong queues wound around the building out into the road and back into Herbert Chitepo Avenue. \nAll that has changed. \nGetting a passport is now a breeze and everyone is pleased. \nWhat changed? Nothing, someone simply started doing their job. \nNdatenda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:44:53.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
