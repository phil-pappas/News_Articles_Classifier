If they move in September, it's going to cast a lot of doubt about where they will stop,\" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.\nThe S&P energy index rose 0.8 percent and was on track for its best four-day gain in seven years, boosted by ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66.\nCrude prices jumped after data indicated surprise cuts to U.S. oil production and as OPEC said it was ready to talk to other producers about the recent drop in prices.\nFischer's remarks at the global central banking conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming suggested the Fed could look beyond recent stock market turmoil brought on by fears that China's economy is faltering.\n\"We can still expect to see some significant drops in the market until we get some direction from the Fed regarding a rate increase,\" said John DeClue, chief investment officer of U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\nAt 2:19 pm, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.76 percent at 16,516.17 and the S&P 500 was 0.85 percent lower at 1,971.91.\nThe Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.97 percent to 4,781.67.\nNine of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower with the utilities index's 1.8 percent fall leading the decliners.\nTwitter gained 3.69 percent after SunTrust Robinson raised its rating to \"buy\" from \"neutral\".\nPhillips 66 was up 2.6 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $4.48 billion stake in the oil refiner.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,793 to 1,229. On the Nasdaq, 1,511 issues fell and 1,229 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 23 new highs and 16 new lows.
