ADVERTISEMENT Castro did not specify exactly how much money the U.S. owes Cuba. The embargo he referred to, however, remains in effect despite the new U.S. policy to normalize relations with the Communist nation. On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to raise the U.S. flag at the reopening of an embassy in Havana, Cuba. Several lawmakers are expected to join him on the trip. The Cuban Embassy in Washington reopened on July 20. Castro did not mention Kerry’s upcoming visit or the efforts to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries, reports say. He also criticized the U.S. for its decision in 1971 to stop swapping dollars for gold. The former Cuban president and prime minister turned 89 on Thursday. His brother, Raúl Castro, took over as president in 2006. President Obama wants Congress to lift the embargo against Cuba, but many Republicans and even some Democrats oppose taking that action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T04:21:42.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
