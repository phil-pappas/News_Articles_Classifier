The FOMC however made few indications of the timing of the lift-off. \nThe minutes were released as consumer prices rose by a modest 0.1pc last month. The uptick in inflation was slightly lower than analyst forecasts of 0.2pc , and will give the Federal Reserve \"pause for thought\" over a September rate rise, said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. \n\"The decision is finely balanced. With underlying price inflation and wage growth still muted, a case can also be made for waiting,\" said Mr Ashworth. \nA measure of core inflation, which strips out volatile elements such as food and energy, rose by 1.8pc in the year to July. But world's largest economy could still fall into deflation in the coming months, said Josh Mahoney of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) . \n\"The impact of multiyear lows in commodity prices and a likely continued depreciation of the yuan\" could drive the US economy back into negative prices, he said. \nWith the Fed keeping a close eye on the labour market, robust job creation could also edge it to move towards a normalisation of monetary policy . The US economy added 215,000 jobs in July, with the minutes noting that labour market improvements are nudging the FOMC towards a rate hike sooner rather than later. \nThe July meeting took place before recent moves by the People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) to devalue the renminbi, sparking a fresh round of stock market volatility . The minutes revealed that fears of an \"adverse spillovers from slower economic growth in China raised some concerns (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) \".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T23:16:13.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
