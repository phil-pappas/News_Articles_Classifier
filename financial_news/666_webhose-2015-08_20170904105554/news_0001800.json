Before Tuesday, Chinese officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoC's move means it will now also take into account the previous day's close and other factors. \nBeijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currency's value on fears major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce its control over the economy. \nThat has made the yuan far more stable than other major global currencies and a 2pc move in its value is dramatic before Tuesday's announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4pc band for four months. \n= Reform = \nBut China is also seeking to reform its yuan policy in an effort to have it included in the International Monetary Fund's basket of \"special drawing rights\" (SDR) reserve currencies. \nIts controls have been a stumbling block in gaining admittance to the select group, now comprised of the US dollar, Europe's euro, British pound and Japanese yen. \nThe Washington-based IMF said this month that \"significant work\" still needed to be done for the yuan to be considered before its next review in November. \n\"A reasonable adjustment of the RMB's value is good for China's exports and also good for the RMB to be admitted to the SDR,\" Liu Dongmin, director of international finance research office at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told AFP. \n\"But most importantly, this marks key progress for RMB exchange rate reform since 2005 and a major step for RMB marketisation,\" he said. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) so the US has long argued the yuan has been kept \"significantly undervalued\" to help Chinese exporters, and Shanghai Finance University associate professor Qin Huanmei told AFP Washington was likely to object to the depreciation. \n\"The value drop of yuan against the US dollar will put pressure on the US because it wants the yuan to appreciate, which would help with its trade,\" she said. \n= 'One-off' move = \nThe PBoC described the sharply lower rate as a one-off move, though it did not use the term devaluation, saying the weakening in the currency reflected the new method of calculating the daily price. \nThe bank will now \"comprehensively consider the supply and demand of foreign exchange\" as well the latest international market rates for foreign currencies to set the fixing, according to a statement. \nAnalysts said data showing a slump in exports over the weekend could also have prompted the move, which should make Chinese goods cheaper overseas. \nExports, a key driver of the country's growth, plunged 8.3pc year-on-year in July, customs said Saturday, spelling more worry for the economy . \nChina's gross domestic product expanded 7.4pc in 2014 - its slowest rate since 1990 - and has slowed further this year . It grew 7.0pc in both of the first two quarters, in line with the government's annual target for 2015. \nWith China's economy already slowing, analysts said a weakening of the currency was long overdue. \n\"The RMB exchange rate deviated greatly from the market (consensus) before, so the one-off correction of 2pc today is big,\" Li Daxiao, an analyst from Yingda Securities, told AFP. \nBy midday on Tuesday, the yuan was quoted at 6.3030 to the dollar, down sharply from Monday's close of 6.2096, according to the operator of the national foreign exchange market. \nBut despite the potential boost to exports and economy the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index shares fell 0.40pc by the break.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:00:10.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
