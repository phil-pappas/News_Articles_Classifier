Mahjoor himself plans to raise a minimum of $156,000/£100,000/€141,000, and has personally donated 1/3 of his goal amount to kick fundraising momentum into high gear. \n“Everyone tells me I’ve gone off the deep end…and they’re probably right,” says Mahjoor with a smile, “But as I look down from the top, I’ll think of two things 1) the good cause that has brought me here and 2) please let me make it to the bottom, but not at 275 mph! But truly, it is so important to me to support this wonderful organization that helps so many underprivileged youth, giving them hope, confidence, and a road map to a bright future. Surely it can’t get better than that.” \nTo sponsor Mahjoor’s descent and support his fundraising efforts, please visit www.mahjoor4charity.com .
