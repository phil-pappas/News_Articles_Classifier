So money goes back into the pocket,\" Mr Dodman told AAP on Monday. \n\"So as soon as these cuts are done, it will probably have a positive effect on us.\" \nRoxby Downs administrator Bill Boehm said locals were well aware a substantial amount of job losses were coming. \n\"Difficult though it is, and we're all affected by it, there is both a bright short-term and long-term future,\" Mr Boehm told ABC radio. \nBHP said its decision to cut jobs was not a reflection of state government policy settings. \n\"Instead it is driven by the global challenges in the resources sector and the need to transform Olympic Dam into a sustainable operation that can contribute to the South Australian economy for many years to come,\" Olympic Dam asset president Jacqui McGill said in a statement. \nThe job losses will reduce the total workforce at Olympic Dam to about 3500 and should be finalised by mid-September. \nFollowing the latest cuts and a decision to mothball a major expansion for the mine, the state government has urged BHP to spell out its long-term plans for Olympic Dam. \nWhile Opposition Leader Steven Marshall said the latest job losses emphasised the need for the government to urgently boost employment. \n\"We need urgent action to restore business confidence and stimulate businesses to create jobs in our economy,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook NAB lifts quarterly profit 9% AAP \nNational Australia Bank has lifted its quarterly cash profit nine per cent to $1.75 billion after a fall in bad …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T11:23:00.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
