Meanwhile, contactless cards became available in the country in 2013 after the launch of the Ourocard card by Banco de Brasil. The prepaid travel cards represent one of the most significant opportunities for issuers of prepaid cards given a decision of the government to tax credit cards outside Brazil in 2011.\nMobile penetration reached 133.5 percent in 2014 in the country, while it stood at 100.6 percent in 2010. It is expected to surpass the 153 percent mark in 2019. M-payments are not very popular at the moment, but they are expected to gather pace in the upcoming years. Government support, growing young population and favorable economic conditions will be major factors fuelling this growth.\nNew market research report “ The Cards and Payments Industry in Brazil: Emerging Trends and Opportunities to 2019 ” worked out by Timetric is now available at MarketPublishers.com.\nReport Details:\nTitle: The Cards and Payments Industry in Brazil: Emerging Trends and Opportunities to 2019\nPublished: July, 2015\nPages: 81\nPrice: US$ 3,995.00\nhttps://marketpublishers.com/report/finance_services/cards/cards-n-payments-industry-in-brazil-emerging-trends-n-opportunities-to-2019.html\nThe research report offers a comprehensive guide to the cards and payments industry in Brazil.
