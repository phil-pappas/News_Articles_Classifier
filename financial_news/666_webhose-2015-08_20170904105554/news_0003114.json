In fact, senior finance ministry officials gave an indication after the submission of the report that the government response in this matter slated to be heard in the Supreme Court today, will make it clear what would be the income tax department’s stand on this issue.\nThe government has now sought more time to study the Shah panel report. Attorney General Mukul Rohtagi has told the bench headed by Chief Justice of India H L Dattu that the government needs additional time to establish its position — the apex court has postponed the hearing on the Mauritius-based Castleton Investment Ltd’s (CIL) appeal seeking clarity on the tax consequences on foreign companies which do not have a permanent establishment in India, to September 29.\nThe income tax department had sent notices to 68 foreign institutional investors demanding Rs 602 crore as MAT dues of the previous years, which has been now abolished from April 1 this year. This led to the controversy forcing the government to set up the Shah committee to look into it and the Central Board of Direct Tax telling its officials not to proceed further in these cases.\nGoing by the past experience, the income tax department would try its level to protect the revenue interest even if it comes at the cost of more confusion and costly delays. So, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley must persuade the taxman to decide on the next course of action based on the suggestions of the Shah panel quickly — even if it means outlining that the action of the income tax department was as per the law, but the government doesn’t want to pursue it, if he is serious about improving the uncertain tax atmosphere in the country.\nThis will also allow the government to hand over other legacy tax issues, including the retrospective tax amendments to the committee.\n 05, 2015 10:04 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:14:36.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
