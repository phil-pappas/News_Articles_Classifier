Here, in five charts, is a look at this week’s financial-market highlights. \n#1: China's Wild Swings \nChina shares once again shook global markets, plunging anew amid receding confidence in Beijing’s ability to stem the selling. But a look at China’s stock-market history shows wild swings are the norm; in fact, the most recent rout is only the 21st worst in 25 years. \n#2: Commodities' Deeper Slide \nThe slide in commodities also resumed, plunging the S&P GSCI Total Return index to its worst monthly loss since 2008. It marks a deepening of a yearslong rout that few expect to moderate, amid a slowdown in China, an anemic global economy and the prospect of higher U.S. rates. The pain is spreading to some of Wall Street’s heaviest hitters, with several commodity hedge funds closing or shrinking. \n#3: Oil's Mixed Signals \nOne reason oil markets have been so volatile lately: Mixed signals from official data on whether U.S. production is finally waning, a development that would help ease the global glut weighing on prices. Conflicting images of U.S. production have emerged from separate federal reports in recent months; on Friday, oil tumbled again as U.S. drilling activity stepped up, although a monthly government report said U.S. production hit a 44-year-high in March and has declined since. Choice fields are one reason some small drillers have been able to keep on pumping. \n#4: The Market's Hot Stocks \nSix stocks have fueled the bulk of gains this year in the Nasdaq Composite, raising fresh concerns about the health of the market’s advance. But investors continue to clamor for select sectors, with Tuesday’s debut of biotech company NantKwest Inc. bringing the highest-ever IPO valuation for a biotech company with no approved drugs, and Uber Technologies Inc. getting new funding that values the ride-hailing company at more than $50 billion. \n#5: Banks' Trans-Atlantic Rivalry \nIn the trans-Atlantic rivalry for investment-banking supremacy, U.S. banks have started running up the score, preparing to pounce as European bank executives over the past week delivered a series of dour proclamations about their need to shrink and further dial back their global ambitions.
