Ecosystem‐based adaptation (EbA) provides flexible, cost-effective, and broadly applicable alternatives for building robust food systems on fewer inputs while reducing the impacts of climate change. \nThe participants at the conference converted existing lessons and experiences into common solutions for food security and climate change adaptation on the continent, their objectives being to determine how to protect and restore Africa's ecosystems, achieve food security, identify scalable inclusive business and finance models, put in place policies that incentivize public and private investment in EbA and increase the likelihood of increased investment from oil earnings back into the Earth's ecosystems, which underpin the entire food security system. \nThe adoption of the Nairobi Action Agenda reflects the importance of the issues on a continent where food imports exceed food exports by 30 percent and the agricultural sector uses over 60 percent of Africa's labour force. \nThe EBAFOSA replaces the Ecosystem Based Adaptation for Food Security Conference (EBAFOSC) to become the continental body dialoguing and working with the African Union and other partners to help drive the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) agenda in line with the Malabo Declaration as well as the proposed SDGs and Agenda 2063. \nDelegates from the UN, regional economic communities, non-governmental organizations, Civil Societies, researchers, the private sector and others including UNEP, FAO, AfDB, AFRA, FARA, ACTS, Greenpeace, ActionAid, Global Environmental Facility, Equity Bank and many other partners discussed multiple topics including how 'Green Revolution' technologies can be made more EbA-friendly, how to build resilience under a changing climate, how to use examples from other southern countries, avert post-harvest loss, use EbA policy to shape the implementation of international agendas, subsidy reform, land tenure and tax incentives as well as how to harness EbA-driven agriculture to stimulate job creation, growth, and value additional partnership in Africa.
