We all know this truth. We (Congress) believe that anger does not benefit anybody except Modiji. It does not benefit the country, farmers, poor and businessmen and we have seen this in Kashmir,” he said.\nRahul said Congress believed in taking everybody along.\nReferring to the 25 years of turmoil in the Valley, the Congress leader said it has been seen in Kashmir over the past many years now that violence does not benefit anyone.\nHitting out at the BJP , the Congress leader said they make the people angry and want them to fight each other.\n“Congress wants to take everyone along in harmony,” he added.\nRahul also accused the NDA government of being anti-farmer.\n“This government is anti-farmer across the country. It is a suit-boot ki sarkar. Initially we thought, it was generally suit-boot ki sarkar but now we have realised that it is only (favouring) five or 10 people (corporates),” he added.\nRahul said he had come to Kashmir on the invitation of the saffron growers as they wanted “me to see first hand” the problems they were facing.\n 27, 2015 3:04 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:24:08.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
