Photo: Supplied\nIt is a never-ending battle for consumers to seek out the cheapest home loans in the market. With interest rates at record low levels, consumers are actively searching to lock in mortgages for as long as possible before interest rates start to rise and property prices begin to fall.\nBesides trawling through the regular financial institutions such as banks and established mortgage lenders online for the best deal, a range of loan comparison websites have entered the market.\nHashChing is one such company claiming to be 'Australia's first online marketplace for home loans'.\n\"HashChing is the only platform where consumers can access better home loan rates from multiple lenders through verified mortgage brokers servicing their area,\" Mandeep Sodhi, co-founder says.\nAdvertisement \"[The] consumer can select the home loan deal and submit the postcode which automatically notifies the HashChing verified mortgage broker servicing the postcode who gets in touch with the consumer directly to service the selected deal.\"\nHashChing believes it is different in comparison to loan websites such as Finder and Mozo because it offers a better service to customers.\n\"Those two websites might offer you more choice on home loans but there is hardly any savings, as the comparison sites show [the] same advertised rate by lenders and send you back to the lender's website,\" Sodhi says.\n\"Consumers can also call a mortgage broker who can negotiate a better rate on their behalf but they don't know which local broker is the recommended broker as there is no rating available currently and there is a concern that the broker may push a high commissioned product.\"\nHashChing operates under a credit representative authorisation granted by the ASIC, which requires it to comply with the laws regarding the home loan market in Australia and receive one-off fixed upfront commission on loan settlement only.\nIn three months trading until the end of July, HashChing had already received 80 home loan applications worth $41.25 million from which three applications totalling $1.3 million had been settled.\nThe company has raised several million in capital and is planning to launch in Asia and India before the year is out. The company is keen to get a big slice of the $1.4 trillion mortgage market in Australia.\n\"HashChing partners with mortgage brokers only in Australia who now write 52 per cent of home loans and can negotiate a better rate on behalf of the consumers due to the volume they do with a lenders,\" Sodhi says.\nHe believes that consumers are better off using HashChing because they will know from the start who is going to contact them with the details of the mortgage broker at the preferred time provided by the consumers.\n\"This eliminates the need for a call centre operator because the first point of contact for consumer is a mortgage broker who is knowledgeable and understands the consumer needs to recommend the right mortgage,\" he says.\nWebsites such as Finder have been around for some time in Australia and have expanded their range of services. Not only do they compare home loan rates but they have also embarked on end user education to make their understanding of the financial markets easier.\n\"We want to empower people to be able to live a better life through financial literacy and making better decisions,\" Fred Schebesta, co-founder and director, says.\n\"We are very different to other comparison websites out there because we go deeper, helping to solve people's problems about banking information, answer their questions without a sales response.\"\nThe website also offers access to brokers who can help consumers through the maze of a first-time mortgage.\n\"We compare more than 1,500 home loans alone and for every 0.25 percentage points you can reduce your home loan by, that's worth about $50 per month for a $300,000 home loan, $600 per year or $18,000 over 30 years,\" Schebesta says. \"That can make a big difference.\"\nBut are these comparison sites making a dent on the big four banks? After all, inertia exists strongly within the banking community with consumers reluctant to change banks fearing that they will get the same level of service, if not worse, than they currently get.\nIf it has had one effect on the banks though, it has been to improve their product offering through better and clearer website information.\n\"Competition is increasing as the digital revolution impacts the financial services industry,\" Andy Fell, general manager retail banking at St George, says.\n\"This is good for customers and good for Australia's economic development. St George does not take competition for granted and is continually using innovation to improve our services and customer experience.\n\"Last year St George introduced HomeHero â€“ a website that provides relevant and easy-to-use information to help customers looking for a new home. Now, 70 per cent of home loan applications are approved in branch within one hour.\"\nThe race is on to provide Australia's most competitive home loan website. The only question that remains is will consumers ultimately get a better deal?\nTime will tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T19:07:19.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
