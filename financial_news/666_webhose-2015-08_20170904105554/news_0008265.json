It is possible, however, they could be fake. \nIn a message the hackers said: \"Time (Xetra: 17T.DE - news ) 's up! Avid Life Media has failed to take down Ashley Madison and Established Men. \n\"We have explained the fraud, deceit, and stupidity, of ALM and their members. \n\"Now everyone gets to see their data.\" \nThe hackers, who said they targeted the company because they don't agree with how the sites are run, added: \"Find someone you know in here. Keep in mind the site is a scam with thousands of fake female profiles... \n\"Find yourself in here? It was ALM that failed you and lied to you. Prosecute them and claim damages.\" \nAmong the users' names that have been released are: sex_pistol77, wildbanana, married_gent and sensualman321. \nAs well as thousands of obvious aliases, Sky News has seen numerous names that appear to be real, including at least one that is linked to a Canadian company director. \nA hacking expert who is familiar with the dark web told Sky News that the information that had been placed online looked credible. \nThe expert, named Vinnie, said: \"I don't think they would be able to fake the size of this database. A friend of mine already has it – she's already going through the emails and stuff and it all looks very legit. \n\"I know for a fact that these people always release the databases. They usually release them if they can’t find a buyer or they have found a buyer.\" \nA statement from Ashley Madison's owners Avid Life Media said: \"Last month we were made aware of an attack to our systems. \n\"We immediately launched a full investigation utilising independent forensic experts and other security professionals to assist with determining the origin, nature, and scope of this attack. \n\"Our investigation is still ongoing and we are simultaneously cooperating fully with law enforcement investigations. \n\"This event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality. It is an illegal action against the individual members of AshleyMadison.com, as well as any freethinking people who choose to engage in fully lawful online activities. \n\"The criminal, or criminals, involved in this act have appointed themselves as the moral judge, juror, and executioner, seeing fit to impose a personal notion of virtue on all of society. \n\"We will not sit idly by and allow these thieves to force their personal ideology on citizens around the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:43:41.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
