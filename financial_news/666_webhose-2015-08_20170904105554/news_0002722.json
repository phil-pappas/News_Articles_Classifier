The S&P 500 lost 0.29 percent to 2,077.57 and the Nasdaq Composite finished 0.26 percent lower at 5,043.54.\nFor the week, the Dow lost 1.8 percent, the Nasdaq dipped 1.7 percent and the S&P edged down 1.2 percent. After hitting a record high in May, the S&P 500 is now up less than 1 percent for the year.\nOn Friday, seven of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 1.86 percent fall leading the decliners as oil prices headed for a sixth week of losses.\nExxon Mobil's 1.61 percent drop weighed the most on the S&P 500.\nWith second-quarter earnings season almost over, S&P 500 companies' aggregate profits are estimated to have increased 1.6 percent, while revenues are projected to have fallen 3.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nWith many U.S. companies boosting their earnings per share by cutting costs and buying back stock instead of by growing their businesses, stock valuations remain a concern. The S&P 500 trades at 16.6 times expected earnings, which is pricier than the 10-year median of 14.7.\nCablevision Systems' shares fell 2.68 percent after the company managed to stem video subscriber losses, but at the cost of margins.\nNvidia's shares surged 12.37 percent a day after the chipmaker reported a surprise rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong demand for its graphic chips for high-end video game computers.\nDecliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,800 to 1,262. On the Nasdaq, 1,701 issues fell and 1,088 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index chalked up four new 52-week highs and 20 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite saw 27 new highs and 161 new lows.\nAbout 6.7 billion shares changed hands on all U.S. exchanges, under an average 7.0 billion in the past five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets data.
