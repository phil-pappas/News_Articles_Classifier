The relief came following a petition filed by Nestle India, challenging the withdrawal and recall order of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The food safety watchdog had passed its orders on June 5, following which Nestle had withdrawn Maggi from the market. A similar order was also passed on Maggi's oats variant. The food safety regulator said tests conducted on a batch of Maggi was found to contain more-than-permissible levels of lead and high quantities of mono-sodium glutamate.
