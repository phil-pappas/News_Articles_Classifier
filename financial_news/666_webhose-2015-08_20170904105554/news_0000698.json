It also said that with the shares trading on a premium rating of 1.6x 30 June 2015 tangible book value, material near-term upside may be limited. \nHowever, the brokerage still sees a total return opportunity of over 15% from current levels on an 18-24 month view. It said that with dividend payments having resumed and management focused on pursuing a \"low cost, low risk, customer focused\" business model, there is strong potential for the company to become a solid income stock over the coming years. \nCharles Stanley said that as with the full-year 2014 results, the interim results have shown a good underlying performance but statutory profits were hampered by further significant legacy misconduct charges and other one-offs. \n\"The underlying profit improvement has again been mainly been derived from lower loan losses which could reverse in a more challenging economic environment,\" it said. \nThe brokerage pointed out that she shares fell 3% in the day of the results despite the 6% underlying pre-tax profit beat, amid disappointment over the hefty PPI and other misconduct charges. \nAt 1040 BST, Lloyds shares were up 0.8% at 83.82p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T14:21:10.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
