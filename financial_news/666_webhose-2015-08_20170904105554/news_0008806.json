Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan The Abbott government will seek to exploit damaging allegations against the construction union in the Heydon royal commission by bringing on a Senate vote next week to reintroduce the Australian Building and Construction Commission.\n​But the Coalition's ability to finally legislate one of its signature pre-election policies remains in doubt with key Senate crossbenchers on Monday either opposed to the bill or refusing to commit to supporting its passage.\nEmployment Minister Eric Abetz told The Australian Financial Review that the government intends to put the bill, which requires the support of six of the eight Senate crossbenchers, to a parliamentary vote next week.\nSenator Abetz said the evidence heard against the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union in the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption had confirmed the need for the ABCC.\nHe said the union's conduct was \"giving trade unions a bad name and costing taxpayers and consumers in circumstances that are completely unacceptable\".\n\"I think the case has been overwhelmingly made out that there does need to be a special cop on the beat,\" he said.\nThe government has intended to put the bill to a vote in March but Senator Ricky Muir joined crossbenchers Jacqui Lambie and John Madigan in expressing opposition.\nSenator Madigan reiterated on Monday that he did not support the bill in its current form.\n \"I am concerned about allegations of corruption in any sector, be it financial services, building and construction or anywhere else,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately, as it stands, the government's focus remains exclusively on the construction industry, giving the impression that it's proposed legislation is ideologically motivated.\"\nSenator Muir said on Monday that he would spend time this week \"re-addressing\" the bill, while noting the royal commission was ``still ongoing\".\nAccess to confidential reports sought \"Any change in my position will be after serious consideration of the impact of any proposed changes to [the current building inspectorate],\" he said.\nSenator Lambie, who held discussions about the bill with Senator Abetz on Monday, has indicated that the government should allow her to view two confidential reports about the construction industry before she would consider supporting the bill.\nBut the government has maintained its opposition to releasing the reports, written by royal commissioner Dyson Heydon and building watchdog Nigel Hadgkiss respectively.\n​Opposition workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O'Connor said on Monday that Labor remained opposed to the bill as it would give powers to the proposed ABCC that were \"excessive, undemocratic and unwarranted in terms of regulating civil laws\".\n\"Any allegation of serious crime that happens in workplaces by an employer, by an employee, or their representatives should be investigated by crime fighting agencies – the police or the Australian Crime Commission,\" he said.\nMaster Builders Australia chief executive Wilhelm Harnisch said the \"damaging evidence\" presented to the royal commission about the CFMEU's alleged conduct showed why the ABCC needed to be reinstated.\nMr Harnisch said the union's conduct was increasing costs on government building projects and therefore adding to costs imposed on taxpayers.\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver said on Monday that Tony Abbott should set aside his political obsession of attacking workers rights and produce a plan to create jobs and grow the economy.\n\"The ABCC is just another example of the Abbott Government's agenda to take away rights at work and deliver for the business lobby instead of supporting the millions of hardworking Australians who keep the country running,\" he said.\nDave Noonan, national secretary of the CFMEU\"s construction division, said the move to bring on a Senate vote showed the royal commission was an \"entirely political exercise\" and not independent of the government.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-10T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:12:34.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
