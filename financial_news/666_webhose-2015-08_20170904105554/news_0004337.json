TWTR, -5.61% fell Monday to its all-time low since the company's initial public offering in November 2013. The stock has been under pressure after the microblogging company last week reported tepid user growth in the second quarter. Still, some analysts remained upbeat and maintained Twitter's stock price target at $50. \"We recognize that TWTR is a show-me story and it will take some time, but we continue to believe the platform is differentiated,\" said analyst Nicholas Rosato Jr. at J.P. Morgan. Twitter is down 6.2% to $29.09 after trading as low as $28.91. The stock is off 19% year to date and has shed 34% in the past 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T23:34:12.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
