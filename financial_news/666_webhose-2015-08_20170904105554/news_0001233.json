(NYSE: UTI) experienced another quarter of declining enrollment, revenue and income as the Scottsdale-based automotive technical training provider looks for new ways to attract students. The declines were expected, said Kim McWaters, chairman and CEO . She is reaching out to industry employers to help attract prospective new students. She talked about her strategy during the company's second-quarter earnings conference call on May 1. For the third quarter that ended June 30, enrollment at UTI was 11,500, down from 12,600 during the same period in 2014. New student starts were flat at 1,900, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . UTI reported a loss of nearly $3 million on $85.1 million in revenue during second-quarter 2015, down from $366,000 in net income on $91.3 million in revenue during the same period in 2014. McWaters is doing what she can to keep compensation expenses down as the company experiences losses. Salary expenses were nearly $38 million for the three months ended June 30, down from nearly $40 million during the same quarter last year. Employee benefits and taxes as well as stock-based compensation also were down, but bonus expenses were up to $1.3 million for the quarter, down from $852,000 during the same time last year. UTI's 2015 outlook remains cautiously optimistic, with revenue expected to continue to decline another 3 to 4 percent. The stock closed yesterday at $5.92 a share. This morning it was trading around $6.05, closer to its 52-week low of $4.92 than its high of $11.97. \nWant Phoenix news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
