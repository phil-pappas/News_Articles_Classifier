Ted Aljibe Packer will also personally oversee the development of Crown's Alan Resort project in Las Vegas . This is a crucial project that he is passionate about given his initial push into the American gaming mecca failed during the financial crisis. Packer admitted as much earlier this month when he said his 2007 push into Vegas was a \"disaster\".\nHe also wants to focus more on on-line gaming opportunities for Crown, something the group hasn't explored until now. He has been looking at online betting firms like Paddy Power as a potential model.\nPacker has been warming up his new offsider, former banker Rob Rankin, for the Crown Resorts' chairman job for some time. Packer heaped praise on Rankin, who accompanied him on his whirlwind visit to Australia earlier this month.\nWhen he is not travelling, Packer divides his time between Los Angeles where his children live and Israel where he has residency and an increasing focus on tech start-up opportunities. Packer, who sold his Sydney home for a record $70 million earlier this month , will be spending less time in Australia in the future, which is a big part of the reason for the Crown management change.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

Crown missed a full-year profit forecast on Thursday and posted a 42 per cent fall in net profit to $378.31 million. But Rankin is a solid pair of hands who be able to provide a more hands-on approach to the role. Rowen Craigie remains as chief executive and John Alexander as deputy chair.\nPacker's shareholding in Crown is not impacted by the decision and he stays on as co-chair of Melco Crown, which owns his Macau casinos. Packer is also looking at a new cybersecurity business based out of Israel and has interests in start-ups with Seek co-founder Paul Bassat, and movie production joint venture Ratpac.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:10:53.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
