Same cycle all over again. Another bubble, another blowout, another crash dead ahead, another massive $10 trillion loss for American investors, like the 2008 credit meltdown and the 2000 dot-com crash. Déjà vu.\nAnd we know it’s coming, except our brains are own worst enemy. Einstein called it “insanity” that we do the same thing over and over again and expect different results. The Duke University behavioral economist Dan Ariely was a bit kinder in his classic: We’re just, as his book title has it, “Predictably Irrational.”\nPredictable irrational, yes, and fair game, too — hunted by those on Wall Street who know our brains are remarkably easy to manipulate. We ignore historical facts, cycles, patterns — anything to stay optimistic, even when a crash is imminent, and even if one is in progress. As IBD publisher Bill O’Neill put it in his perennial best seller, “How to Make Money in Stocks,” the market has topped and tanked about every four years for a century. Bigger crashes every eight years. Read on for proof.\nYes, American investors are born optimists. Years ago we did a research study: 93% of the time the Wall Street gurus are bullish. Today, behavioral economics confirms the same is true with America’s 95 million Main Street investors. Our brains are also perpetual optimists — bulls, in other words.\nGet it? We’re naturally optimistic. Blind optimists. Irrational optimists. And the Wall Street gurus are always one step ahead of us, profiling and manipulating us, hunting us even, luring America’s 95 million investors with that 93% good-news spiel, knowing we’ll keep turning up at the stock-market casino.\nEven as a market is peaking, or even dropping, we all expect a brighter future. We want good news, optimism, happy talk, bull markets. So we tune out reality, discount bad news, invent positive alternatives. We’re so predictably irrational that we Americans are queuing up to lose $10 trillion again, just like in 2000 or in 2008.\nYou’re so predictable that Wall Street has an algorithm for your profile. The bubbles will just keep expanding, and you will tune out your rational worries and concerns more and more. A few words to the wise: Trust no one. Know that the happy-talk talking heads will just keep feeding optimistic sound bites to the media to manipulate your brain. That’s just what they do.\nWant proof? Listen: Here are three historical examples of very famous happy-talking Wall Street gurus who suckered predictably irrational investors into massive losses followed by long, dark recoveries:\nHappy talk downplays 2008 financial meltdown\nBusinessWeek, Kiplinger’s and USA Today all reported on false predictions made by well-known Wall Street gurus just before the 2008 subprime meltdown spread rapidly across the U.S. and global economies:\n• Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in Fortune: “This is far and away the strongest global economy I’ve seen in my business lifetime.”\n• “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer: “Bye-bye, bear market; say hello to the bull.”\n• Newsletter producer Ken Fisher: “This year will end in the plus column ... so keep buying.”\n• Then–Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke: “I don’t anticipate serious failures among large banks.”\n• Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen: “Fear priced into stocks is likely to abate as recession fears fade.”\n• Rep. Barney Frank: “Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are fundamentally sound.”\n• Barron’s: “Home prices are about to bottom.”\n• Worth magazine: “Emerging markets are the global investors’ safe haven.”\n• Bernie Madoff: “It’s virtually impossible to violate the rules.”\n• Kiplinger’s: “Stock investors should beat the rush to the banks.”\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/search/term.html?KEYWORDS=DAN+ARIELY&mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T14:50:54.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
