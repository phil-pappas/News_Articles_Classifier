Photo: Reuters\nUber is fighting with the Australian Taxation Office over whether its drivers should be forced to pay GST. But in the US, its home market, it's putting out fires about its financial performance.\nLeaked documents obtained by the website Gawker overnight confirm that the app-enabled ridesharing service, recently valued at $US50 billion ($68 billion), is rapidly growing in terms of sales, but losing tens of millions of dollars.\nWhich is not particularly surprising. The company is still privately held, after all, and it's not uncommon for fast-growing technology companies to prioritise growth and expansion over the bottom line.\nUber financial documents we obtained show it’s very very far from profitable http://t.co/45Beofr96M pic.twitter.com/yATp5kZesv\n— Sam Biddle (@samfbiddle) August 5, 2015 What the numbers don't really tell us is whether Uber is simply losing money because it's spending up to chase growth, or because it's not bringing in enough money on each ride to cover its costs.\nThe latter would be a bit of a worry. But you'd have to think the high-profile investors the company has brought on board - including Google, investment bank Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft - would have done their due diligence before pouring money into what is one of the most expensively valued startups in history.\nIn any case Uber, which is known for its aggressive approach to government and media relations, was swift to dismiss the significance of the report. \"Shock, horror, Uber makes a loss. This is hardly news, and old news at that,\" the company told Fairfax Media in a statement. \"It's a case of business 101: you raise money, you invest money, you grow (hopefully), you make a profit and that generates a return for investors.\"\nWhile the release of the numbers does somewhat dent the mythology surrounding Uber, the company does have a point. It has raised nearly $US7 billion from investors over the past five years, and even if its losses increase from here on (which is quite possible) it would take a long time to wipe all of that out.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/45Beofr96M", "https://twitter.com/samfbiddle/status/628975982515499008", "http://gawker.com/here-are-the-internal-documents-that-prove-uber-is-a-mo-1704234157", "http://t.co/yATp5kZesv"], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:18:28.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
