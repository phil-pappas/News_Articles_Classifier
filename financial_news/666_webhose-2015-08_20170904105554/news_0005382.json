At 0900 BST, the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 0.8%, while France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX were both up 9%. \n\"European equities are trading higher this morning as a very respectable European earnings season and improving growth prospects for the Eurozone, especially for countries like Italy and Spain are providing investors with plenty of reasons to favour European stocks versus Asian and US ones,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \nFrench bank Societe Generale (Swiss: 519928.SW - news ) surged after it reported a 25% increase in second-quarter profit and said it plans to target further cost reductions in the coming years. \nLondon-listed insurer Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) rallied after posting a 6% rise in first-half pre-tax profit and an 18% increase in operating profit thanks to strong organic growth in the UK and US, as it raised its interim dividend despite a fall in annuities. \nRyanair was on the front foot after the budget carrier said it was the first ever airline to carry over 10m passengers in one calendar month. It said traffic grew 11% to 10.1m customers in July from 9.15m in July last year, while the load factor, which measure how many seats were actually taken up per flight, was up 4% to 95%. \nLondon Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) was also in positive territory after it said first-half revenues nearly doubled thanks to the contribution of December acquisition Russell Investments, with underlying growth of a more modest 9% on the back of an encouraging performance of markets and data. \nMediobanca (Milan: MB.MI - news ) gained after the Italian investment bank posted a 79% rise in fourth-quarter net profit on higher interest income and rising fees. \nGerman consumer goods company Beiersdorf (Other OTC: BDRFF - news ) rose as it reported a 19% increase in second-quarter net profit amid rising sales. \nOn the downside, Dutch lender ING slipped into the red as its second-quarter results fell short of analysts' expectations. \nOn the data front, investors will turn to the release of Eurozone retail sales at 100 BST. In the US, the ADP employment report is at due at 1315 BST, while trade balance figures are at 1330 BST and ISM non-manufacturing comes out at 1500 BST. \n\"All eyes will be on the US ADP employment change data especially after Fed's Lockhart in an interview to the WSJ pretty much confirmed that despite a batch of mediocre economic data of late and low wage growth the Fed is ready to raise rates already in September,\" said Huber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T12:34:25.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
