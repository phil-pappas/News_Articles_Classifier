Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Queensland's architects have slammed the Queen's Wharf site of Echo Entertainment's planned casino as inappropriate, saying it will do \"irreparable\" damage to central Brisbane.\nThe $2 billion contract Echo won last month to build a new casino was a mega development that would dwarf the low-key government buildings and limited public space in the precinct, Australian Institute of Architects Queensland president Richard Kirk said on Wednesday.\nThe Cottee Parker-design to turn 7.8 hectares of public land into 2000 new apartments, 1100 new hotel rooms and more than 20,000 square metres of new retail space needed a larger grid, or block size, than the small blocks of the city's urban core, Mr Kirk said. He was also scathing of plans to build over public roads, cutting out light to them.\n\"We can do irreparable damage to the city if we proceed down this path,\" Mr Kirk told The Australian Financial Review . \"They're building the gaming floor over one of the streets, which is just unacceptable. Cities that erode their street network lose their civitas and clear governance structure.\"\nIt would be far better for the large-scale project to be located on a peripheral part of the city, to encourage the small central business district to expand and to also leave space in the government precinct for more public offices that would become necessary as the state's population grew, he said.\n\"If you assume all the land within our government precinct, you're pretty much hamstrung into the future,\" Mr Kirk said. \"We're going to need a larger government. Why would you hand over land, which is a rare commodity in the inner city, when you have other viable or appropriate sites?\"\nA spokeswoman for state development minister Anthony Lynham rejected the criticism.\n\"As the Premier said last month, this is the biggest change to the tired George Street Precinct since the construction of Parliament House in 1864 and the Parliamentary Annexe in 1979,\" she said. \"It will do for Brisbane what World Expo and the development of South Bank did 30 years ago.\"\n Echo's Queensland managing director, Geoff Hogg, said the company was proud of the proposal.\n\"This redevelopment will transform Brisbane's CBD, with the repurposing and revitalisation of beautiful heritage buildings to make them even more accessible to the public,\" Mr Hogg said. \"This will be an asset for the state that is quintessentially Queensland, taking into account wonderful natural attractions, such as the riverfront and the weather, to create an iconic and globally appealing destination.\"\nMr Kirk was unwilling to criticise the government of Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for not changing the site since winning last year's election.\n\"I think it's fair to say the current government's conscious of the importance of letting projects that have already started to continue,\" Mr Kirk said.\nBut he hoped for change.\n\"We're optimistic that the government will be open-minded to alternative sites.\"\nNeither Melbourne nor Sydney would permit a casino within a block of their parliaments, he said. Adelaide had done just that, but that was not good, Mr Kirk said.\n\"That's an example of a mistake and we shouldn't follow it.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-08-05T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:08:54.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
