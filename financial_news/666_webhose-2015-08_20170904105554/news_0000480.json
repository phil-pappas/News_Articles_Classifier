The government will hold 49% share in NIIF, which will be structured like a sovereign wealth fund. \"We are looking for long-term investors in NIIF,\" Sinha said on Friday. He said provident funds, endowment and sovereign funds have expressed interest in partnering government in this initiative announced in the budget to spur India's infrastructure development. Modelled on Singapore's investment vehicle Temasek, NIIF will provide equity finance to core sector projects to boost economic activity. \"NIIF will be a commercially-run organisation and operate at arm's-length from the government,\" Sinha said. The government will provide Rs 20,000 crore from the budget for its holding in the entity. The fund, set up as a company or a trust, will have alternate investment funds under it that will provide equity financing to infrastructure projects as well as to other funds supporting the sector. \"We have seen serious shortage of equity capital for infra projects...this fund essentially will bridge this gap,\" he said. The NIIF will look at both greenfield and brownfield projects and also support stalled projects that have been stuck because of shortfall of equity capital. The fund will have its own governing council and its management will be paid market salaries to attract best talent.
