GVC is believed to have tabled that offer and an announcement from Bwin updating investors on the state of play is due on Tuesday. 888 will not make decision on whether to increase its bid or walk away until it has seen the terms of the rival approach. \nBwin has been up for sale since last November with 888 and GVC battling to buy it against a background of sweeping industry consolidation . Betting companies are striking deals with each other in effort to scale-up to offset the impact of higher taxes and stricter regulation. \nLast week, bookmaker Paddy Power (LSE: PAP.L - news ) and betting exchange Betfair revealed they are in merger talks to create one of the world’s biggest online gambling companies generating more than £1.1bn in revenues. In July, Ladbrokes (LSE: LAD.L - news ) and Coral unveiled the terms of a tie-up that will form Britain’s biggest gambling company by betting shops. \nThe flurry of deal-making has left William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) looking isolated. \nHill failed in a £720m attempt to buy 888 in February. However, if GVC buys Bwin, 888 would become vulnerable to another approach. \nAlternatively, Hill could attempt to buy rival Betfred or have a tilt at an overseas operator, banking sources said. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is thought that both Paddy Power and Betfair would be too expensive for the bookie. \nHill, which is in regular contact with its adviser Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , is understood to have spoken to its bankers in the wake of the announcement of Paddy Power’s merger with Betfair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T22:53:26.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
