But parliament in Germany, the biggest contributor to the deal, has yet to approve it.\nIn the statement, the Commission said the package would enable Greece \"to address the remaining imbalances in the economy in order to bring it back on a sustainable growth path, while also addressing in a determined way the social challenges facing the Greek society.\"\n($1 = 0.8968 euros) (Reporting by Julia Fioretti; Editing by Grant McCool )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T02:32:06.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
