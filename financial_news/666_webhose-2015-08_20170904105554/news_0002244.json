And while you may be thinking that this won’t do any good because you don’t fly Alaska Airlines, consider this: It has partnerships with American Airlines AAL, +0.96% , Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +0.52% and many more, which means, “you can fly on Delta and American and get Alaska miles,” explains Brian Kelly, the founder of ThePointsGuy.com .\nAlaska Airlines, which is owned by Alaska Air Group Inc. ALK, -1.08% , is followed by American Airlines and Southwest LUV, +0.29% as the No. 2 and No. 3 best frequent flier programs, respectively; the worst program was Spirit’s. Here is the full list of rankings .\nThe rankings were computed using an algorithm that weighted the frequent-flier programs in this way: 45% for the ease of earning and redeeming free round-trip flights; 25% for additional benefits like the ease of earnings and using points (other than booking flights) and perks like free checked bags; 10% for the breadth and diversity of routes flown; 10% for the number and variety of award flights that can be purchased at a low cost using points or miles; 5% for the number of daily flights; 5% for the airline’s on-time performance, lost and mishandled baggage and other consumer complaints.\nTo be sure, frequent flier programs aren’t what they used to be, as airlines are routinely devaluing rewards. “With a rising number of revenue-based programs (like those offered by Delta and United UAL, +0.12% ) rewarding travelers based on dollar spent rather than distance flown, collecting enough points to use for free flights has become increasingly challenging for infrequent travelers,” says Liz Weiss, the travel editor for U.S. News & World Report. Plus, travelers complain about how airlines make it hard to cash in frequent flier miles for some flights and seat availability is limited.\nRead more: Ditch your branded airline card\nFollow these 5 rules when booking a flight (1:26) Saving time and money while having peace of mind is a must when traveling. Catey Hill gives 5 simple tips on how to properly book your next flight.\nElite status is also now harder to achieve. “Airlines are raking in billions [of dollars] each year, leaving them with little incentive to award fliers with elite tier benefits,” says Weiss. “With a small, selective group of people with top-tier elite status, achieving top-tier status has become increasingly challenging and less valuable.”\nStill, smart consumers can get great value from these programs, says Kelly, thanks in part to many of them having still-lucrative earnings structures like sign-up bonuses and the ability to earn double and triple points on certain purchases. Plus, the frequent flier programs themselves are free to join, he adds.\nFurthermore, not all frequent fliers are plagued by the seat availability issue: Southwest and JetBlue JBLU, +0.00% — which both had top-five frequent flier programs in the U.S. News survey — also have the highest seat availability, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal and loyalty and rewards software company Switchfly released earlier this year, which found that Southwest had seats available on 100% of the flights the surveyors examined and JetBlue 87%.\nAs for how to pick the right frequent flier program for you, the rankings help, but they’re not the only thing you should be examining (after all, if you don’t fly that airline or its partners, its frequent flier program won’t do you much good). Indeed, there is no one-size-fits-all best program, says Kelly. “To identify the programs that best fit your particular needs and objectives, consider where you’re based, how often you travel and where you want to go with your miles or points,” says Weiss. “When comparing programs, also take into account reward options, network coverage, member benefits and, most importantly, how easy it is to earn and redeem free flights.”\nIn other words, you’ll be reading a lot of fine print to find the right programs, so if you’re not so keen on that — and travel frequently — you may be better off getting a general travel rewards credit card and earning points that way.
