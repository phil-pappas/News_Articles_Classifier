U.S. drugmakers want 12 years, but Australia wants five. People briefed on the talks had seen seven or eight years as a possible compromise. \nMinisters will likely head home from Maui with no set date for their next meeting. \nJapan and the United States had been trying to agree on the rules of origin for cars, which determine when a product is designated as coming from within the free trade zone and therefore not subject to duties. \nThe United States and Japan had largely agreed on the rules, but had to get buy-in from Canada and Mexico, which are closely tied in to the U.S. auto industry. \nJapanese automakers source many car parts from Thailand, which is not a member of the TPP, and strict rules would upset existing supply chains. Japan also wants the United States to quickly drop duties on Japanese auto parts going to the United States. \n(Reporting by Ami Miyazaki and Krista Hughes; Additional reporting by Dave Graham and David Ljunggren; Editing by Dan Grebler and Ken Wills)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T05:39:07.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
