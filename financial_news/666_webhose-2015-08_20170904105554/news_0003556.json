A file photo of the Nepal earthquake ALSO READ Natural catastrophe pool remains non-starter How to fight the heat wave, the Odisha way Earthquake panic leads to surge in insurance enquiries GIC Re says Nepal quake claims to be under $50 mn 7.3 earthquake hits Nepal, tremors across North India \nThe economic losses from natural catastrophes and man-made disasters in the first half of 2015 (calendar year) were to the tune of $37 billion, according to preliminary estimates by Swiss Re. \nThe global insurance sector covered 45 per cent ($16.5 billion) of these losses, which is higher than the previous 10-year average cover of 27 per cent. \nIn the first half of 2015, around 18,000 people lost their lives in disaster events - a sharp increase compared with 4,800 in the year-ago period. The earthquakes in Nepal and a heat wave in India and Pakistan claimed the highest number of victims. \nEconomic losses from natural catastrophes alone were $33 billion in the period under review. This is less than $54 billion in the first half of 2014 and the average first-half year loss over the previous 10 years at $99 billion. \nOf the overall insured losses, $12.9 billion came from natural disasters - less than the average first-half year loss of the previous 10 years at $25 billion. In the first half of 2014, the figure stood at $20 billion. \nThe costliest natural catastrophes for the insurance sector resulted from severe winter weather and thunderstorms in the US and Europe. \nDisaster events claimed many lives in the first six months of 2015. In all, around 18,000 people lost their lives. \nThere were 9,000 fatalities in the earthquakes that struck Nepal in close succession in April and May, the largest loss of life due to any natural catastrophes so far this year. \nThe economic losses in Nepal are estimated to be around $5 billion. Of those, only around $160 million were insured losses. \n\"The tragic events in Nepal are a reminder of the utility of insurance,\" says Kurt Karl, chief economist at Swiss Re. According to him, insurance cover does not lessen the emotional trauma that natural catastrophes inflict, but it can help people better manage the financial fallout from disasters so they can start to rebuild their lives. \nIndia and Pakistan were hit by a severe heat wave in May and June with temperatures touching 48?C, the highest since 1995. It is estimated that 2,500 people died in India and 1,500 in Pakistan as a result of extreme heat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:30:55.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
