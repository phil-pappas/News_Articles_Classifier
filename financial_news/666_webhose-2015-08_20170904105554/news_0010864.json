This was a bank “tactic to maximise their profit to the disadvantage of the customers”.\nAustralia’s banks were the most profitable in the world, he said.\n“My view is every single Australian is ripped off in some way with credit cards,” Koch said.\nGreenwood and Clitheroe did not return calls yesterday.
