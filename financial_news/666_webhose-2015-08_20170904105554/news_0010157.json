The list represents the most comprehensive look at the most important segment of the economy – America’s independent entrepreneurs. Companies such as Yelp, Pandora, Timberland, Dell, Domino’s Pizza, LinkedIn, Zillow, and many other well-known names gained early exposure as members of the Inc. 5000. \"It truly is an honor to be named to the Inc. 5000 list this year,” said Tom Haag, State Collection Service Chairman/CEO and son of the company’s founder, Hilding Haag. “To be considered one of the country’s fastest-growing businesses is an amazing accomplishment. But for a family-owned organization, in its 67th year of business, to make the list – I think that is pretty exciting. It is a testament to all of our hardworking and dedicated employees who have helped State Collection Service become a nationally-recognized name in the accounts receivable management industry.”\nThe 2015 Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth when comparing 2011 to 2014.

The Inc. 5000’s aggregate revenue is $205 billion, generating 647,000 jobs over the past three years.\n\"The story of this year’s Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership. In an incredibly competitive business landscape, it takes something extraordinary to take your company to the top,” said Inc. President and Editor-In-Chief Eric Schurenberg. “You have to remember that the average company on the Inc. 5000 grew nearly six-fold since 2012.
