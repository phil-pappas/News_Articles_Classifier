Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Employment Minister Eric Abetz have refused to commit to supporting moderate changes to the workplace system, proposed by their own review, that would make labour cheaper on Sundays, provide an alternative to the award system and reduce politicisation of the Fair Work Commission.\nBusiness groups broadly welcomed the first report of the Productivity Commission review of industrial relations , which would create \"take it or leave it\" statutory contracts for small businesses, new employees and reduce Sunday penalty rates in some industries to Saturday levels.\nUnion leaders said the plan would be worse than John Howard's Work Choices regime, which helped the Coalition lose power in 2007.\nMr Abbott, who has resisted business pressure to deregulate the labour market, said the government was not committed to implementing any of the proposals.\n\"I want to absolutely stress that this is a draft report,\" he said. \"The one thing I do want to make crystal clear is that this government will make no changes to workplace relations in this term of Parliament.\"\nIn a deliberate intervention in the highly politicised industrial relations debate, former ACTU president Martin Ferguson said penalty rates were unrealistic and the commission's recommendations should be considered.\n\"It will be easy for vested interests to dismiss these draft recommendations out of hand, rather than discussing them rationally and sensibly, but that would only be to the detriment of workers,\" Mr Ferguson, the chairman of Tourism Accommodation Australia, said.\nEnterprise contract welcomed Business groups welcomed the proposal for a new statutory enterprise contract that small and medium-sized businesses would be able to offer to new staff without requiring the approval of the Fair Work Commission.\nThe agreement would be lodged with the tribunal but, unlike enterprise agreements, there would be no requirement for it to be approved before it came into operation.\nEmployees could only exit the enterprise contract and return to the applicable award after one year. If a worker complained prior to the 12 months, the commission would measure the contract against a revised \"no disadvantage test\".\nProductivity Commission chairman Peter Harris said employees would not be back-paid if they were found to have not been paid their proper entitlements. He acknowledged on Tuesday that \"there will be a set of people who are exposed to change\" if the enterprise contracts are introduced.\nThe draft report also recommends Sunday penalty rates be c ut by up to 75 per cent for employees in the hospitality, retail, entertainment, restaurants and cafe sectors. Sunday penalty rates for cafes, hospitality, entertainment, restaurants and retailing should be aligned with Saturday rates.\nPenalty rates on Sunday range from 125 per cent to 150 per cent compared with Sunday rates, which range from 175 per cent to 200 per cent.\nMr Abbott said that any changes to penalty rates would be ultimately determined by the Fair Work Commission.\nPower for temporary variations Significant minimum-wage increases threaten jobs and the report recommends giving the Fair Work Commission the power to make temporary variations in awards \"in exceptional circumstances\" after an annual minimum wage review has been completed.\nThe commission also found that minimum wages were justified and that complaints from some business groups, that existing levels were highly prejudicial to employment, were not justified.\nIt proposed an overhaul of the Fair Work Commission and changes to unfair dismissal laws and the rules governing industrial action.\nMr Harris said the commission found the workplace relations system was not \"systemically dysfunctional\" but changes were needed to repair the system.\n\"Many features work well, especially given the need to find balance between the conflicting goals of the parties involved,\" he said.\n\"Changes to the workplace relations framework have to recognise that it's not just about the economics. There are ethical and community norms about the way in which a country treats its employees.\n\"Nevertheless, important reforms are needed, preferably soon.\"\nBHP Billiton happy with recommendations BHP Billiton said on Tuesday that the commission's recommendations were an important step in delivering specific and targeted workplace relations reform.\n\"At first glance many of the conclusions of the draft report reflect BHP Billiton's day-to-day experience of working with the current industrial relations framework,\" Mike Henry, BHP Billiton coal president said.\n\"We particularly welcome the recommendations of the draft report in relation to bargaining arrangements for greenfield sites and prospective moderate changes to reduce the current tendencies of the Fair Work Act to promote industrial action as a first rather than a final option in the bargaining process.\"\nSenator Abetz said while business wanted the \"big bang\" on reform, the commission has called for repair of the system.\n\"Can I simply say to the Australian people: they spoke loud and clear in 2007, we learnt that lesson immediately after the election in 2007, saying that lesson had been learnt, their view had been registered with us,\" he said.\n\"We listened to the Australian people. Yet Mr Shorten and the trade union movement have continued, in the 2010 campaign, when we announced our policy in May 2013, when we announced the terms of reference, now again with a draft report â€“ it's all the same mantra.\"\nOpposition workplace relations spokesman Brendan O'Connor said: \"Labor will never support a two-tier penalty rate system that would leave millions of Australian workers worse off.\"\nThe commission's final report is due to be handed to the government in November, which will then consider its response. Any substantial changes are unlikely until after the next election.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-04T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:47:10.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
