The SEI Trust Company is a subsidiary of SEI, a leading supplier of customized operating infrastructure and services to investment organizations worldwide. \nA pioneer in the CIT arena, the SEI Trust Company has successfully partnered with CIT advisors for more than 25 years. It has provided CIT services to more than 130 CITs representing over $25 billion in assets, making it one of the leading providers of CIT services and expertise. \n\"Given the lower costs and operational efficiencies of a CIT, it was the clear choice for offering a daily-valued vehicle in the U.S. retirement market,\" said Richard Nino, Executive Vice President, Institutional Markets at Fiera Capital. \"With its market leadership and expertise in CITs, SEI was the natural partner to help us leverage that vehicle's advantages. Its execution of the CIT due diligence, launch, and initial client onboarding processes has been outstanding every step of the way.\" \nThe CIT was initially funded with a mandate of approximately $540 million from a 401(k) plan sponsor with more than $20 billion in assets. The SEI Trust Company will serve as trustee, and will provide fiduciary management along with accounting and administration functions for the CIT. \n\"We expect Fiera Capital's international equity acumen and SEI Trust Company's CIT expertise to be a winning combination in the U.S. retirement market, especially in light of the growing demand for CITs,\" said John Alshefski , Senior Vice President and Managing Director of SEI's Investment Manager Services division. \"Plan sponsors are increasingly taking advantage of CITs' efficiency and flexibility to offer customized, effectively priced solutions for retirement investors.\" \nSince entering the U.S. market in 2011, Fiera Capital has been delivering strong organic growth in the United States through its U.S. affiliates, which have won two dozen institutional mandates in United States, totalling more than $2.4 billion in assets. \n\"The launch of the CIT is an important milestone in Fiera Capital's overall strategy for significantly expanding its presence and distribution in the U.S.,\" said Nino. \nAbout SEI Trust Company SEI Trust Company (the \"Trustee\") serves as the Trustee of the Fund and maintains ultimate fiduciary authority over the management of, and the investments made, in the Fund. The Fund is part of a Collective Investment Trust (\"the Trust\") operated by the Trustee.
