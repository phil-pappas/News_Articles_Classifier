Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Rupert Murdoch 's $84 million Gulfstream G650 flew out of Sydney just before 7am on Sunday. It was back on Kingsford Smith tarmac by 4pm.\nMay we have half Lord Copper's energy should we make it to 84 years of age!\nHis private jet made an earlier return trip on Friday, leaving Sydney at 10am before returning six hours later.\nWhat's he been up to? Inspecting Courier-Mail editor Chris Dore and his Brisbane troops? Visiting the sheep at his Yass farm? Or catching up with PM Tony Abbott, who spent the day in Adelaide?\nThe PMO ruled the last one out and was tight lipped about any meetings between the pair.\nThe answer might be more sedate. We hear that Rupert is holidaying for a week in the Whitsundays, a destination, which, interestingly, is about a five hour return trip from Sydney.\nSo if they haven't caught up yet (whether in Brisbane, Canberra, Port Moresby, or on Lachlan Murdoch 's boat off Hamilton Island) there's still time.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-08-16T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:05:34.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
