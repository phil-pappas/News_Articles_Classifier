Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro When commentators search for reasons for the extraordinary volatility on global markets , it doesn't take long for at least some of the blame to be lumped on the shoulders of quantitative hedge funds.\nBut George Mussalli, chief investment officer of Boston-based quantitative fund PanAgora, argues that misunderstands the way quant funds approach risk.\nPanAgora was founded in 1989 and manages around $US40 billion with $30 billion in equity-market-related strategies and $10 billion in multi-asset strategies, including $2 billion for Australian institutions.\nMussalli says the fund is built to withstand periods of high volatility by being uncorrelated to broader market moves. PanAgora focuses on removing market and systemic risk and instead focuses on identifying 'transient risks' that come and go, such as rapidly-falling energy prices.\n\"Our goal isn't to take a position, simply to determine that the risks in investing in energy are greater now than it has been in the last 10 years.\"\n\"We need to be in front of the risk models, because they look at the last 10 years to describe what is going to happen.\n\"So you have to know what you can predict and what you cannot predict. Such as JetBlue [US airline] has better on time arrivals than SouthWest that's a good thing to bet on, so we look for thousands of those types of things.\"\nBeating the blues The approach is helping PanAgora beat the current market blues.\n\"We spent a lot of time on risk management and portfolio construction and the fruits of that come out in months like this when the portfolio hasn't really been affected, it's up a little bit this month,\" Mussalli says.\nMussalli was speaking after Sydney-based investment firm Pengana revealed a new deal with PanAgora. It is Pengana's second major tie-up with a global investment fund after it announced a joint venture with Chicago-based small cap equities fund Lizard Asset Management announced last year, and comes as the $1.5 billion fund seeks to broaden its offering of absolute return strategies to investors.\nâ€‹Mussalli told The Australian Financial Review that the fund's strong returns were based on \"avoiding the crowded trades\" such as bets that cheap stocks will appreciate or trends will continue to run.\n\"We don't have common bets and positions that most of other firms have,\" he says.\n\"We are trying to achieve a high hit rate on a monthly basis and not correlate with any type of market environment.\"\nMussalli said PanAgora combines fundamental analysis of companies with quantitative approach to identify good relative bets.\n\"What we try to do is take a fundamental view of the company and then find the data we need. Within an industry or a country we are looking to identify the companies that will succeed on the long term and others that will fail, based on our proprietary data,\" he said.\nMr Mussalli was reluctant to offer too many insights into the investment strategy but cited an example of analysing airline data as a measure of whether it was likely to attract more passengers.\n\"Maybe one airline is on time more or they lose less bags. If you wanted to get sophisticated you could go on Expedia and see vacant seats and ticket prices.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-08-27T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:05:23.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
