All teachers are, therefore, expected at their respective work stations from Monday 31st August 2015 performing their teaching and administrative duties,\" said TSC head of communications Kihumba Kamotho. \nHe insisted that the salary dispute was still in the Court of Appeal and teachers should allow the legal process to run its course. \n\"The only dispute the commission is aware of is the Economic Dispute which is the subject matter of an appeal in the Court of Appeal,\" he said. \nMr Kamotho said the schedule for school terms dates have not changed since they were set by Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang. \n\"All teachers should adhere to the dates given by the Cabinet Secretary for Education,\" he said. \nNational examinations for Class Eight and Form Four candidates have been set for October and November. \n'SHOULD KEEP AWAY' \nBut Kuppet Secretary-General Akelo Misori said teachers will not be intimidated as they were demanding their fundamental right. \nMr Misori said the union had not received any communication from the government on how it was going to effect the salary increase. \n\"We will not go to school today and teachers should keep away from schools until we give them an update that the money has been paid,\" he said. \nMr Misori said teachers were not interested in paralysing the education sector but were only fighting for their rights, adding that the government has not been sincere with its engagement with teachers for too long. \nKnut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion told parents to keep their children at home. \n\"Parents kindly keep your children at home as there will be no teachers in school unless the government complies with the court order,\" said Mr Sossion. \nHe said the court order must be implemented to the letter, adding that the only language that the teachers would want to hear was compliance with it. \nMr Sossion said the union will not issue any strike notice as they had been properly advised by their lawyers on the issue.
