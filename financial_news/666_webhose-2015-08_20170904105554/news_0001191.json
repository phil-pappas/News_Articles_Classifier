As a nationwide unique project, the new plant already is considered a model, setting new standards with respect to flexibility, efficiency and environmental sustainability. \nThe 20 Jenbacher J920 FleXtra gas engines form the heart of the plant, supplying a total output of 190 megawatts (MW) of electrical and 192 MW of thermal energy, which will be fed into the electrical and district heating network, thus contributing to grid stability. The total efficiency of the equipment from GE is greater than 90 percent; electrical efficiency is 45 percent. Compared with the previous coal-fired power plant, CO 2 emissions are reduced from 1.8 million tons to approx. 540,000 tons. \n“Kraftanlagen München was quick in selecting the right concept and has found the best-suited partner for this project with GE. The new gas-fired thermal power plant in Kiel is a groundbreaking example for the successful realization of the energy transition plan by employing highly efficient combined heat and power generation. We are happy to implement this large-scale project using GE’s Jenbacher gas engines,” stated Gerrit Koll, business unit leader, energy- and power plant technology at KAM. \n“With our flexible and highly efficient gas engine technology, we’re proud to make a decisive contribution to the pioneering project from Stadtwerke Kiel and Kraftanlagen München. Versatility in the electricity exchange paired with inexpensive costs for heat generation will be the way forward in Kiel,” said Oliver Klitzke, Executive Operations GE Germany. “Cogeneration systems as distributed and load-oriented applications form the ideal bridge to the energy system of the future, allowing us security in energy supply, the highest level of efficiency and therefore minimal primary energy consumption.” \nThe greatest possible flexibility was a primary requirement of the new Stadtwerke Kiel plant. Due to the high proportion of wind-generated electricity in the regional grid, the power plant has to be able to feed full power into the local electrical grid within a short period in order to offset the volatility of the wind level, thus ensuring stability of the grid. The efficient GE engines demonstrate that they are the ideal bridge technology and application to implement the energy transition plan in Germany, with the goal of generating 80 percent of electricity from renewable and therefore, volatile energy sources by 2050. \nAbout the Kraftanlagen Group \nThe Kraftanlagen Group stands for efficient power plant engineering.
