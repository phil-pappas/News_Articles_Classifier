But over many years Alitalia has lost its way and become a challenged business. \n\"Aviation is a global industry, not a local one. Like so many other industries, aviation should have access to global investment funds in order to provide the capital required to grow efficiently and remain competitive. \n\"Global investment is not a threat,\" he said. \"It is both a lifeline and an energiser, which can only be good for European aviation, European economies and European jobs.\" \nEtihad Airways invested 560 million euros in a multi-level deal comprising a 49 percent equity stake in Alitalia, a 75 percent stake in Alitalia's loyalty program, MilleMiglia, the purchase from and leaseback to Alitalia of five pairs of arrival and departure slots at London Heathrow Airport, and shareholder loans to reduce Alitalia's immediate financial liabilities. \n\"A strong Alitalia is essential for Italy,\" he said. \"Without Alitalia, air connectivity to, from and within Italy would be seriously diminished and left to others without the same commitment to Italy or Italians.\" \nHogan said that as a strategic shareholder, Etihad Airways needed to see a return on its investment, and together with Alitalia's management had set a three-year timeline for achieving sustainable profits. \nIn this first year, the aim is to reduce losses, with break-even targeted in 2016 and profitability in 2017. \n\"We are not a bank,\" Hogan said. \"We needed to stabilise the business financially by providing fresh capital. We also needed to work with Alitalia, its unions and its partners to identify immediate opportunities to cut costs. These included seeking efficiencies, restructuring the network and schedules, and reducing the short-haul fleet to maximise aircraft utilisation. There were immediate results.\" \nHe added: \"We have not only ensured that Alitalia stays in the air. \"We have also invested in protecting and creating jobs in Italy. We have invested in rebuilding the Alitalia brand. And we have invested in Alitalia with the clear commitment that we will help it to grow into a prestige global brand, and an airline and company which contributes to Italy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T08:42:39.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
