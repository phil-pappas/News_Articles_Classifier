Jamieson super fund, but reported that he was not a member of the fund and had no interest in the shares. \"This was an inadvertent and erroneous disclosure,\" he reported.\nMaybe Jamieson should stick to buying Tatts lottery tickets in future.\nCorporate baggage While Qantas boss, Alan Joyce , was crowing about the cost cutting that helped its momentous recovery from financial penury – including significant bloodshed at the front line with 5000 staff in the firing line – there was one particular sector of the airline that did not appear to be pulling its weight.\nCorporate – which the airline describes as the \"centralised management and governance of the Qantas Group\", weighed in with a $163 million loss for the flying 'roo, equalling its performance for the 2014 financial year.\nCBD hopes that will be reflected in bonuses for those in corporate HQ when the annual report is released.\nCopping it The victims of the Commonwealth Bank's financial planning fiasco have watched its compensation process proceed at a glacial pace, but there have been signs of movement behind the scenes.\nWhile CBA boss, Ian Narev , was preparing to host the financial press at a bank dinner Wednesday night, the bank's wealth arm was digesting the news that Harry Mitchell , head of Commonwealth Financial Planning (CFP), had departed.\n\"It's with mixed emotions that I advise that Harry Mitchell ... no longer works for the CBA Group,\" said Marianne Perkovic , who goes by the title of Executive General Manager Advice.\n\"I would like to thank Harry for his contribution to CFP over the past three years, and wish him the best for his future endeavours,\" she said of the former Scottish cop.\nIn an interview with Money Management two years ago, Mitchell made it clear he saw himself as a new broom at the financial planning arm, sweeping out any culture of bad advice.\n\"It's going to be really uncomfortable for people who don't want to do the right thing and I'm OK with that,\" he said at the time.\nJudging by his LinkedIn profile, he has not left for a fresh career opportunity.\n\"I am currently seeking new career opportunities,\" reads the opening line of the profile baring his name.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:30:16.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
