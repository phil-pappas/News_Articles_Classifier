Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) jumped 10pc as a result. \nShares in Vedanta Resources surged by 10pc after the Indian government granted it approval to reopen its iron-ore mine in Goa, after a three-year ban. \nIndia’s largest private miner said it had on Monday restarted operations at its biggest mine at Codli in Goa, where it won approval to extract 3.1m metric tons of iron ore. \nIn 2012, the Supreme Court of India banned mining in Goa as it attempted to clampdown on illegal operations and, although the ban was lifted last year, miners had to wait for environmental clearances from the government before they could begin production again. Prior to the suspension of mining, Vedanta said it was the largest Indian exporter of low grade ores, while India was the third largest exporter of iron ore. \nThe price of iron ore plummeted to a six-year low of $44.59 in early July, but has recovered slightly since. Despite the floundering price, Vedanta is confident the group can yield a positive cash flow from its iron ore business. \n“We continue to work with central and state government to improve competitiveness of Indian exports”, said the company. \nAnalysts were somewhat cautious, however. They were unconvinced the resumption of iron ore operations - at a time when market prices are extremely low - would be value accretive, and instead said they would not be surprised if the reopened business were loss-making. \nOnly last week, Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) downgraded the Vedanta stock amid volatility in the Indian rupee and metal price variation. The stock was changing hands at 491.4p by close on Monday- up 44.7p, or 10pc. \nIn the wider market, Britain’s benchmark index underperformed its European peers as weak data from China took its toll on commodity stocks, dragging the mining-heavy FTSE lower before lunchtime. \nChinese exports slumped by a mammoth 8.3pc year-on-year in July and imports contracted by 8.1pc. Following the negative Chinese data dump, Investec slashed its commodity price forecast. * China’s stocks rise as merger speculation offsets weak economic data Hunter Hillcoat, of Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) , said “there are clear signs that the market is attempting to establish appropriate levels in the “new normal” environment”, adding that metal price forecasts at the start of the year “were not bearish enough”. Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) suffered a double downgrade, as the stock was lowered from a “buy” to “sell” rating, while the three majors, Rio Tinto , BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) maintained a “hold” rating. \nHowever, in afternoon trade, buoyed by commodity stocks, the FTSE bounced back to join its European bourses amid hopes of further stimulus from Beijing. The CAC in Paris rose 0.8pc and the German DAX advanced 1pc. The FTSE 100 advanced 17.73 points, or 0.3pc, to 6,736.22. Glencore closed 1.4pc higher at 205.9p, while Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) added 47.5p, or 1.8pc, to £26.35, BHP Billiton jumped 1.5pc and Anglo American advanced 1pc. Mid-cap Centamin failed to shake off the Investec downgrade, declining 1.6pc to 53.8p. \nElsewhere, Esure Group (LSE: ESUR.L - news ) became the biggest faller on the FTSE 250 as half-year results missed analysts’ expectations . Underlying pre-tax profit fell by 21.3pc to £46.5m, as the insurer warned the environment remains challenging. In the first six months of the year, motor profits also plunged from £17.1m to £3.3m, due to the problems with small personal injury claims. \nEamonn Flanagan, of Shore Capital, said “this is a feature esure seems to be struggling with”. Shares hit a three-month low, trading at 240p - down 25.5p, or 9.6pc. \nFood retailers were among the FTSE laggards, amid reports Amazon is set to enter the UK grocery market. As a fierce price war continues among UK supermarkets, it emerged the Seattle-based group has signed a 10-year lease on a former Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) warehouse in Surrey. \nSeparately, an analysis of quarterly results revealed the supermarket sector’s profits were 62pc lower in the first quarter . Tesco fell 3.1p, or 1.4pc, to 212.8p, J Sainsbury (Other OTC: JSAIY - news ) shed 1.2pc to 264.4p and Wm Morrison was off 0.8pc at 183p. \nAhead of its third-quarter results on Thursday, travel group TUI AG (LSE: TUI.L - news ) dropped 8p, or 0.8pc, to £10.45p after a note from JPMorgan Cazenove said it could take a €40m hit from the turmoil in Tunisia and Greece. However, analysts reckon management will reiterate its current full-year financial guidance. \nAim-listed Imaginatik (LSE: IMTK.L - news ) inched 1.6pc higher to 8p as former Quindell (Xetra: M6FA.DE - news ) boss Rob Terry continued his stake building , upping his holding to 12.01pc, through his investment vehicle Quob Park Estate. \nFinally, some £4.3m was wiped off the valuation of Independent Oil & Gas after an investor unexpectedly pulled out of a planned $10m equity investment due to falling oil prices. The North Sea-focused firm suffered its heaviest fall on its two years as an Aim-listed company down 52.1pc to 5.6p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T22:16:05.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
