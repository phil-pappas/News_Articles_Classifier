The company applied for $3.3 billion in discounts for spectrum it purchased earlier in the year at auction. Small businesses are entitled to these discounts, as per FCC regulations, and Dish has ownership stakes in some. It was under this cover that the company applied for -- and was denied -- the discount. \nDish has also reportedly been in talks with T-Mobile US to acquire the telecom giant. TheStreet Quant Ratings gave both Dish and T-Mobile \"buy\" ratings, with \"B-\" letter grades.So, what are the best cable and satellite companies investors should be buying? Here are the top three, according to TheStreet Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary ratings tool. \nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings.

Market Cap: $5.3 billion Year-to-date return: 15.7% \nAMC Networks Inc. owns and operates various cable television's brands delivering content to audiences, and a platform to distributors and advertisers in the United States and internationally. The company operates in two segments, National Networks, and International and Other. \n\"We rate AMC NETWORKS INC (AMCX) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations, solid stock price performance and compelling growth in net income. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: AMCX's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 6.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 15.1%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. The gross profit margin for AMC NETWORKS INC is rather high; currently it is at 56.79%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 13.80% is above that of the industry average. Net operating cash flow has slightly increased to $110.05 million or 9.37% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, AMC NETWORKS INC has also modestly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of 7.92%. Looking at where the stock is today compared to one year ago, we find that it is not only higher, but it has also clearly outperformed the rise in the S&P 500 over the same period. Although other factors naturally played a role, the company's strong earnings growth was key. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year. The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Media industry. The net income increased by 41.5% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $58.66 million to $83.01 million.
