And giving by individuals — who made 72% of all donations — was up 5.7%, to $258.51 billion.\nUna Osili, Director of Research at the Lilly school, credits the bump-up to last year’s improving housing, labor and financial markets. “The stock market and the economy and financial security drives giving,” she said.\nThe concern about boomer giving Giving USA doesn’t break down the numbers by age, but Osili told me that “boomers and older households appear very committed to philanthropy.” The concern now, she said, is “that many are now in the retirement phases of their lives and emerging from lots of shocks from the recession.”\nInterestingly, the total number of U.S. donations hasn’t been changing much, just the total dollar amount and average gift size. “Fundraisers call this ‘dollars up, but donors down,’” said Osili.\nYou’ve probably read about some of the mega-gifts in recent months. “We’re seeing donors becoming more strategic,” noted Osili, who said high-net-worth households and portfolios have recovered faster than the overall economy.\nFor instance, hedge-fund manager and 1980 Harvard Business School alum John Paulson just gave Harvard University $400 million, the largest gift in the school’s history (its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is being renamed in his honor). A few months back, entertainment mogul David Geffen gave $100 million to Lincoln Center so it could renovate the New York Philharmonic’s home, Avery Fisher Hall (which will become David Geffen Hall in September).\nThe charity category that’s down But not every type of charity saw an increase in donations last year: Gifts to the international affairs category actually fell by 2% in 2014. “That’s something we’re very interested in,” said Osili.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://givingusa.org/"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:47:31.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
