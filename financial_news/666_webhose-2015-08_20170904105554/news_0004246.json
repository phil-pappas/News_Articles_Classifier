What Asylum Seekers Get Here And In France \nAccording to the Freight Transport Association (FTA), one major distributor of pharmaceuticals carrying drugs bound for NHS hospitals had to write off stock of £2.5m after such a break-in, because it posed a major safety risk. \nThe security lapses also cause a headache for other industries, especially those where perishable goods are at stake. \nFigures from the Fresh Produce Consortium suggest at least £10m worth of food destined for Britain had to be binned between January and June, because stowaways had posed a \"contamination risk\". \nThe Road Haulage Association estimates that 90% of all road freight between the UK and the continent uses Kent's road network, with as many as 10,000 loads moving across the Channel on a daily basis. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if just 1% of the stock is tampered with, at an average loss rate of £30,000 per trailer this amounts to a loss of £3m a day, or £1bn a year. \nThe FTA believes importers and hauliers have been left \"carrying the can\" because of the migrant crisis. \nSome insurance companies are declining to cover the cost of written-off stock, invoking clauses which state that acts of civil disorder are not covered in the policies of affected businesses. \nJo James, chief executive of Kent Invicta Chamber of Commerce, told Sky News: \"Kent has been plagued with the effects of Operation Stack for over 20 years now - and every time it has been introduced, the result is the M20 is turned into a huge lorry park. \n\"At last, the Government has woken up to the fact that this is a national problem and a solution needs to be found. \n\"The loss to the local economy is significant, as businesses are unable to deliver goods and services. \n\"This is unacceptable and a threat to the long-term viability of some businesses.\" \nEurotunnel has also accused public authorities of \"underestimating the migrant situation\". \nLast week, the company revealed it has spent €13m (£9m) on security measures in the first half of 2015 alone - and called on the French and British governments to reimburse them. \nMinisters are now working with officials in Kent to find space to park lorries and ease congestion on the M20. \nWith the warnings that continued delays will be unsustainable for small businesses - and the prospect that higher costs will eventually be passed on to consumers - the pressure is on to resolve the crisis sooner rather than later. \n:: As the migrant crisis continues, Alex Crawford gets to the source of the problem: Watch 'People Smuggler - World's Most Wanted' on Sunday at 9pm on Sky News.
