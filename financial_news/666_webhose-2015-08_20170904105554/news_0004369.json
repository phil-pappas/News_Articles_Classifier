AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Washington / President Barack Obama's illustrious goal of deepening the United States' relationships with Asian allies has suffered a serious setback and opened the door for emerging rival China, after a meeting of Pacific Rim trade ministers broke up without an agreement.\nMr Obama's former top Asia adviser for national security, Jeffrey Bader, warned that a failure to seal a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in Hawaii last week \"puts into question the [US] rebalance to Asia\".\n\"The Obama administration's policy of 'rebalance' toward Asia has been designed to achieve two objectives: to embed the United States more deeply in the world's most dynamic economic region; and to prevent a regional vacuum, to be filled predominantly by China as it continues its rise,\" Mr Bader co-wrote with David Dollar, the United States Treasury's former economic and financial emissary to China.\n\"But the economic component that should be driving US engagement has had few specific accomplishments.\"\nAmerica's Asian partners, including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, were eager to forge closer economic ties with the US, as part of President Obama's Asia \"pivot\", launched in 2009.\nSo far the US rebalance is viewed as too defence-heavy and lacks any major economic piece besides a bilateral free-trade deal with South Korea.\nChina plans China has announced plans to spearhead a competing multilateral free trade pact with Asian neighbours, after being excluded from the TPP. Australia signed a free-trade deal with China this year.\n President Obama tried to sell the TPP to a sceptical public as a mechanism for the US to write the economic rules in Asia, instead of China.\n\"One of the things we should be doing, for example, is writing the rules of global trade to benefit American workers and American businesses,\" Mr Obama said in June.\n\"I think we should write those rules before China does.\"\nChina was not included in the 12-nation TPP negotiations because its state-owned enterprises could not meet the high standards seeking to eliminate special rules and subsidies favouring government firms against the private sector.\nBut Beijing scored a coup earlier this year when it set up the $US100 billion ($136 billion) Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, an institution that the US unsuccessfully pressured Asia Pacific countries such as Australia not to join.\nTrade vital The TPP deadlock over market access issues for dairy, sugar and automobiles , as well as differences over intellectual property rules for pharmaceuticals, may delay any TPP finalisation to at least 2017.\nWhile trade ministers collectively talked up the chances of a deal in the near term, an October election in Canada and the US Presidential election cycle, that is beginning to ramp up, are widely seen as major inhibitors.\nIn the political and security sphere, the US rebalance has made progress, including strengthening of alliances with Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, as well as the joining of the East Asia Summit,\nAsia experts have been warning for the last year that a failure to land the TPP would be a big obstacle to the US successfully fulfilling its Asia rebalance.\n\"If the United States does everything right in Asia, goes to the meetings, participates, but we don't get TPP done, it's very hard to succeed,\" said former US assistant secretary of state for east Asia and Pacific affairs, Kurt Campbell, in a Washington speech last September.\n\"If we make a lot of mistakes but get TPP done, we can still be successful in Asia. That's how important TPP is.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-08-02T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:20:42.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
