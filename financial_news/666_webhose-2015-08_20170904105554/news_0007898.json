The S&P 500 slid 64.84 points, or 3.19 percent, to 1,970.89 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 171.45 points, or 3.52 percent, to 4,706.04.\nA U.S. recession is not in sight, and with stock valuations such as price to earnings, to book and to sales at or close to 25-year averages, the sell-off may be overdone, said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\"If you're fully invested, just enjoy the rest of the summer,\" Kelly said. \"If you're sitting on cash waiting for a buying opportunity, well guess what, this is the buying opportunity.\"\nOIL AND EMERGING MARKETS HIT\nCrude oil fell again as oversupply from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in particular continues to overwhelm slowing demand.\nU.S. crude was at a more than six-year low as it posted an eighth straight weekly decline. The U.S. benchmark traded briefly below $40 a barrel before settling down 87 cents at $40.45. Brent fell $1.16 to settle at $45.46.\nOil's run of weekly losses is its worst since 1986.\nEmerging market currencies in the Americas tracked Asian markets lower, with the Colombian and Mexican pesos as well as Brazil's real <BRBY BRL=> falling more than 1.0 percent against the dollar.\nEarlier in Asia, the Malaysian ringgit hit a pre-peg 17-year low and South Korea's won took its losses to 1.8 percent against the dollar this week.\nGold, seen as a good asset in difficult times, rose to its highest in more than a month. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled up 0.6 percent at $1,159.60 an ounce.\nYields on safe-haven U.S. Treasuries slipped further, with the benchmark 10-year note rising 10/32 in price, pushing its yield down to 2.0487 percent.\nLower Treasury yields and the stronger euro weighed on the dollar. The greenback traded down 1.01 percent at 122.14 yen and against the euro, the dollar fell 1.17 percent to $1.1373.\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Clive McKeef and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T00:34:09.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
