The NY Fed President’s “less-compelling”-for-now comment on the potential of a September interest-rate hike has crushed the bear rebellion and perhaps that Bearmageddon. At least for now.\nMoney-market futures are pushing that first rate hike all the way out to 2016, says Ian Williams, economist at Peel Hunt. That, of course, could back the Fed into a corner pretty good, as a few out there are getting more and more comfortable batting the term “QE4” around.\nClearly, every word is going to be scrutinized to the nth degree at the Fed’s Jackson Hole gathering, which kicks off with a dinner tonight. Investors may have to wait until Saturday, when Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer speaks, for the real excitement.\nPositioning for the Fed to be more dovish than you think has worked pretty well in the last decade or so, notes Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Société Générale. “This positioning, however, is part of the source of danger to market stability, since it means that any ‘less dovish’ comment or action is magnified, because it comes as a surprise,” he cautions in a note.\nAnd the market psyche has already been damaged by this thrill ride we’ve been on, which on Wednesday saw 98% of stocks rip higher, notes Sean D. Emory, blogging for The Market Meter . “It gets to a point where nobody wants to buy the rip, because you want the market to settle; then as it moves even higher you buy, only to be left with nothing as it moves lower,” he says.\nEmory offers some advice on how investors should keep their cool these days, and that’s by going back to basics. “Before you make a decision, step back and ask yourself again: ‘Why am I buying this stock?’” Check out our chart of the day for more.\nEven as we peer down the barrel of potentially another big up day for markets, skeptics are out there, lurking en masse. Our call of the day advises investors to do anything but play it cool right now. In fact, run, don’t walk to the nearest exit for this rally, because the fun is just getting started.\nKey market gauges Futures for the Dow YMU5, +0.95% S&P 500 ESU5, +0.82% and Nasdaq NQU5, +1.01% all pushing up about 1%. Asia ADOW, +2.16% helped carry the baton for Wall Street’s rally, and the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +5.34% barreled ahead 5.3%. Note Bloomberg reports that Beijing intervened in the market today, to make sure nothing detracts from a big military parade on Sept. 3. Fair enough.\nEurope’s Stoxx 600 index SXXP, +2.38% is also doing its part for another ride higher for markets, gaining nearly 3%. And crude CLV5, +3.78% is screaming higher, up around 4.5% as the dollar DXY, +0.15% also moves north. Gold GCV5, +0.05% is up a little, and even copper HGU5, +1.76% is rebounding in a big way.\nThe Quote: “I’m going to do something, whatever it takes, to get gun legislation — to shame people, to shame legislators into doing something about closing loopholes and background checks and making sure crazy people don’t get guns.” — Andy Parker, the farther of TV reporter Alison Parker, speaking after his daughter was killed along with cameraman Adam Ward when a former colleague ambushed them during a live interview.\nMeanwhile, social media is calling New York Daily News’s Thursday cover tasteless.\nthe entire NY Daily News editorial team needs to be F I R E D\n— Alex Kuhlke (@BigRedDiva) August 27, 2015 Prev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BigRedDiva/status/636734755548045313", "http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/china-said-to-intervene-to-shore-up-stock-market-before-parade-idtyzfdu", "http://www.themarketmeter.com/#!Psychology-is-Important-Here/ced9/55de20670cf28ffc7ee923eb", "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/virginia-tv-shooting/slain-journalists-father-says-shooter-he-was-crazy-man-gun-n416716"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T15:22:49.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
