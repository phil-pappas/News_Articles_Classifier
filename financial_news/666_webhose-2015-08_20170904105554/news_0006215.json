Current peak demand is about 2,400MW against a total installed generation capacity of 2,845.5MW, only 1,600MW of this capacity is available at peak and 1,400MW at off-peak leaving a deficit of 800MW in generation capacity at peak. \nHonorable Kwabena Donkor, Minister of Power, announced at the 2015 Africa Energy Forum in June 2015 in Dubai that plans are in place to push through Emergency Power arrangements to beef up the supply situation in Ghana. \nThese arrangements will add about 1,000MW by the end of the current year (2015) and ultimately provide the platform to pursue the medium to long term solutions. The Ministry is also taking immediate steps to add in excess of 5,000MW generating capacity based on natural gas, clean coal and renewable energy sources within the next five years. \nThis has opened up attractive opportunities for the private sector to get involved. The Powering Africa: Ghana Investment Summit will thus focus on specific projects and the investment opportunities these will throw out. \nOther confirmed speakers for the Powering Africa: Ghana Meeting includes Wisdom Ahiataku-Togobo, Director Renewable and Alternative Energy of the Ministry of Power, William Amuna, Chief Executive Officer of GRIDCo, Ing. Kirk Koffi, Chief Executive Officer of Volta River Authority and Matty Vengerik, Chief Executive Officer of Quantum Power. \nThe rest are Samuel N. Brew-Butler, Board Chairman of Cenpower Generation Company , Mawuena Trebarh Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC), Dr. A.K. Ofosu-Ahenkorah, Director of Policy of Ministry of Power, Samuel Sarpong, Executive Secretary of the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) and Robert Dwamena, Ag. Managing Director of Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG). \nIfey Ikeonu, Council Member (Legal) of ECOWAS Regional Electricity Regulatory Authority, Kweku Awotwi, Principal of Africa Power Systems Management and Paul Kunert, Head of Business Development of Globeleq are also scheduled to speak at the Summit. \nThe Powering Africa: Ghana Summit is powered by EnergyNet UK in collaboration with Diplomatic Call Ghana with support from the Ministry of Power and Ministry of Finance.
