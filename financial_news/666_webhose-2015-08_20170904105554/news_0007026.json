Telegraph – 1 hour 58 minutes ago 1,172.00 +17.0000 \nAsk an expert: Our reader wants to know whether he can improve on the cash rate from his stocks and shares Isa account \nCould anybody inform me where it would be sensible to place my cash in these difficult times? A level of 0.2pc at Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) seems very poor and most other companies do not bother to reply to my enquiries regarding cash interest rates. AW, via email \nThe reality is the rates available on cash deposits from DIY brokers are dismal across the board. The return offered by Hargeaves Lansdown is typical. \nRates range from zero to a “best buy” of 0.5pc from Barclays Stockbrokers, but even then this is only reserved for those who have at least £50,000 to spare. For everyone else the interest on offer drops to 0.2pc. \n• Calculator: How your investments might grow with monthly saving \nIn fairness, providing savings accounts is not what DIY investing platforms are there for and they argue that offering better deals is hard because they do not have a banking licence. \nThis means they cannot hold client cash direct and must place it with other banks, so therefore cannot pay competitive rates. \nBut thanks to changes to the Isa rules, which came into effect last July, savers can now transfer between stocks and shares Isas and cash accounts whenever they like. \nSo therefore someone in your position, who wants to procure higher interest, can put the money into a cash Isa. It will, however, require time and administration on your part. \nNationwide’s “Flexclusive Isa” is the highest paying easy-access deal on the market, offering 1.6pc on balances above £1. \nJustin Modray, of independent financial adviser Candid Money, said: “The only other option is to put into a money market fund, but to be honest you will be lucky to earn 0.3pc once the fund management charges have been stripped out. There is also a chance you could lose money going down this route. \n“So in this case transferring into a market-leading cash Isa and then transferring back into the stocks and shares Isa at a future date will give you a higher interest rate on your savings.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T15:38:10.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
