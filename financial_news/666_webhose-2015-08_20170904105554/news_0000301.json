The PIL filed by NGO Foundation for Restoration of National Values (FRNV) sought laying down of guidelines to ensure that parliament functioned without disruptions and impediments from its members, in the discharge of its legislative and representative responsibilities. The PIL sought sought the guidelines so that public at large and public exchequer were not adversely affected on account of parliamentary proceedings being \"unreasonably and unjustifiably obstructed, stalled and disrupted\" by the opposition. The non-governmental organisation (NGO) said it was concerned over the \"deterioration in the standards of governance in India and the commensurate inability of the State to abide by the commitments and principles enshrined in our constitution\". \"The fact that governance is indeed on the decline, is borne by the fact that numerous Committees and commissions appointed by the government of India have, over the years, pointed to systemic and other lapses that are still in need of urgent remedy,\" the PIL said. The PIL filed by advocate Ravi Prakash Mehrotra said the Foundation was \"deeply concerned that any further lack of action on part of the State to redress the lapses will gravely hinder its ability to adhere to its constitutional obligations\". \"There is urgent and pressing need to improve the overall structures, systems, skills, styles, policies and procedures needed for good governance, with a robust, wholesome and socially responsible administration,\" the non-governmental organisation said. It said this has to be done by simultaneously instilling in those responsible for public administration \"a deeper understanding of their responsibility to further the welfare of the people of our country\".
