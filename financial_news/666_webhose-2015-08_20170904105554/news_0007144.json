Sherman noted on Wednesday that Defense Secretary Ash Carter recently traveled to Israel. \nShe told the Senate Banking Committee that the U.S. is ready — whenever Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is — to discuss further enhancements to security assistance for Israel. \nNetanyahu has criticized the agreement that the U.S. and other world powers negotiated with Tehran to curb its nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars of relief from economic sanctions stifling its economy. \nCongress is expected to vote in September on whether to approve or disapprove of the deal. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T19:13:00.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
