Can you guess where came out on top and where is the unhappiest place to live in the UK? \nIt’s the most affordable borough in London , but Barking and Dagenham has earned another accolade residents might be less proud of - the least happy place to live in the UK. \nCheaper property comes at a price in the Essex commuter belt - Barking and Dagenham scored lowest in five of Rightmove ’s 12 criteria to judge Britain’s happiest location, placing it right at the bottom of the list of 130 places. \nResidents’ ratings put the area in last place for community, area upkeep, safety, amenity and neighbourliness. \nResearch earlier this year showed Dagenham is Britain's most burgled town . \nBarking and Dagenham Council leader Darren Rodwell said: “I find this report quite amusing as we have just had tens of thousands of people coming to a series of events celebrating 50 years of our borough. \n“This was the largest community celebration of its kind in London and as a result we even had Her Majesty The Queen coming here a couple of weeks ago to see our fantastic borough and residents.\" \nMr Rodwell said the area was primed for growth and creative development: “London is moving east and we are at the heart of it.” \nProving that it’s not grim up north after all, Harrogate was rated the happiest place to live for the third year running, topping the poll for area upkeep, pride and safety. \nAlso in the top five for happiness were Shrewsbury, Ipswich, York and Chester. \nLanguishing at the bottom were Hounslow, Brent, Harrow and Newham, suggesting that while property prices in London are high, morale is not. \nOf all London boroughs, Richmond (Taiwan OTC: 2743.TWO - news ) was voted the happiest. \nIn Scotland, Inverness came out top, while Llandrindod Wells is the happiest place in Wales. \nDespite the North-South house price divide, Barking and Dagenham has cheaper property on average (£225,455) than Harrogate, in North Yorkshire, where the average home is £277,049, according to Rightmove. \nRightmove’s housing expert Miles Shipside said: “To come top of our Happy at Home Index three years in a row is no mean feat, and we’ll be expecting a spike in people having a look on Rightmove to see what they might be able to afford to buy or rent in the Harrogate area. \n“So what’s so great about Harrogate? Maybe it’s the quaint tea rooms or perhaps it’s the beautiful countryside. \n“Anyone who is thinking of making a move there should bear in mind that property asking prices are higher than the national average, so perhaps it’s worth a look at the below national average places of Shrewsbury and Ipswich, that make it in to second and third place.” \n= The ten happiest places to live = *Harrogate *Shrewsbury *Ipswich *York *Chester *Inverness *Llandrindod Wells *Hemel Hempstead *Watford *Blackpool = The ten unhappiest places to live = *Barking and Dagenham *Hounslow *Brent *Harrow *Newham *Tower Hamlets *Greenwich *Luton *Hillingdon *Haringey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T08:52:58.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
