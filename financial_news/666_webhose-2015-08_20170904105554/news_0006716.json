Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Ian Narev naturally wants to accentuate the positive. And, from CBA's perspective, there's plenty to be positive about, including the usual headline news of another record annual profit of $9.1 billion, this time up 5 per cent.\nThe results still come with some markers of the risks ahead. That includes slightly increased expenses, falling margins and slowing momentum in the second half of the financial year.\nBut despite the Commonwealth Bank having to join its competitors in urgently raising billions of dollars of capital from shareholders, its chief executive insists the broader outlook remains encouraging. Even a modest rise in credit issues for personal loans is predictable and confined – closely connected to rising unemployment in the once-booming resource states of Western Australia and Queensland.\nThe foundations of the Australian economy are pretty good, Narev says, noting the discernible pick-up, particularly in business credit card use, after the May budget. While overall growth in business credit is still below trend, he thinks it's reasonably solid at around 4 per cent and that hopefully this will increase. He also remains confident in the stability of credit quality overall, albeit in an industry so dependent on continued growth in mortgage lending.\nCBA chief Ian Narev says both sides of politics and business need to do more to translate Australia's natural economic strengths into results. Glenn Hunt Risk weightings The default position for any decent banker and banking system is still the same. That is the need to be as well protected as possible to manage for the inevitable shocks. This helps explain APRA's toughened stance on capital adequacy for Australia's big banks.\nMoving the banks to higher risk weightings for mortgages from next July is officially designed to improve the degree of competition in the mortgage market. The Murray inquiry noted the anti-competitive impact of the smaller being held to much higher weightings and capital requirements than the big four. But the new standards also fit the prudential regulator's extreme focus on increasing capital adequacy for Australia's major banks.\nBank chief executives may have grumbled about the need to do this given their relatively strong position internationally, but the CBA's $5 billion capital raising, following that of NAB and ANZ, reflects an acceptance that there's no choice but to follow the new rules – sooner rather than later.\n China Not that any of this would prevent a financial sector rout in the case of any returning global financial crisis. But even without that, world markets are volatile at best. Narev cites the obvious international risks, such as the continuing problems in Europe and the reaction to the prospect of rising interest rates in the US, as well as questions about China's growth rates.\nChina is clearly the most significant for Australia right now, demonstrated in the smashing of stocks and the Australian currency in reaction to the abrupt devaluation of the renminbi this week. What this implies for Australian exports and the direction of the Chinese economy has led to a severe bout of market nerves taking hold. Even if there's a recovery of confidence in how this will play out, plenty more threats are lurking to destabilise sentiment and trade.\nThat only underscores the longer-term key to Australia's economic stability – as well as the continued high profitability of the banking sector. It's the momentum of the domestic economy and the ability to find new sources of growth and jobs.\nSome of those different avenues to growth are belatedly open. Andrew Robb spent his lunch hour at the National Press Club busily spruiking the huge benefits of the free trade agreement with China, including for the services industry, assuming this can come into effect by the end of the year. Presumably Labor will not go as far as imperilling this deal in Parliament, despite backing the grossly misleading union campaign against it.\nBoth sides must work together But even success is still not going to be enough to drive the Australian economy fast enough or far enough. The low wages growth figures released on Wednesday compound what Narev describes as a Catch-22. Business doesn't invest because of low demand, but demand doesn't increase due to concerns about job security.\nIt's also why Narev says both sides of politics as well as business now need to do more to translate Australia's natural economic strengths into results.\n\"We haven't got forever to get these things right as a country,\" he says.\nAlthough low interest rates have helped propel the resurgence in housing construction, which helps considerably, Narev politely points out the need for additional policies to help make the economy more diversified and productive.\nIt's no longer enough, he argues, for business leaders to say it's the responsibility of government to fix the economy. Nor for government to say it's up to business to invest more. Instead, it needs co-operation and a mutual understanding of each other's realities to \"wrestle down\" a few things. His to-do list features a more efficient and fair tax system, building high-quality infrastructure, and getting trade and foreign investment settings right.\nThis requires a great faith in the ability of the political system to deliver, in a week when so much Canberra energy has been diverted into a massive brawl in the Coalition over whether to approve same-sex marriage. Nor is this political fight likely to end any time soon, despite the obvious preference of the public for Parliament to approve the idea and stop carrying on about it. Instead, Australia faces the prospect of a nonsensical preference by Tony Abbott, inexplicably backed by Julie Bishop, for a plebiscite after the next election. As Malcolm Turnbull says acerbically, this means discussion of this issue will continue to drown out many other important issues for the government and for the economy indefinitely. Just ask a banker.\nWhat was that line about jobs and growth again?", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-08-12T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:07:21.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
