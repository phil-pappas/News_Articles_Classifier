Affinity and Carlyle did not offer a comment. \nTesco, Britain's biggest supermarket group, whose credit rating was cut to \"junk\" status by Moody's and S&P in January, is battling to recover from an accounting scandal and reverse its market share losses in Britain to discount chains Aldi and Lidl. The sale of the South Korean unit is the biggest divestment Tesco is making to improve its financials. \nTesco hired HSBC for the sale of the unit, Homeplus, and in July shortlisted Affinity, Carlyle, Goldman Sachs's private equity arm, KKR and MBK Partners, sources have said. \nIt was not immediately clear if Goldman was part of any bidding group. The U.S. investment bank previously declined to comment on being part of the bidding for Homeplus. \nOrion Corp, a non-private equity suitor, was not shortlisted but remains interested in the sale, an Orion official said. \nThe final bids for the business are due on Aug. 24, Reuters previously reported. \nHomeplus Co Ltd is Tesco's largest business outside Britain, with annual revenue of 7.05 trillion won ($5.9 billion) in 2014. It has more than 400 stores and 500 franchise stores. \nHomeplus's property holdings, consisting mainly of stores, had a book value of 3.09 trillion won as of the end of February, according to a regulatory filing.
