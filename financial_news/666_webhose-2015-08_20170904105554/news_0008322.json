Japan's Nikkei (.N225) dipped 0.3 percent. \nMSCI's all-country world stock index lost 0.25 percent. \nBritain's FTSE 100 fell 0.3 percent (.FTSE). The pan-European FTSEurofirst index of 300 leading shares managed a gain of 0.3 percent (.FTEU3), having been in negative territory much of the morning. Germany's (.GDAXI) and France's CAC 40 (.FCHI) fell nearly 0.2 percent. \nThe worries over China came on a day when trade in the yuan was relatively calm after Beijing fixed the currency's exchange rate marginally higher for the third successive session. \nChina's central bank on Tuesday set the yuan's midpoint (CNY=SAEC) near Monday's closing price at 6.3966 per U.S> dollar. In the spot market, the yuan closed flat at 6.3938 (CNY=CFXS). \nConcerns about slowing growth in China also hit commodities, as benchmark copper prices (CMCU3) slid to a six-year low of $4,989, below the psychological $5,000 a tonne level, and was last down 2.3 percent at $4,999 a tonne. \nBrent oil futures (LCOc1) were down 0.6 percent to $48.46 per barrel, edging closer to a six-month intraday low of $48.24 touched last week. U.S. crude futures rebounded to trade up 0.4 percent to $42.05 (CLc1), after hitting an intraday low of $41.43, close to their lowest since early 2009. \nInvestors will look to U.S. inflation data and minutes of the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting, both being issued on Wednesday, as they ponder when the Fed will begin raising interest rates. \nMarkets are still not fully convinced the Fed will raise rates in September, but most investors are betting a rate hike will occur by the end of year. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last down 10/32 in price to yield 2.1854 percent. \n(Additional reporting by Tanya Agrawal; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:11:55.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
