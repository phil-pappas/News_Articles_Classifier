By Sophie Jamieson | Telegraph – 22 minutes ago 0.0015 0.0000 \nThousands of London Underground workers walk out for 24 hours on Wednesday over plans for all-night Tube services. We look at the potential effect on the capital's businesses \nWhat is the true cost to the British economy of a London Tube strike? \nThe unions did not make themselves popular with business leaders in the capital when they announced 24-hour action starting on Wednesday from 6.30pm. The move follows a previous 24-hour stoppage in July. \nAlready businesses are counting the cost of another strike: all that time wasted queuing for overcrowded buses or traipsing through the streets of London by foot; not to mention the minutes frittered away commiserating with colleagues over nightmare journeys; and the lost income for cafes across the capital as workers choose to stay at home for the day. \nDavid Leam, director of infrastructure policy at business organisation London First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , says: “Right now, the strike will cause harm to many businesses from restaurants to retailers who will suffer from fewer customers.\" \nBut is it possible to put a figure on the financial impact of the travel disruption? Numbers ranging from £10m to £300m have been touted as the estimated loss to the economy of a one-day strike - we dissect them below. \nLondon certainly does not look very productive on strike days (Stefan Rousseau/PA) \n= Fifty million pounds? = \nThe cost of £50m is often cited, but that is based on London Chamber of Commerce and Industry research from 2007, when 315 firms from different sectors were surveyed about lost productivity. \nThe LCCI no longer recommends using this eight-year-old figure - offering merely that strikes “can paralyse businesses”. It adds that the all-night services that London Underground workers are protesting against - in the form of overnight Tube services on selected lines - would bolster the city’s evening and night-time economy. \n= Three hundred million pounds? = \nA more recent figure from the Federation of Small Businesses put the cost of a two-day strike in February last year at £600m. That suggests a 24-hour walk-out comes with a £300m price tag. \nThe FSB figure was based on a snap poll of 627 small business owners extrapolated for the 800,000 businesses in a capital, with the mean amount lost multiplied by the percentage of businesses who reported a negative impact (58pc of those surveyed). \nThe FSB said it could not be sure the figure would be the same 18 months on, but noted the particular cost to the retail and hospitality sectors. \nSue Terpilowski, the FSB’s London policy chairman, added that many people “demonstrated their flexibility during the last strike with home working and other flexible working arrangements being put in place\" - suggesting productivity doesn't fall by quite as much as some might believe. \nPrepare to queue (Warren Allott/The Telegraph) \n= Ten million pounds? = \nIndeed, the flexibility of the new ‘ digital economy ’ could mean that the cost of a strike is a good deal less now than it was when the LCCI did its research in 2007. \nThat’s the belief of thinktank Cebr, which suggested a figure of £10m a day at exactly the same time that the FSB released its 30 times higher estimate. \nIn a report in February 2014, Cebr executive chairman Douglas McWilliams said his number was based on London’s regional economic output. \n“Cebr forecasts that London’s Gross Value Added [GVA this is the normal measure of regional GDP] this year will be £318bn. This gives London’s daily GVA at £1.03bn. So the £50m estimate is about 5pc of daily GVA, which seems way too high,” Mr McWilliams said. \n“I would be surprised if the impact is as much as a loss of GVA of 1pc, which would give a cost to the London economy of about £10m. Plus there will be some costs from additional fuel use, etc.” \nThe night bus could be a thing of the past \n= A boost to the night-time economy = \nThe other factor to consider is the potential loss for London’s businesses were unions to successfully block plans for 24-hour Tube services. \nLondon First and TfL research suggested that nearly 2,000 jobs would be supported by night-time services, 265 in directly operating the Tube and 1,700 indirectly. \nThe resulting economic output was put at £360m over 30 years, with £2.70 in benefits for every £1 spent on delivering the service. Which means if the unions get their way and put the kibosh on the night-time Tube, the strike could cost much more than one day’s productivity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T15:21:49.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
