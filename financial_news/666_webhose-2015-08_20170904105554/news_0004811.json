Accordingly, our actual results may differ materially from the future performance that we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Differences between actual results and any future performance suggested in these forward-looking statements could result from a variety of factors, including the following: \n� acts of terrorism aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; \n� political and economic conditions in nations that produce crude oil or consume refined products; \n� demand for, and supplies of, refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, and ethanol; \n� demand for, and supplies of, crude oil and other feedstocks; \n� the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on and to maintain crude oil price and production controls; \n� the level of consumer demand, including seasonal fluctuations; \n� refinery overcapacity or undercapacity; \n� our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations; \n� the actions taken by competitors, including both pricing and adjustments to refining capacity in response to market conditions; \n� the level of competitors' imports into markets that we supply; Table of Contents \n� accidents, unscheduled shutdowns, or other catastrophes affecting our refineries, machinery, pipelines, equipment, and information systems, or those of our suppliers or customers; \n� changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; \n� the price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles; \n� the levels of government subsidies for alternative fuels; \n� the volatility in the market price of biofuel credits (primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) needed to comply with the United States (U.S.) federal Renewable Fuel Standard); \n� delay of, cancellation of, or failure to implement planned capital projects and realize the various assumptions and benefits projected for such projects or cost overruns in constructing such planned capital projects; \n� earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and irregular weather, which can unforeseeably affect the price or availability of natural gas, crude oil, grain and other feedstocks, and refined products and ethanol; \n� rulings, judgments, or settlements in litigation or other legal or regulatory matters, including unexpected environmental remediation costs, in excess of any reserves or insurance coverage; \n� legislative or regulatory action, including the introduction or enactment of legislation or rulemakings by governmental authorities, including tax and environmental regulations, such as those implemented under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (also known as AB 32), Quebec's Regulation respecting the cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission allowances (the Quebec cap-and-trade system), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation of greenhouse gases, which may adversely affect our business or operations; \n� changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit; \n� changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar; \n� overall economic conditions, including the stability and liquidity of financial markets; and \n� other factors generally described in the \"Risk Factors\" section included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 that is incorporated by reference herein. \nAny one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. \nAll subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Table of Contents \nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Overview For the second quarter of 2015, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $1.4 billion, or $2.66 per share (assuming dilution), compared to $651 million, or $1.22 per share (assuming dilution), for the second quarter of 2014. The increase of $700 million was due primarily to the increase of $993 million in our operating income as shown in the table below (in millions). Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 Change Operating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $ 2,161 $ 1,079 $ 1,082 Ethanol 108 187 (79 ) Corporate (191 ) (181 ) (10 ) Total $ 2,078 $ 1,085 $ 993 \nThe $1.1 billion increase in refining segment operating income in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014 was due to higher margins on gasoline and other refined products (e.g., petroleum coke, propane, and sulfur) relative to Brent crude oil, partially offset by lower discounts on sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. In addition, lower natural gas costs in the second quarter of 2015 favorably impacted our refining segment operating income compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our ethanol segment operating income decreased $79 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014 due to significantly lower ethanol margins that resulted from lower ethanol prices (which were impacted by lower gasoline prices) and lower co-product prices. Corn feedstock costs declined in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014, but the decline was not as significant as the decline in ethanol prices, which resulted in lower ethanol margins. \nFor the first six months of 2015, we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders from continuing operations of $2.3 billion, or $4.52 per share (assuming dilution), compared to $1.5 billion, or $2.77 per share (assuming dilution) for the first six months of 2014. The increase of $835 million was due primarily to the increase of $1.1 billion in our operating income as shown in the table below (in millions). \nSix Months Ended June 30, 2015 2014 Change Operating income (loss) by business segment: Refining $ 3,802 $ 2,359 $ 1,443 Ethanol 120 430 (310 ) Corporate (349 ) (353 ) 4 Total $ 3,573 $ 2,436 $ 1,137 \nThe $1.4 billion increase in refining segment operating income in the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014 was due to higher margins on gasoline and other refined products (e.g., petroleum coke, propane, and sulfur) relative to Brent crude oil, partially offset by lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. In addition, lower natural gas costs in the first six months of 2015 favorably impacted our refining segment operating income compared to the first six months of 2014. Our ethanol segment operating income decreased $310 million in the first six months 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014 due to significantly lower ethanol margins that resulted from lower ethanol prices (which Table of Contents \nwere impacted by lower gasoline prices) and lower co-product prices. Corn feedstock costs declined in the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014, but the decline was not as significant as the decline in ethanol prices, which resulted in lower ethanol margins. \nAdditional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income of our business segments and other components of net income attributable to Valero stockholders are provided below under \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\" \nIn March 2015, we issued $600 million of 3.65 percent senior notes due March 15, 2025 and $650 million of 4.9 percent senior notes due March 15, 2045, and our consolidated subsidiary, Valero Energy Partners LP (VLP), borrowed $200 million under its revolving credit facility (the VLP Revolver), as further described in Note 4 of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On July 1, 2015, VLP repaid $25 million on the VLP Revolver. \nOn July 13, 2015, our board of directors authorized our repurchase of an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date. \nOutlook Energy markets and margins were volatile during the first six months of 2015, and we expect them to continue to be volatile in the near to mid-term. Below is a summary of factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the third quarter of 2015: \n� Refining margins are expected to be volatile as gasoline margins are projected to follow the seasonal trend and decline from current levels and crude oil discounts are expected to widen due to an anticipated increase in crude oil available in the market resulting from the start of the fall refinery maintenance season. \n� Ethanol margins are expected to remain depressed as long as gasoline prices remain low. \n� The market price of biofuel credits (primarily RINs) is expected to remain volatile during 2015 until final target volumes are set by the U.S. EPA. \n� A decline in market prices of crude oil and refined products may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories.
