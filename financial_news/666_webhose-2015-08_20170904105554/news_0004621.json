It's not enough for the estate agent to be in the top 5 per cent of performers for Ray White Real Estate nationally – he has to scale Mount Everest or Mount Kilimanjaro.\nBut, as the director of \"Team Bock\" real estate sees it, the key elements to success in business and in adrenalin-peaking challenges are the same.\n\"There's goal setting that you break down into daily objectives, clarity of focus – especially in the midst of white noise – without getting distracted, and energy management that involves fitness and diet,\" he says.\nRay White Real Estate's Stephen Bock has scaled mounts Everest, Kilimanjaro, Kosciusko and Aconcagua. \"Climbing mountains is the best business development course I've ever done.\"\nThere is increasing interest among business professionals in adventure challenges, or dangerous pursuits, says banking and finance lawyer Cheryl Bart, who has stood on the peaks of the highest mountains in seven continents with her daughter Nikki, a cardiologist.\nShe has also skied to the North and South poles, becoming the 31st person in the world to achieve the explorers' grand slam. In 2009 she was made an officer of the Order of Australia for services to the economy and cultural development in South Australia. She works with welfare organisations and contributes to sport, and sits on boards too numerous to detail.\n\"People are realising the greater value of experiences over materialism,\" Bart says. \"Doing something dangerous also sharpens your focus.\"\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Highly focused Joe Bonington, the son of British mountaineering legend Sir Chris Bonington, who runs a gym that trains ordinary people to take on extraordinary challenges, says people at executive level tend to be highly focused and goal driven.\n\"They need that level of stimulation and achievement outside of work as well as inside,\" he says.\nUsing cross-training, functional movement, altitude training and more at his Sydney-based adventure sports business Joe's Basecamp, Bonington trains high-flyers to push themselves to the extreme.\n\"Part of it is about releasing stress, part about feeling alive,\" he says. \"When you are doing something with that element of risk, it puts everything back into perspective.\n\"On a mountain, in the bush or crossing a desert, all the other stuff just drops away. Things can also become clearer away from the emails and iPhone.\"\nOn a physical level, he says rigorous training can develop greater discipline, as well as increase feel-good endorphin levels and help condition both the brain and the body.\nBock, who has scaled four peaks – Everest, Kilimanjaro, Kosciuszko and Aconcagua – and still has three more on his list, says: \"For the first peak I was up at 3.45am four days a week to train on a treadmill, including up to three hours wearing a 25-kilogram pack, as well as doing strength training.\n\"Wednesday night each week was a one-hour fitness test and on Sundays we hiked 50 to 70 kilometres for 10 to 12 hours with a heavy pack.\n\"You push yourself until you are vomiting and you are crying in pain. Every session is intensive and once you reach your limit you extend it.\"\nTrained for a year The high-flying agent trained for a year in the lead-up to Everest.\nBart, who always packs running and swimming gear for her frequent business trips, cross-trains six days a week, including boxing and spin classes. Once a week she pushes herself to the physical limit with a personal trainer.\nFor Jarrod Bowditch, an executive director of the multimillion-dollar Verifact Group, completing Papua New Guinea's Kokoda Track in 2009 meant nine months of training, trekking with a heavy backpack, as well as doing other cardiovascular and resistance work.\nMental toughness was just as crucial as physical toughness, the executive says. He used the walk to raise money for the Gidget Foundation, a charity that supports families affected by post-natal depression, for which he sits on the board of directors.\nBowditch's current adventure challenge involves long rides on a DR-Z400 motorbike and a KTM 690 Enduro bike. He has been from Cairns to Cape York and from Sydney to Melbourne over the Snowy Mountains.\nHe agrees with Bonington that a bonus of extreme challenges in remote locations is the \"digital detox\". \"There is no communication, so you can't access your mobile or email.\"\nRecharges For Jodie Davis, who has a degree in multimedia and systems management, it is possible that climbing mountains or even motorcycling seems a little tame. The business development and marketing manager for Matt Hall Racing, Australia's premier aviation entertainment organisation, recharges by aerobatic piloting.\nShe is also training for a 100-kilometre hike from the Hawkesbury to Sydney, where participants must do the distance in the fastest possible time.\nDavis, who has competed in 16 acrobatic flying competitions in Australia, says the sport is 90 per cent mental training and 10 per cent physical.\n\"I never stop learning about new manoeuvres, new aircraft, new sequences, new rules, or new environmental conditions,\" she says. \"The training I do allows me to go from feeling one step behind the aircraft and being 'responsive', to being three steps in front of the aircraft and being 'proactive'. To a very similar degree these approaches can also be applied to business.\n\"Much like business, aerobatics is also about preparation, research and risk management.\"\nAerobatics training differs from hiking training in that she can go at a fast pace for hours on end and \"basically zone out\", she says.\nDifferent motivations Bart, who, as a director at the Australian Himalayan Foundation, will guide a trek to Bhutan in 2016 to fundraise for Nepalese earthquake victims, acknowledges that different people have different motivations for adventure challenges.\n\"But a common factor is the importance of having goals, of planning and of adapting to changing conditions,\" she says.\n\"You can't get depressed and say, 'I can't do it any more.' You have to say, 'How will I do it?' with equal vigour.\"\nBonington believes it takes a certain mental toughness to take on an extreme physical challenge – but says that toughness can be learnt.\n\"We are talking about people who take their work very seriously and treat something like this in the same way as they would a major business project.\n\"That said, devoting the time to prepare properly, and to train, is crucial to whether or not you succeed – or you come back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:07:58.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
