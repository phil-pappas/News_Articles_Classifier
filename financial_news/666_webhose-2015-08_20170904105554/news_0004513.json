( NGS ), a leading provider of gas compression equipment and services to the natural gas industry, announces its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Revenue: Total revenue was $24.2 million, an increase from $22.0 million, or 10%, for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period ended June 30, 2014. This change was attributable to a significant increase in sales revenue to $4.3 million from $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same three month period in 2014. Total revenue decreased 2% between consecutive quarters by $500,000 to $24.2 million from $24.7 million, mainly due to an expected decline in rental revenue attributable to the decline in overall activity in the industry. Special Items : During the first half of this year NGS initiated a review focused on optimization of the rental fleet and decided to make adjustments for equipment that has been relatively underutilized; primarily related to older gas compression packages designed for dry natural gas shale operations. As a result, NGS reported non-cash, pre-tax charge of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2015. This charge included a pre-tax charge on the retirement of rental equipment of $4.4 million. The remaining balance was related to a slight increase in bad debt and inventory allowances. Gross Margins : Total gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2015 increased 8% to $14.0 million from $13.0 million for the same period ended June 30, 2014.

Sequentially, operating income decreased to $5.4 million, excluding special items, for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from $5.8 million in the period ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in rental revenues between the periods.
