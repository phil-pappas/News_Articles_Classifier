Robert Bentley vetoed in June as lawmakers remain at an impasse over taxes and revenue. \nThe Senate committee on Friday rejected a House plan that would have gutted the state's Medicaid program. Instead, members approved a budget identical to the one that lawmakers passed in June that slashes $200 million from state agencies. \nBudget committee chairman Sen. Arthur Orr said lawmakers will continue looking for an agreement on revenue. He expects lawmakers will be back in a second special session. \nGov. Robert Bentley has called the cuts unacceptable. \nSenate and House leaders are meeting with Bentley Friday to talk about the final days of the special session which must end Tuesday. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T20:31:12.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
