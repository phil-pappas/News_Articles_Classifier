(@easic), a fabless semiconductor company that delivers a custom integrated circuit (IC) platform (eASIC Platform), and Tamba Networks , a leading developer of connectivity IP cores, announced the immediate availability of a 100 Gigabit Ethernet MAC (media access controller) and PCS (physical coding sublayer) solution for high bandwidth applications, such as data center, and core and access network switching. The combination of the eASIC Nextreme-3 silicon platform and Tamba’s flexible, ultra-low-latency Gigabit Universal Ethernet MAC/PCS cores gives designers a single integrated platform for building IEEE802.3-compliant communications equipment that supports 100G Ethernet and 40GE-KR4, including FEC (forward error correction), link training and auto negotiation. “eASIC is pleased to partner with Tamba to address the growing demand for 100Gbps Ethernet and 40Gbps with KR4 support for designing low latency, efficient multiplexers and distribution equipment,” said eASIC Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing, Jasbinder Bhoot. “The Tamba IP is fully qualified in the eASIC flow allowing our customers to get started immediately with an easy-to-use, cost-effective solution for getting to market quickly, and achieving higher performance and lower power compared to FPGA alternatives.” “Together, we’re delivering an efficient silicon platform for Ethernet layer implementation that fully exploits the benefits of Tamba’s compact, configurable, Universal Ethernet MAC/PCS IP cores and the eASIC Nextreme-3 silicon fabric,” said Tamba Networks President, Soren Pedersen. “With our IP cores, designers can achieve drastic reductions in latency, power consumption, and logic size for next-generation communications equipment. We’re excited to extend those advantages to eASIC customers.” To learn more about Tamba IP for Nextreme-3, go to eZ-IP Intellectual Property Alliance .
