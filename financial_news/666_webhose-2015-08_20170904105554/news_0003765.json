To be fair, it took something as seismic as the end of the commodities supercycle to prove his fallibility, but apparently Ivan Glasenberg isn't superhuman or from another dimension, after all.\nIt wasn't long ago that the founder of mining giant Glencore was widely lauded as a dealmaking genius when he floated the company on the London Stock Exchange.\nIt was 2011, a time of huge global uncertainty, when most other business figures were focused on little more than simple self-preservation.\nYet the suave South African chose this moment to push the button on the largest listing the City had ever seen. In one fell swoop, the commodities trader was catapulted into the upper ranks of the FTSE 100, Glasenberg joined the ranks of the super-rich thanks to a 15pc stake that saw him become a dollar-billionaire 10 times over, and its army of nearly 500 traders all made just over $US100m (£64m) each.\nIn the City, where huge fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, the listing was more spectacular than any ever seen, dwarfing even the bumper floats of Goldman Sachs and Google in terms of wealth creation.\nThe company quickly became known as \"the millionaires factory\", and with good reason Glasenberg immediately earned a reputation as one of the world's most astute business figures.\nInvestors, of course, assumed they too would become rich by joining the Glencore money-making machine.\nBut, unfortunately, it hasn't quite turned out that way.\n Commodities: weak link In fact, it's turned out pretty badly so far, thanks to a flaw in the plan: the commodities supercycle was supposed to go on for ever. Driven by seemingly limitless demand from China's red-hot economy for every raw material on the planet, commodity prices rocketed into another stratosphere, where experts thought they would stay.\nGlencore is one of the largest producers of raw materials - from iron ore to copper and aluminium, and even oil and wheat. But it is also the single biggest middleman, and therefore investors thought snapping up shares in Glencore would be a one-way bet.\nSadly for them, it soon transpired that the supercycle turned out to be a myth and no different from previous boom-and-bust cycles.\nTo compound the pain, it now seems as though Glasenberg pushed the button when at the peak.\nNo one is suggesting that Glasenberg, despite his undoubted brilliance could have foreseen the forthcoming storm, but the result is that as China cools and commodity prices tumble, suddenly Glencore has found itself in a world of pain.\nThe company is battling falling profits, has a mammoth debt pile, and because it is unique in both producing and trading commodities, is more exposed to the slump than its main rivals. As a result, Glencore's share price has fallen more than 60pc, a bigger drop than BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, to hit an all-time low.\nWarning sign To compound Glasenberg's efforts to arrest the dramatic fall in fortunes, one of America's biggest activist funds has suddenly turned up on his share register. No doubt the combative tycoon will dismiss the emergence of Harris Associates as an investor as little more than a distraction, but the hedge fund has the potential to become a big nuisance.\nAt the moment, it only owns 1pc of the company's shares but that position has doubled in recent weeks and it would not take much more of an increase for it to wield a decent amount of influence. As we've seen in plenty of other situations, activists don't have to amass huge stakes for boards to capitulate.\nGlasenberg is famously feisty, so he is unlikely to easily agree to any demands he doesn't like, but so too is David Herro, Harris Associates' founder.\nA fascinating tussle could be brewing.\nHerro has a history of blocking deals that he thinks a company shouldn't be attempting so perhaps he thinks Glasenberg, a serial dealmaker, could attempt another takeover as a way out of the mess. After all, it was less than a year ago that he attempted to pull off a spectacular £100bn merger with Rio Tinto.\nGiven the deterioration in Glencore's fortunes since then, it's hard to imagine that even Glasenberg would try to revive such a massive deal, which would carry immeasurable risks.\nInstead, he should focus his efforts on turning round his company, which as things stand is going to require real superpowers.\nThe Sunday Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:12:12.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
