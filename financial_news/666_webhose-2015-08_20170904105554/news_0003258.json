The sector is now declining at an annual rate of 0.7 percent, they said, compared with 0.1 percent a year ago.\n\"That may not seem like a mass exodus, but it is a big change in a short period of time,\" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. \"And the rate of decline is still accelerating.\"\nMedia stocks plunged this week on concerns about \"cord cutting,\" or dropping of cable or satellite TV subscriptions, fueled by Walt Disney Co's admission that its sports juggernaut ESPN had lost a \"modest\" number of customers.\nThe second quarter saw the debut of new online options that do not require a cable subscription, including Time Warner Inc's HBO Now and Sony Corp's PlayStation Vue.
