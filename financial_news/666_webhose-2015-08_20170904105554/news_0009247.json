Shares of Dow components Exxon Mobil and Chevron were down about 1 percent in premarket trading. \nAnother fall in the S&P energy index, already the worst performing among the 10 major S&P 500 sectors this year, will mean the index will have declined for six straight sessions. The last time that happened was in May. \nThe Fed, in minutes of its latest meeting released on Wednesday, continued to express broad concerns about lagging inflation even as the job market improved further - key factors it has said it will consider when deciding on the timing of a raise in interest rates. \nData on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the trend remained consistent with solid labor market momentum. \n\"We are looking at a steep lower open today as the markets are worried about oil prices and the Fed minutes added to the fear factor,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. \nS&P 500 e-minis were down 12 points, or 0.58 percent, with 274,595 contracts traded at 8:33 a.m. ET (1233 GMT). \nNasdaq 100 e-minis were down 26 points, or 0.58 percent, on volume of 42,510 contracts. \nDow e-minis were down 107 points, or 0.62 percent, with 32,646 contracts changing hands. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average is poised to stay below its 200-day moving average for the 13th session in a row. The last time this happened was over a 59-session period during August to September 2011. \nAfter the minutes, traders scaled back bets the Fed would raise rates in September, while the dollar index fell. \nWall Street briefly turn positive on Wednesday after the minutes, but closed lower, weighed down by oil prices and a fall in materials and energy stocks. \nFears of slowing growth in China, which carried the global economy following the 2008 financial crisis, have also hit commodities. \nNetApp rose 5.7 percent to $31.18 after the data storage equipment maker's results beat expectations. \nDisney fell 1.7 percent to $104.63 after Bernstein downgraded the stock to \"market perform\". \nThe National Association of Realtors releases existing home sales data for July at 10 a.m. ET.
