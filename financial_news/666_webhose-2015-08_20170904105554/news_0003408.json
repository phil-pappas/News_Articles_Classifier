Any move to sideline the carriers by going direct to consumers is therefore risky for Apple.\nApple recently reported that it sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter through June, raking in $31.4 billion in revenue, or 63 percent of its total sales.\nIn order to ensure maximum coverage to its customers, Apple has moved away from an early focus on exclusive deals with single operators in key markets to work with as many operators as possible.\nLast year, the company launched an own-branded Apple SIM card that allows consumers using its iPad tablet devices, but not its phones, to switch services between network operators. Several top operators in the United States and Europe support the Apple SIM.\nBy contrast, Silicon Valley rival Google Inc earlier this year unveiled an MVNO service in the United States.\nThe Google service, known as “Project Fi”, is being run in conjunction with U.S. operators Sprint and T-Mobile USA . It connects customers to the fastest available service by seeking out available local Wi-Fi hotspots before, as a backstop, connecting to the telecom networks of its partners.\nApple shares, which fell as much as 4.4 percent in the first 90 minutes of Nasdaq trading on Tuesday, steadied after the denial to be down 3.1 percent by 1642 GMT.\n 05, 2015 9:11 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:28:20.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
