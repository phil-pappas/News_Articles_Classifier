MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of KKR & Co. L.P., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, and the related notes included elsewhere in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2015, including the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained therein. The historical condensed consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KKR. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors.\" Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. All amounts are in thousands, except unit data and per unit data and except where noted. \nOverview \nWe are a leading global investment firm that manages investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds. We aim to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and driving growth and value creation in the assets we manage. We invest our own capital alongside the capital we manage for fund investors and bring debt and equity investment opportunities to others through our capital markets business. \nOur business offers a broad range of investment management services to our fund investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and third parties. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 260 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $510 billion. We have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in new areas, such as credit, special situations, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"), capital markets, infrastructure, energy and real estate. These efforts build on our core principles and industry expertise, allowing us to leverage the intellectual capital and synergies in our businesses, and to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on meeting the needs of our existing fund investors and in developing relationships with new investors in our funds. \nWe conduct our business with offices throughout the world, providing us with a pre-eminent global platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer investors in our funds, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities. \nWe have also used our balance sheet as a significant source of capital to further grow and expand our business, increase our participation in our existing businesses and further align our interests with those of our fund investors and other stakeholders. The majority of our balance sheet consists of general partner interests in KKR investment funds, limited partner interests in certain KKR investment funds, and co-investments in certain portfolio companies of KKR private equity funds as well as the interests in CLOs, corporate loans, debt securities and energy and real estate assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of KKR Financial Holdings LLC. Our balance sheet also holds other assets used in the development of our business, including seed capital for new strategies, such as growth equity investments and real estate credit, and minority stakes in other investment managers. \nAs a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, CLOs, managed accounts and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income from investing our own capital alongside that of our fund investors and from other balance sheet investments and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested. \nOur investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base, an integrated global investment platform, the expertise of operating consultants and senior advisors and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. These teams invest capital, a substantial portion of which is of a long duration and not subject to redemption. With over 75% of our fee paying assets under management not Table of Contents \nsubject to redemption for at least 8 years from inception, we have significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities. We believe that these aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions. \nBusiness Segments \nPrivate Markets \nThrough our Private Markets segment, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. We also manage and sponsor a group of funds and co-investment vehicles that invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy and real estate. These funds, vehicles and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC registered investment adviser. As of June 30, 2015, the segment had $63.1 billion of AUM and FPAUM of $46.8 billion, consisting of $36.8 billion in private equity and $10.0 billion in real assets (including infrastructure, energy and real estate) and other strategies. Prior to 2010, FPAUM in the Private Markets segment consisted entirely of private equity funds. \nThe table below presents information as of June 30, 2015 relating to our current private equity funds and other investment vehicles for which we have the ability to earn carried interest. This data does not reflect acquisitions or disposals of investments, changes in investment values or distributions occurring after June 30, 2015.

Such amounts have been converted into U.S. dollars based on (i) the foreign exchange rate at the date of purchase for each investment and (ii) the exchange rate prevailing on June 30, 2015 in the case of unfunded commitments. \n(3) The gross IRR, net IRR and multiple of invested capital are calculated for our investment funds that have invested for at least 36 months prior to June 30, 2015. None of the North America Fund XI, Asian Fund II, Real Estate Partners Americas, Energy Income and Growth Fund, Global Infrastructure Investors II or European Fund IV have invested for at least 36 months as of June 30, 2015. We therefore have not calculated gross IRRs, net IRRs and multiples of invested capital with respect to those funds. \n(4) Investments are considered partially realized when realized proceeds, excluding current income like dividends and interest, are a material portion of invested capital. None of the North America Fund XI, Asian Fund II, Real Estate Partners Americas, Energy Income and Growth Fund, Global Infrastructure Investors II or European Fund IV have realized a material portion of invested capital. We therefore have not calculated gross IRRs, net IRRs and multiples of invested capital with respect to the investments of those funds. \n(5) IRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period. Net IRRs presented under Total Investments are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees. Net IRRs presented under Realized/Partially Realized Investments are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest, but before payment of any applicable management fees as management fees are applied to funds, not investments. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees. \nThe multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of any realized and unrealized returns on a fund's investments to the fund's general partner pursuant to a carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees. \nExisting KKR Private Markets funds may utilize third party financing facilities to provide liquidity to such funds, and in such event IRRs are calculated from the time capital contributions are due from fund investors to the time fund investors receive a related distribution from the fund. KKR Private Markets funds also generally provide in certain circumstances, which vary depending on the relevant fund documents, for a portion of capital returned to investors to be restored to unused commitments as recycled capital. For KKR's Private Markets funds that have a preferred return, we take into account recycled capital in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital because the calculation of the preferred return includes the effect of recycled capital. For KKR's Private Markets funds that do not have a preferred return, we do not take recycled capital into account in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital. The inclusion of recycled capital generally causes invested and realized amounts to be higher and IRRs and multiples of invested capital to be lower than had recycled capital not been included.
