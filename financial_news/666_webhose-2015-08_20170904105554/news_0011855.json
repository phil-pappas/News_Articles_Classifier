However, it’s fair to say that the “Betty Power” tweet published on July 24 was filed into the “banter” category by the sorts of hedge funds who set up black boxes to pick up and trade on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) gossip. \nHowever, the real question now is not whether the tweeter knew more than he or she should have, or indeed whether the Takeover Panel even thought to investigate at the time, but that given the frenzied pace of M&A in the gambling sector, what will happen to the now sidelined William Hill? \nIf the mooted deals in the sector come to light, Hill will have been, in the course of just one month, relegated from the UK’s biggest betting firm to third. The first sting was from former number two and number three Ladbrokes (Amsterdam: LB6.AS - news ) and Coral, who confirmed their £2.3bn deal to create a betting shop giant last month, one which would take the top spot. The mooted merger between Betfair and Paddy Power will combine two strong online platforms and create one of the more modern betting shops estates in the UK and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) , and place the enlarged entity into second position. \nDeal activity between the gaming majors is being driven by tougher regulations and higher taxes, which have put the industry under unprecedented pressure. \nAs a result of the rising costs of meeting regulation, which Betfair chief executive Breon Corcoran credited for being a catalyst for the deal talks, William Hill and its chief executive James Henderson cannot afford to stand still. But that is not to say that there is no hope for the sporting major. After all, there are other situations in the sector which are may provide food for thought for Henderson. \nIn February, William Hill had a punt at a £720m takeover of 888. That ended badly after it became clear 888’s major shareholder, Avi Shaked, was reluctant to sell at the mooted takeover price, and was instead pushing for a deal that would see him and the rest of the Shaked family, which controls 48pc of the business, receive a higher amount than other investors. \nSuch a proposal, which would be barred under UK rules, was possible as a result of 888’s Gibraltan jurisdiction, but it was unpalatable to the co-founding Ben-Yitzhak family, who own 10.5pc of the business. \nThe deal’s dismissal prompted a showdown between shareholders and 888 chief executive Brian Mattingley, which ended in an agreement that the Shakeds would be supportive of management. In March, Mattingley, who has since been promoted to executive chairman, said 888’s shareholders were “not natural sellers for cash but they would be supportive of 888 being a consolidator”. He added that they would see an all-share combination with a rival, rather than a cash takeover, “as a positive move”. \nThe implicit green-light for 888 to be predator and not prey saw 888 quickly make a pass for online rival Bwin.Party, which had been trying to sell itself for months. But 888’s own flirtations appear to be in jeapodary, as Aim-listed rival GVC, which appeared on the scene only after 888 showed its hand, now seems to be in pole position for Bwin even though 888 is offering more cash than its rival. \nIf Bwin does fall into the hands of GVC then a scorned 888 may have to turn to William Hill. Because 888 is domiciled in Gibraltar, William Hill is permitted to return with another bid at any time, rather than being beholden to the UK’s six-month lock-up rule. \nBut with a £3.5bn market capitalisation that dwarfs 888’s market value of £557m, a merger of equals, as the Shaked’s so desire, between William Hill and 888 seems unlikely. \nThere is an understanding that 888’s Mattingley is pragmatic, even if the shareholders are not, although William Hill might not want to be spurned twice with a hostile approach. \nBut when deal making reaches these frenzied heights the fear of missing out often sets in, meaning companies take bolder steps than they might in more normal times. \nAlternatively, William Hill could yet turn gate-crasher and make a move for Paddy Power. \nThere is no such thing as a done deal, as hedge funds are fond of saying, but breaking up an agreement between two listed rivals after weeks of intensive talks is not guaranteed, and could leave Hill’s Henderson dangerously exposed were he not to collect on such a high-stakes gamble.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T22:49:02.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
