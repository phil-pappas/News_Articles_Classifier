Guess what? We DO know what we're doing! Here, just a few lies we're fed by the media about women and money. on.aol.com \nScratch the surface, and we all have fears about money. Fear is our most powerful emotion...it can motivate and it can paralyze. What good can fear bring? Think of the child who learns to be afraid of a hot stove by accidentally touching one. We don't ever want that child to touch a hot stove again. For many Capital Region families, money and fear go together. No other single issue represents our need to love and be loved, to experience fun and enjoyment, to want freedom, and to experience some degree of power over our lives,” Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Yahoo \nOprah Winfrey calls fear \"False Evidence Appearing Real.\" Money can be a scary subject for many people, and like most important topics, women and men deal with it differently. Here are six money fears experienced by women–and what to do about them. \nThe \"Bag Lady\" Syndrome. Many women worry they will wind up homeless. It is critical to remember that your financial future is in your hands–being destitute doesn’t just happen. “Bag lady Syndrome.” The most documented female money fear is anxiety about finding yourself suddenly destitute and on the street. Lily Tomlin, Gloria Steinem, Shirley MacLaine and Katie Couric have all reported suffering from this fear. \nNot Smart Enough. Many financial advisor says they often hear women complain, “I am too stupid to learn about finance.” “It’s not that you are not smart enough, it is that you have not been socialized to talk about finance with others, and women tend to learn through conversation,” say brain scientists. \nFear of Being a \"Bad Mother.\" It is common for mothers to fear their kids won’t be able to afford college–and to sacrifice their retirements as a result. There are no scholarships for retirement. There are scholarships and loans for students, however. \nFear of Mistakes. Fear of making money mistakes means many women defer to their husbands to handle family finances–then find themselves lost in the case of divorce or death. One woman in the Stockade district of Schenectady confided that she knows she needs to learn about money, but when her 23-years-older husband talks about money, she can't understand him and the conversation ends up in an argument. \nFear of Taking Control. Fear of making mistakes also paralyzes many women from taking control of their money, or stashing their savings in low-interest rate accounts that actually lose money when taxes and inflation are considered. “Women--and men--need to recognize that everyone makes mistakes; it’s part of learning,” says the Consumer Federation of America, “There are few mistakes that can’t be undone. But if your concerns are immobilizing, consider hiring someone to help you avoid those mistakes.” \nFear of Divorce. Often,women stay in unhealthy relationships for fear that divorce will guarantee poverty, says Lisa Decker, divorce financial analyst based in Atlanta. “The fear of the unknown is more comfortable than the thought of struggling through money woes,” she says. Decker advises taking small steps to understand your financial picture, then find ways to make enough money to support yourself. \nInformation and knowledge can overcome fears. Consumers in the Capital Region can start by getting information here. \nRemember: The only thing we have to fear is, fear itself, according to President Franklin Roosevelt, speaking during the depths of the Great Depression.
