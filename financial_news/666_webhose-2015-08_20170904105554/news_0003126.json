The situation had created a \"revenue buoyancy\" permitting more capital expenditure and investment in infrastructure, the minister said. \"The first quarter capital expenditure increased by 17.6 percent. Because of our revenue measures, we have been able to allocate an additional Rs.70,000 crore this year for investment in infrastructure,\" Jaitley said. The indirect tax revenues grew 37.5 percent to nearly Rs.154,000 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal on the back of a significant rise in excise collections. The collections on this count in the year-ago period were Rs.112,000 crore, the finance ministry said last month. The first quarter indirect tax collection figures appear to give some indication of \"green shoots\" of economic revival, Jaitley added.
