Bluepoint’s mobile remote deposit capture (RDC) solution, QwikDeposit ToGo, will now include Mitek MiSnap™ for automated mobile check capture. With QwikDeposit ToGo and Mitek MiSnap, mobile check capture becomes almost effortless. When an account holder initiates a mobile deposit and is prompted to take a picture of the check, they simply hover the camera-equipped smartphone over the document. Mitek MiSnap provides continuous real-time feedback until a suitable image is detected, and then automatically captures the image. Within seconds, an ideal Check-21 image is ready for deposit. The account holder benefits from the quick, error-free deposit, and no back office review is needed.\n“Bluepoint was one of the earliest providers of Mitek’s Mobile Deposit. The simplicity and the efficiencies of using the camera for check deposit has made is a preferred deposit channel for consumer and financial institutions,” said James B.
