And we love our booze. So, why not combine the two in a cocktail?\nThat’s the premise behind Owl’s Brew, a two-year-old line of tea-based mixers that can be combined with a wide variety of spirits (vodka, whiskey, tequila, etc.). It’s a concept that has found a strong market in relatively little time. Sales of the mixers are projected to hit $1.7 million this year — more than four times the total in 2014, according to the company — and the product is showing up everywhere from the shelves of Whole Foods to the bars in Loews Hotels. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that tea itself is so popular (wholesale tea sales climbed 10.7% to $10.84 billion over the last two years, according to Statista.)\nThe mixer line is the brainchild of Jennie Ripps and Maria Littlefield, marketing pros with a passion for (what else?) tea. The team admits their idea wasn’t a slam-dunk when they first floated it. “Historically, mixologists have been working with tea for a long time, but the person at home didn’t think tea could stand up to spirits,” says Ripps. Then again, Ripps and Littlefield weren’t looking to craft plain-Jane mixers—tea is the key ingredient, but it’s hardly the only one in the four varieties Owl’s Brew has released to date. They range from “The Classic” (English Breakfast tea with lemon and lime) to the newly launched “White and Vine” (white tea with pomegranate, lemon peel and watermelon). Tea is versatile enough to invite such combinations, Ripps adds, and that’s even before booze is added to the equation.\nAs for the brand’s name, it’s intended to promote the idea that tea is “wise” drinking, especially because of the high concentration of antioxidants in the beverage. Plus, the brand says that it uses only organic ingredients. Says Ripps: “Even if you’re drinking cocktails, you should know what you’re putting in your body.”\nWhat we think about them: It’s hard to believe that it’s taken someone so long to come up with the concept of tea-based mixers, because it’s a pure winner. The mixers play up tea’s naturally refreshing quality, but they take that refreshment in different directions — whether it’s the lemon-y appeal of “The Classic” or the more exotic, tropical qualities of “Coco-Lada” (black tea with coconut, chai spices and pineapple). Moreover, the resulting cocktails change a great deal depending on the spirit that’s added to the mixer — and part of the “fun” of Owl’s Brew is seeing these differences in the combinations.\nHow to enjoy them: As mixers go, Owl’s Brew has what might be called an “open platform” approach — that is, you’re really not confined to any category of spirit. For that matter, you’re not even confined to spirits: The brand says you can combine the mixers with wine or beer in some instances (for example, “White and Vine” blends well with wheat beer, Ripps says). Or, if you prefer to go the non-alcoholic route, just add some seltzer.
