Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Prime Minister Tony Abbott and other Coalition frontbenchers have dismissed Joe Hockey's new push for a republic, saying the government has 'bigger things' to focus such as the economy and jobs.\nAustralian Republican Movement chairman Peter FitzSimons has recruited his friend Treasurer Joe Hockey to champion the cause in Canberra by leading a new parliamentary friendship group, along with ACT Labor senator Katy Gallagher.\nThe Prime Minister, a monarchist, slapped down the move on Thursday, saying Mr Hockey had not talked to him about leading the group.\n\"No, we didn't talk about this because we've got, I suppose, bigger things on our minds most of the time,\" Mr Abbott told the Nine Network.\n\"Joe and I talk about many things but mostly it's the economy and what the government can do to improve the economy\".\nHe then said he did not think there would any change on the issue \"any time soon\", and \"there are lots of parliamentary friendship groups and this is just another of them\".\nThe comments follow similar statements from other coalition colleagues who have suggested Mr Hockey has created another distraction away from their mantra of \"jobs, growth and community safety\".\nAgriculture minister Barnaby Joyce also brushed off Mr Hockey's initiative.\n \"I believe everyone should have friends I think they are great..but I'm going to be focusing on other things.\n\"I'm sure Joe has strong reasons but I just want to focus on the job we are doing, we're turning around the soft commodity market in our nation,\" he said.\nWA Liberal senator and constitutional monarchist Dean Smith argued Mr Hockey's involvement in the republican debate was \"most definitely a distraction\".\n\"The priority for every parliamentarian is to focus on the national economy and on jobs creation, nothing is more important than strengthening the economy and creating jobs at this time,\" Senator Smith said.\nMr Hockey has long supported turning Australia into a republic, along with Education Minister Christopher Pyne, Liberal senator Marise Payne and Coalition MP, Wyatt Roy.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-27T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:39:18.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
