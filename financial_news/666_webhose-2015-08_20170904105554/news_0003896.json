Lucky 8 sees sales spike\nNUMBER IS UP: Bumper weekend at buyers test their luck\nAROUND THE STATE: More Victorian real estate news\nPrices at the top end of town are running hot.\nThe city’s luxury real estate ranks among the top 10 in the world for price growth, according to research from Knight Frank.\nMelbourne’s top tier properties notched 7.9 per cent growth in the year to June, which was the seventh biggest increase globally and well ahead of the 2.5 per cent average.\nThe cream of the property crop in Melbourne has a $3.6 million median price.\nMelbourne is gearing up for a big auction weekend as sellers hope to cash in on the 8/8 date.\nThe report, Knight Frank’s Prime Global Cities Index, measures movement in the top 5 per cent of properties across 35 major cities.\nThe Victorian capital’s surge is behind Sydney’s 12.5 per cent growth, which was the third highest rate in the world.\nMichelle Ciesielski, director of residential research at Knight Frank Australia, said Melbourne and Sydney had lagged behind other major centres in bouncing back from the GFC.\n“We’ve taken longer to recover than global counterparts in our prime residential markets,” she said.\nAustralasia is now leading the charge as the fastest growing region in the world for luxury real estate.\nTop reported sales in Melbourne so far this year include six with $10 million-plus price tags.\nThe rises come as Melbourne waited for the results of a bumper auction weekend with more than 900 homeowners test their luck on Saturday’s auspicious date — August 8.\nThe eighth day of the eighth month is a promising day to sell due to the number eight’s ­association with good fortune in Chinese culture.\nThe digit is a popular choice for licence plates, phone numbers and as a date for special occasions — a belief homeowners are hoping will bring success under the hammer.\nMore than 1000 properties are scheduled for auction this weekend, which is a record number for August, according to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria.\nnicole.engwirda@news.com.au\nIncrease ", "external_links":
