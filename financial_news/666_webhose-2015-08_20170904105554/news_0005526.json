Advertising Print This Post \nGMO Click, the largest brokerage in Japan by volumes, has revealed its financial metrics for the month ending July 2015, according to a GMO CLICK statement. \nEarlier this August, GMO Click released its monthly tranche of foreign exchange (FX) volumes for July 2015 , which generated a total of $983 billion, corresponding to a loss of -9.5% MoM from June. However, the figure is a steadfast improvement from its 2014 equivalent, surging 146% YoY from July 2014. \nHowever, for the month ending July 2015, GMO Click’s financial metrics also witnessed a deterioration in its operating revenues, having come in at only $19.1 million (¥2,379 million) – this figure shows a decline of -3.0% MoM from $19.7 million (¥2,432 million) reported in June 2015. \nFurthermore, GMO Click has now seen a successive decline in four straight months, having had its volumes wither from a high of $22.1 million in April 2015. The trend is largely on par with the rest of the FX industry, albeit in other regions, with many brokers grappling market tranquility and a cessation of volatility just one month after a lingering Greek debt crisis. \nGMO Click also recently made headlines when the group marked a new milestone for the company, registering the 400,000th account at the brokerage this past June . It remains to be seen if the account growth will correspond to higher revenues and volumes however, two trends that have thus far been pointed downward. Got a news tip?
