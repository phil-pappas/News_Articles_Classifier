If the generals begin to run, head for the hills. In that saying the “troops” are the majority of all stocks, especially the non-leadership, non-mega cap stocks. The generals are typically a much smaller subset containing the market leadership stocks, sometimes large to mega-cap stocks.\nAs I described in Investor Alert: Look Beyond Just Price, Market Breadth Is Weak , which is about NYSE market breadth, specifically the advance-decline line (AD Line) and the new highs-new lows differential, the troops have been running.\nAugust 5, 2015 signified something more than noteworthy; Apple Apple shares broke below its 200-day moving average (see chart below) for the first time in about two years. Now the generals are running.\nChart courtesy of Stockcharts.com. Commentary and opinions are those of Hanlon Investment Management.\nApple is perhaps the biggest general of all time, as it has an enormous market capitalization of $650 billion, and was recently worth $750 billion. In market-cap-weighted indices, such as the S&P 500 Index, Apple has a large impact on the daily movement of the index. So as Apple breaks down, so potentially goes the index with it.\nAnother technical perspective on Apple can be seen in the chart below. This is known as a quadruple top, occurring in Apple at $133 per share. Apple closed yesterday below $114 per share, down 14% from its all-time high.\nChart courtesy of Stockcharts.com. Commentary and opinions are those of Hanlon Investment Management.\nIndex investing has been all the rage for the past three to four years. Many indices are market capitalization weighted and therefore are controlled by a handful of stocks, as discussed above. These are the leadership, mega cap stocks, sometimes referred to as the generals. When the granddaddy of them all, Apple, breaks below its 200-day moving average, take note.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue ", "external_links": ["https://hanloninvest.com/market-commentary/pdf/2015-08-04%20Look%20Beyond%20Just%20Price;%20Market%20Breadth%20Is%20Weak.pdf"], "published": "2015-08-13T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:22:47.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
