Chris Hopkins This gap in the data flow is astounding to Rio's people, given the deal that delivered Vale its prize involved a proposed payment of $US2.5 billion to BSGR and its billionaire principal, Beny Steinmetz. And payments like that just do not get made without the chief executive sending more than one missive to the people involved.\nBut, as Rio's people made clear on Thursday, the problem here is that Vale's document retention program seems specifically designed not to retain data .\nThe eight critical Vale witnesses identified by Rio, including the dapper Agnelli, are no longer employed by the company. Under Vale's information management rules, the hard drives of former employees are wiped when they leave and records of their emails are transferred to tapes. Amazingly, those tapes are wiped after a year.\nLegal two-step typical in US Rio's claims of document destruction were reaffirmed in the concluding part of a legal two-step that is apparently typical of the US civil law process, given they were offered to the court in direct response to correspondence delivered by Vale to the trial judge earlier in the week.\nIn attempting to deflect further document discovery, Vale's letter identified the lack of any documentary evidence for the claims of a conspiracy between it and BSGR in the materials presented to Rio under discovery.\nVale's letter complained that Rio had indulged in misrepresentation during a recent court room conference over the state of the discovery process.\nThe document in question outlines a Vale-BSGR plan to use a Liberian railway and port to export the Guinean iron ore. Rio claims this plan was proprietary information stolen by Vale from a data room that was opened in late 2008 to allow the Brazilian company to assess whether it wanted to acquire Simandou.\nAnd, to be sure, the idea that Liberia was a potential exit point for Simandou product was new to everyone when the potential was revealed in court documents last year.\nMind you, given the staggering cost and engineering effort of building a pathway back through Guinea, the idea has compelling logic and was not totally new. BHP Billiton had contemplated the Liberian option for its Nimba project in Guinea. It is not far from Simandou and boasts the same high quality of ore. But it was always a less likely development given that it sits in a world heritage zone and the hills that host the deposit are also home to a unique species of tool-using monkey.\nBut we digress.\nRio open due to vulnerabilities Just to refresh memories here, Rio was open to any and all deals at the time because the concert of its bizarre $US38 billion acquisition of Alcan and the subsequent onset of global financial crisis had left it vulnerable to collapse.\nVale did not pursue a deal with Rio and instead opted to partner with Steinmetz, who poached half of Rio's Simandou options in 2008. At least one person involved in that deal has admitted to paying bribes to Guinea government officials and BSGR's arrangement is the subject of inquiries by both US and British anti-corruption authorities.\nAfter an inquiry, Guinea has since cancelled the transfer of the leases to Steinmetz's BSGR and Vale has lost the $500 million down payment it made to its erstwhile partner in Guinean iron ore.\nFor all that, Vale is sticking firmly to its narrative of innocence. And this week it claimed Rio had misrepresented to the court the quality and content of only documentary evidence it had produced from discovery that might support the conspiracy theory.\nOn Thursday Rio returned fire with interest. It noted that assessment of Vale materials delivered under discovery had only just started and identifying three more oddities that would indicate that a working relationship between Vale and BSGR existed well before the 2010 Simandou deal. As for the lack of documentary evidence of conspiracy at the highest levels of this deal, Rio noted:\n\"Vale cannot, on the one hand, destroy documents from key witnesses and then, on the other hand, say \"there [are] no documents supportive of Rio Tinto's allegation[s].\"\nTouche.\nTransparency hurts You have to give Orica's new chief executive Alberto Calderon his due.\nJust hours before making his maiden public address as the boss of the world's biggest exploder, Calderon spiced things up by doing what new MDs the world over do. Savvy as ever, Calderon foreshadowed post-tax asset impairments of between $1.35 billion and $1.65 billion and a profit that would fall up to 15 per cent shy of consensus forecast.\nFor good measure, the new guy also confirmed a review of a $400 million buyback that Orica can afford only because it sold its chemicals business in March for $750 million. We are betting that review translates into no buyback and Orica will hold on firmly to the $350 million that hasn't already been spent.\nAs a result, before, during and after Calderon's typically refreshing address to a 550-strong audience at the Melbourne Mining Club on Friday, Orica took an absolute beating on the sharemarket.\nBy the close of trading, with the shorts having a field day, investors had stripped a worrying $1.1 billion from Orica's market capitalisation as its share price plummeted 16.8 per cent.\nIt will, of course, escape no one's attention that Ian Smith is the former managing director of Orica and that before turning his hand to explosives he spent five years running gold miner Newcrest. Part of Smith legacy at Newcrest is $7 billion in impairments and write-offs, which result mostly from the ill-managed acquisition of the Lihir gold mine that happened under his watch.\nObviously it is unfair to suggest Smith deserves exclusive carriage of Newcrest's burden, and even more unfair to blame him for all of Orica's woes. I mean, up to $870 million of Orica's impairments flow from a flailing ground support business that was assembled largely by Smith's immediate predecessor, Graeme Leibelt, and that now sits firmly outside of Calderon's core business. At some point it will be disappeared.\nOn the other hand, up to $780 million worth of non-cash setbacks flow directly from the Smith era. What's more, the only thing that appears to have changed for the ground support business is that management and board now have a better look through at its financial performance. So everyone now knows that a business that sat in the books at maybe $1.2 billion was actually only throwing off $50 million in real cash flow.\nCalderon arrived at Orica promising stronger and more routine illumination of the business.
