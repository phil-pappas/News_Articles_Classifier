The NFU said that Asda would “pay 28p per litre to processor Arla, which will then be expected to pass this onto its British farmer suppliers”. \nMorrisons’ price increase will come into effect “later this month and through the winter,” it said. \nEarlier this week Morrisons launched a new ‘Milk for Farmers’ brand, selling its usual milk under different packaging for 10p per litre more and pledging to give the extra cash to farmers . \nThe NFU said it had been “explaining the dire straits that many farmers are facing to the public and to retailers” and had received “overwhelming public support from the general public”. \nIt said Lidl was “taking action to help ensure farmers get a fair price”, Asda had “moved to support farmers in their hour of need”, Aldi had “shown it supports the farming community” and Morrisons had “recognised the need to support the dairy sector at this difficult time”. \nMorrisons also announced plans for a new cheddar cheese line at a 34 pence premium, with the extra cash going to farmers. \nReasons for the low milk prices have been contentious. Supermarkets point to a supply glut, caused in part by Russian import restrictions. \nBut farmers have blamed supermarkets for slashing their milk prices in an attempt to compete with each other. \nDairy prices are expected to fall further following the abolition of European milk production quotas, which took effect from April. \nWhile UK production has been unconstrained by the quota system, milk production across the continent and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) is widely expected to ramp up, potentially leading to a greater volume of imports into the domestic market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T23:07:39.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
