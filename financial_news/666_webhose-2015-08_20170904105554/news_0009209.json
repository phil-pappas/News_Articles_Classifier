The focus really has to be on economic reform and increased investment,” he said. \nMr Rehn said debt and deficit rules, which he helped to enforce during his time in Brussels should be matched by policies that promoted employment growth and investment. * Why it's time for Germany to leave the eurozone * Germany's record trade surplus is a bigger threat than Greece He described Greece's third bail-out in five years as far from ideal, but added: \"it is still a better course of action than an uncontrolled Greek exit would be. The fundmanetal thing is whether Greece will now seriously be able to implement economic reforms in a way that Spain, Portugal and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) have done, and have recovered since economic reforms ... If it does this then Greece may be able to make a reasonable success of a third bail-out.\" \nAlexis Tsipras, the country's prime minister, resigned on Thursday and called a snap election , which is likely to be held on September 20. \nMr Rehn also laid out his action plan to revive the Finnish economy. The country shrank by 0.4pc in the second quarter, as it continues to suffer from the decline of Russia, Nokia (Milan: 23568.MI - news ) and the country’s paper industry. \nMr Rehn said it was a “close call” whether Finland would remain in recession for a fourth year. “This year we’ll have close to zero growth but we expect next year onwards we will return to positive growth,” he said. \n• How sleepy Finland could tear apart the euro project • Marathon man faces long haul with eurozone's other straggler \nHe said Finland’s recovery would be based on the “three pillars” of making Finnish businesses competitive again “by introducing a social contract between the trade unions an employers”, stabilising the country’s public finances over the medium term and encouraging private investment in new areas such as green growth and renewable energy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T00:18:35.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
