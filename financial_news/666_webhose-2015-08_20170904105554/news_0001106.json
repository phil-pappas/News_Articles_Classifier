It will ensure that his party is seen as the friend of the working poor, they argue, and further reduce Labour’s appeal. While I don’t necessarily disagree with the politics, I have been one of the few dissenting voices: my argument is that the hike will cost tens of thousands of jobs, a price that is simply not worth paying. \nEmployers will recruit workers if they believe that the cost of doing so is lower than the extra revenues generated. If the minimum wage is too high, the calculation will switch in favour of not hiring the worker: nobody will recruit somebody who costs more than he or she generates. A very low minimum wage doesn’t make much of a difference, of course, especially if younger workers are wholly or partly exempt. The issue is fundamentally one of level. \nMr Osborne’s decision to introduce his national living wage is undoubtedly inspired by a similar pro-minimum wage movement in the US. But he should study carefully the impact of the American experiment. From a minimum wage to the National Living Wage Year National Minimum Wage (July 2015) 6.50 2020 9.00 \nTake recent events in Seattle, chronicled brilliantly, as ever, by Mark J Perry for the American Enterprise Institute. Last June, the council adopted a 58pc hike in the minimum wage to $15 (£9.61) by 2017, with as a first step an increase to $11 in April, up from $9.47 per hour in January. \nThe impact on restaurant jobs – an industry that tends to be affected most harshly by increases in the minimum wage – has been stark. Around 1,300 net jobs were lost in that industry between January and June, Perry says, the greatest decline since 2009, when the US was in crisis. Around 1,000 restaurant jobs were lost in May alone following the minimum wage increase in April, also the largest one month decline since January 2009, again during the Great Recession. \nBy contrast, the total number of restaurant jobs across the US grew by 130,700 during the same period, while restaurant jobs across Washington state but excluding Seattle grew by 2,800. \nThis looks like a policy that is almost designed to kill a lot of jobs, with many more casualties to come as the rest of the increases are rolled out. It is possible, of course, that the impact will partly be cushioned through higher prices to consumers, but this is an area where customers are often poor and very price-sensitive. They may eat out less if prices go up. \nThe Seattle case seems pretty clear cut. Yet it is usually notoriously hard to estimate the exact impact of steep rises in the minimum wage. Increasing the cost of labour by more than the rise in productivity will, all other things being equal, reduce employment, and I’m in no doubt whatsoever that Mr Osborne’s policy will destroy many jobs here in Britain. \nBut there are, in the real world, myriad interrelated variables at play which make it hard even for sophisticated econometricians to unambiguously calculate the extent of the job destruction that follows major rises in the minimum wage. Boosting wage costs often leads to commensurate reduction in non-wage costs: companies cut back on training, for example, or force employees to buy their own uniforms. \nSo higher wages can mean unchanged labour costs. It may be that a higher minimum wage incentivises bosses to supervise their staff more closely, wringing out additional productivity gains, which could cancel out any increase in the unit cost, but equally it is hard to see why they wouldn’t want to do that anyway to make more money even in the absence of a higher wage. \nSome studies suggest that employees work harder if they earn a relatively high wage but are scared of losing their job: this implies that high-unemployment nations that increase their minimum wage could sometimes see the impact on jobs reduced by a concomitant increase in worker effort. \nThe result of these and other effects are that studies often disagree about the exact impact of significantly higher statutory minimum wages. But as Minimum Wages and Employment: A Review of Evidence from the New Minimum Wage Research by David Neumark and William Wascher, a major analysis of all the main papers on the subject, rightly concluded: “A sizeable majority of the studies surveyed … give a relatively consistent (although not always statistically significant) indication of negative employment effects of minimum wages. In addition, among the papers we view as providing the most credible evidence, almost all point to negative employment effects, both for the United States as well as for many other countries.” \nThe paper argued there was no credible evidence that minimum wages could boost employment, and that the research shows clearly that the least-skilled suffered the most from job losses. \nSome academics disagree, of course, but to me it is clear that George Osborne’s massive hike in the minimum wage will exclude a significant number of people from the world of work. There is a view that this might be a worthwhile trade-off: if millions are paid more, does it really matter if a few can’t find gainful employment any longer? Again, I disagree: there is nothing more cruel than freezing out the young, the unskilled, the inexperienced or the aspiring migrant from the chance of employment. \nBeing permanently jobless is a terrible, heart-wrenching state; the Government should never do anything that encourages such a catastrophe. The answer to low wages is to boost productivity by improving the incentives to deepen capital and by improving education and training, not by mandating unaffordable wage increases. \nallister.heath@telegraph.co.uk Digital Overlord to iCup Technician: here are some of the wackiest job titles out there Botox, beer and bowling: the bargains people are Google searching for around the UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:04:06.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
