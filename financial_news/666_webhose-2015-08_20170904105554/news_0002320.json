Picture: PUXLEY MAKGATHO Related articles NEWS ANALYSIS: Public protector delays findings of Prasa probe ANC MPs block bid for Madonsela appearance Madonsela adamant Zuma must pay back some of the money In this article Companies and organisations: African National Congress | Public Protector People: Baleka Mbete | Thuli Madonsela THE bickering and the attacks on Public Protector Thuli Madonsela over her office’s report on Nkandla have caused a \"worrying defiant trend\" among state officials, she said on Monday.\nMs Madonsela has been at the centre of a storm over her findings that President Jacob Zuma had unduly benefited from the upgrades to his private residence at Nkandla. Even the title of the report, Secure in Comfort, has been attacked by African National Congress MPs.\nBut a parliamentary ad hoc committee refused to give Ms Madonsela a chance to appear before it and respond to criticism.\nMs Madonsela on Monday responded at a media briefing, during which she made direct reference to parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete.\nMs Madonsela told journalists she and her team were concerned that the \"safety and value\" of her office were being eroded.\nShe cited an example of an accounting officer ignoring findings against a state organ and providing her office with a two-paragraph response indicating the matter would be dealt with directly with the complainant. She also noted the refusal by Parliament to give her office much-needed resources — which was likely linked to the furore around the Nkandla upgrades.\nShe outlined 10 \"misunderstandings\" that had emerged from the work of the ad hoc committee, which had escalated after MPs visited Nkandla two weeks ago.\nAmong the 10 issues was the classification of certain items as security and nonsecurity items — she indicated that the swimming pool was, in fact, described as such in minutes of meetings held to plan the upgrades, as well as an apportionment document compiled by the then deputy public works minister.\nSimilarly, it was government officials who described the amphitheatre as having dual purposes — a gathering place and a soil retention wall.\nAlso, whether the swimming pool was dirty, or the visitors’ centre too small or not, as observed by MPs after their visit to Nkandla, was irrelevant, Ms Madonsela said. Her job was to investigate whether there was the necessary authority to construct the items, and the maintenance of these items was not part of her job.\nMs Madonsela said she was \"deeply saddened\" that she had been forced to use the media as a platform to address the issues raised about her report.\nShe was speaking two months before her office turns 20 and noted the \"vitriolic attacks\" by politicians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:58:41.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
