The competitiveness of any bank depends on how low it is able to keep cost of funds. The most important component of this is the so-called CASA, where CA stands for current account and SA, for savings account. These deposits are called low-cost since banks do not pay any interest on current account deposits. On savings accounts, most banks barring Yes Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank pay 4% interest. A recent study by Nomura shows that state-run banks are not only plagued by bad loans, but also sliding CASA. Current accounts have grown at a slower pace with depositors reluctant to park surplus funds. In savings account, individuals have contributed the most with 77% share followed by SME and trusts. A report by Nomura says CASA growth has moderated from 20% on CAGR in fiscal 2008. Although savings account growth is keeping pace with overall deposit expansion at 14% CAGR, the current account growth continues to dip. Changes in incremental current account and savings account share are the most notable. Over the past two years, private banks accounted for 60% of incremental current account deposits with just 20% of total deposit share. The incremental savings account share of private banks increased to 28% in FY13-15 versus 24% in FY11-13.
