Prosecutors confirmed they had \"received a full file of evidence for consideration of corporate liability charges\" relating to phone hacking. \nA decision about whether to prosecute rests with Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders. \nMeanwhile, the Financial Times reported that former News of the World editor Brooks, who quit News Corp when the hacking scandal broke four years ago, would return to head Murdoch's British newspaper division, which includes the Times, Sunday Times and The Sun newspapers. \nNews Corp confirmed holding talks with 47-year-old Brooks but said it had no announcement. \nMurdoch shut down the News of the World, Britain's top-selling newspaper, in July 2011 after the revelation that it had hacked into the phone of a 13-year-old murder victim. \nBrooks, a close confidante of Murdoch and a friend of British Prime Minister David Cameron, was acquitted last year after an eight-month trial of charges relating to phone hacking, bribery and hiding evidence from police. \nHer former deputy Andy Coulson, who succeeded her as News of the World editor, was convicted of conspiring to hack phones and jailed. \nSeveral other former News of the World staff were also convicted of eavesdropping on the voicemails of celebrities, royals, politicians and crime victims. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T00:10:37.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
