However, a false head & shoulders pattern break to the downside last Friday keeps the index in a positive near-term technical position heading into the data. The index has failed several times over the past few weeks to close above the 78.6% retracement of the April/May range around 12,050 and this remains a clear hurdle to a more important run higher in the buck. If we do ever get that elusive daily close above 12,050 we would expect a re-test of the April highs in relative short order. Any weakness below last week’s low around 11,965 would warn that USD is rolling over and signal a deeper correction is about to unfold.
