Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Unions will apply to have Dyson Heydon removed as head of the Royal Commission Into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, as video emerged of him criticising the Rudd Government for tending to do \"non-substantive things\".\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver said on Wednesday that unions would proceed with an application on Friday to have Mr Heydon disqualify himself.\nMr Heydon faces allegations of bias, conflict and incompetence for accepting an invitation to give the annual Sir Garfield Barwick address , an event which doubled as a NSW Liberal Party fundraiser, while leading a commission which the labour movement had already called an $80 million political witch-hunt.\nMr Oliver said the ACTU had decided to proceed because Prime Minister Tony Abbott had refused its calls to shut down the commission.\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver said his union body had decided to proceed because Prime Minister Tony Abbott had refused its calls to shut down the commission. ​``Given Tony Abbott has failed to act, the ACTU must now take further action,\" he said.\n``The ACTU again calls on the Prime Minister Tony Abbott to shut down the Royal Commission into Trade Unions and to stop wasting millions of tax payer dollars pursuing his own political agenda.\"\nIn a roundtable on charity regulation convened by the Centre for Independent Studies in June 2013, Mr Heydon questioned the former Rudd Government's proposed changes to the charities sector.\n\"Let me just ask what is the point of the Charities Bill 2013? Why seek to enact it just before an election at a time when the government is borrowing $1 billion a week just to pay the public service?\" Mr Heydon said in a video published by Fairfax Media on Wednesday.\n \"Is it an illustration of the fact that the tendency of the Rudd government to do non-substantive things like make speeches, and appoint committees and hold summits and so forth, survived even after Mr Rudd ceased to be prime minister? Or is it just really the production of some boffins in the Treasury or some other department?\"\nQuestioned about the comments by Labor in parliament, Mr Abbott said \"that's the best thing that's ever been seen said about the Rudd Government\".\nMr Abbott said rather than Mr Heydon's comments being evidence of bias, they were \"evidence of gentle tolerance of the most incompetent government in Australian history\".\nThe Abbott Government's Senate leader, Eric Abetz, accused the ALP and unions of spewing forth \"venom and hatred\" at Mr Heydon because he has uncovered union scandals.\nSenator Abetz told the ABC's AM program on Wednesday that the whole issue was \"literally about a non-event\" as Mr Heydon withdrew from the Liberal event.\nHe said the commission had \"flushed out\" evidence about the conduct of Labor leader Bill Shorten and Cesar Melhem, the former Victorian secretary of the Australian Workers Union.\n\"This is venom and hatred being spewed forth by Labor and the trade union movement against the messenger who is uncovering scandal after scandal,\" Senator Abetz said.\nHe said he did not know why the Liberal party branch invited Mr Heydon to make the address.\n``As soon as Mr Heydon became aware that he had overlooked the type of function it was, he immediately withdrew before it even hit the media,\" he said.\nSenator Abetz said the Senate should not be ruling on the legal test for apprehended bias.\n``Can I say that should not be determined by a kangaroo court in the Senate where the chief prosecutor is Senator Wong, a former CFMEU employee herself hardly coming with clear mind to this issue.\"\nHe denied the controversy would undermine the finings of the commission.\nMeanwhile, Mr Heydon, through a spokesman, refused on Wednesday to comment on reports that the royal commissioner was being paid more than $3,000 a day. The Herald Sun reported on Wednesday that ``cabinet submissions\" show Mr Heydon is being `paid a daily rate in excess of $3,000\".\nThe Government has continually refused to state how much Mr Heydon is being paid. Attorney-General, George Brandis told parliament on Wednesday that the information about Mr Heydon's salary was commercial in confidence.\n​The commission said on Wednesday that its expenditure had reached $28 million by June 30 this year, with the amount including fees paid to Mr Heydon​ and counsel assisting the commission. It operational budget is $61 million over two years", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-19T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:03:52.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
