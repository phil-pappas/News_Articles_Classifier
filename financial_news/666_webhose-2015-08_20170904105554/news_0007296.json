Small players without enough spectrum (less than 5MHz) can provide advanced mobile technologies namely 3G/4G. Sharing will also benefit players looking for additional spectrum to augment their current holdings,” it said.\nHowever, the sharing of liberalised/auction allocated spectrum with administratively allocated spectrum is a roadblock.\nAn operator needs to pay one-time spectrum charges to liberalise his administratively allocated spectrum block, it added. Ind-Ra expects most action in the 800MHz and 1,800MHz bands as they have the capability to provide 4G services over 5MHz contiguous blocks.\nBroadband base in India is growing and there is increasing demand for spectrum to support growing data volumes over wireless mobile network.\nIndia has more than 85 per cent of its broadband subscriber base on wireless network.\n“This is unique to India (with global average being below 50 per cent) and therefore demands higher spectrum,” Ind-Ra said.\n 21, 2015 2:26 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:20:11.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
