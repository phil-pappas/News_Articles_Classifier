You may downplay your propensities by claiming that you just like to keep close tabs on your team, but that's a poor excuse for excessive meddling. How can you give your people the space they need to succeed and learn? How should you prioritise? And how do you get comfortable stepping back?\nWhat the experts say If you're the kind of boss who lasers-in on details, prefers to be included on emails and is rarely satisfied with your team's work, then you're a micromanager.\n\"For the sake of your team, you need to stop,\" says Muriel Maignan Wilkins, managing partner of Paravis Partners, an executive coaching and leadership development firm.\n\"Micromanaging dents your team's morale by establishing a tone of mistrust – and it limits your team's capacity to grow. It also hampers your ability to focus on what's really important, adds Karen Dillon, author of the HBR Guide to Office Politics .\nAs hard as it may be to change your ways, the \"challenge is one that will pay off in the long run\", says Jennifer Chatman, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business. \"There may be a few failures as your team learns to step up, but ultimately they will perform much, much better with greater accountability and less interference.\" Here are some pointers on how to let go.\nReflect on your behaviour The first step is to develop an awareness of why you micromanage. \"Most likely it's because of some insecurity - you're afraid it will reflect badly on you if your team doesn't do something exactly the way you would do it or you're worried you'll look out of touch if you're not immersed in the details, so you overcompensate,\" Dillon says. Wilkins recommends you ask yourself: What excuses am I using to micromanage?\n Get feedback \"Often there is a significant disconnect between what leaders intend and what the team is actually experiencing,\" says Chatman. \"Feedback is essential to see how significant the issue is.\"\nTo get a handle on what your direct reports really think and whether it lines up with your intentions, she recommends gathering confidential data from your people – or better yet, have a third party do it.\nWhat you hear may be sobering, \"but it's critical to understanding the broader patterns and reactions and the impact [your micromanaging has] on your team,\" she says.\nPrioritise what matters \"A good manager trains and delegates,\" says Dillon, and you can't do that if you're taking on everything yourself. Determine what work is critical for you to be involved in and what isn't.\nYou should also highlight the priorities on your to-do list, meaning \"the big-ticket items where you truly add value,\" and ensure you are \"spending most of your energy\" on them, Wilkins says.\nTalk to your team Once you've determined your priorities, the next step is communicating them to your team. \"Have a conversation about the things that really matter to you - the things that they'll need to seek your guidance and approval on – so your direct reports can get ahead of your anxiety,\" Dillon says. Tell them how you'd like to be kept in the loop and how often they should provide status updates.\n\"Be explicit with your direct reports about the level of detail you will engage in,\" adds Wilkins. At the same time, enlist their help to make sure you don't fall back into your old micromanaging ways.\nStep back slowly Fighting your micromanaging impulses might be hard at first. \"Do a test run on a project that is a bit less urgent and give your team full accountability and see how it goes,\" Chatman says. \"Recognise that your way is not the only, or even necessarily, the best way.\"\nThe test of leadership, she says, \"is how well the team does when you're gone.\"\nAnother way to ease out of micromanaging is to discretely seek feedback from other co-workers about how your team is operating, says Dillon. \"Ask a colleague you trust: 'How's that project going?'\"\nBuild trust Your team members may want to come to you for approval before taking charge of a project. \"Acknowledge this is a growth opportunity for the person and say that you know in your heart of hearts he will rise to the challenge,\" says Dillon. This is more than a pep talk. You're in effect \"giving your employee the psychological power to lead.\"\nAnd then, \"walk the talk,\" Wilkins says. Don't excessively scrutinize. Don't insist on being included on every email. And don't renege on your vote of confidence. \"Let them do it and don't back-pedal and change everything they did.\"\nIf things don't go exactly as you'd like, try your hardest not to overact. Take a breath; go for a walk; do whatever you need to do to come \"back from that agitated micro-managerial moment,\" says Dillon. After all, does it really matter if the memo isn't formatted exactly to your liking? \"For most things, nothing is so bad it can't be corrected.\"\nKnow your employees' limitations Keeping a closer eye on certain projects or certain employees is sometimes warranted, Dillon says. Similarly, Wilkins says \"when the deliverable is urgent and high stakes\" it may make sense to intervene or ask to be kept regularly apprised of things.\n\"In this case, it's helpful if you explain to the person why you are being so hands-on,\" she says. \"You should also give feedback to the employee and coach them, so they can complete the task on their own over time.\"\nPrinciples to remember Do:\nAsk yourself why you micromanage and reflect on your need for control. Refine your to-do list by prioritising the tasks and projects that matter most to you. Talk to your team about how you'd like to be kept apprised of their progress. Don't:\nRenege on your vote of confidence – tell your reports you trust them and let them do their jobs. Overact when things don't go exactly as you'd like them to – take a breath and figure out a way to correct the situation if it's truly necessary. Go too far – you don't want to become a hands-off boss.
