Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Michael Smith DP World Australia has secured a victory in its battle with the Port of Melbourne over a proposed 750 per cent rent increase after negotiating a deal which will see prices rise by a fraction of that amount.\nThe Victorian government is expected to announce details of an agreement, which clears the way for the port to be privatised, this week.\nSources said DP World is to pay around $25 to $29 per square metre at the country's busiest container terminal under the new deal which has been the source of a bitter dispute between the stevedoring industry and the port.\nIt is believed DP World previously paid $16-$18 per square metre. The Port of Melbourne's proposed increase would have taken this up to $120 per square metre.\nDP World chief Paul Scurrah had strongly opposed the proposed increase at the port, which is the in the process of being privatised, warning it would lead to job losses.\nAsciano, the owner of stevedore Patrick Corp, was also affected by the rent hike but not until next year.\nThe agreement clears uncertainty surrounding the privatisation process and enables potential bidders to put a dollar value on the asset. The new agreement is a backdown by the Victorian government.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has been worried by reports that the massive increase in DP World's proposed rent is based on a new rental agreement made with Philippines-based International Container Terminal Services (ICTS), when it was awarded the rights to operate Melbourne's third container terminal in May 2014.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...
