At the same time, Bengaluru and Chandigarh rank high in terms of job opportunities and consumption, but low on financial infrastructure. This indicates that while the top cities are moving faster on creating job opportunities, they are unable to add financial infrastructure at a similar pace, according to a report India’s Urbanization–Tide Turning , by Morgan Stanley India Co. Pvt. Ltd, as part of its series called AlphaWise Evidence Series. The index has been constructed using consumption patterns in the top 200 Indian cities by population.\nThe index measures financial infrastructure as the sum of ATMs and bank branches by the total income of the city. Cities with high total income will need more ATMs and bank branches. But the study suggests otherwise. For instance, though Coimbatore generates Rs. 17 for every Rs. 100 earned in Bengaluru, but it has 27 ATMs and branches versus 100 in Bengaluru, leading to better financial penetration.\nIn terms of urban consumption, it was found that even as the consumption index and job opportunities index exhibited sequential improvement in growth, financial penetration slowed significantly, thus pulling down the overall index growth. The index growth decelerated sequentially to 5% for the six-month period ending March 2015 versus 8% growth in the March-September 2014 period and 12% growth in the September 2013-March 2014 period. The job opportunities and consumption indices were up 7.8% and 5%, respectively, for the six months ending March 2015 versus 5% and 3% growth during the previous six months. However, financial infrastructure growth slowed to 2%—the slowest since March 2011—versus 14% growth in the previous six months.\nSubhrata Jana/Mint\nAmong the top 50 cities by population that form the basis of the index, Chandigarh and Raipur are top-ranked in consumption index, Bengaluru and Pune lead in job opportunities, and Nashik and Varanasi rank at the top in terms of financial infrastructure.\nWhile the six-month period ending March 2015 showed slow growth in financial penetration, growth in this index has outpaced that of other indices since 2011. ATMs have been the key driver for the strong growth, according to the report. The ATM to bank ratio rose to 1.34-times from 0.8-times since March 2011 for the top 50 cities. The overall ratio for the top 200 cities has moved to 1.2-times from 0.7-times.\nE dited excerpts from India’s Urbanization–Tide Turning, by Morgan Stanley India .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T02:26:57.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
