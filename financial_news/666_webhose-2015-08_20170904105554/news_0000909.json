The judge said that Dallas Buyers Club LLC had sought amounts far in excess of what was a permissible demand. Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin The 4726 customers of internet providers iiNet, Internode, Adam Internet, Dodo, Wideband and Amnet Broadband who illegally downloaded the Hollywood blockbuster Dallas Buyers Club have won a reprieve from the Federal Court of Australia, after the court found that the company who owns the rights to the movie is engaged in \"speculative invoicing\".\nIn a big win for downloaders, Justice Nye Perram said the company that owns the rights is entitled only to demand the cost of buying the film and a proportion of their legal costs, likely to amount to less than a few hundred dollars. The Hollywood company was seeking to demand thousands of dollars in damages based on a complicated formula based on how many copies of the film had been downloaded and whether it had been shared with others.\nThe practice of speculative invoicing has occurred overseas, where alleged copyright infringers receive legal demands for large amounts of money to settle, or a threat that they will face court.\nIn early April, the Federal Court ordered the internet providers hand over the personal details of customers who allegedly downloaded the film.\nBut Justice Perram said he wanted to approve the letter before he would lift his orders and the demands were sent.\nHowever, in his decision handed down on Friday morning, he said that Dallas Buyers Club LLC had sought amounts far in excess of what was a permissible demand.\n\"This brought forth the first draft letter,\" Justice Perram wrote. \"There is no need to set it out. It was quite long and, on the whole, negative about people copying the film, which is hardly surprising. Critically, however, it did not make any demand for a sum of money. Instead, it encouraged recipients to make a telephone call to discuss the matter or to engage in email correspondence with an unidentified representative of DBC.\"\nThe judge then went back to the company to seek to have them set out a demand for a quantified amount of money but ruled on Friday those demands went too far.\n \"A written submission was then prepared by DBC which set out in some detail what DBC was going to demand as a matter of money.\n\"I will not publish the actual figures that DBC proposes to demand for the confidentiality reasons I have just mentioned\n\"However, I do not think that claims (b) and (c) are within the purposes for which the power in r 7.22 can be used,\" the judge ruled.\nThat is, the judge said the company cannot claim \"an amount relating to each infringers' uploading activities\" or \"additional damages ... depending on how many copies of other copyrighted works had been downloaded by each infringer\".\nThe judge ruled that he will allow the letters to be sent if the company pays a $600,000 bond and agrees to only demand \"a claim for the cost of an actual purchase of a single copy of the film\" and \"a claim for damages arising from the amount of money it has cost DBC to obtain each infringer's name.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-08-14T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:09:40.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
