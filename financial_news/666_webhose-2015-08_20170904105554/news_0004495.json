David Clemson Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The success of industry super funds can be attributed to a combination of the age of members, generous cash flow and some fortuitous market conditions, experts say.\nIndustry Super Australia economist Stephen Anthony sparked debate over which super funds are best for the economy by claiming self-managed and retail funds were too obsessed with short-term gain.\nEconomics professor Rod Maddock, a former Business Council of Australia chief economist and Commonwealth Bank executive, said the age of members played a big role in how a fund could invest.\n\"Industry super funds have a whole lot of clients who are very young and hence have got very long investment horizons,\" he said.\n\"That's why they can afford to be patient\".\nSMSF members older Conversely, members of self-managed and retail funds tend to be older, richer and more inclined to switch funds, according to Professor Maddock.\nAs a result these funds were necessarily focused on shorter-term performance and liquidity, he said.\n \"These funds have clients who are much closer to retirement,\" he said.\n\"Hence they manage their money differently. If you think you might need the money in two years time you manage it different to if you need it in 32 years time.\n\"They tend to hold quite a lot of cash and quite a lot of Australian shares, whereas normally a diversified portfolio would have a fair bit of exposure outside Australia.\"\nOn the other hand, industry funds have tended to invest more heavily in alternative assets such as infrastructure, unlisted property and private equity, which require longer investment timeframes.\nMr Anthony accused self-managed funds of being \"in a flight to short-termism\" by favouring Australian equities over nation-building infrastructure investment. He put retail funds in the same boat.\nAustralian Prudential Authority figures show industry funds hold 20 per cent of their funds under management in unlisted assets, compared to 6 per cent across retail funds.\nMonopoly 'cash flow' Rice Warner chief executive Michael Rice said guaranteed cash flow via government-mandated super contributions gave industry funds greater investment latitude.\n\"Because the industry funds have got this huge monopoly cash flow from the employer-guaranteed super they can invest in infrastructure, direct property and the like because they don't need to worry about liquidity,\" he said.\n\"Aussie Super's cash flow is about $5 billion a year now so if a member leaves or changes the investment option, the payment can be done out of cash flow and they don't need to redeem assets.\n\"Whereas if you're with one of the retail investment platforms such as BT or Colonial, each of those options has to be looked at in isolation. Each option needs its own liquidity as members can opt out at any time.\"\nFortunately for industry funds, market conditions have been kind to their particular brand of asset mix.\nGap narrows Chant West investment research manager Mano Mohankumar said over the past 15 years industry funds had been a long way ahead of retail funds, but the gap was narrowing.\n\"That 15-year period includes two major sharemarket downturns â€“ the tech wreck of the early 2000s and also the GFC,\" he said.\n\"During those periods, retail funds have had a higher allocation to listed shares and listed property, which were hit the hardest.\n\"Post-GFC we've had listed markets performing very well so that's definitely helped the retail funds.\n\"They've additionally ramped up their allocation to alternative assets.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-08-05T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:17:54.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
