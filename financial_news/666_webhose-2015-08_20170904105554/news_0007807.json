It mirrored a dip on the rival EBS platform, owned by the world's largest inter-dealer broker, ICAP (Amsterdam: IA6.AS - news ) . \nTrading volumes on the EBS trading platform fell by a fifth last month, dropping to an average of $82 billion a day from $101 billion in June. \nTrading on EBS - the main venue for banks and other major institutions to trade the euro, yen and Swiss franc against the dollar - was still up 16 percent on a year ago, when the platform was just emerging from a prolonged drop in volumes.
