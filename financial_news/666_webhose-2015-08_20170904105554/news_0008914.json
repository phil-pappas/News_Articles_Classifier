Wage growth ticked up by a lackluster 0.2%. Markets greeted the data with relative indifference with the dollar weakening slightly across the board and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending the day flat.\"We don't believe the Fed is going to raise interest rates in September,\" said Yuri Abe, senior economist with Garrett Knight Associates. \"They have less reason to do so now than they did at the beginning of 2015 when economic growth had a better aggregate read than it does now. The recovery is running on the fumes of the last round of quantitative easing and that's being reflected in the data.\"The July data showed little sign of deviating from the composition trends that have become hallmarks of the jobs recovery in the United States showing a marked bias towards temporary, part time roles in service-oriented sectors like retail and healthcare.\"There is an abundance of anecdotal evidence which suggests that many Americans are having to hold 2 or 3 part-time jobs in order to make ends meet and this is at the heart of the Fed's apparent reluctance to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade,\" added Abe. Garrett Knight Associates says it is acquiring precious metals in anticipation of gradual change in the prevailing narrative which points to an extension of dollar strength.
