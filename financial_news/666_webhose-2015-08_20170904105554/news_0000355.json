But it had kept its rate static for five years, at 13.49 per cent, despite the historic drop in the cash rate. And that still made it poor value. \nMs Turner advised people to seek a better deal through credit unions and smaller lenders, saying the best rate available was 8.99 per cent offered by Community First Credit Union. \n\"Don't trust the big banks when it comes to credit card marketing,\" she said. \n\"Credit cards are high cost products and if you have a card with a big bank you'll pay up big in interest and fees,\" she said. \nTHE FACTS ON YOUR PLASTIC \n* 40pct of credit cards have an intro offer (either a discounted purchase rate or annual fee) \n* 0pct purchase rate offers were often the more expensive down the track \n* Only five of the top 20 lowest cost credit cards have an intro offer \n* On average, a credit card costs $685 to maintain each year \n* The average credit card rate is currently 17.57pct (lowest is 8.99pct, highest is 23.5pct) \n* There are almost twice as many intro purchase rate offers than in 2011 \n(Source: Mozo) @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Related Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T09:14:20.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
