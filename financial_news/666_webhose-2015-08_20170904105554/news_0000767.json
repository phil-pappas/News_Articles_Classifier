Morgan Private Bank in New York said of the July U.S. payrolls report.\nThe prospect of higher U.S. interest rates has made the dollar significantly more attractive to investors in the past year which in turn has lowered demand for commodities and crimped U.S. corporate earnings from exports.\nThe U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of euro, yen and four other currencies, reached 98.334, its highest since late April before turning lower to 97.788, down 0.05 percent from Thursday.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,297.68, the S&P 500 decreased 13.45 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,070.11 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 41.30 points, or 0.82 percent, to 5,015.14.\nEuropean's top shares fell 0.9 percent at 1,574.99 after data showed German exports and industrial output falling in June, a setback that underlined the need for central bank stimulus in the euro zone.\nTokyo's Nikkei ended up 0.3 percent.\nThe MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 45 nations, fell 2.09 points or 0.49 percent, to 421.1.\nIn debt markets, the U.S. yield curve flattened as longer-dated bond prices rose with traders believing a possible Fed rate hike would erode the value of shorter maturity debt faster than longer dated bonds.\nShort term interest rate markets signaled traders were pricing higher the chances the U.S. central bank would end its near zero rate policy at its September, but it remained a close call.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries notes were up 12/32 in price for a yield of 2.189 percent, down four basis points from Thursday, while two-year notes slipped 1/32 for a 0.725 percent, up nearly two basis points.\nOil prices remained under pressure Friday morning, but gold bucked the trend although by not enough to see the precious metal avoid its longest weekly losing streak since 1999.\nOil faced its sixth consecutive week of losses, the longest run since the start of the year. Brent crude was last down 79 cents, or down 1.6 percent, at $48.73 a barrel. U.S. crude was last down 53 cents, or down 1.19 percent, at $44.13 per barrel.\nSpot gold prices rose $7.09 or 0.65 percent, to $1,096.10 an ounce, rebounding from an earlier low of $1,082.76.
