Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nBank loans to property investors grew at twice the banking regulators' 10 per cent annual growth limit in the past year, according to quarterly property exposure data.\nHowever, figures due out on Monday are expected to show a sharp reverse.\nInvestor loan exposures of banks were 19 per cent higher in June compared with a year earlier, according to the data released by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Loans to owner occupiers grew just 2.5 per cent over the year to June.\nIn June, banks with loan books above $1 billion had $507.4 billion worth of investor home loans compared to $426 billion in June 2014.\nAdvertisement Interest only loans, the growth of which has also alarmed regulators, grew more than 20 per cent, to $512 billion, reaching 40 per cent of the roughly $1.3 trillion of home loans compared to 35 per cent in June 2014. These mainly go to investors.\nThe jump in both loan categories was primarily due to a dramatic lift in loans to investor in the September quarter of 2014 and in the December quarter for interest only loans. Investor home loans rose more than 8 per cent between June and September, equating to an annualised rate of 32 per cent. Interest only loans rose almost 9 per cent between September and December, or an annualised rate of 35 per cent.\nThis dropped to 3.4 per cent in the December quarter, 2.7 per cent in the March quarter 2015, but was back up again to 3.4 per cent in the June quarter. This reflects an annualised rate of 10.3 per cent to 13.6 per cent.\nAPRA has been monitoring growth rates since December. It wants banks to keep total investor loan growth at 10 per cent for 2015.\nHowever, the figures may also reflect revisions by several banks to their loan statistics. On Tuesday NAB reduced the number of owner occupier loans it has written by almost $40 billion to $126.5 billion and increased its housing investor loans from $66.6 billion to $93 billion. The change means the proportion of its home loans going to investors jumps from around 28 per cent to more than 42 per cent.\nANZ Bank made similar revisions several weeks ago, but NAB already had the fastest growth of the big banks in loans to landlords. However, while the NAB changes alter the proportion of loans, it may not change the growth rate. It is understood bank loan statistics for July out on Monday will show a reduction in its growth rate.\nNAB's changes will appear in APRA's the loan figures for July on Monday.\nIn July, most banks increased interest rates on investor loans, upped the deposit needed to get an investor loan and began assessing every loan a borrower has to ensure they can repay the loan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T05:39:11.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
