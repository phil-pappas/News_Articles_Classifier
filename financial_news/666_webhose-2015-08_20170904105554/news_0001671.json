A daily close below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 1.2956 exposes the 38.2% level at 1.2798. Alternatively, a move above the 14.6% Fib expansion at 1.3109 opens the door for a challenge of the 23.6% threshold at 1.3207. Prices are too close to resistance to justify entering long from a risk/reward perspective. On the other hand, the absence of a defined bearish reversal signal suggests that taking up the short side is premature. With that in mind, we will remain flat for now.
