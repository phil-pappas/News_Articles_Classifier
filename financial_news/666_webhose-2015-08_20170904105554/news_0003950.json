Many say they are struggling to survive, having gone for 14 months without pay. \nThe diplomat we spoke to who asked not to be named fearing victimisation explained: \"We have had families separated, wives/husbands and children are in Zimbabwe because we cannot afford the fees abroad. \n\"I personally have been limping along because of the little which is coming from rentals of my small house in Harare. \n\"But you can imagine the problems as the tenant is also failing to pay on time because of the harsh economic environment back home.\" \nWorst affected are diplomats posted to missions in the more expensive Western countries. \n\"My brother, we are sinking in debt; those serving in some European and North American countries are wallowing in debt (credit cards) which are not being serviced, debt collectors are after them,\" said our source. \nNewZimbabwe.com checked with other embassies were officials were prepared to talk on condition they are not named and the tales of woe appeared to be as global as the country's diplomatic footprint. \nIn some cases, heads of missions have been forced to use personal funds to pay their own rentals as well as help struggling members of staff with \"parents' funerals, medical expenses, school fees\". \nNewZimbabwe.com was told that, in one case the wife of an ambassador was forced to give cookery classes in order to raise money for their own domestic expenses. \n\"I hear one mission's electricity is now cut,\" one official said. \n\"Sadly, we continue to pump out rents for nearly all properties, despite policy to purchase, as there is never enough money for capital expenditure - but after a few years we have paid entire purchase price those properties!\" \nEfforts to contact foreign affairs minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi were unsuccessful as he is attending the SADC summit with Mugabe in Botswana. Foreign affairs secretary Joey Bimha was also not available. \nHowever, in March this year, Bimha conceded that the situation was bad. \nHe told legislators that government owed foreign embassy staff $6,6 million in salary arrears up to December 2014, $32,6 million arrears for operational expenses, and $376 900 in school fees refunds for children of staff at the 46 diplomatic missions and consulates. \nBut staff at the missions blamed Bimha and top officials at head office in Harare for the crisis. \nSaid one of the envoys we spoke to: \"It is our understanding that Treasury regularly releases money for diplomats' salaries. \n\"But because these salaries are remitted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary for that Ministry Mr Bimha and the Director of Finance Mrs Mudambo take upon themselves to high jack that money and divert it to cover running expenses at Head Office and at Missions, including the payment of rentals and other utilities.\" \nHe added: \"Our appeals for payment seem to have fallen on deaf ears as it quite apparent that no one cares for us anymore. \n\"The Ministry has the audacity to buy new cars for the Secretary and Minister every year while we wallop in poverty in these foreign lands. \n\"To verify the points I have raised, I would be happy if you got in touch with Mr Bimha and Mrs Mudambo in Foreign Affairs and establish for yourself how these people are totally indifferent to our plight. \n\"They should not lie to you that Treasury has not been releasing money for our salaries, it has been and the two of them have been deciding how our salaries should be distributed to cover other expenses.\" \nIn June this year, finance ministry secretary Willard Manungo said government was concerned about the welfare of staff at the country's embassies adding their salaries who now be processed back home in Harare though Salary Services Bureau. \nHowever, it appears this is yet to be done. \n\"My personal appeal is to Minister Chinamasa to urgently stop remitting our salaries through Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but through SSB like other civil servants,\" said our source. \n\"It is no longer a secret that all diplomats are frustrated and stressed to the core. Many of want to go back home as they have served more than the stipulated four years abroad.\" Zimbabwe \nAN estimated 20 000 workers who were fired after the Supreme Court ruled that employers could terminate contracts on … see more » Copyright © 2015 New Zimbabwe.
