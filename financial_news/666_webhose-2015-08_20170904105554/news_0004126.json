BBY was placed into voluntary administration on May 18 by Marianna Papadakis Former clients of BBY are seeking to take legal action against the collapsed stockbroker, but KPMG, the administrator and now liquidator to several BBY entities, has launched its own court bid to have any legal challenges consolidated to reduce expenses.\nThe liquidators are also seeking court orders for some of BBY accounts to be consolidated for the purpose of making future distributions to creditors.\nBBY was placed into voluntary administration on May 18 after the firm fell short of minimum capital requirements in the clearing of options and was unable to repay a loan to lender St.George Bank. It also followed several skirmishes with regulators.\nKPMG was initially appointed as administrator while PPB Advisory was the receiver. KPMG is now the liquidator of several BBY entities. The firm's executive chairman Glenn Rosewall held a majority stake along with his father, tennis player Ken Rosewall. Lawyer David Perkins was also on the board.\nRoss Foreman for the liquidators put a notice to NSW Supreme Court judge Peter Brereton on Monday that it intended to send to BBY clients who were bringing separate proceedings.\nBut Justice Brereton knocked it back saying there was no point in issuing a notice until the liquidators knew what they were seeking.\nJustice Brereton said if BBY's clients were to decide whether they wanted to become involved in the proceedings, to oppose or propose a particular position, they needed to know what was being propounded.\n\"That's going to exacerbate expenses,\" he said.\n Mr Foreman said the liquidators commenced proceedings seeking to be a representative defendant because it was concerned several of BBY's former clients could bring multiple proceedings in different jurisdictions.\nHe said further notice could be provided to the court of what the liquidators' preliminary investigations into BBY's accounts so far revealed and what further investigations could expose, including whether clients segregated accounts were pooled together or dealt with by product line or individually.\nBarrister Gerald Parncutt said he represented several clients with $12 million of investments who were seeking return of trust funds.\nMr Parncutt said the clients did threaten proceedings and proceedings were now issued but appeared to be in the process of being stalled by the liquidators.\nJustice Brereton said the clients were not prevented from continuing their action or lodging a cross-claim to the liquidator's application.\nMr Foreman said the liquidators were not stalling but merely seeking for court action to be taken in an \"appropriate and orderly manner\".\nThe matter was adjourned until August 24.\nCreditors and clients that traded through BBY are scrambling to seek funds owed to them as a result of BBY's collapse which left 180 employees owed around $2.7 million, while the shortfall for clients could be around $16 million.\nIn light of the BBY collapse, ASIC has called for amendments to the Corporations Act to protect client funds in the event a firm goes bust.\nA preliminary report submitted to ASIC by then KPMG joint administrators Stephen Vaughan and Ian Hall found BBY may have been misusing client funds, misleading its lender St.George by inflating its funding requirements and trading insolvent since June 2014.\nAIMS Financial Group , led by George Wang bought the remnants of BBY, now BBY Asia Pacific Group, for between $5 million and $10 million.\nIt is understood KPMG lodged funding request with the corporate regulator to boost its recovery efforts for BBY creditors and investigations into its failure and a possible pursuit of its former directors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:06:22.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
