It expects craft beer producers to try to offset the threat posed by rising wine and cider consumption through innovative offerings and niche products such as Belgian, French and German-style craft beers. New varieties of craft beer are expected to drive increased demand, particularly specialty European styles such as saisons, an IBISWorld research report says. \"Beer drinkers are expected to place greater value on craft beers with a regional focus produced in small, seasonal batches, as opposed to easily obtainable mass-produced beers,\" it says. Craft and fruit-infused beer are tipped to demonstrate the strongest growth while foreign brands will also make increasing inroads into the market. IBISWorld senior industry analyst Ryan Lin says craft beer offerings may become even more niche. \"I believe that as consumer tastes continue to develop, a lot more premium and dietary characteristics of the products would be very important for the industry players to really capture.\" The range of low- to full-strength and low carb beers offered in mainstream beers could also be reflected in the craft segment, he says. \"Craft beer is essentially founded upon the fact that it is unique and it is different. \"Our big players, once a lot of the craft beer aspect of things become a lot more saturated in the industry, they may look towards new flavours, different ways of brewing beer, in order to attract the demand - a more different product than before.\" IBISWorld says the line between craft and mass-produced beers is slowly blurring as the industry's largest players increasingly turn to craft beers. \"It is therefore important for craft beer producers to maintain branding that appeals to their customers, at the risk of losing their credibility among an increasingly discerning target market.\" At the same time the major supermarket players Woolworths and Coles - which account for more than half of all liquor sales in Australia - are tipped to expand their own private label offerings. \"They're pitching these private label craft beers as being small, unique and something different for consumers that is accessible via their liquor stores as well,\" Mr Lin says.
