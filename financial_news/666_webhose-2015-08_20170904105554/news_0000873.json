The Summit will focus on the \"financial engineering behind deal making\" in the wealth management industry. In that vein, the keynote panel will drill deep into the dynamics of the deal, introducing two veteran RIA deal makers to join the widely regarded debate between Dan Seivert and Mark Tibergien which is now in its fourth edition. \nPeter Raimondi and Jeff Dekko are not only industry veterans, but within the last year have each guided their firms through significant transactions. Raimondi's Banyan Partners sold to Boston Private in a deal valued at $60M and Dekko's Wealth Enhancement Group sold a controlling interest to Lightyear Capital LLC -- an industry focused private equity firm that had previously invested in Cetera and divested in a sale to RCS Capital Corporation. \nIn terms of the debate, both Tibergien and Seivert are known for their high-energy back and forth, each taking an industry position (which they may or may not agree with) and rigorously defending that position while an engaged audience not only looks on, but participates by voting on which side of the argument they believe in -- it is the responsibility of the speakers to make a strong case. \n\"We are thrilled to welcome Peter and Jeff this year, not only for their acumen as deal makers but because they have so recently gone through mega-deal transactions and have such a fresh perspective,\" said Seivert. \"Mark and I have been sparring for years now and while it's always an exciting competition we're very much looking forward to adding the \"applied perspective\" by pairing with two of the industry's most respected and experienced CEOs.\" \nRaimondi will join Tibergien and together the men have 74 years of industry experience, having advised on over 100 deals combined. Dekko joins Seivert, and while the combined industry experience here may only add up to 42 years, they advised on over 300 deals and both have considerable private equity experience. Game on! \nA sampling of the six debate topics the deal makers will go head to head on: \n1. Whether allocating 25% of a roll-up firm's equity is a good or bad deal - for advisors! \n2. Whether or not a roll-up IPO spells doom for the firm's culture \n3. The pros and cons of brand unification for roll-ups \nThis year's Deals and Deal Makers Summit also includes the following sessions: The Human Dynamics of \"The Financial Deal\": Maximizing Potential While Humanizing Risks Breaking Up Is Hard to Do... Learn How To Master It Super Models: Fine Tune Your Business Model to Optimize Financial Performance The Most Powerful Trends in Wealth Management Deal Making Demystifying the Financial Engineering of Deal Makers \nThe Mission of the DDM Summit is to provide wealth managers with advanced education and training, unparalleled networking opportunities and a unique experience that stands apart from other industry conferences and workshops.
