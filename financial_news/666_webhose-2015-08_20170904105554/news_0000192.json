Mashesha \nFollowing a breakdown of the engine supplying the Nthane Cluster (Mosu, Mokubilo and Mmea villages), Mr Mokaila said the engine which was at Khwee was moved to Nthane, while a similar engine from the Rakops booster station was relocated to Khwee. \nHe said the decision was taken solely based on the fact that the engine which was at Khwee would adequately handle the large workload in Nthane than the one which was in Rakops. He said after the engine which was in Nthane was repaired and put back to use, the engine which had been moved from Khwee was returned to Khwee and was currently in operation there. \n\"This engine is in good condition and serviced regularly. The next normal service will be carried out on 7 August 2015.\" The engine, he said, was serviceable and was not yet due for replacement. \nThe MP for Boteti East, Mr Sethomo Lelatisitswe had asked the minister how WUC realised returns on their investments in RADP areas like Khwee, Mmea and Mosu in the Boteti East constituency. \nHe also wanted to know if it was true that WUC in Letlhakane removed the new engine which was watering Khwee as there was no business and replaced it with an old unserviceable one from Nthane and took the new one to Rakops where there was business. Mr Lelatisitswe also asked when the unserviceable engine in Khwee would be replaced. \nSource : Parliament", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T13:21:22.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
