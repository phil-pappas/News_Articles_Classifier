They had shaved off one percentage point off growth and contributed to South Africa’s economic contraction in the second quarter of this year, he said.\nMedupi’s first unit started contributing power during its synchronisation period from March 2 and the plant is expected to be fully operational by the first half of 2019 and contribute to one-eighth of South Africa’s total electricity capacity.\nOnce completed it will be the fourth-largest coal-fired plant and the largest dry-cooled power station in the world, the government said.\nIts planned operational life is 50 years. Eskom budgeted R105bn for the entire project but said on Sunday it would be higher due to overruns.\nAs Eskom’s creaking power stations buckle under pressure, Zuma’s government is looking to introduce 9,600 MW of nuclear energy by 2030 into its strained grid to reduce its reliance on coal-fired power.\nThe price-tag of up to $100bn for the controversial build, which aims to have the first 1,000 MW of atomic power online in eight years time, has been met with strong opposition.\nAsked about delays, Molefe said: “We are going to have strict project management principles. We have to ensure that the timelines set are adhered to.”\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:17:29.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
