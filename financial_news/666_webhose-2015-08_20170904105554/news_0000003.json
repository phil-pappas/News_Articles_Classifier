How the votes of third-placed candidate, dissident Peronist Sergio Massa, are split will be key.\nFernandez's interventionist policies have fueled one of the world's highest inflation rates, stunted investment into Latin America's No.3 economy and stalled economic growth.\n\"The bigger picture is that some form of economic adjustment post election will be inevitable,\" Edward Glossop, an economist at Capital Economics, said in an investor briefing note.\nTo win outright on Oct. 25, a candidate needs 45 percent of the vote, or 40 percent with a 10-point margin over whomever places second.
