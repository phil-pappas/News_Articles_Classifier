Louie Douvis For the blue chip holders, Rio Tinto is expected to increase its dividend the most, up 53 per cent from last year's 96¢ per share to $1.47, although lower than its February payout of $1.53.\nInterestingly, Rio Tinto's dividend payouts have triggered rallies in its share price for the past two years under chief executive Sam Walsh's tenure.\nRival BHP Billiton however is expected to keep its dividend growth on hold this year, paying out 62¢ a share.\nCSL is also expected to lift its dividend by a healthy 43 per cent, from 60¢ to 86¢. The payout seems justified given the biotechnology giant's share price crossed into the $100 mark on Tuesday , a milestone which has been charted by a 54 per cent rise in its share price in the past year alone.\n Proving some analyst's theories that Australian companies feel beholden to their yield-driven investors, the list of companies expected to boost their dividend payouts include beleaguered mining and mining services companies, including Iluka Resources, nickel miner Western Areas, Bradken Group and gold miner Northern Star Resources.\nBloomberg estimates that all of the big four banks will increase their dividends as expected, but in the shadow of looming increased capital requirements. ANZ Banking Group will increase its dividend slightly, from 95¢ to 97¢, while Commonwealth Bank shareholders will lift from $2.18 to $2.25.\nThose companies set to cut their dividends include embattled companies Arrium and Metcash, which are are forecast to cut their payouts from 2.6¢ and 6¢ to zero respectively as they struggle to turn their fortunes around and lift back into profitability.\nFortescue Metals Group and Santos are also poised for a cut as they deal with plunges in iron ore and oil prices over the past year.\nBut the list is relatively small, just 13 companies opting to cut this year. This is despite challenging conditions over the past year in light of a slow down in China's economy, a broad-based fall in commodity prices, a strengthened US dollar and an Australian economy which is yet to navigate through a post-commodity boom landscape.\nMorgan Stanley earlier this year said it expected growth in dividend payments would continue to outstrip earnings. Companies on the ASX 200 paid out a combined $90 billion in dividends in the first half of the 2015 financial year alone.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/expected_divs_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/the-graph-that-suggests-rio-tinto-shares-are-about-to-surge-20150802-giq0l2.html"], "published": "2015-08-05T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:12:59.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
