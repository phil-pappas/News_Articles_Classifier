The offshore watchdog said that output from the North Sea over the first six months of this year could be 2.5pc higher than the same period last year. \nThe UK's main producing area is the type of production which Opec had hoped would be squeezed by lower prices because of the high cost of operating offshore. Operating costs in some of the North Sea's oldest fields are estimated to be in the region of $80 per barrel. \nBrent crude dipped below $50 per barrel \nâ€œClearly the oil price which has more than halved since this time last year continues to really challenge the industry. However, [the production increase] can indeed be attributed to the effort and investment industry has put into improving the integrity and performance of UKCS assets,\" said Deirdre Michie, chief executive, Oil & Gas UK, in a statement. \nIn March, the Chancellor George Osborne offered some relief to oil and gas operators in the North Sea by cutting taxes on the region. Tax rates on production from older oil and gas fields were cut from 80pc to 75pc, falling to 67.5pc from next year. For newer fields, effective rates were trimmed from 60pc to 50pc. \nCommodities were sold down across the board with copper officially entering a bear market on concerns over stuttering Chinese economy growth. \n\"We are confident that the Chinese government and central bank will resort to further fiscal and monetary policy measures in a bid to shore up the economy,\" said Commerzbank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T09:34:00.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
