Seconds later, the rocket exploded over the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe accident, along with the failed Oct. 28 launch of an Orbital ATK Antares rocket on another station cargo run, has left the U.S. space agency dependent on Russian and Japanese freighters to resupply the station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\nSpaceX also has been cleared to compete against industry stalwart United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to fly U.S. military satellites.\nSpaceX has a backlog of nearly 50 launches, worth more than $7 billion, on its schedule.\nThe cause of the June accident is \"an easy problem to go fix,\" Shotwell said, adding that the company wanted to take extra time to \"make sure we're not seeing something like that anywhere throughout the vehicle or the supply chain.\"\nThe next mission on SpaceX's launch calendar had been a U.S. government ocean-monitoring satellite called Jason 3, but Shotwell indicated that a commercial communications satellite would move to the front of the line.\nLuxembourg-based SES SA has a contract to fly on the first Falcon 9 rocket that features an upgraded first-stage engine.\nThe upgrade will allow SpaceX to attempt to land its rockets back at the launch site from high-altitude missions so they can be refurbished and reused.\nThe Jason 3 satellite is slated to fly aboard the standard Falcon 9.
