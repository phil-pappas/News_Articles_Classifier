It has certainly increased over the last few years,\" the minister said. \n\"Australia wants foreign investment, we need foreign investment, but we need to make sure that foreign investors comply with the laws.\" \nHockey said he would introduce legislation into parliament in the coming weeks to ensure that the reporting requirements, enforcement and penalty regimes for foreign investors who broke the rules were tougher. \nAs already announced, foreigners who illegally buy Australian real estate will face up to three years in jail or fines of Aus$127,500 (US$95,000) for individuals and Aus$637,500 for companies. \nIn relation to civil penalties, investors will lose whichever is the greatest of the capital gain made on the property, 25 percent of the purchase price or 25 percent of its market value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T09:47:41.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
