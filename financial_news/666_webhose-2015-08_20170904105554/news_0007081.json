The stronger franc has hampered Switzerland's export-reliant economy, though it has depreciated slightly in recent weeks and now trades at around 1.07 francs per euro.\nSNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said the central bank's policies would help to weaken the franc over time.\n\"We do not currently see a need for change (to our policy),\" Jordan told Swiss magazine UnternehmerZeitung.\n\"Our current monetary policy is oriented towards negative interest rates and the willingness to intervene in the currency market if necessary. Both should reduce the overvaluation of the franc over time.\"\nAt the height of the Greek crisis in June, Jordan gave rare confirmation that the SNB had been active in the currency market to weaken the franc.\nThere has also been talk that the SNB is using the window of opportunity created by a summer lull in global currency markets to push down the value of the franc with less effort and at lower cost.\nThe SNB's policy of negative interest rates -- first announced in December and pushed further into negative territory in January -- aims to stem a flight into the safe-haven franc.
