Photo: Supplied\nIs casual attire the key to getting your creative juices flowing in the workplace? IT services company Interlex Solutions chief executive James Hanrahan certainly thinks so.\n\"What I believe is that if you are comfortable in your workplace – which means you dress comfortably – you feel the freedom to do your role well,\" says Hanrahan.\nHe says as long as his staff get the job done and are professional, he doesn't care what they wear to work.\n\"As long as it's practical and safe obviously, we don't care what you wear in the workplace.\"\nAdvertisement Hanrahan was in the air force for 10 years. \"I had to wear a uniform to work every day, and then I was in corporate role and I had to wear a suit to work every day.\nHe held roles at Globe International and Billabong. \"We used to wear Billabong clothes to work like shorts, shoes and T-shirts, and we were just as professional as everyone else. I got the idea back then.\"\nJudy Sahay, director of creative digital agency Crowd Media HQ, also holds the same view.\n\"The best creative processes happen when you're in a relaxed, comfortable environment,\" says Sahay.\n\"For some employees this may be influenced by the outdoor environment, office decor, workstations, and for others it's being able to wear whatever makes them comfortable. \"\nSahay says when the business started 18 months ago, they had a very corporate look with everyone from their strategist and content creators to designers dressed in corporate attire.\n\"While this look is great when you are in front of a client, it didn't make sense to have the team dress up professionally for every day of the week,\" she says.\n\"When we changed the policy, people were able to wear what they wanted, they felt more relaxed. Some came in casual, others still wanted to dress corporate. We left it to the individual to decide. It created a different atmosphere, helped with creativity and overall productivity.\"\nElena Di Fiore, owner and director of Adelaide-based firm HR Management Consulting, agrees that having a relaxed dress code can promote creativity.\n\"When you obviously have something like an informal or relaxed dress code, you empower the employee to be themselves,\" she says. By being themselves, it encourages creativity, she says.\nIt also encourages attendances rates, she says. \"In some ways employees don't like having the uniform because it means in many ways having to conform, and everyone has different drivers when it comes to going to work.\"\nDi Fiore's own business has a relaxed dress code. \"My clients appreciate it. Another advantage of my having a relaxed dress code is that in some ways you are able to relate to the client far easier.\"\nBut there are pitfalls too. Di Fiore says lack of branding for the employer is one. \"Obviously, there is a time and a place to have a relaxed dress code, in certain industries it works really well, in others it doesn't.\"\nFor instance, professional services. \"Because they have a particular image to uphold and their clients have a certain expectation, there is a bit of a perception about the person that wears a suit that they are more credible than the person wearing a more relaxed presentation.\"\nThere are work, health and safety issues to be considered too. \"If you have a relaxed dress code it is difficult from an HR perspective to manage what is suitable attire in the workplace. Someone might take it to an extreme and turn up to work in thongs or flip-flops,\" says Di Fiore.\n\"Now from a safety perspective, if you've got someone working in a warehouse, that's just not going to work. So it does become a bigger HR issue to manage where you've got a diverse workforce.\"\nFred Schebesta, co-founder of Finder.com, says dress is one way to get most people to express themselves and who they are.\n\"One of our core values is to be straight up, obviously to tell it as it is. And through doing that, I think people get that feeling of their looking to as well and they are encouraged and applauded for being themselves.\"\nSchebesta says everyone wears suits, and if you are always wearing a suit you look like everyone else.\n\"If you can dress how you want to dress, it enables you to be able to dress in a way which is personal to you and create your own personal brand,\" he says\nSchebesta recalls presenting to an important client barefoot after spending the night at the office. \"We were more busy focusing on building their business than we were on how we dressed.\"\nHe says the client appreciated that he was busy working on their business. \"It made it real for them.\"\nHanrahan says: \"I don't understand, in this day and age, why people need to wear suits to the office?\n\"It really does baffle me. I have a lot of friends and associates and peers who are three-piece suit wearers, and I always ask them why they wear a suit to work. They haven't got an answer for it.\"\nWhat do you think?
