When this is done then these financial institutions will issue sukuk\" said Frad adding aggregate issuance of Tunisian corporate sukuk could initially reach 100-150 million Tunisian dinars (51-76 million). \n\"Before the end of the year Zitouna and Best Lease will be able to issue.\" \nState-owned electricity and water utilities may follow suit while national carrier Tunisair could tap the market later after clearing legislative hurdles Frad added. \nThe Tunisian arm of Bahrain's Al-Baraka Banking Group is expanding operations after it became a resident bank at the end of 2013. The Islamic lender is adding wholesale banking and investment products which could include sukuk. \n\"Best Lease (sukuk) will be a good idea and we are considering this\" Chief Executive Adnan Ahmed Yousif told Reuters. \nSince 2014 Al-Baraka's Tunisian arm has launched six sharia-compliant products such as vehicle financing and introduced pilgrimage savings schemes to the Tunisian market. It plans to launch sharia-compliant student loans this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:38:27.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
