They find it difficult sourcing the seedlings and the technique of planting it. That was why some of the farmers have to replant it twice after consultation with experienced sesame farmers from Kankara and Bakori.\" \nHe observed that the intervention of the marketing companies of the commodity, through the provision of quality seedlings and making advance payments to farmers, will boost the crop production in the southern part of the state. \nAbdulkadir stated that provision of a market will also serve as a morale booster to the farmers in the area. \nIt is observed that the growing unemployment rate in the country has also forced many youth into farming of cash crops such as sesame. \nMal Muhammadu Sani, 31, from Bakori said his inability to secure job or further his studies due to financial constraints forced him into sesame and other cash crops farming.
