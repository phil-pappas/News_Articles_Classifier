Could this be a catalyst for growth in Noida? \nIn 2013, advocate Gaurav Bansal filed a petition with the NGT (National Green Tribunal) for the imposition of an eco-zone around the Okhla Bird Sanctuary in Delhi. Rampant urbanisation has always been a cause for concern across the country and Bansal insisted on clear demarcation of territory for environmental reasons. However more than 50,000 homes were caught under the crossfire in the region, stalling projects and inflicting financial strain on builders and home buyers. \nOn Tuesday, MoEF (Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate change) announced that the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) limits will be within reasonable limits, keeping in mind the welfare of property owners in the region. The ESZ around the sanctuary will be 100 metres on three sides in Noida and around 1.27 km towards Delhi. MoEF will issue a detailed report on the matter in a week. \nGaurav Bansal has welcomed this decision too. The real estate market was paralyzed in the region for close to two years with delay in projects and payments thereafter. The court’s ban had a severe impact on Sectors 74, 75, 76, 122 and 137 and close to 25 new residential housing projects came to a standstill. Evidently the economic impact of the delay in decision has been tremendous. \nThe decision comes as a good sign for the market in Noida. Reports have also pointed out that the state government will benefit greatly making up to INR 2000 crore as stamp duty collection after this decision. Authorities will also receive pending dues from builders. Home buyers in the region had stalled payments to a large extend owing to the uncertainty, but the decision will sure come as a huge relief for builders. This will serve as a catalyst and give a much needed bump to the real estate market in Noida. The next will quarters will determine the actual impact of this decision. \nImage: “Okhla bird sanctuary” by Amit.pratap1988 – i capture itPreviously published: none.
