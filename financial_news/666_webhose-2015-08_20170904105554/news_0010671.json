And for a while now, there has not been quite enough growth.”\n“This may be simply a feature of the post-financial crisis world — the need for balance sheet repair. It may be about changing demographics.\n“It may be that potential growth is a bit lower than we used to think, though I don't think we can know whether that is so at present.”\nThe summit, in Sydney, is being hosted by The Australian and the Australian Financial Review .\nMr Stevens said fiscal policy debate in Australia was usually framed between discussions of “when do we get back to surplus” or debates about “fairness”.\nBut Mr Stevens said the debate should focus on “how do we grow the pie?”.\n“That isn't because distribution doesn't matter. It's because distributional issues surely get easier with growth but much, much harder in its absence.”\nOriginally published as Glenn Stevens hits out at ‘short-termism’ ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/rba-governor-glenn-stevens-hits-out-at-short-termism-calls-for-focus-on-growth/story-e6frfm1i-1227499439167?sv=ef755b1c9d411be70782b86578c88e12", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/rba-governor-glenn-stevens-hits-out-at-short-termism-calls-for-focus-on-growth/story-e6frfm1i-1227499439167?sv=ef755b1c9d411be70782b86578c88e12", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/rba-governor-glenn-stevens-hits-out-at-short-termism-calls-for-focus-on-growth/story-e6frfm1i-1227499439167?sv=ef755b1c9d411be70782b86578c88e12&h=Glenn+Stevens+hits+out+at+%26%238216%3Bshort-termism%26%238217%3B", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Glenn+Stevens+hits+out+at+%26%238216%3Bshort-termism%26%238217%3B&c=RESERVE+Bank+governor+Glenn+Stevens+says+the+focus+of+reform+debate+should+be+on+economic+growth%2C+rather+than+on+the+timeline+for+a+Budget+surplus.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/rba-governor-glenn-stevens-hits-out-at-short-termism-calls-for-focus-on-growth/story-e6frfm1i-1227499439167?sv=ef755b1c9d411be70782b86578c88e12", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/rba-governor-glenn-stevens-hits-out-at-short-termism-calls-for-focus-on-growth/story-e6frfm1i-1227499439167?sv=ef755b1c9d411be70782b86578c88e12&title=Glenn+Stevens+hits+out+at+%26%238216%3Bshort-termism%26%238217%3B", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/rba-governor-glenn-stevens-hits-out-at-short-termism-calls-for-focus-on-growth/story-fni0dcne-1227499439167", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/rba-governor-glenn-stevens-hits-out-at-short-termism-calls-for-focus-on-growth/story-e6frfm1i-1227499439167?sv=ef755b1c9d411be70782b86578c88e12&title=Glenn+Stevens+hits+out+at+%26%238216%3Bshort-termism%26%238217%3B"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:38:34.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
