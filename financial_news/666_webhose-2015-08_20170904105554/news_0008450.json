You want to get it into the pipes and into the market and let economics determine exactly where it flows.\n\"It's about export dollars and jobs and a continued supply to the domestic and export markets. It's not an and/or situation – it's both. We have to work in the national interest, as ultimately the Australian people own the resources in the ground.\"\nRenewables have a place Knox believes gas will play an increasingly important role in conjunction with renewables in Australia's energy future.\nHistorically, Australia has derived most of its energy for power generation from coal (about 80 per cent). The remainder has come from gas and other sources, but this is changing rapidly.\n\"Ultimately, we have to lower our carbon footprint and increase our efficiency. It won't be a competition between coal and gas because it's about choosing the right mix to deliver the outcomes that Australia believes are appropriate.\n\"Gas complements wind and solar well and we're seeing that in other countries, such as South Korea and Japan. Both these countries use a lot of gas in their transport sectors and increasingly we will see more gas power in transport.\"\n\"Coal will continue to be an important commodity for a long time to come but gas has an important role and will probably be the fastest growing fuel in Australia's energy mix. I firmly believe we want to invest more in renewables and continue to develop gas, which will lower our carbon footprint,\" Knox said.\nAs for the local oil and gas industry, Knox is understandably bullish.\n\"It's an industry employing thousands of people and provides the energy required to about 45 per cent of our manufacturing sector as well as energy into Australian homes and this will continue for an extremely long time,\" he says.\nKnox believes ensuring the future of the industry also entails getting on top of emotive issues such as the coal seam gas debate by explaining the science and earning the confidence and trust of local communities.\n\"The industry is getting better but we have to earn that confidence and trust of everyone in a locality every single day. We need to bring a community on the journey and when we do that, and do it well, we get local support.\"\nBeyond domestic issues what sets us apart at the moment is for the first time in our history \"we have the right street address\".\n\"Asia is growing and our ability to provide oil and gas into that market opens up opportunities for us we haven't yet fully realised.\nAsian proximity Gas is becoming increasingly important as a fuel because it's affordable, has a relatively low carbon footprint and we have a lot of it available. Importantly, we can get it into the Asian markets quickly which will drive growth here and generate enormous wealth.\nANZ's recent report, Australia's gas industry - when markets collide , echoed Knox's comments, suggesting Australia's LNG could triple in the coming years as Asian demand rises, overtaking iron ore as the country's key export driver.\nCoping with that demand is something Australia is well prepared for, with the size of each LNG investment rivalling the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The Gladstone LNG project is big enough to produce 10 per cent of Malaysia's gas needs and 10 per cent of South Korea's needs.\n\"It's a very large plant that will run for 30 to 50 years depending on the resource base,\" Knox says.\n\"Basically it's a very large refrigerator – it takes methane gas we extracted from the coal seam or from other types of rock and it's transported to Gladstone in a pipeline where it's cooled down to minus 161 centigrade and put on ships in liquid form.\"\nKnox has always said it might have been better to build two plants next to each other (rather than three) in Queensland, although we will see an enormous creation of wealth in the long run.\n\"It's an extraordinary way of linking the resources of Australia with the growing markets of Asia and it has never been done on this scale before. It's an innovative, high- tech game from start to finish.\"\n\"And when you include Western Australia we will be matching Qatar as the largest supplier in the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:09:44.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
