The Markit/CIPS PMI on UK construction eased to 57.1 in July from 58.1 a month earlier, missing forecasts for a reading of 58.5. The Athens stock market fell for a second day as worries about the country's finances dragged. Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) was leading the fallers as the Dublin-headquartered pharmaceuticals group made a hostile takeover approach for US immune deficiencies specialist Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) at roughly $30.6bn, only a month after it was spun out by Baxter International (NYSE: BAX - news ) . 1600: US stocks are little changed amid a slate of earnings and a report that showed US factory orders rose in June. Office Depot (NasdaqGS: ODP - news ) is trading higher even though its second quarter sales missed expectations. Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) gained despite opening at an all-time low after the social media giant closed at a record low of $29.27 on Monday night. Toyota fell despite posting a record first quarter profit fuelled by a weak yen, although the group would have reported a decline in operating profit had it not been for the favourable currency impact. \n1500: US factory orders rose 1.8% in June, as expected, following a 1.1% drop a month earlier, the Commerce Department reveals. \n1445: The ISM's New York index rose to 63.1 in July from 63.1 in June, well above the 50 level that indicates expansion.

The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index fell to 57.1 in July from the previous month's 58.1, trailing estimates for a reading of 58.5. Nevertheless, a number above 50 signals expansion in the industry. \"July's growth slowdown is the first for three months and perhaps a sign that the post-election impact on construction confidence has started to diminish,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) . \n0900: London equities slumped, led by natural resource related stocks as commodity prices weakened. A measure of mining shares were in the red, including Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) , as gold and silver prices declined on the Comex.
