A Reuters reporter said there were smashed windows and damaged doors.\nIn a text message, an ENI spokesman played down the extent of the damage. \"Nobody wounded and no significant damage to the office buildings,\" he said.\nENI is still active in Libya, a major oil producer gripped by chaos and fighting. Like other Western companies, it has withdrawn expatriate staff.\nMellitah's biggest asset, El Feel oilfield, has been closed for months due to a protest by local security guards. The Wafa oil and gas field and its offshore operations are still working.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility.\nMilitants loyal to Islamic State have claimed a string of killings of foreigners as well as attacks on embassies and oilfields in Libya.\nIslamic State militants have exploited chaos in the North African country, where two governments allied to a host of armed groups are fighting for control four years after the ousting of veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi.
