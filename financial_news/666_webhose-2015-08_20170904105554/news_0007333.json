(the \"Company\"), (NASDAQ: MBII ), a leading provider of bio-based pest management and plant health products for the agriculture, turf and ornamental and water treatment markets, announced today that it has completed a $40 million loan financing. \nThe financing involves the Company's issuance to the lenders of Senior Secured Promissory Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $40,000,000, accruing interest at a rate of 8% per annum, with $10 million payable 3 years from the closing, $10 million payable 4 years from the closing, and $20 million due 5 years from the closing. The Company also issued to the lenders warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to $1.91 per share (subject to certain limitations on exercisability). The Company currently intends to use the proceeds of the loan for working capital and other general corporate purposes. \nPam Marrone, Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We are grateful for the support of our lenders in recognizing the long term potential of the Company.\" \nThe Company also announced that James Iademarco, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer since January 2015, has elected to resign effective August 31st, 2015. To assist with the transition of various pending matters, Mr. Iademarco has agreed to remain available to advise the Company in a consulting capacity for an additional period of up to 90 days.

As reported in the Company's Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on August 17, 2015, the Form 10-Q will not be filed with the SEC until after the completion of Company management's evaluation of the necessity, nature and scope of any restatements to its previously filed financial statements.
