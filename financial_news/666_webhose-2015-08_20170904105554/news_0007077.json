But it wasn’t always like that. In fact, it’s likely that your grandparents’ understanding of money was shaped by tougher financial times.\nAnd it’s great to be reminded about these values, because one day (just like us) you’ll be in a position to pass on their wisdom to the next generation.\nSo on that note, here are five things our grandparents taught us about money that will last forever.\nProud grandparents David and Libby Koch say old fashioned advice can save you a lot of money. Source: Supplied\nAlways pay with cash\nForget credit cards . If your grandparents didn’t have the money set aside to buy something, it’s simple … they didn’t buy it.\nYes, credit is readily available nowadays, but buying things you can’t afford will inevitably get you into trouble.\nSo take a leaf out of their book, and pay with cash. Even if it’s just for a month, you’ll learn a lot about where your money is going.\nBetter still, when you’re using your credit card ... mentally make the link to it being your money. That it is cash.\nSETTING A BUDGET: Everything you need to know is on moneysaverHQ\nWaste not, want not\nToday we’re comfortable using something once and then throwing it away, or replacing something that’s broken rather than fixing it.\nBut when times are tight, this approach just doesn’t make sense.\nYou wouldn’t catch your grandparents throwing away food because they forgot to cook it before it spoiled or paying $3 for a bottle of water when they can get it for free out of the tap.\nAnd we bet they knew how to repair things around the house themselves, whether that meant fixing a leaky tap, or stitching up old clothes.\nSave the pennies and the pounds will follow\nWith a lifetime of experience, your grandparents understand better than anyone the importance of taking a long-term approach to building wealth.\nThey’ll be the first to tell you that over time, a little saved here and there adds up to a significant sum.\nThis truism is a bit like the title of the classic Paul Kelly song, “From Little Things Big Things Grow”, and it works just as well with dollars and cents as pounds and pennies.\nDon’t spray it ... you may want to live a champagne lifestyle but if you can’t afford it you’ll end up in debt. Source: Supplied\nPut money away for a rainy day\nAs with everything in life, there will be good times and bad when it comes to your finances … Just ask your grandparents.\nAnd while you should make every effort to enjoy the good times, it makes sense to have a plan for when things go wrong.\nEvery now and again, an issue will pop up that you weren’t expecting, like your car breaking down or something more serious such as losing your job.\nHaving ‘rainy day’ money saved will give you the freedom to ride out the storm and come out better than ever on the other side.\nYou can’t have champagne taste on a beer budget\nBreaking the budget to buy a fancy car, borrowing too much to buy a house in ‘that’ suburb, or any of the other mistakes people make when they’re trying to keep up with the Jones’s are examples of foolish financial behaviour.\nYou’ll just end up in debt trying to keep up with people who are already there, so instead of trying to buy your way to success, focus on building your career.\nEventually, with a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, you’ll be in a position to buy all of those fancy things.\nBut by then you’ll probably realise that there’s a lot more to life. Of course, you could have just asked your grandparents.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/grandparents-may-not-be-too-tech-savvy-but-they-know-a-lot-about-saving-money/story-fn7kicty-1227487280668?sv=b4a0a5ff41f062c8cf4150d70008b4ea&h=Why+you+can%26%238217%3Bt+have+champagne+taste+on+a+beer+budget", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/credit-cards#itm_t=story&itm_l=advice-from-grandparents", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/building-a-budget#itm_t=story&itm_l=lessons-from-grandparents", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/grandparents-may-not-be-too-tech-savvy-but-they-know-a-lot-about-saving-money/story-fn7kicty-1227487280668?sv=b4a0a5ff41f062c8cf4150d70008b4ea&title=Why+you+can%26%238217%3Bt+have+champagne+taste+on+a+beer+budget", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/grandparents-may-not-be-too-tech-savvy-but-they-know-a-lot-about-saving-money/story-fn7kicty-1227487280668?sv=b4a0a5ff41f062c8cf4150d70008b4ea", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Why+you+can%26%238217%3Bt+have+champagne+taste+on+a+beer+budget&c=IT%26%238217%3BS+likely+that+your+grandparents%26%238217%3B+understanding+of+money+was+shaped+by+tougher+financial+times+so+they+have+plenty+of+good+advice+when+it+comes+to+saving+money.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/grandparents-may-not-be-too-tech-savvy-but-they-know-a-lot-about-saving-money/story-fn7kicty-1227487280668?sv=b4a0a5ff41f062c8cf4150d70008b4ea", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/grandparents-may-not-be-too-tech-savvy-but-they-know-a-lot-about-saving-money/story-fn7kicty-1227487280668?sv=b4a0a5ff41f062c8cf4150d70008b4ea&title=Why+you+can%26%238217%3Bt+have+champagne+taste+on+a+beer+budget", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/grandparents-may-not-be-too-tech-savvy-but-they-know-a-lot-about-saving-money/story-fn7kicty-1227487280668?sv=b4a0a5ff41f062c8cf4150d70008b4ea"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:22:36.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
