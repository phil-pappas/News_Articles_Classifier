Tsipras resigned on Thursday.\nWith 25 lawmakers, the party would be the third largest bloc in Greece's 300-seat parliament ahead of the centrist To Potami and far-right Golden Dawn parties, which each have 17 lawmakers.\n(Reporting by George Georgiopoulos, Writing by Deepa Babington; editing by David Stamp)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:57:42.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
