(ATI) has issued a lockout notice that will affect more than 2,000 workers, effective Saturday, August 15. The notice comes after failed contract negotiations between the company and the United Steelworkers union. Negotiations began in May; contracts expired on June 30. ATI says it \"presented its last, best and final offer\" on August 1. The union had until August 10 to accept it. The offer included $4,500 in lump-sum payments over four years and incentives for ATI Flat Rolled Products employees who averaged $94,000 in 2014 earnings. \"[W]e intend to return to our local unions to meet with our fellow USW members so we can review with them the specifics of these proposals. After these discussions, we will be better prepared to determine our next step, including whether we will present this offer to the full membership for a vote,\" said the USW in a statement. ATI will continue operations with non-union and temporary workers until a contract is finalized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T20:19:41.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
