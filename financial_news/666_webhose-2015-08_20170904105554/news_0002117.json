The figure is later raised again to 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). \n- December: The three main credit ratings agencies -- Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's -- downgrade Greece's debt. \n-- 2010 -- \n- April: Ten-year bond yields leap above 8.5 percent, the highest since Greece adopted the euro in 2001. With public debt at 350 billion euros ($385 billion) and Greece essentially unable to borrow on debt markets, Athens appeals for aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. \n- May: Greece becomes the first eurozone country to receive a bailout as the EU and IMF agree to a 110 billion euro package of loans in exchange for austerity measures that include wage cuts and tax hikes. \n-- 2011 -- \n- October: As Greece's economic situation deteriorates, the eurozone prepares a second loan package ultimately worth 130 billion euros. \nIn addition, private sector creditors agree to write off more than 100 billion euros, about half the debt owed to them. \n-- 2012 -- \n- February: The eurozone approves Greece's second bailout package. \n- May 6: Two Greek political parties that accepted austerity measures, the socialist Pasok and conservative New Democracy, suffer losses in early elections. The radical left Syriza party vaults to second place. Fresh elections are held. \n- June 17: The two pro-bailout parties form the core of a new government after a close vote. The conservative prime minister creates a three-party coalition. \n-- 2014 -- \nApril: Greece returns to sovereign debt markets for the first time in four years and posts a primary budget surplus (which excludes debt interest payments). \n-- 2015 -- \n- January 25: Syriza wins a snap election with a pledge to renegotiate the bailout terms. In five years, Greek GDP has fallen by 25 percent, salaries have withered and a quarter of the workforce is unemployed. \n- February 20: Greece's creditors agree to extend emergency loans until the end of June. Athens vows to enact reforms in exchange for the last 7.2 billion euros in rescue funds. \n- June 30: Greece's bailout officially expires and the country misses a 1.5 billion euro debt payment to the IMF. \n- July 5: More than 61 percent of Greeks reject creditors' bailout terms in a referendum. \n, in return for reforms that exceed those rejected a week earlier. \nGreek lawmakers approve a first batch of reforms on July 16 and 23. \n- August 11: Greece and its creditors agree on fiscal targets for the third rescue package. The final deal is expected to be voted on by Greek lawmakers on August 13, and put to eurozone finance ministers the following day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T17:20:17.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
