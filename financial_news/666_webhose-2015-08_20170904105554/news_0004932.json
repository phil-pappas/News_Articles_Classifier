Written by: Mark Henricks 08/17/15 - 9:12 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — The rattle in Social Security’s piggy bank will be silenced one year later than previously forecast, according to the latest report from the retirement fund’s trustees. The 2015 edition of the annual summary said Social Security’s trust fund will run out of money in 2034, instead of 2033 as was forecast last year. \nIf you’re like many Americans, you think that means you’re not going to get anything from Social Security when you retire. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey found 41% of people who had not yet retired believed that by the time they were ready to retire, there would be no money for benefits. \nBut, while the latest summary bluntly states that the trust fund will be empty in 19 years, that doesn’t mean future retirees will get nothing. Even after 2034 and if nothing is done, Social Security will be able to pay about 77% of the current level of benefits. While that’s not great, it’s not nothing. And there are options for making up the shortfall, including raising taxes and reducing benefits.
