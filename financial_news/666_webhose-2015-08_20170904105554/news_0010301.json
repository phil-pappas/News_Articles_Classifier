But with Thursday's report of a stronger-than-expected U.S. economy , investors are reassessing just how much impact China's economic slowdown is really having. \nInstead, this week's market turmoil appears to be mostly a bout of panic that was quickly contained, a surge of computer selling that was based mostly on technical analysis, and most of all, a valuation reset that was probably overdue. \nAnd if proof were needed, the U.S. market has now erased all of its losses for the week -- Wall Street's way of saying \"never mind.\" More Headlines The Diamond Ceiling: Women CEOs Aren't Hauling in Gaudy Pay Packages Like Male Peers \nThe U.S. government had basically the same message earlier in the day, when it reported that the nation's economy grew at a 3.7% annual rate in the second quarter -- far better than the 2.3% it had first estimated last month. \nOf course, if China's economy and stock market continue to implode, the contagion could easily spread around the world and slam U.S. stocks. But for now, at least, that threat seems to be somewhat limited. \nSo as the dust clears, we have on our hands what we thought we did two weeks ago: A U.S. economy likely to grow between 2% and 2.5% this year, a glut of labor and production capacity that is holding down wages and inflation, and a Federal Reserve that has to balance risks in deciding whether to raise interest rates as soon as September. \nAnd we have a cheaper stock market that has given back some of the gains it made in 2013 and 2014, as higher multiples apparently made some investors fear that a more-expensive market was more vulnerable to risks coming from Asia -- the normal push and pull that happens even in long-running bull markets. \nAfter the selloff, a Standard & Poor's 500 Index that had been selling for 17.6 times expected 2015 profits in early August was down to 15.3 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, using estimates compiled by S&P Capital IQ. \nThat's essentially the same as the average since 1999 -- which is appropriate or even a little low considering that interest rates are near zero. Tech companies are trading at a P/E ratio that is barely higher than expected profit growth -- also a recipe for stable to rising stock prices, especially for companies like Apple whose 14% expected annual profit growth for the next five years is much higher than its P/E ratio of 12, which falls to 8 after accounting for Apple's $200 billion in cash holdings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:07:21.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
