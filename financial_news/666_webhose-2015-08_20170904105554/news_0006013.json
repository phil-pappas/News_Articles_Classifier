Jessica Hromas by Joyce Moullakis Bennelong Funds Management is backing a new high-profile boutique led by Jack Chemello, Suellen Morgan and Mary Feros, that does not construct its portfolio by drawing on traditional benchmarks because it believes the S&P/ASX 200 is too dominated by banks and miners.\nBennelong, which already holds minority stakes in six other boutiques and has $5.6 billion in total funds under management, is backing the team of investment directors at newly established Touchstone Asset Management.\nIt includes Mr Chemello, formally a senior portfolio manager at BT Financial Group, Ms Feros, most recently a senior portfolio manager at Advance Asset Management, and marks a return to managing funds for Ms Morgan, formerly of 452 Capital. They have combined experience in the industry of about 60 years.\nThe fund's strategy, known as \"benchmark unaware\", differs to that used by the majority of local active managers. The nation's biggest banks and Perpetual are yet to use the structure but it is being employed though by the likes of AMP, Lazard and Pengana.\nBennelong, which is owned by BRW rich lister Jeff Chapman, pours profits into philanthropic endeavours. The funds management firm is chaired by former Standard Chartered and Westpac Banking Corp executive Mike Pratt. It is seeking to grow organically and via acquisitions to at least triple its funds under management over the next three years.\nBennelong's chief executive Craig Bingham acknowledged the competitive nature of the local industry and said managers that didn't adapt to the landscape did so at their own peril.\n\"There is a great need for funds management businesses to adapt to the new environment,\" he said referring to increased regulations, demand for more robust risk and compliance, more scrutiny of remuneration and a trend for large clients to assess in-house management.\n\"You have a competitive landscape where everyone wants to come to Australia and participate, and as a result it's a hugely competitive marketplace.\n \"The key is not to fall into the trap of doing what you've comfortable in doing.\"\nTouchstone, which will use quality scores and a Quality-At-a-Reasonable-Price (QARP) philosophy to assess investment risk against expected return, is majority owned by the directors and three analysts. Bennelong is not disclosing the seed capital provided and the arrangement also includes up to five years of working capital.\nCompanies in emerging markets The new fund fits into Bennelong's broader strategy, which includes seeking out acquisitions or minority stakes in companies in emerging markets.\n\"We want to maintain high alpha equities platform rather than being all things to all people and then looking to take that DNA and extend it via geography,\" Mr Bingham said, noting the firm was in talks on five potential acquisitions.\nOne of the key tenants of Touchstone, named after a black stone historically used to assay the quality of gold, is offsetting the concentration risk of the local bourse is it's one of the most concentrated sharemarkets in the developed world.\n\"Regardless of whether you're investing in an active or passively managed fund here, you're still being forced to hold a huge amount of risk that would be diversified away if you were invested virtually anywhere else in the world. Long term that's a bad deal,\" Mr Chemello said.\n\"If our banking system was to suffer a significant downturn from which it couldn't recover quickly, the impact on retirement savings for many, many Australians would be dramatic.\n\"Since the global financial crisis, tracking errors for investment products right across the industry have fallen significantly. This means that investors are now being asked to pay active management fees on products that are largely index funds … we're already seeing significant reallocation of money as a result.\"\nThe industry is, however, fiercely competitive as investors increasingly look to managers that have access to international equities and other high-profile names re-emerge in the industry.\nFormer Wilson Asset Management manager Matthew Kidman is back in the market for funds, alongside ex-Ellerston fundies Gary Joffe and Glenn Poswell. The market has also been littered with listed investment companies.\nBut Touchstone believes gender diversity also sets it apart from other managers, as 50 per cent of its team are female.\n\"It's crazy to build any business based upon one gender only – you're only accessing half the available talent pool in the country, and probably limiting your business's potential to half of what it could be,\" Mr Chemello said.\nHe did, however, have a false start in his return to the industry following a sabbatical. Mr Chemello had a short stint with Mason Stevens before getting Touchstone off the ground.\nIn the June Mercer survey , Bennelong Concentrated Equities ranked third for Australian share managers with one-year returns of 16.9 per cent while Bennelong Core Equities ranked 48th at 7 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:12:47.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
