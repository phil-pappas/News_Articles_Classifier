Should you only return to the markets on St Leger Day (which, as racing fanatics will know, is in early September each year)? No, clearly not – that's a load of superstitious bunkum, akin to crossing your fingers and rubbing your rabbit's foot as you bet on a sixfold accumulator. Quite aside from the fact that it's basically a coin toss on whether the markets will make or lose money in the summer, the transaction costs involved in liquidating your entire portfolio and then reinvesting the money every year would be astronomical. That being said, anyone who did it this year would be laughing now. The FTSE 100 is officially in correction territory having fallen more than 10pc since its last peak of nearly 7,104 on April 27 – yes, just four days before the beginning of May. And there's over three weeks to go until the St Leger Stakes runs at Doncaster on September 12. Interactive: FTSE summer 'correction' But the general malaise hides a more nuanced picture. Take a look at the worst performing five stocks in the FTSE 100 this year. They are Aberdeen Asset Management (-22pc), Weir Group (-26pc), Antofagasta (also -26pc), Anglo American (-37pc) and poor, old Glencore (-45pc). What's the common theme here? China . Fears about a slowdown, or even a crash, in the world's second largest economy have weighed heavily on the Asia stock markets in which Aberdeen invests and hurt the prices of the commodities that Antofagasta, Anglo American and Glencore produce. Only Weir Group, the industrial pump maker, stands out from the laggards. It supplies the oil and gas market and has therefore been hit by the slump in the price of crude. Now look at the winners. They are Direct Line (up 31pc), Barratt Developments (37pc), Persimmon (43pc), Mondi (49pc) and, top of the pops, Taylor Wimpey (55pc). It will not have escaped your notice that three of the five are UK house builders. So, on the one hand there are the stocks that have benefited from the uptick in the UK economy (and the housing market in particular); on the other are those stocks that are more exposed to the vagaries of the global economy and worries about China in particular. This dichotomy is reinforced lower down the scale of market capitalisation. The FTSE 100 is down 3pc for the whole year to date but the FTSE All Share is up 2pc. The average UK fund manager is also in positive territory, up over 6pc, according to Hargreaves Lansdown. That is because they are overweight midcap stocks which tend to be more exposed to the UK economy than blue chips. The question now is: what next? The consensus view appears to be that the slowdown in China could get worse before it gets better. That being the case, it remains to be seen how much of a drag a further slowdown in the global economy exerts on the UK markets. The silver lining of this scenario is that it might further delay a rise in interest rates, which, all other things being equal, should be a positive for equities in general and those of housebuilders and construction companies in particular. On the flip side, if pessimism about China has been overdone ( as our own Ambrose Evans-Pritchard believes ), then the miners could come bouncing back, which would, relatively, hurt those managers that remain underweight in the sector. Active fund managers often come in for a fair amount of stick – comparisons to monkeys throwing darts are not unknown. In aggregate they often fail to outperform the market, especially when fees are taken into account. But, fair's fair, they've proved their worth so far this year. They will have their work cut out navigating the months ahead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T19:59:57.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
