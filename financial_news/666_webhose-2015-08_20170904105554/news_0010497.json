The banks, which admitted guilt earlier this year over manipulating foreign exchange or benchmark interest rates, were required to seek the department’s permission to maintain their Qualified Professional Asset Manager status.\nSuch a rejection would be a departure for the Labor Department, and the tentative decision comes early in a process that allows for additional bank response and public comment.\nPublic interest groups and lawmakers including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, have pressed the Labor Department for tougher reviews of banks convicted of crimes before clearing them to continue their pension-management businesses.\nThe department could use a threat of denial as leverage to place stricter conditions on any permission it may ultimately grant.\n“You shouldn’t discount the possibility that the Department of Labor is asking for more information so they can better craft conditions for a final exemption,” said Andrew Oringer, an attorney at Dechert LLP who specializes in pension issues.\nAddressing Issues JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc pleaded guilty to settle currency-manipulation charges in May and have also requested waivers for their pension-management operations, which are pending.\nUBS and Deutsche Bank are actively engaging with the Labor Department to address the issues it raised, according to spokesmen for the banks. Michael Trupo, a Labor Department spokesman, declined to comment. Spokesmen for RBS, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment.\nThe department told the banks it had “tentatively decided not to propose the requested exemptions” they sought, according to the notices dated July 16 and 17. In each case, the department wrote, the banks had failed to demonstrate that their continued pension-fund management would be in their clients’ interests, or that they were protecting the rights of plan participants.\nThe letters gave the banks 40 days to submit additional information to support their requests, a period that would end this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:42:50.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
