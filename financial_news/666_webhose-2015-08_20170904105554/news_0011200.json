We are in discussions with our lender in relation to this matter,\" the company said on August 11.\nNeither GE nor WDS returned calls on Wednesday evening, and WDS is expected to update the market on Thursday.\nContractors to the mining and energy sectors have been among the worst hit by the commodities slump, with several companies, such as Forge Group collapsing under the strain.\nWDS is believed to be in the middle of a labour supply contract at South32's Appin mine in the Illawarra, as well as Shell's Daandine coal seam gas project in Queensland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:20:33.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
