PADI-approved and available to kids ages 8 to 12 the PADI bubble maker course is as fun as it sounds a chance for kids to blow bubbles while scuba diving. \nThe newly launched PADI Seal Team and PADI Seal Team specialty program are world recognized certifications which welcome young scuba divers who are looking for action-packed fun surrounded by sharks and rays by completing aqua missions. Children aged 8 to 12 will learn what it is like to dive with flashlights take digital pictures underwater and float effortlessly like an astronaut. \nPart one aqua missions 1-5 covers basic scuba diving skills such as breathing underwater clearing a mask of water recovering a regulator and swimming around experiencing the sensation of being weightless. Each session takes about an hour. \nPart two which requires PADI Seal Team as a prerequisite offers 10 specialty AquaMissions. \nSteve Kaiser VP marine sciences and engineering for The Lost Chambers comments: 'Children have a natural curiosity about the world around them. They want to know how things work how creatures live and especially where they live. They also have an urgent need for exploration. Scuba diving is an excellent way to really satisfy this need. As an added bonus scuba diving also teaches a child math skills physics and natural science which can make them more critical thinkers in the classroom.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T09:14:01.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
