Denver bar killer Dexter Lewis will be sentenced to life Denver bar killer Dexter Lewis will be spared execution, sentenced to life without parole Associated Press – 6 minutes ago Print \nDENVER (AP) -- Jurors have spared Denver bar killer Dexter Lewis the death penalty, and he will instead be sentenced to life in prison. \nThe jury made its decision Thursday. It is the second time in a month that a Colorado jury has decided against execution for a mass killer. \nLewis was convicted Aug. 10 of five counts of murder for stabbing five people to death in a bar robbery in October 2012 that netted $170. \nProsecutors said Lewis led a four-man robbery crew at Fero's Bar and Grill. He killed the bar's owner and four customers. Two of the men at the robbery testified that Lewis, 25, went down a line stabbing his victims while they were held at gunpoint. \n\"He simply went down the line, not caring about them, not showing any of them any mercy,\" prosecutor Matt Wenig told jurors when they began considering execution for Lewis. \nThe bar was set ablaze before the men fled. \nLewis' defense carefully detailed his abusive childhood, which included Lewis watching his father brutally treat his mother and taking beatings and verbal abuse of his own. \nHis mother, Tammesa Jones, described beating the boy while she abused drugs and alcohol. \n\"I'd hit him with a belt, hit him with my fists. ... I would hit him all over,\" Jones said, breaking down in tears. \"I hit him, probably like, every day.\" \nKilled in the robbery were the bar's owner, Young Suk Fero, 53, and four customers — Daria M. Pohl, 21, of Denver; Kellene Fallon, 44, of Denver; Ross Richter, 29, of Overland Park, Kansas; and Tereasa Beesley, 45, of Denver. \nBrothers Joseph and Lynell Hill pleaded guilty to murder under deals with prosecutors and received lengthy sentences. The fourth man, Demarea Harris, was a confidential informant at the time for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and reported the slayings to authorities. He was never charged in the case. \nHarris and Lynell Hill testified that Lewis stabbed all five people. Joseph Hill refused to testify. \nEarlier this month, a separate jury in suburban Arapahoe County rejected the death penalty for another mass murderer — Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes, who killed 12 people. \nIn the Holmes case, the defense argued not that Holmes was abused as a boy but that he was mentally ill. \nUnder Colorado law, juries must unanimously agree to impose death sentences. In this case, at least one juror sided with Lewis' defense team that his abusive childhood was a mitigating factor in the case. \nNo Denver jury has sentenced someone to death since 1986. \nColorado has not executed anyone since 1997.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T02:04:51.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
