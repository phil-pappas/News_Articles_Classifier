It's wrong for the government not to rescue it.\"\nAll sectors fell sharply, including banks, after a morning rebound in the sector petered out.\nBenchmark mainland indexes have not only given up all the gains made from Beijing's unprecedented stock market rescue in July, in which hundreds of billions of state dollars were directed into the market, but this week entered negative territory for the year-to-date.
