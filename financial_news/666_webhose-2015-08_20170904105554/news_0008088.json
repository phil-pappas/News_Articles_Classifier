The vote is scheduled for mid November.\nClearance from regulators, including the Foreign Investment Review Board and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, is also required.\nThe full details of the initial cash-and-scrip offer were kept quiet, though Asciano said it valued its stock around $9.05 a share.\nHowever, from the time the offer first surfaced until the end of last week, Brookfield’s share price had retreated more than 6 per cent, meaning the original non-binding proposal had likely drifted below $9 a share.\nOriginally published as Asciano backs $12bn Brookfield bid ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Asciano+backs+%2412bn+Brookfield+bid&c=%3Cb%3EUPDATE%3A%3C%2Fb%3E+ASCIANO+shares+have+soared+after+the+logistics+group+accepted+a+revised+%2412+billion+takeover+offer+from+a+consortium+backed+by+a+Canadian+fund.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/asciano-backs-revised-12bn-buyout-bid-backed-by-us-fund-brookfield-infrastructure-partners/story-e6frfm1i-1227487953720?sv=8c0663a2b3bb6417fdc0d5b14d6a01ad", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/asciano-backs-revised-12bn-buyout-bid-backed-by-us-fund-brookfield-infrastructure-partners/story-e6frfm1i-1227487953720?sv=8c0663a2b3bb6417fdc0d5b14d6a01ad", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/asciano-backs-revised-12bn-buyout-bid-backed-by-us-fund-brookfield-infrastructure-partners/story-e6frfm1i-1227487953720?sv=8c0663a2b3bb6417fdc0d5b14d6a01ad&h=Asciano+backs+%2412bn+Brookfield+bid", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/asciano-backs-revised-12bn-buyout-bid-backed-by-us-fund-brookfield-infrastructure-partners/story-fni0dcne-1227487953720", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/asciano-backs-revised-12bn-buyout-bid-backed-by-us-fund-brookfield-infrastructure-partners/story-e6frfm1i-1227487953720?sv=8c0663a2b3bb6417fdc0d5b14d6a01ad", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/asciano-backs-revised-12bn-buyout-bid-backed-by-us-fund-brookfield-infrastructure-partners/story-e6frfm1i-1227487953720?sv=8c0663a2b3bb6417fdc0d5b14d6a01ad&title=Asciano+backs+%2412bn+Brookfield+bid", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/asciano-backs-revised-12bn-buyout-bid-backed-by-us-fund-brookfield-infrastructure-partners/story-e6frfm1i-1227487953720?sv=8c0663a2b3bb6417fdc0d5b14d6a01ad&title=Asciano+backs+%2412bn+Brookfield+bid"], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:04:35.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
