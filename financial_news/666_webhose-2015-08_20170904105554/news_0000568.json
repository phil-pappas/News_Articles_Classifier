Nic Walker by Fiona Carruthers Australia's leading Indigenous model, Samantha Harris, recently turned 25. She boasts an enviable 61,600 followers on Instagram, has modelled for David Jones and Vogue , and recently debuted on Dancing with the Stars .\nYou grew up in Tweed Heads on the NSW north coast. Where are you based now and what are some regular haunts in your home city?\nFor the past three years I've lived near Palm Beach, about 50 minutes' drive from Sydney. When I'm not working, I love staying home. If I'm out with friends, we'll usually hang around Manly – and I'm also a regular at Manly's Fitness First gym. One of my favourite places is Jellyfish at North Steyne, as it's a cafe by day and a restaurant by night with great atmosphere. When family come down to visit, we have a ritual of going to Doyles at Watsons Bay. If it's a nice day, we catch the ferry over from Circular Quay. Seafood is big in my family and salmon is my go-to dish.\nFavourite quiet place?\nI know it's boring, but I have to say the Gold Coast because that's where I'm from. I grew up with three brothers and two of them still live on the Gold Coast. I was the third child and I can tell you my older brothers didn't used to like hanging out with their little sister. It wasn't seen as very cool. But we get along really well and my youngest brother is 15, so he's still at school up there. I get back home about three times a year; mainly for Christmas and birthdays. We all love Rainbow Bay and Snapper Rocks.\nBest destination for work?\nFor the past two years, I've done shoots for the Tjungu Festival up at Uluru. It's basically a big get-together to celebrate Indigenous culture, including fashion. I mentor the young models, helping them feel confident and comfortable walking in a show. Some of these girls have never done anything like this before and they appreciate just having me around. I love hearing about their lives in the Northern Territory and getting to know their families. You always hear your whole life how amazing Uluru is. Then when you see it up close you get what everyone is on about.\nWhere would you happily return to at short notice?\n I did a magazine shoot in the Cook Islands late last year and the water was beautiful. We were there for a whole week, staying at Tamanu Beach Resort [in Aitutaki]. Swimsuit shoots are always extra work. I drink lots of water, eat only healthy meals – mainly meat, fish, vegetables and salad – and hit the gym hard to prepare. But when we got there, it was more like a holiday, especially given we had the middle of the day off when the sun was at its hottest.\nI also treated myself to a relaxing break at the Naka Villas in Kamala Bay on the west side of Phuket in September last year.\nGo-to swimwear in your closet?\nSeafolly – and no they don't pay me to say that! [Even though she was the face of Seafolly in 2010.] I also wear a lot of Lorna Jane exercise gear; I buy that myself too.\nMost arduous aspect of your job?\nI wasn't very sporty as a kid, so it's taken a long time to get used to doing exercise. I mix boot camp with gym classes so I don't get bored, but mostly I just run on the treadmill at the gym.\nSelf-pampering secret?\nA monthly facial at Dermalogica's head office in Crows Nest [on Sydney's lower north shore].\nMost memorable Seat 1A story?\nI actually mainly fly economy, even for work. I've only flown first class once, about 10 years ago when I was 14. I was still at school [Tweed River High] and had just started modelling. I'd been in New York on a shoot for Glamour magazine with Patrick Demarchelier, the famous French photographer. The flight back from New York to Los Angeles was delayed and by the time we got to LA, our economy seats were gone, so Qantas upgraded me and my then agent. I was amazed they had beds in the sky. But to be honest, I didn't appreciate how special it was as I was too young and I just wanted to get home! Back then, I was so shy I didn't even brag about it to the kids at school.\nSamantha Harris spoke to Fiona Carruthers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:08:37.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
