Luis Ascui Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Victorian MP Tony Smith is firming as the favourite to replace Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker following her resignation over travel expenses.\nNumber crunchers said Mr Smith held a strong lead over his fellow Victorian Russell Broadbent and South Australia's Andrew Southcott.\nMr Smith stretched his lead as the main parties signalled they wanted a truce over the use of travel expenses rather than risk engaging in an act of mutually assured destruction.\nThe 74 Liberal Lower House MPs will vote on Monday to replace Mrs Bishop. One source said the only question was who out of Dr Southcott and Mr Broadbent would come second behind Mr Smith.\nNationals MP and Deputy Speaker Bruce Scott had been hoping for the job but the Liberals do not want to give the job to the junior Coalition partner.\nMathematically, Mr Scott could pinch the job if he pushed because the Speaker is decided by a vote of all members of the House of Representatives.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten has backed Mr Scott. If he secured the support of Labor, his Nationals colleagues and the independents he would win by 75 votes to 74.\nBoth main parties have amassed files on the travel expenses of the other but Prime Minister Tony Abbot calmed the issue when he declined to weigh in on Labor's Tony Burke for flying his family business class to Ayers Rock when he was Environment Minister in 2012.\n Mr Burke's trip was within the rules because he was on government business. He contended Mrs Bishop's fault had been to fly to fundraisers and weddings and claim them as official business, in breach of the rules.\nAs some in the Coalition labelled Mr Burke a hypocrite for leading the attack on Mrs Bishop, Mr Abbott, who has ordered another review of the expense system, called for a truce.\n\"On particular members of Parliament and whether particular spending was good, bad or indifferent, I just want to say the important thing is to get the rules right,\" he said.\n\"Plainly, some people in the past have made spending decisions, have made travel decisions which may well have been inside the rules but were plainly outside public expectation.\n\"I want to get the rules right. I really do want to ensure that the latest controversies are indeed the last controversies. I want the public to have absolute confidence that it's a transparent, accountable, workable and, above all else, independent system so that these sorts of issues are, as far as is humanly possible, a thing of the past.\"\nFormer Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Alan Fels, who was a member of the 2010 Belcher review into parliamentary expenses, said the latest episode could have been avoided had the recommendations been adopted.\n\"It's had a really damaging effect, so damaging that maybe this time they will buy some more radical medicine,\" he said.\n\"Secondly, I'm afraid the time has come to have an independent commissioner to oversight it.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:10:01.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
