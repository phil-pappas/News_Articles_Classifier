The brokerage treated all orders as having equal priority between November 2009 and April 2011, when it suspended operations, the SFC said.\n“No one should dive into dark water without knowing what is hidden,” Mark Steward, the SFC’s executive director of enforcement, said in the statement. “Operators must have clear rules and procedures in place for operating dark pools.”\nBNP did not fully resume trading on the dark pool until seven months after it had suspended activity, and it only notified the SFC in January 2013, the regulator said. That breached the terms of BNP Paribas Securities (Asia) Ltd.’s license to run automated trading services.\nThe bank also failed to obtain client consent to execute orders in the dark pool, a second breach of its license. The SFC found it difficult to assess the impact of the rule breaches because BNP Paribas kept insufficient trading records for its dark pool.\nBNP Paribas co-operated with the SFC in the investigation and examined what had happened, Christine Chan, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at the bank, wrote in an e-mail. The bank told the SFC that it would hire an independent outsider to review how the dark pool operates.\nHong Kong will get a tougher regime for dark pools from December 1. Bank-operated trading venues provide the only alternative to Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which enjoys a monopoly over on-exchange equity trading.\nThe SFC fined the Hong Kong-based unit of Nomura Holdings Inc. HK$4.5 million last month for failing to report significant misconduct by a former trader in a timely manner.", "external_links": ["http://www.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=15PR82\\"], "published": "2015-08-03T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T14:14:39.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
