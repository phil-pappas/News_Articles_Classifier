Here are 30 expert Quote: s that will make you money.\n#1 Shares \"It is far more important to minimise the inevitable investment mistakes than be obsessed with trying to find the tenfold investment winners.\"\nHamish Douglass, Magellan Group CEO, CIO and lead portfolio manager\nThis circumspect investment approach has helped Hamish Douglas build a $30 billion listed funds management giant and establish him as Australia's number one manager of global funds through buying high-quality US stocks ignored by other market participants.\nIf you want to get technical, Douglass says his job is to \"to assess the likely cash flows a business will generate over its lifetime, discount these cash flows back to the present value\" and determine if buying today will generate an acceptable rate of return. Simple? Not quite. Effective? You bet.\n#2 Asset allocation \"It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.\"\n George Soros, founder of Soros Funds Management\nFamous for betting US$1 billion against the British pound in 1992, the philosophy of George Soros carries real weight for investors who understand that being right at the wrong time can be just as much of a disaster as being plain wrong.\nSoros was the primary adviser to Quantum, a hugely successful hedge fund, which averaged returns of 20 per cent per annum trading highly leveraged global macro themes before it closed and returned $26 billion to investors in 2011.\n#3 Property \"I am never in a hurry to do any deal. There's a real cut-off point and I am very unemotional about chasing things I think are too expensive.\"\nLang Walker, billionaire property developer\nIn boom markets like Sydney and Melbourne, many investors suffer from a syndrome called fear-of-missing out. It's easy to get caught up in a bidding war at an auction but as the saying goes \"Act in haste, repent at leisure\".\nWalker says that when assessing the value of a property he will arrive at a figure and stick to it. As he told us, every time he has been outbid in a transaction he's managed to find something even better in the weeks and months that followed.\n#4 Shares \"I spend most of my time thinking about the right price to pay for individual stocks that meet our criteria of trustworthy, competent management, conservative leverage and reasonably predictable futures. None of this is rocket science.\"\nJohn Sevior, Airlie Funds Management founder and chief investment officer\nJohn Sevior is the stock picker's stock picker. The occasionally self-deprecating fund manger is less concerned about the global macro themes that consume some commentators than he is about avoiding the pothole right in front of him.\nSince kicking off his new venture in October 2012 after departing Perpetual, the Airlie Concentrated Share fund is up 57.7 per cent compared with the benchmark ASX 300's 36 per cent return over the same period. An impressive performance gleaned from a straightforward motto.\n#5 Shares \"Always question yourself and your ability. Don't ever feel that you are very good. The second you do, you are dead.\"\nPaul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation\nOne of the most successful US hedge fund managers, Paul Tudor Jones is estimated to have amassed a personal fortune of US$4.6 billion through trading everything from shares and commodities, to bonds and long/short positions.\nTudor Jones shot to fame during the Black Monday market meltdown of 1987 when he reportedly tripled his clients' funds with a series of shorting strategies. The lesson here is a simple one, never get complacent about your positions.\n#6 Property \"The person with the most information is generally a seller.\"\nPaul Osborne, founder of Secret Agent\nCaveat emptor! The asymmetry of information in the property market is the number one reason people get into trouble and yet it is so rarely discussed. Properties are not fungible or interchangeable. They are unique little patches of dirt each with their own quirks.\nOsborne says that buyers need to operate with a heightened approach to due diligence to ensure you don't end up with a lemon. His says about a third of property sales take place because they aren't suitable, for whatever reason.\n#7 Shares \"Any company that has a material profit warning is a mandatory sell; bad news tends not to be an isolated event. If a company declines by 20 per cent, it triggers a review. If we are unwilling to buy more it becomes a mandatory sell.\"\nDon Williams, Platypus Investments founder and CIO\nAmong the most consistently strong performing Australian fund managers, Platypus founder Don Williams has been able to consistently find growth in markets when there doesn't seem to be any growth around.\nTo make sure he's not getting caught up in a fad or a fleeting opportunity, he has some basic rules to live by. Since establishing the fund in 1998 his Australian equities fund has returned 10.3 per cent per annum.\n#8 Shares \"There is no substitute for meeting management, competitors, employees, and suppliers of listed companies to truly understand the operating environment and growth prospects. It is critical to understand the people involved in the business.\"\nEd Prendergast, Pengana Emerging Companies fund co-manager\nPrendergast is emphasising the importance of deploying \"shoe leather\" in researching a company. If you own a position in a retail stock, for example, why not visit an outlet nearby and walk the floor?\nExamine the foot traffic, does the fit-out meet expectations and are your interactions with the staff satisfying? Sometimes the answers to your investment questions are right in front of your nose.\n#9 Shares \"More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don't is a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively.\"\nRay Dalio, Bridgewater Associates founder\nThe man responsible for running the world's biggest and weirdest hedge fund is known for being extremely exacting and demanding plenty from his staff. Dalio is renowned for his ability to navigate global economic events, which he proved in 2008 when many of his hedge-fund peers lost money. His philosophy shows a good investor needs to understand themselves as much as the world around them.\n#10 Shares \"It's hard to buy popular stocks cheaply. Superior long-term returns are found from focusing on buying unloved shares with good fundamentals in cyclically depressed sectors. For this reason, we focus on contrarian investment ideas.\"\nSimon Mawhinney, Allan Gray chief investment officer\nMawhinney is in charge of running possibly the best-known contrarian or deep-value funds manager in the Australian equities market. It's easier said than done but blindingly obvious when you think about it. Since its launch in July 2011 Allan Gray's Australia Opportunities Fund has returned 6.5 per cent net of fees compared with the benchmark's 3.1 per cent.\n#11 Shares \"We are looking to invest in changes. That could be the change induced by shifts in industry structure, the economic cycle, competitor behaviour, changes in the cost base, investor risk appetite. Generally there are lot of things changing for a company at any point in time so the key to investing is understanding the relative impact of changes and their likely longevity.\"\nSean Fenton, Tribeca Investment Partners portfolio manager\nCatalysts are where investors can make the best returns for their bet. While professionals will seldom own up to investing simply on the basis of a catalyst, the good investors will always have catalysts in their back of their minds.\nThis approach has enabled Tribeca to find returns in a market where many other investors can't. The Tribeca Alpha Plus Fund returned 20.5 per cent after fees for the 2014-15 financial year to take out the number one position on the Mercer Investment Survey for Australian equities managers.\n#12 Shares \"Never cite boredom as a reason to sell a stock. Always sell the first hiccup in a concept stock. Always buy a 'fallen angel' slowly. Avoid companies moving into an investment year. Never back an incompetent manager no matter how good the company he fronts.\"\nBen Griffiths, Ely Griffiths founder and portfolio manager\nKnown as one of Australia's best small caps stock pickers, Ben Griffiths established specialist small caps funds management firm Ely Griffiths in 2002. Griffiths prides himself on his ability to recognise trends and exploit trends to his advantage.\nThere are patterns in the sharemarket and Griffiths' philosophy highlights a few of the important ones. In a challenging environment for the smaller end, these simple rules have helped Griffiths deliver returns well above the market.\n#13 Shares \"These are the key tenets I live by: Capital preservation is the number one consideration. Don't invest in blue sky. Ensure the business has a strong business model; sound and robust management. Do the numbers and focus on free cash flow.\"\nDavid Paradice, Paradice Investments founder\nDavid Paradice of \"Para\" is revered among investors, having built a $10 billion funds management business starting with his highly regarded small caps fund which has earned him the honorary title of small caps king.\nPara likes to keep things simple, which is why his core philosophy is stripped back to some of the most basic tenets of investing. No matter how complex a situation becomes, or seemingly endless the alternatives are, the best investors are always able to simplify the process.\n#14 Shares \"We consider the downside first. We look at balance sheet, cash flow, profitability. If you've looked at all these, then you've done your homework and you don't have to worry too much. The other thing is, do your own homework.\"\nNathan Parkin, Perpetual Investments deputy head of equities\nOne of the rising stars at one of Australia's oldest and best-known funds management firms, Nathan Parkin was recently appointed deputy head of equities at the firm that has produced more superstars than any other firm.\nParkin is known best for his ability to find opportunities the market might have missed. This is not a skill you can pick up from reading the reports others have written, it requires dedication and the ability to walk the walk.\n#15 Property \"Patience. Patience. Patience. We're in an industry where everyone's throwing obstacles at you and it can take years. You've just got to keep rolling on all the time.\"\nLang Walker, billionaire property developer\nIf you are trying to add another floor to your property and the bureaucracy is making you tear your hair out, spare a thought for property developer Lang Walker who has broken through the red tape to complete more than 200 developments.\nAmong his biggest developments were The Finger Wharf at Woolloomooloo, Broadway Shopping Centre and Collins Square in the Melbourne CBD, Australia's largest mixed-use commercial project which is valued at more than $1.6 billion.\n#16 Property \"The use of leverage should be conservative. The cheap-money era may end sooner than we expect.\"\nPaul Osborne, founder of Secret Agent\nLook, nobody's asking you to start reading the tea leaves from US Federal Reserve statements, there are enough analysts around the globe doing that already and haven't they done a smashing job! The lesson here is, be cautious.\nYou don't need to be US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen to know that when rates start rising being geared up to the eyeballs will get very painful, very quickly, no matter how sound the underlying asset is. So build your equity, the sleep-at-night ratio remains one of the most important investment metrics around.\n#17 Property \"You cannot make money flipping assets when investing in direct residential property. The transactions costs are too high\"\nRichard Wakelin, director and founder of Wakelin Property Advisory\nSorry reality TV, the numbers just don't stack up. No matter how hard you try or how many cracks you paint over, speculating on property is still the fast track to personal ruin.\nEven if you do bank a double digit return in 12 months the costs involved in listing a property, paying stamp duty, advertising and associated agents fees will eat away at your capital too much to make it worth your while.\n#18 Property \"Don't go for a cheap $50 online valuation – get a full inspection done.\"\nChris Gray, CEO of property portfolio company Empire\nEven if it's your 100th investment property, Empire's Chris Gray says you should never ever skimp on the valuation of a fresh acquisition. Gray says that this will almost guarantee that you won't get ripped off by paying too much for a property and at $500 a pop for a full inspection it's a small price to pay.\n#19 Superannuation \"Rule one. Never lose money. Rule two. Never forget rule number one.\"\nWarren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway chairman\nOf all the investment aphorisms, this remains the simplest and perhaps the best. Known as the world's greatest investor, Warren Buffett finessed the simple yet demanding value investing creed developed by Benjamin Graham to build a personal fortune worth US$72 billion.\nThe observation has a special importance for investors at all stages. For those in the accumulation stage, it is a reminder that there is nothing harder than having to make up lost ground. For those in the drawdown phase, well, need we say more?\n#20 Asset Allocation \"The way I have dealt with the risk matrix of our business has been to diversify across the different sectors.\"\nLang Walker, billionaire property developer\nThey say diversification is the only free lunch in investing. While Walker is specifically referring to the major property segments such as retail, commercial, industrial and residential this can be just as easily adapted to your entire portfolio.\nTake a look at your asset allocation. Are you heavily exposed to one asset class over another? Is that because of a comprehensive risk-reward analysis you have conducted or did it just happen? Take stock at least once a year and rebalance when necessary.\n#21 Superannuation \"You should not simply focus on interest rate. For operational cash, you need to define what you need and then match that liability to a suitable cash option.\"\nKevin Toohey, Atchison Consultants general manager\nAn important distinction. With most of us so focused on how low the returns from cash are it's easy to forget that we all need cash for expenses and in retirement you need to be able to accurately forecast these expenses many years into the future.\nFurthermore, while we are happy to lump at-call, term deposits and other instruments under the heading of cash remember they are all different. A cash fund that holds bank bills is different from cash in the bank. A cash ETF may be underpinned by bank deposits but is still a fund with different characteristics.\n#22 Superannuation \"At different points you've got to still expect inflation-plus, but the question is inflation plus what?\nHarvey Kalman, Equity Trustees executive general manager\nEverybody loves it when markets deliver returns in the high teens but you can't expect your investments to do this consistently over the long term. One of the biggest funds in Australia for instance, the Future Fund, has a target of CPI plus 4.5-5.5 per cent.\nIf inflation is running at 3 per cent and you are getting another 5 per cent on top, that's a pretty good result compounded over the past 10 years. Ground your expectations and don't rely on bumper years to help you reach your goals.\n#23 Asset allocation \"Your risk profile needs to be compatible with your goals. When your goals or circumstances change, you would need to revisit that risk profile.\"\nWade Matterson, Milliman practice leader\nThere are a few gems in here worth unpacking. Firstly, that any investment plan needs to start with your goals and work backwards. If you are unhappy with the amount of risk you are taking on then perhaps it's time to revisit your goals.\nThe second idea worth exploring is that the time to change your asset allocation is when your goals or circumstances change, not when markets in Greece or China rise and fall. Remember that the signal is always personal never universal.\n#24 Asset allocation \"A balanced investment portfolio should hold between 20 and 40 per cent in fixed income. If you're more conservative, say you're 65 and want to focus on income, you'll probably want to go higher than that.\"\nDamien Wood, Spectrum Asset Management principal\nThe old rule of thumb that you should subtract your age from 100 to find out your allocation to growth assets (and by default fixed income) is no silver bullet but it is a useful depiction of how the \"glide-path\" model of asset allocation works.\nThe glide-path method tries to avoid any sudden step changes in your asset allocation. Making a number of gradual adjustments to your holdings over time is much more preferable and leaves you less exposed to any sudden market fluctuations.\n#25 Asset allocation \"Most Australians are long property and shares. Automatically that tells you where you are underweight: fixed interest, global assets and securities outside the ASX top 20. \"\nHarvey Kalman, Equity Trustees executive general manager\nIt's probably no surprise that for most investors their super fund is simply an extension of their investing preferences. But this can be a missed opportunity because your super fund can be structured to complement your other assets.\nAs long-term investment, super can be the perfect investment hedge. What's more, investors have access to many more long-term investments than ever before with the proliferation of ETFs, LICs and high-quality options from industry funds.\n#26 – Property \"The broader country has risk of oversupply because councils say that their income comes from approving apartments, so everyone is approving apartments\"\nHarry Triguboff, billionaire property developer\nThis observation from the person who almost single-handed introduced the concept of apartment living to Australia is critical because when it comes down to the nitty-gritty the success of any investment comes down to supply and demand.\nSpeaking to The Australian Financial Review in April, Triguboff echoed the concern of the Reserve Bank about the enormous numbers of residential developments springing up in places like Melbourne. So do your homework and place scarcity of the asset among your top priorities.\n#27 - Property \"Seek third party advice to get an objective point of view. If you are not paying for the product or service, you are the product.\"\nChris Gray, CEO of property portfolio company Empire\nThis advice could equally apply to any of the major asset classes (or indeed service purporting to be \"free\"). However it has special resonance in the property sector where standards of advice tend to be a bit looser than elsewhere.\nWhen receiving advice it is critical to understand how the adviser is getting paid, ask for these details upfront so any conflict of interest is apparent. Make sure the adviser is fully accredited. Academic qualifications and industry accreditation is usually a good start.\n#28 – Super \"For anyone still working past 60, it's hard to find a reason not to start a transition to retirement pension. That's how effective they are.\"\nJonathan Philpot, HLB Mann Judd partner wealth management\nTransition-to-retirement strategies can appear complex but they can deliver a powerful boost to your overall position. Effectively, once preservation age is reached, a worker can start drawing a tax-free pension while salary sacrificing at the same time.\nThe strategy works on multiple levels allows the investor to reduce the amount of income tax they would pay on their income while also saving on the tax they would pay on superannuation earnings. That's what we call a win-win scenario.\n#29 – Asset allocation \"The most outstanding investment records have been built by people who specialise, develop a deep understanding and stay within their circle of competence.\"\nHamish Douglass, Magellan Group CEO, CIO and lead portfolio manager\nThe vertically integrated model of bank-aligned advisers has produced great outcomes for the wealth management arms of the banks but some very ordinary ones for many of the clients they are supposed to be serving.\nConsider your own investments. Is your fixed income exposure being managed by a specialist or by some coincidence is it being managed by the same company which appears on your adviser's letterhead? Compare the performance of your portfolio manager with the rest of the market and have a good reason to stay with them.\n#30 – Super \"Managers will ensure that the best returns are coming from the flagship and that's the balanced fund.\"\nGreg Medcraft, ASIC chairman and IOSCO chairman\nThis gem that Australia's top corporate cop shared with us back in April was too good not to give another run. Growth options get all the attention for their sexy (often) double-digit returns and alluring mix of high-performing assets.\nBut as Medcraft outlined, the fund option with the most money invested and the most attention paid to it is almost always the balanced option. When comparing funds look beyond the short term and consider its performance over five-, seven- and 10-year periods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:09:15.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
