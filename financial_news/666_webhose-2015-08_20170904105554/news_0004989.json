Supplied Share on twitter by Perry Williams Gambling tycoon James Packer has taken another hit to earnings from his Macau casinos with China's corruption crackdown savaging revenues for the Melco Crown joint venture in the second quarter.\nMelco Crown net revenues in the second quarter of 2015 fell 24 per cent to $US916 million ($1.25 billion), missing a consensus forecast of $970 million, due to declines in both high-end and mass-market earnings at its casinos.\nIts closely watched property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation fell 35 per cent to $US204.9 million.\nMelco chief executive Lawrence Ho told investors the environment continues to be challenging in Macau, the only region in China where its citizens can legally gamble.\nMacau's gross gaming revenue in July fell 35 per cent to 18.6 billion patacas ($3 billion), marking a 14th straight month of declines and the lowest level of revenues since 2010 with Beijing's efforts to rein in fraudulent activity and illegal cash flowing across the border hitting earnings across the board.\n\"Macau is currently experiencing a difficult period,\" said Mr Ho. \"However, we believe that through the strong leadership from the Macau and Chinese governments, the ongoing build-out of significant local and regional infrastructure, together with an expanding and increasingly affluent Chinese middle-to-upper-class, Macau remains the world's most important and exciting gaming market.\"\nThe subdued result will be a concern for Mr Packer's Crown Resorts, which derives nearly half of its earnings from Melco through its 34 per cent stake.\nMr Ho, the son of Macau casino magnate Stanley Ho, controls another third of Melco Crown.\nDespite the prolonged slump in the world's largest gaming hub, Melco Crown on Wednesday revealed it will open its latest Macau casino, the $3.2 billion Studio City on October 27 , adding to its existing Altira and City of Dreams casinos in Macau and the Philippines.\n However, Melco continues to sweat on the number of gaming tables it will be allocated by the Macau government.\nIt's thought the debt covering Studio City has a covenant that states the casino needs a minimum of 400 tables but most analysts expect it may only receive 150 tables, in line with Macau's stated aim of diversifying its economy away from gaming.\nMr Ho confirmed on Thursday Melco has yet to discover its allocation and said it remains a worry for the financial profile of the Studio City complex.\n\"We understand that a Macau gaming operator received an allocation of only 150 tables in May 2015,\" said Mr Ho.\n\"We are mindful that the operational and financial performance of Studio City will depend to a large extent on the number of gaming tables allocated by the Macau government and we remain concerned about receiving materially fewer tables than we intend to request for Studio City. Notwithstanding this concern, we believe Studio City's unique and diversified offerings will make it a unique asset built consistent with the Macau government's objective of delivering world class entertainment.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-08-06T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:09:05.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
