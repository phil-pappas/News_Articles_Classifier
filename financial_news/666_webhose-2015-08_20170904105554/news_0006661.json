We won't be giving in until they come to the negotiating table and act in a reasonable manner towards our people. \n\"We have to win this because defeat is unimaginable.\" \nEvery senior union delegate has been sacked and the company is trying to break the MUA's influence, Mr Carnegie said. \nHutchinson, however, says it has no plans to spend money on new automation at Sydney or Brisbane. \nThe Labor Party and the MUA have taken aim at Employment Minister Eric Abetz, who was quoted as saying the sackings via text message may be appropriate. \nSenator Abetz said on Friday he was unaware of the specifics of the sackings, but it was important for employers and employees to treat each other with respect. \n\"If the culture is that employees can text message the boss and they in fact expect the boss to text message them, then that may be an appropriate methodology,\" Senator Abetz told the ABC. \nHis Labor counterpart, Brendan O'Connor, called the comment heartless and said it showed the government was out of touch. \nSenator Abetz has since said he \"was not aware of the particular situation\" when he made the comments. \n\"I can understand this is a particularly difficult time for the workers involved,\" he said in a statement on Saturday. \nFair Work Commission deputy president Anna Booth issued an interim order on Friday night for employees to stop the industrial action, however the order is understood not to cover the MUA. \nThe Fair Work hearing is expected to resume at 5.30pm on Monday. \nThe MUA has also sought a Federal Court injunction against the sackings. \n\"We're just really disappointed and frustrated,\" MUA Sydney branch secretary Paul McAleer said. \n\"We have 50 families who are crushed. This isn't about 50 people made redundant because there is no work. There is work here. \n\"The women and men they work with, who have been lucky enough to escape the brutality at the moment, are incredibly distressed about the future they have.\" \nQueensland Council of Unions general secretary Ros McLennan said Hutchison Ports had treated its employees unfairly and she called on members of other unions and community supporters to join the continuing round-the-clock picket. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Unions dig in on Hutchison Ports protests AAP \nWorkers sacked by Hutchison Ports Australia are digging in their heels as unions say they will not stop their picketing â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T16:32:45.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
