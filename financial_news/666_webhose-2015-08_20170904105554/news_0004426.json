Brazil has 25 years to repay the loan, with an eight-year grace period.\nThe borrowing authorization was backed by opposition parties who said it was a strategic purchase for the country's defense.\nThe first Gripen NG fighter jets should be delivered to Brazil in 2019. Saab plans to set up a Brazilian assembly line producing the fighter jets through 2024 in partnership with Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA.\nThe contract provides for full transfer of technology and the production of 15 of the jets in Brazil.\nBrazil awarded the contract in December 2013, choosing Saab's fighter over Boeing Co.'s F-18 Super Hornet and the Rafale made by France's Dassault Aviation SA.\nBrazil signed an additional $245 million deal with Saab in April to supply arms for the Gripens.\n($1 = 8.6783 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Anthony Boadle ; Editing by Ken Wills )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T04:00:18.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
