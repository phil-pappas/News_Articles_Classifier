The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) - a gauge of shipping costs - dropped to its lowest point since 1985 during the period, with the market weighed down by \"an oversupplied fleet and a slowdown in seaborne demand\". \nThe declines in oil have meant that offshore drilling services have been left \"in a more challenging state than seen in many years\", Clarksons said. \"Consequently, few listed players are prepared to increase exposure or to raise capital for new projects.\" \nBut the oil price rout could be a windfall in the months to come. Clarksons said that lower fuel costs could contribute to \"a more positive global growth story\". \n\"There is a reason to believe that the market will have further upside, especially as the seasonal demand story impacts in the fourth quarter,\" it reported. \nFollowing Clarksons's £280m acquisition of Platou this February, Mr Case said that he was \"delighted to report that the pace of integration of our two businesses has been going well\". \nAdministrative costs rose 29pc to £115.4m as the company absorbed the acquisition; however Clarksons said it anticipated cost savings of £4m a year in due course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:22:35.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
