A recent slump in energy prices, however, last week saw the Russian currency hit its weakest level against the dollar since February. \nThe profit figure exceeded analysts' predictions averaging 347 billion rubles for the January-to-March period, Interfax news agency reported. \nBut while sales revenues were up, Gazprom's operating profits dropped by 3.0 percent to 459 billion rubles and sales volume was down 10 percent to 132.3 billion of cubic meters (bcm). \nRussia's economy has slumped into recession on the back of lower oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. \nThe country's economy ministry said last month it expected Gazprom's production to drop to 414 billion bcm this year, which would be an all-time low. \nGazprom has recently encountered difficulties with some of its partners, including conflict-hit Ukraine. \nIn June, Kiev suspended purchases of Russian gas from the company in the latest pricing dispute. \nGazprom was also accused by its Turkmen counterpart last month of being \"insolvent\" and of refusing to pay for gas supplied by the isolated Central Asian state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T13:51:11.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
