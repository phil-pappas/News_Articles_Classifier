The EU antitrust authority can sanction wrongdoers up to 10 percent of their global turnover. \nIn his blog, Walker said the EU authority had failed to take into account strong competition from online retailers Amazon.com (NasdaqGS: AMZN - news ) Inc and eBay Inc. \nHe also said internet traffic had risen by 227 percent in the last decade in the countries where the Commission said it had abused its power to the detriment of rivals. \nSAME ARGUMENTS \nWalker said the regulator's demand that Google give equal treatment to its rivals was \"peculiar and problematic\" and only justifiable if the company provided an essential service like an electricity company. \nGoogle's foes were scathing of the company's arguments. \n\"We have seen this movie before. Defendants in big European antitrust cases have made the same arguments,\" said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer at lobby group FairSearch, whose members include Microsoft Corp, Nokia Oyj and TripAdvisor (Swiss: TRIP.SW - news ) Inc. \n\"And they argued, again like Google today, that the antitrust authorities just don't get it, and that the remedy they demand cannot be implemented without causing technical and market chaos.\" \nGoogle has however been backed by one study by the Centre for European Reform, a pro-EU think tank. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) surveyed prices of 63 items in Britain's consumer inflation basket, comparing prices on Google Shopping with those of the first-placed retailer in normal search results. \nGoogle Shopping was 2.9 per cent cheaper. \n\"Those who lose most from Google's behaviour are producers, not consumers, at least in the UK,\" author John Springford said in a report published last month. \n\"If Google's prioritisation of its own shopping service gave it monopoly power, one would expect prices to be higher in its own service.\" (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in Frankfurt; Editing by Susan Thomas and David Holmes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T22:39:16.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
