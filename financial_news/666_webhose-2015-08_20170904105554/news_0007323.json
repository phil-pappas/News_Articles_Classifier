Andrew Meares by Primrose Riordan Immigration minister Peter Dutton has confirmed that seven people stopped at Sydney airport suspected of joining terror groups, five of them last week, were on top of 336 people intercepted leaving the country under suspicious circumstances in the past year.\nTwo groups, of five and two, were stopped carrying wads of $10,000, with the group of five, in their late 20s to early 30s, then attempting to go back and get on a plane to the Middle East the next day, according to Mr Dutton.\nThe information was released on the same day the government confirmed it was pushing ahead with their plan to strip dual-national terror suspects of their citizenship via legislation changes, a move constitutional law experts say exposes the government to a high court challenge.\nThe new laws are under review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, chaired by Victorian Liberal MP Dan Tehan, who recently advocated bombing ISIS targets in Syria.\nMr Dutton said the government intends to bring citizenship legislation to Parliament in the first week of September, and has sought to minimise the risk of a challenge \"as best we can\".\n\"We have taken advice from the solicitor-general as well as external counsel ... and the advice is that the bill in its current form is the best way for us to mitigate risk in relation to a constitutional challenge,\" he said.\nSeparately, the government's consultation process on the value of Australian citizenship is expect to start over the next fortnight to gauge community views in Sydney's Hurstville, Brisbane, the Dandenongs in south-east Victoria, Darwin, Western Adelaide, Perth and Brighton in Tasmania.\nSenator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, secretary to the Attorney-General, said there was a \"trend emerging\" in support of the proposed laws and the importance of valuing Australian citizenship in consultations held so far.\n \"There is strong support for mechanisms for suspending of privileges of Australian citizenship from people who ... would stand against Australia,\" she said.\nShe said the review had received more than 2500 responses to the online survey and about 400 emailed submissions.\nMr Dutton said in the 2014-15 financial year, from August 22, 2014, to June 30, 2015, 336 people were intercepted trying to leave the country potentially to join terror groups abroad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:51:21.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
