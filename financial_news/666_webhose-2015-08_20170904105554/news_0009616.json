The bank will take up 25,000 square metres when current tenant, KPMG, moves to Barangaroo South.\nTo help absorb the space are also the new tech stocks. Amazon is said to be keen to take up about 10,000 sqm of space at 2 Park Street, being vacated by law firm Gilbert & Tobin, which is also moving to Barangaroo South.\nAmazon and their agents declined to comment.\nOther leases are said to be LinkedIn, which is expanding in 1 Martin Place, Sydney, while 5 Martin Place is one of the contenders for offices for Dropbox and the New York-based WeWork, being a co-sharing space for entrepreneurs, freelancers, startups and small businesses.\nNicholas Holt, Asia Pacific head of research, at Knight Frank said Sydney remained the bright spot for office leasing.\nHe said following Twitter and Amazon's recent expansion, continuing the trend of technology occupier demand growth, Google is also looking to finalise its decision.\nAccording to Sydney agents, the internet search group is looking for about 10,000 sqm of space and is understood to have viewed White Bay in Balmain and 10 Carrington Street, part of the Wynyard Place development.\nMr Holt said net absorption in the first half of 2015 continued to be negative in Brisbane and Perth, and a strong future supply pipeline will add to their woes through 2016. Melbourne, on the other hand, saw demand double on a year-on-year basis, as tenants continued to centralise in the CBD.\nRetail property is also returning to its best with the important releasing spreads narrowing between new and existing rental contracts.\nScentre Group, the country's biggest landlord, reported a strong profit for the first half.\nAccording to Macquarie Equities analysts while the lower $A will adversely impact the margins of some retailers, the continued improvement in sales across the Scentre Group portfolio is encouraging with comparable specialty sales growth of 5.1 per cent in Australia, a rise on the growth rate of 4 per cent, reported in the March quarter.\nCiti analysts said Scentre's underlying business appears to be tracking ahead of guidance, which they see as a positive.\nThe analysts said the earnings announcement also highlighted the upward trend in Australian shopping centre values. \"Our revised numbers reflect today's sales as well as our view that retail property values will continue to strengthen,\" the Citi analysts said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:35:48.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
