said management was striving to better control costs because of the slowdown.\n\"In these circumstances, we are continuing to sharpen our focus on the management of capital and on the control of expenses,\" Mr Smith said.\nHe nonetheless defended the bank’s strategy to chase growth in Asian markets.\n\"Our super regional strategy continues to provide us with differentiated sources of revenue and future growth options and it is underpinning our performance in every part of the business,\" Mr Smith said.\nYesterday, ANZ launched a $500 million retail share purchase offer — the last component of its $3 billion capital raising — giving eligible investors the chance to buy up to $15,000 of the company's stock.\nThe move follows the $2.5 billion institutional raising, as the nation's third-biggest lender looks to shore up its capital reserves to meet new regulatory guidelines due to start next year.\nIn recent months, CBA has tapped shareholders for $5 billion, and National Australia Bank has raised $5.5 billion as the big four all look to bolster their capital positions.\nWestpac is the only major lender yet to announce similar plans.\nAs previously released, ANZ's cash profit — a measure of underlying earnings — was $5.4 billion for the nine months to June on an unaudited basis.\nThat compares with $5.2 billion in the same period a year earlier.\nNet profit rose 11 per cent to $5.58 billion.\nCustomer deposits grew 9.5 per cent in the nine-month period, while net loans and advances rose 7.7 per cent.\nGross impaired assets decreased 3 per cent, while the total provision charge of $877 million or 21 basis points increased 13 per cent.\nANZ said while loss rates were expected to remain well under the long term average, it estimated that the total impairment charge for the year to September would be about $1.2 billion, or 21 basis points compared with 19 basis points last financial year.\nANZ Bank (Frame content direct link:
