Simon Bullard by Phillip Coorey Ewin Hannan Labor, unions and the Greens have demanded the resignation of the head of Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption amid revelations commissioner Dyson Heydon was scheduled to be the guest speaker at a Liberal Party fundraiser.\n\"He is conflicted, he is biased, it is a farce, \" said manager of Opposition business Tony Burke, as he attempted to suspend the business of Parliament to bring on a motion.\nAs the chaos took hold, Justice Dyson adjourned hearings of the commission and released a statement saying he had cancelled his appearance at the fundraiser. The event has been planned since April.\n\"The Commissioner Dyson Heydon will not be delivering the Sir Garfield Barwick address,\" it said.\n\"As early as 9.23 this morning (and prior to any media enquiry being received) he advised the organisers that \"If there was any possibility that the event could be described as a Liberal Party event he will be unable to give the address, at least whilst he is in the position of Royal Commissioner.\"\nAttorney-General George Brandis stood by Justice Heydon, saying his decision to withdraw from the fundraiser should be the end of the matter.\n\"There is no more eminent lawyer in Australia than Mr Heydon,\" he said, saying he only became aware of the mater when it broke in the media on Thursday morning.\nLabor, unions, Greens call for Heydon to quit Related Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

Just hours later, Justice Heydon pulled out.\n\"He has agreed to appear at an organised fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Australia,\" said shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus.\nMr Dreyfus said Labor would pursue the resignation in the Federal Court if Justice Heydon did not step aside. He called on Justice Heydon to disclose all his links with the Liberal Party, including whether he was a member.\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver said Justice Heydon's appearance showed the commission was politically-motivated.\n\"Unions have always said the royal commission is a political witch hunt and this revelation is proof of this claim,\" Mr Oliver said .\n\"It is time for Tony Abbott to shut down this Royal Commission.\"\nThe Greens industrial relations spokesman Adam Bandt said the Royal Commission should be immediately terminated.\n\"If a judge was discovered to be raising money for the prosecution, there'd be a mistrial and the case would be over,\" he said.\n'Very serious' Opposition leader Bill Shorten, who spent two days being grilled by the commission over his trade union day and who was personally taken to task by Commissioner Heydon, said the development was serious.\n\"If it is true that a royal commissioner investigating Tony Abbott's political opponents is now attending a Liberal Party fundraiser, that is incredibly serious, incredibly concerning,\" he told reporters.\n\"Labor has been consistent from the outset that we saw that Tony Abbott's royal commission was designed to smear his political opponents. If what you've said is true, that is very serious, it is very significant.\"\nJustice Heydon abruptly adjourned hearings of the commission just after 10am saying he had to adjourn for five minutes due to an urgent matter.\nThe commissioner returned 10 minutes later and hearings then resumed for another 40 minutes, until Justice Heydon departed again, saying \"another problem has come to my attention\".

Invitations say Justice Heydon is listed as they keynote speaker at the Sir Garfield Barwick Address on August 26 at the Castlereagh Boutique Hotel in Sydney.\nAn invitation written on a Liberal Party letterhead says the $80 cost should be made to the Liberal Party of Australia's NSW division. It also calls for donations if people are unable to attend.\n\"All proceeds from this event will be applied to state election campaigning,\" the invitation's fine print notes.\nAttorney-General George Brandis, who selected Justice Heydon to head the Royal Commission, addressed the same fundraiser in June 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:10:35.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
