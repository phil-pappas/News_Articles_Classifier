Against the yen, which is also used as a funding currency and is a more traditional safe haven, the dollar fell to its weakest in six weeks, down 0.7 percent on the day at 122.46 yen.\n\"In an eerie repeat of the 2013 taper tantrum, the latest risk selloff is mutating into a USD selloff,\" wrote Credit Agricole analysts. \"The taper tantrum was Fed-induced while the latest bout of risk aversion is fuelled by concerns about China. The USD-weakness thus seems to be more of a collateral damage.\" (Additional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in Singapore; Editing by Alison Williams/Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:59:51.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
