The finance minister now says the airline may need a half a billion dollar bailout. \nKenya Airways said its pre-tax loss had grown from 4.86 billion Kenyan shillings ($48 million) to 29.71 billion shillings ($293 million) in the ending in March 2015.

But Evanson Mwaniki, chairman of the airline's board of directors, said creating a state-owned enterprise wasn't the answer. \n\"We were there before and we did not make money.

Tourists are staying away from Kenya's palm-fringed beaches and safaris following a spate of lethal attacks by Islamist militants. \n\"We had growth of the fleet which was not matched by revenue growth,\" said the airline's finance director Alex Mbugua. The \"growth of fleet\" was the purchase of Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes which began in 2013. \nAmong Kenyans tweeting support for the carrier was Kenya Airways shareholder and owner of Capital FM, Chris Kirubi. \nStrategically we require Kenya Airways, it is our railway on air. #SavingKQ - Chris Kirubi (@CKirubi) August 1, 2015 \nKenya Airlines has been hit by competition from Gulf carriers, a loss of 5.78 billion shillings from hedging against fluctuations in the price of crude oil, and by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. \nHowever, Nairobi based economic analyst Rufus Mwanyasi sounded an optimistic note. \"If we go back to 2002, the company faced similar challenges and they were able to get out of it.\" \nKamanda Morara, an analyst with Shanti Research Limited, told Daily Nation the airline could survive if its debts were restructured, unnecessary assets disposed and costs cut. But if creditors demand what the airline owes them, then Kenya Airways would have to wind up. \nAuthor Mark Caldwell (Reuters, AFP) More on This \nPoor management decisions, operational inefficiencies and failure to counter competition are likely to have caused the … see more » Previous Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:22:21.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
