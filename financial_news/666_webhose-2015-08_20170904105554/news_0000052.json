But National Australia Bank slipped 21 cents to $33.11 and ANZ fell three cents to $30.57.\nMr Dan said an expected capital raising by Commonwealth Bank on Wednesday could see more volatility on the ASX.\nKEY FACTS\n* At 1018 AEST, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 15.1 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 5,524.3 points.\n* The broader All Ordinaries index was up 15.1 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 5,520 points.\n* The September share price index futures contract was up 21 points at 5,466, with 9,304 contracts traded.\n* At 1105 AEST, national turnover was 593 million securities worth $1.289 billion.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-share-market-recovery-continues/story-e6frfm30-1227478603652?sv=ccdc6a254d4689a6601f7c4688041d4a&title=Australian+share+market+recovers", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-share-market-recovery-continues/story-e6frfm30-1227478603652?sv=ccdc6a254d4689a6601f7c4688041d4a", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-share-market-recovery-continues/story-e6frfm30-1227478603652?sv=ccdc6a254d4689a6601f7c4688041d4a&h=Australian+share+market+recovers", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-share-market-recovery-continues/story-e6frfm30-1227478603652?sv=ccdc6a254d4689a6601f7c4688041d4a", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-share-market-recovery-continues/story-e6frfm30-1227478603652?sv=ccdc6a254d4689a6601f7c4688041d4a&title=Australian+share+market+recovers", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Australian+share+market+recovers&c=THE+Australian+share+market+has+continued+its+recovery+from+Friday%26%238217%3Bs+rout%2C+moving+higher+on+the+back+of+gains+by+key+stocks+and+strong+leads+from+Wall+Street.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-share-market-recovery-continues/story-e6frfm30-1227478603652?sv=ccdc6a254d4689a6601f7c4688041d4a"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T07:48:38.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
