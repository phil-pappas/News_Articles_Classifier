The report is their first since the creation of their Financials Division which was borne after the gaming operator announced three acquisitions of forex and CFD brokers . During the H1 period, Playtech completed its acquisition of TradeFX (recently renamed Markets Limited), while transactions for Plus500 and AvaTrade are expected to be completed in September. \nWith the acquisition of Markets Limited completed on May 7th, within Playtech’s current financials release include close to two months of revenues from its new Financials Division. During the close to two month period, Financials added €10.6 million in revenues. Playtech announced that overall, revenues at Markets Limited were $48.2 million during H1 2015, an increase of 60% compared to the same period in 2014. However, Playtech did state that the May and June period were 5% below that of 2014 due to “to very low market volatility”. \nLooking ahead, Playtech stated that the first 55 days of Q3 2015 were strong for Markets Limited, with growth in CFD trading, as first time CFD depositors increased 12% and total CFD customers were 19% higher. With their acquisitions of Plus500 and AvaTrade set to close during September, speculation within the industry has been how the gaming firm will integrate its three new brokers. With Markets, AvaTrade and Plus500 bringing to the table unique operational models, Playtech is expected to apply each broker’s strengths to the other brands. As an example, it is expected that Plus500’s marketing technology which provides automated search engine marketing, will be expanded to assist Markets and AvaTrade’s acquisition of new leads. \nIn addition, Markets.com is known for having a strong outbound sales and retention team to boost long term customer revenues. As such, with Plsu500 currently only using emails and automated marketing campaigns to close and engage customers, it is expected that Playtech initiate direct phone sales to help increase re-deposits of Plus500’s customer base.
