Then a flood of news reports hit about this unpaid U.N. intern being “ forced to live in a tent .”\nSo, now after the media furor, Hyde lacks not only a proper place to stay, but he also doesn’t even have that internship anymore.\nThe young Kiwi announced on Wednesday that he was resigning, saying he “felt that it would be too difficult to continue to focus on my work as an intern at this stage,” according to a New Zealand Herald article on Thursday. Here’s a picture of Hyde via a tweet from Australian news outlet SBS:\nUnpaid UN intern resigns after living in a tent to make ends meet http://t.co/Vof9g0R6SD pic.twitter.com/LgAyAq1S1O\n— SBS News (@SBSNews) August 12, 2015 The spotlight on Hyde comes as employers are increasingly criticized for offering unpaid internships. In the U.S., Labor Department rules have made it tougher for many companies to use unpaid interns, though some argue that hasn’t protected young people from exploitation , but rather deprived them of valuable professional experience.\nEven LeBron James faced criticism a couple of summers ago for advertising an unpaid internship.

The New Zealander acknowledged that he lied during his internship interview when asked whether he would be able to support himself during his stay, and he said “no person forced me to sleep in a tent,” according to a Guardian article .\nIn earlier news stories, he described packing up his gas stove and other possessions each morning into his backpack, then storing everything under his desk. His much-publicized plight led to offers of a place to stay , but it sounds like he won’t need that now.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11496435", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33893384", "http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/03/daily-chart", "https://twitter.com/SBSNews/status/631606170952728577", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/12/unpaid-un-intern-who-had-to-sleep-in-a-tent-quits-after-media-uproar", "http://t.co/Vof9g0R6SD", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11495916", "http://t.co/LgAyAq1S1O"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:23:55.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
