It is hoped that all pensioners who have Aadhaar numbers will make use of this additional facility of biometric life certification. \nPensioners can approach their paying branches with the PPO, Aadhaar card and bank pass book for trouble-free seeding of Pensioners' Aadhaar number in their bank account. \nConventionally, pensioners are required to give a Life Certificate to the pension disbursing authority in November, every year - either by presenting themselves before the Branch Manager or by means of a Certificate issued by a Gazetted Officer or other designated authorities. \nWith \"Jeevan Pramaan\" the pensioners and family pensioners need not visit the pension disbursing agency or Gazetted/designated authority for submission of Life Certificates. \nThe Life Certificates may be submitted from personal computers and laptops at home or by visiting a conveniently located Common Service Centre or the nearest branch of any pension disbursing bank. \nGoodReturns.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:35:47.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
