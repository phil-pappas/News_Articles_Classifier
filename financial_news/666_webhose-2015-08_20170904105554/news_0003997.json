Jim Rice by James Eyers The boss of the nation's largest bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Ian Narev, was paid $8.32 million in the 2015 financial year, including a $3.18 million cash bonus as the board rewarded him for the bank's technology performance and high levels of staff and customer satisfaction.\nHis pay packet was up 5 per cent on his $7.9 million in 2014, matching the increase in CBA's cash profit for the year.\nThe bank's annual report released on Monday, said Mr Narev, who last week presented the bank's record $9.14 billion full-year cash profit , received fixed pay of $2.65 million; the cash bonus ($1.59 million of which is paid next month, with the other half deferred to next July); $2.3 million in long-term equity rewards and about $200,000 in incidental payments..\nCBA senior executives are paid short-term bonus based on the board's assessment of customer focus (which the board said was above target in 2015); balance sheet strength (on target); productivity (on target); technology (above target); and employee engagement (above target). Long-term rewards are linked to total shareholder returns and customer satisfaction numbers.\nMr Narev's total remuneration actually received in 2015 was $7.97 million, which included $3.73 million in deferred cash and equity awarded in previous years but vested in 2015.\nThe next two-highest paid CBA executive were chief financial officer David Craig, whose total statutory remuneration in 2015 was $4.37 million (down from $4.7 million in 2014), and chief risk officer, Alden Toevs, who received $4.36 million (down from $4.9 million in 2014).\nThree group executives broke the $3 million mark in 2015: the head of wealth, Annabel Spring ($3.27 million, including a $1.32 million bonus); head of the retail bank, Matt Comyn ($3.17 million, including a $1.24 million bonus); and head of international financial services, Robert Jesudason ($3.09 million, including a $1.15 million bonus). The head of institutional banking and markets, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, received $2.95 million, including a $1.22 million bonus.\nStrong performance \"The year's strong performance and progress on longer term strategic initiatives resulted in executives, in aggregate, receiving above target short-term incentive awards,\" said CBA director Jane Hemstritch, who heads the remuneration committee.\nCompany secretary and general counsel David Cohen, received $2.88 million in 2015, while chief information officer David Whiteing got $2.23 million.\nMr Narev is not the highest-paid banking CEO in Australia: ANZ Banking Group's chief executive Mike Smith received a total salary of $10.7 million. ANZ and the two other big banks release their annual reports in November given their September year end.\nMs Hemstritch said the CBA board was continuing with a review of executive remuneration at CBA. No changes were being proposed for the 2016 financial year, she said, and final outcomes would be considered in relation to the 2017 financial year.\n\"Our strategy has served us well in aligning rewards to our executive team for achieving sound profitable growth and delivering value for shareholders. In a rapidly changing market, we need to ensure it continues to do so,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:09:58.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
