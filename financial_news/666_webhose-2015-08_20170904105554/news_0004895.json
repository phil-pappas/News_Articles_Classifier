Still, “we believe it will strengthen to a level consistent with our ratings by 2017.”\nHRG, which is backed by Richard Handler’s Leucadia National Corp., said in April that it is considering a sale of all or part of its stake in FGL. The insurer’s first-quarter profit was wiped out by losses on holdings related to RadioShack, including a loan that was arranged by HRG-owned Salus Capital Partners.\nThe developing outlook means the ratings firm could lift or lower the Des Moines, Iowa-based company’s grade in the next 12 to 18 months, or keep it the same. The eventual decision will be influenced by the insurer’s ability to build capital, S&P said, and would also take into account any changes that occur if the company finds a buyer.\nA representative for FGL had no immediate comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:15:07.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
