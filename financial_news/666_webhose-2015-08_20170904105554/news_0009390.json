The survey, just like previous ones, revealed that it is easiest to make calls on Airtel in the region because there is no congestion. Users could also maintain conversations on Airtel’s network because call drops are not as prevalent as they are on other networks. \nLast year, Airtel received positive reviews in NCA’s surveys on Network Quality conducted throughout Ashanti, Upper East and West, Central, Volta, Northern, Eastern and Greater Accra regions. \nIn a related development, at the 9 th edition of Festival of ideas in Accra, Airtel Ghana’s Managing Director, Lucy Quist, speaking on Quality Assurance said her Company’s constant sterling service quality could be attributed to its commitment to consistent quality customer service practices and its insatiable desire to remain the most loved in the country. \nFestival of Ideas, originally known as the Infopreneurship Conference, is widely acknowledged as Ghana’s most prestigious business conference that brings together CEOs, top management officials from corporate institutions, and professionals from diverse sectors of the economy under one roof for insightful presentations, corporate training, brainstorming and networking. \nThis year’s theme “Business with Integrity” anchored on five main pillars; Compliance & Systemic Integrity, Corporate Governance, Quality Assurance, Leadership by Example and Corporate Values & Ethics. \nMrs. Lucy Quist, an international business leader, spoke on the topic Standards & Quality Assurance. She espoused in her presentation that standards of quality are set by the expectations of the ultimate consumer and it should be the goal of all involved in the business to meet this expectation. \nAirtel has been a trailblazer in Ghana’s telecommunication industry since the launch of its services in 2008. Following its 3.75G data network launch in 2012, it has provided nothing but trend-setting products and services. Airtel Care Application, Data Rollover, Data Kredit, Airtel Insurance, Airtel Dual Voucher and Health and Fitness App are among the trend-leading innovations from Airtel Ghana.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T02:51:49.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
