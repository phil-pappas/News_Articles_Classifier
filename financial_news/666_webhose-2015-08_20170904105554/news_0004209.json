The group had purchased an education group called Wireless Generation for $360 million in 2010. \nOne of the Amplify projects was a tablet computer aimed at primary and secondary schools. \nMurdoch, who spun off News Corp.'s faster-growing media-entertainment operations into 21st Century Fox in 2013, has been gradually moving away from day-to-day operations at the companies. \nAt News Corp. he holds the title of executive chairman and his son Lachlan is co-chairman. \nA similar arrangement was announced this year at 21st Century Fox, where Murdoch's son James is chief executive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T01:56:10.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
