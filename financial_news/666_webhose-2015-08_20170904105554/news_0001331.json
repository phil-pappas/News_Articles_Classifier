The monthly record was driven by small private refineries buying crude, according to preliminary data from the General Administration of Customs . \n\"A major reason for the selloff in oil has been concern about Chinese demand,\" Price Futures Group Senior Market Analyst Phil Flynn told Bloomberg . \"It's clear from this data the demand hasn't crashed.\" \nThe Chinese data comes after Baker Hughes ( BHI ) announced the number of active U.S. oil rigs grew for the third week in a row last week. The total U.S. rig count rose by six to 670 rigs the week ending August 7. \nValero is an international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels based in San Antonio, TX. \nAbout 6.2 million shares of Valero were traded by 3:29 p.m. Monday, above the company's average trading volume of about 5.9 million shares a day. \nTheStreet Ratings team rates VALERO ENERGY CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of A+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate VALERO ENERGY CORP (VLO) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and attractive valuation levels. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Powered by its strong earnings growth of 118.03% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 28.13% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, VLO should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year. VALERO ENERGY CORP reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue.

This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($8.02 versus $6.98).
