He had also won many film awards.\nThe complaint was frivolous and vexatious and hence the forum should direct Manavalan to delete his name in the complaint and consequently dismiss it with costs, he said.\nWhen the case came up today, Judicial member K Annamalai and member M Murugesan directed Manavalan to submit his reply on September 9, 2015 after he sought time to do so.\nManavalan, in his petition, pointed out that the Madurai bench of state Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had issued notices to seven persons, including Chairman-cum- Managing Director of Nestle India Ltd, actors Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit, Preity Zinta and the Commissioner of Food Safety (Chennai).\nIt had also directed the designated officer of the Deputy Director of Health Services, Madurai, to lift at random samples of Maggi noodles with tastemaker from different shops and to test them at the appropriate laboratory, he said.\nThe bench had directed the officer to file a test report along with opposite parties’ opinion on safety of consuming Maggi noodles.\n“Prima facie case made out in the complaint. Considering the seriousness of the allegations pertaining to the health and public safety of the consumers, we are inclined to grant the relief sought for by the petitioner,” the Commission had said.\nThe petitioner had also sought the forum’s directions to Nestle India not to distribute Maggi noodles and to withdraw it from sale, saying it was in violation of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.\nManavalan had sought a direction from the forum to the actors not to promote the product through advertisements containing ‘false representations’ about the quality and safety of the product.\n 21, 2015 8:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:50:42.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
