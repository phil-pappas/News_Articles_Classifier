He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 12. \nFederal prosecutors say the Social Security Administration was never notified of Clarke's mother's death in January 1998. They say Clarke continued receiving her monthly retirement benefits that were deposited into a joint bank account until last October. \nThis story has been corrected to show that defendant's last name is spelled Clarke, not Clark. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T19:39:42.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
