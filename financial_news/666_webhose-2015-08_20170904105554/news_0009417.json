But the tribe hopes it will bring economic growth to the area. (Submitted image: White Earth Nation) New casino coming to northwest Minnesota By: Brian Johnson August 18, 2015 7:02 am 0 \nWith its planned new casino on the outskirts of Bagley in Clearwater County, the White Earth Nation vows to bring more than new gaming options to northwest Minnesota. \nThe new Shooting Star Casino on Highway 27 between Ebro and Bagley, scheduled to open in spring 2016, will kick-start economic growth in and around Clearwater County, and bring 40 permanent new jobs to the area, the tribe says. \nBill Marsh, general manager of the White Earth Nation’s Shooting Star Casino, said the project will provide opportunities for Native American subcontractors during construction. \n“Our hope is to secure Native American contractors for the job, and there are a number of good ones out there,” he said. \nAs for the permanent jobs after construction, “We are one of the highest-paying employers in the area, so we should bring some good wage positions to those communities,” Walsh said. \nDesigned by Cuningham Group in Minneapolis, the project is scheduled to start next month. \nMarsh said civil engineers will be at the project site later this week. The goal is to have a contractor on board within the next month and start digging in September. \n“We want to have the foundation and footings in by around Nov. 15 to beat the frost, and that way we can continue to build through the winter,” Marsh said. \nTribal leaders aren’t disclosing the cost or square-footage. \nMarsh said the casino will include black jack and “Texas hold ’em” tables, a “large selection of slot machines,” and “one of the nicest bar and grill facilities in the region.” \nThe new casino won’t be as big as the White Earth Nation’s Shooting Star Casino in Mahnomen, which has a hotel and event center. But future expansion is a possibility, Marsh said. \nShooting Star Casino said in a press release that the project will expand the White Earth Nation’s footprint in a region it has historically inhabited, diversify the tribe’s operations, and fund services to improve life for White Earth Nation members. \nBagley has a population of 1,400 and is about 27 miles west of Bemidji. Marsh said the new casino will draw visitors from Bemidji and other towns within a 50-mile radius. \nThomas Zitt, senior vice president of the Innovation Group, a gaming and hospitality consulting firm in New Orleans, said a number of other tribes have opened “satellite facilities” to go with their flagship property. \nZitt isn’t working on the Shooting Star project. But speaking as an outsider, he said it looks like the White Earth Tribe will be well-positioned to capture the Fargo and Grand Forks, North Dakota, markets with the new casino. \n“If you live in either of those cities, it’s a pretty good distance to get to another competing facility,” he said. \nOne potential downside: The new casino will be a bit off the beaten track from Highway 2, a major corridor that serves Grand Forks, Bemidji, and Duluth, Zitt said. \nWhite Earth Nation opened its existing Shooting Star Casino in Mahnomen in 1991, and expanded it in 2001. The location includes the casino, a 15,000-square-foot space for concerts, 3,000 square feet for meetings and events, and a 386-room hotel.
