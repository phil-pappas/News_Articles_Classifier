The investors assert that U.S. Bank, as trustee for the MASTR Adjustable Rate Mortgage Trust 2006-OA2, harmed certificateholders in failing to timely request repurchase of defective mortgage loans by the sponsor, UBS Real Estate Securities. The investors cite recent decisions, previously covered here and here , out of the New York federal court dismissing the trustee’s claims against U.B.S. as time-barred as to certain loans. The complaint includes claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of New York’s Streit Act.
