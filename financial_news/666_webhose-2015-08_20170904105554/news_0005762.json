Picture: AFP\nThe bank’s eligible retail shareholders — those who owned shares before the rights issue was announced last week — have until the close of business on September 8 to elect to buy shares in the program. But if they choose to sell their entitlements, they must do so on the stockmarket by September 1, or accept the proceeds allocated in a bookbuild on September 14.\nCBA head of capital management Tricia Ho-Hudson said it was preferable for shareholders to “make an active decision­”. “They can watch over the two-week period and decide the price they want to sell (their entitlements) at. (If not) it will sell in bookbuild and you have only one price,” she said.\nThe bank announced the cash call last Wednesday as it unveiled a record $9.1 billion full-year net profit.\nMr Tonucci acknowledged there had been widespread speculation among analysts that the $5 billion capital raising program was too small and the bank would be forced to shake the can again in the coming year.\nThe banking watchdog, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, is pushing the banks to set aside more cash and account for more risk in their mortgage lending.\nThe international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is also expected to soon announce its recommendations for how banks can insulate themselves against potential future financial shocks.\n“I think there has been a lot of speculation by analysts about filling capital requirements ... (and that) these is still more capital needed,” Mr Tonucci said.\n“Our view is we sized this to cover the implementation of the new mortgage rules — that really represents the bulk of capital change.”\nThe CBA’s program is the second biggest in Australian history after NAB earlier this year tapped investors for $5.5 billion.\nMacca’s view\njeff.whalley@news.com.au\n One trip to the well for CBA", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/cba-dismisses-speculation-of-further-cash-calls/story-fni0dcne-1227487544685", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/08/17/1227487/544657-b466352e-44ba-11e5-bc34-34ddf35a38db.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/08/17/1227487/544631-8485a512-44bd-11e5-ac0e-632009ba126e.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-18T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T23:07:02.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
