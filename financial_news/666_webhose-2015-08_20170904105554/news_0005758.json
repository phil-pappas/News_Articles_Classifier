Sluggish growth in China and other Asian economies may also dent exports, keeping the BOJ under pressure to expand stimulus.\nMany analysts say weak GDP data alone won't trigger an immediate monetary easing.\nBut economists have already sharply cut their growth forecasts for the current fiscal year on expectations of a big contraction in April-June, and expect the BOJ to do so too when it reviews its long-term projections in October.\nPolitical factors, however, may discourage the BOJ from expanding its already massive asset buying stimulus programme. Abe's close aides have signalled that further easing is unwelcome as it could spur further falls in the yen which would boost import prices and the cost of living for households.\n\"The yen already fell a lot but that didn't help the economy much. Trying to trigger further yen falls with additional easing could back-fire and hit households,\" Kato said.\nJapan's economy suffered a mild recession last year as consumption took a hit from a sales tax hike in April 2014. Growth rebounded this year, only to slow again as exports and consumption remained disappointingly weak.
