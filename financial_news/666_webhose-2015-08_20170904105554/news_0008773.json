This however does not mean a reduction in our traditional hard copy readers. Ghanaians still like to read a physical newspaper and turn the pages. \nWe are only increasing our customer base by adding extra accessibility for those who prefer mobile news, or may not find it convenient to purchase the physical newspaper on a daily basis. We have also worked very hard on our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram access so our breaking stories and news can be seen conveniently across multiple platforms. \nMr Blay added, 'Another key aspect for our publications is advertising and giving our clients an ever-growing return on every Cedi they spend advertising with us. With this mobile app and our social media presence, advertising campaigns placed via our brands get to reach multiple layers of readers and consumers.' \nThe current version of the mobile app is available to Android users with an IOS version for Iphone users soon to be released. \nThe app gives users the option to subscribe to an SMS based service to receive breaking news alerts in real time when they happen and ensure subscribers never miss the latest stories. \nThere are other user options like voice your own opinion and connect with the editorial team by commenting on stories and sharing your favourite articles with friends through integrated social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp. \nThe Daily Guide mobile app is currently available for free download from the daily guide website, www.dailyguideghana.com and the Android store. \nA business desk report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:24:43.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
