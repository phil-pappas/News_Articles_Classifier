Bloomberg Share on twitter by John McDuling A year is not a long time for a wine vintage, but it's a very long time in the wine business.\nThis time a year ago, Treasury Wine Estates, Australia's biggest listed wine company, was struggling . The company, which was spun out of the brewing giant Foster's back in 2011, lost more than $100 million after it was forced to literally destroy millions of bottles of its wine due to oversupply in the market.\nToday, it's stock has soared 15 per cent after the company delivered a $73 million profit. It looks like Treasury might have finally cracked China, which loois poised to become its biggest market in the next few years. And it has at least one ace up its sleeve as it looks to continue its good run into the new financial year. It involves the often derided pink coloured beverage known as ​rosé, or brosé as some people calling it this northern hemisphere summer.\nMen drinking rose, or brose has been a bit of a talking point in the US and Europe this summer. Apparently, people are switching from drinking craft beer to it, causing all sorts of thinkpieces on the matter.\nOne of these wines is not like the others. Treasury Wine Estates Sticking to business, Treasury is looking to capitalise on the clear bromentum in the category.\n\"We are looking to further develop the rosé offerings in our portfolio and see a lot of potential for that in the US, Australia and other markets,\" a Treasury spokesman told Fairfax Media.\nTreasury's existing products include some of Australia's oldest, most prestigious (and expensive) wines, like the Penfolds range, which has been around since the 1844, to less prestigious brands like Lindemanns. Later this year it will add the \"Squealing Pig\" Central Otago Pinot Noir Rosé to its line up just in time for Australia's summer.\nWhile the company already has a couple of roses in its portfolio (from the Lindemanns, Fifth Leg and Annie's brands), this one will be the first in the more expensive mass-tige (mass prestige) category. In other words, the one that should have the most appeal in the affluent young man, or \"bro\", demographic.\nSo brosé is coming to Australia this summer. Whether it catches on, we'll have to wait to find out.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-21/treasury-plunges-to-loss-on-us-wine-destruction/5686522", "http://www.details.com/blogs/daily-details/2015/06/brose-pink-wine-for-men.html", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling"], "published": "2015-08-19T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:04:22.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
