Rockefeller III.\nRelated\nAsia Society Names Leader Nam June Paik Exhibition Opens at Asia Society in New York Review of ‘Buddhist Art of Myanmar’ at the Asia Society Museum: Crash Course in Nirvana Asia Society President Josette Sheeran said the institution’s search for a museum director was the first arts hire in a strategic plan that began a rollout in 2014. Among the ongoing agenda items is to build a board in which half the trustees are from Asia and half from the West.\n“We are a globally deployed institution,” said Ms. Sheeran, adding that to maintain and heighten that active presence, the Society interviewed people from all over Asia for the museum role. “We were determined to find someone with a finger on the pulse of the exploding, dynamic art scene in Asia.”\nMr. Tan managed Singapore’s pavilion at the 50th Venice Biennale and was assistant chief executive for museums and programs under Singapore’s National Heritage Board.\n“He brings expertise from curation and administration,” said Ms. Sheeran. “Singapore is such a crossroads. It really showed in his perspective.”\nAsia Society’s museum exhibits traditional Asian art, as well as an extensive collection of photography and new-media works by Asian and Asian-American artists.\nAmong his new duties will be overseeing those collections, as well as orchestrating dialogue about the Asian art field through directing the Asia Society Arts and Museum Network and its Arts & Museum Summit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:24:21.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
