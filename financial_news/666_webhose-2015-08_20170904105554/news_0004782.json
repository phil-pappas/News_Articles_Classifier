This nonsense must not be accepted by Zimbabweans,\" he said. \nAt least 20 000 people have lost their jobs since July 17 when Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku delivered a Supreme Court judgment that activated a common law provision giving employers and employees the same rights regarding the termination of contracts. \nChidyausiku ordered that employers could just like workers terminate contracts after giving three months' notice leaving the cumbersome and expensive retrenchment route. \nThe judgment was followed by massive dismissals but Mugabe's government has since moved in to stop the rot, announcing that Parliament would be recalled this week to deal with the emotive issue. \nIn the proposed amendments, employers will need to pay-out contracts and fire workers on fair and reasonable grounds. \nChivasa said in line with the need for social justice and \"protecting thousands of families who are being subjected to poverty, it is clear that law can apply in retrospect\". \n\"The NCA party therefore calls upon Parliament to play its role responsibly by ensuring that the new law applies not only for the future but also remedial of the irresponsible behavior by the employers as witnessed in the past four weeks. \n\"We believe that if the law is applied for the future only it will be unconstitutional and unfair discrimination against those who were unfairly dismissed. \nThis is so because since 1980 there was no termination on notice until 17 July 2015 when the Supreme Court ruling was given,\" the statement said. \n\"This means that if the law is applied for the future then the only employees who would have been dismissed on notice since independence would be those who lost their jobs in the past four weeks. There is no justifiable basis for this discrimination,\" said Chivasa. \nHowever the party called for an increase in the minimum retrenchment package being proposed to one month salary for every year rather than the two weeks in the proposal.
