Australia’s Macquarie is also thought to be eyeing a consortium bid. \nInfrastructure investors are lining up to swoop on City after Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the private equity firm that owns a host of energy and transport assets including Gatwick, announced at the start of the month it wanted to sell the airport . Borealis and Allianz are already important investors in British infrastructure and are viewed as natural suitors for City. \nToronto-based Borealis jointly owns the high-speed rail link between London and the Channel Tunnel with OTPP, and is a shareholder in Associated British Ports. \nAllianz, meanwhile, is one of a group of investors that is backing the £4.2 bn Thames Tideway Tunnel, the “super-sewer” project which gained financing approval last week from water regulator Ofwat. Furthermore, Borealis and Allianz have worked together on transactions in the past, including a €1.6  bn (£1.17 bn) deal to buy a RWE’s Czech gas pipeline business in 2013. \nThe two groups earlier this month partnered with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Munich Re to purchase Tank & Rast, the owner of German motorway services. \nCity airport is viewed as something of a trophy asset in the infrastructure world. Located close to both Canary Wharf and the City, it is convenient for workers in the capital’s financial districts and so inevitably carries a high proportion of business travellers. \nSome bankers reckon £2 bn is a top-end valuation for the airport but feasible given the current frothy nature of the market for infrastructure assets. \nDermot Desmond, the Irish billionaire businessman, bought City for £23.5 m from construction business Mowlem 20 years ago. He went on to sell it to GIP for about £750 m in 2006 . \nThe airport has enjoyed strong growth, catering for 3.7m passengers last year compared with 2.8m in 2010. However, uncertainty over its mooted £200 m expansion plan could mean that bids fall short of GIP’s asking price. \nBoris Johnson , the London mayor, recently blocked the airport’s proposal to boost capacity because of concerns about the increase in aircraft noise. The airport is appealing against his decision and, if it succeeds, City hopes that expansion will allow it to carry 6m passengers a year by 2023. \nSpokesmen for Borealis and Allianz declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T23:15:20.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
