Reuters Share on twitter by Karen Maley Will the US central bank raise short-term interest rates next month and will Beijing be able to cushion the slowdown in the Chinese economy? They're the two big questions roiling global financial markets at present.\nInvestors are no closer to an answer to the first question with the minutes of the US Federal Reserve's July policy meeting, showing that US policymakers are deeply divided on whether to raise US interest rates.\nThe Fed's minutes, released on Wednesday, put a positive spin on the split, saying that although most US central bank officials considered that the time was not yet ripe for raising rates, \"they noted that conditions were approaching that point\".\nAll the same, it's clear there's a heated debate on whether US inflation is on track to reach the US central bank's 2 per cent target.\nJanet Yellen chairs the Federal Reserve, which has put a positive spin on the split among policymakers as to whether to raise interest rates. Reuters The official, more sanguine, line is that US inflation is likely to edge higher towards 2 per cent \"as the labour market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated\".\nSceptics But some Fed officials questioned this position, pointing out that further declines in oil and other commodity prices, along with the strengthening US dollar, will keep US inflation low.\nAnd these sceptics are likely to be proved correct, particularly as the downward pressure on US prices has only increased since China's surprise move last week to devalue its currency, the yuan.\n A lower yuan means that Chinese exporters are able to sell their products in global markets at even cheaper prices, forcing competitors to cut their prices in order to maintain market share, and spreading deflationary pressures through global markets.\nIn addition, a lower Chinese currency increases the cost of commodity imports such as oil, aluminium and copper, which are denominated in US dollars. This will further reduce China's demand for commodities, which has already wilted as a result of slower Chinese economic activity.\nWorries about a sharp contraction in demand due to the slowing Chinese economy have sparked a massive sell-off in commodity markets, the oil price plunging to a fresh six-year low overnight.\nAt their July meeting, some US central bank officials were concerned that a rise in US interest rates would push the US dollar higher, \"extending the downward pressure on commodity prices and the weakness in net exports\".\nIn addition, others noted the risk that a \"material slowdown\" in Chinese growth \"could pose risks to the US economic outlook\".\nIt's precisely this question of whether Beijing will be able to avert this \"material slowdown\" that's troubling investors at present.\nAnd they found little reassurance from the rebound in the Chinese sharemarket in late trading on Wednesday. The Shanghai Composite Index, which had fallen by as much as 5 per cent in trading, closed up 1.2 per cent at the close after several companies disclosed that state-backed companies were among their top shareholders, which reassured investors that Beijing was continuing to support the sharemarket.\nBut although Beijing has shown that it is willing and prepared to manipulate the prices of financial assets, such as shares and its exchange rate, investors are deeply concerned that the Chinese leadership is struggling to avert a sharp slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.\nAs a result, the latest outbreak of turbulence in financial markets shows little sign of abating.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-08-20T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:45:40.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
