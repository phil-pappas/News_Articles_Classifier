By Richard Dyson | Telegraph – 23 minutes ago 14,700.00 +100.00 \nAsk an expert: we answer a reader's query about how, and when, valuable items can be given away in lieu of death tax \nI have read about heirlooms being used to offset IHT owed. My father died recently, leaving a valuable Chinese vase worth thousands of pounds. I am considering giving it and other items to a local museum to preserve his memory, and also perhaps as a way of cutting our hefty inheritance tax bill. How does this work? AC, by email \nTax laws allow those liable to pay inheritance tax (IHT) to give items to the state in lieu of tax - but the items have to be sufficiently special, says James Hender, partner at accountancy firm Saffery Champness. \n\"Heirlooms would in principle be acceptable.\" he said, \"It is important that it is you, and not someone else, who is liable to pay that tax. \n\"If all the IHT has already been paid (for example, by the executors) there would no longer be a liability and hence the question of an offer in lieu of that tax could not arise.\" \nBut satisfying HMRC that the item is of sufficient rarity and importance is likely to be the biggest hurdle. \n\"If you are the liable person, the next question is whether any object you might wish to offer in payment meets the relevant, very high, standard. \n\"It must be 'pre-eminent for its national, scientific, historic or artistic interest'. HMRC would need you to provide evidence that it meets that standard, with a valuation; and you might well need specialist advice for this.\" \n• New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) inheritance tax rules: we answer your questions \nIn reaching its own assessments of quality and value HMRC would take advice from the independent Acceptance In Lieu Panel of Arts Council England. \nAfter that it would be open to you to couple your offer to HMRC with a wish that the object would, if accepted, be allocated to a museum of your choosing, said Mr Hender. \n\"HMRC would take advice here too but would, if possible, accommodate your wish. You can make allocation a condition of your gift; but the offer would fail if HMRC were unable to agree to your condition.\" \nIf your objects are accepted, you would not pay IHT on their value. \nOn top of that, as part of the acceptance, your IHT cash payment would usually be reduced by 70pc of their market value. \nMr Hender adds that \"if the value of the objects exceeded the tax for which you were liable, HMRC would not refund the difference in cash.\" \nIf your heirlooms did not meet the \"pre-eminent standard\" it would still be possible to donate them to a museum. \nAs long as the museum met certain conditions the gift would be free from IHT and capital gains tax. \nA simpler way of dealing with the above process, if your late father has died within the last two years, would be to redirect the gift to you under his will to the museum. Subject to certain formalities the IHT rules might then treat your gift as though it had been a bequest by your father, and hence exempt from IHT on his death. \nGot a question for our experts?
