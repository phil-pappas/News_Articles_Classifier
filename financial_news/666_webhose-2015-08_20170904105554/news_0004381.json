Each year, the amount typically fell between $2 million and $4 million. \nBut those unclaimed winnings aren't lost. They go toward property tax relief in Wisconsin, showing up as a gaming credit on property tax bills. \nLottery officials have said they believe many of the winning lotto game tickets were accidentally thrown in the trash or tucked into pockets and forgotten. They said some players may toss their tickets because they didn't win the jackpot and weren't interested in redeeming smaller cash prizes. \nInformation from: Post-Crescent Media, http://www.postcrescent.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:36:14.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
