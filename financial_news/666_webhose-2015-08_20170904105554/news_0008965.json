It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also recently acquired the YouTube rival Dailymotion , one of several online services that provide a platform for Peppa Pig. \nAfter selling its telecoms assets in recent years, Vivendi is focused on building up its global scale as a media rights owner and distributor. \nHowever, it is understood that Vivendi is not currently in discussions with Entertainment One. Sources familiar with the British company said it was not now looking to be acquired. \nTakeover options have been explored as Entertainment One’s biggest shareholder, the investment fund Marwyn, has sought to cash in on the company’s rapid growth. It sold a 9pc stake and gave up its seat on the board in July , sending the shares tumbling. \nMarwyn remains an 18pc shareholder and says it “continues to be excited by the scale of opportunity that faces Entertainment One going forward”. \nEntertainment One has grown rapidly as demand for content rights from pay-TV operators and internet-based on-demand services, such as Amazon and Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) , has ballooned. The firm’s stock market valuation has climbed towards £1bn as it has built a large library of film and television rights through acquisitions, and is now focused on expanding its production arm. \nIn a Telegraph interview earlier this year, Darren Throop, Entertainment One’s chief executive, argued the company was nevertheless undervalued by the London market, which has few remaining media stocks. \nAll parties declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T01:00:24.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
