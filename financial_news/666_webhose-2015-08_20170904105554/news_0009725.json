Mr Rooney negotiated the sale.\nLachlan MacGillivray​, head of retail investment services at Colliers International, said the improving retail trading conditions are fuelling further confidence in retail investors.\n\"A lack of supply and record levels of demand for high-performing assets are contributing to yield compression,\" Mr MacGillivray said.\n\"However, this has not deterred investors, particularly those from offshore, who accounted for 16 per cent of all transactions in the sector, showing a particularly strong interest for assets with development potential.\nThe yield compression in retail, being driven by a pricing disconnect between prime office and retail, is expected to see record pricing for any quality retail assets that come to market, he said.\nMr Rooney said investors continue to pursue a range of transaction structures, joint ventures and capital partnership arrangements.\n\"Paradise Centre, Queensland and the ARIO Portfolio of three assets in Queensland are the most recent deals that have come to market and are expected to transact for in excess of $240 million and $200 million respectively. The ARIO Portfolio will be offered individually or in one line.\n\"Most investors remain open to a wider variety of investment opportunities to access scarcely available assets and achieve solid returns while at the same time remaining prudently cautious towards risk.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:33:12.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
