Sunteck is among those that emerged relatively unscathed from the global meltdown and a domestic slowdown, even as bigger rivals found themselves holding excess inventory amid dwindling sales.\nHome sales in India’s top six property markets fell 8 percent in the quarter through March from a year earlier, according to research firm Liases Foras, which estimates it will take at least 46 months to find buyers for unsold homes in Mumbai alone.\nSurging Debt Some of India’s largest developers have seen debt surge more than 60 percent as mortgage rates around 10 percent deter buyers. Debt at Godrej Properties Ltd. climbed 63 percent to 27.64 billion rupees ($431 million) in the quarter through March 31 from a year earlier, while DLF Ltd., India’s biggest, saw a 7.7 percent increase in its net debt to 209.7 billion rupees.\nSunteck, with a net debt at 9.6 billion rupees as of March 31, said it will take advantage of its relatively better balance sheet to acquire assets, Khetan said.\nThe Mumbai-based company plans to build condominiums and offices after purchasing the assets, and may lend its brand to help complete projects that are stuck, he said. It may even develop property jointly with the existing builder, he said.\nFunds are chasing commercial properties more for better returns, and Sunteck may look to double the share of its office and retail assets to about 40 percent and cut residential assets from 80 percent if there is increased demand, Khetan said.\nHis aim is to boost rental income from yield generating commercial assets 10-fold to 2 billion rupees in the next three to four years.\nWarburg Pincus Even as Khetan expects higher prices for his condominium projects, Pankaj Kapoor at consulting firm Liases Foras Real Estate Rating & Research Pvt. says high-end home sales will remain subdued over the next few years and prices will stagnate.\n“The luxury residential market will remain slow for the next two to three years,” said Kapoor, founder of Liases Foras. “We will see a time correction even as sales start to pick up.”\nPrivate-equity property funds disclosed 64 investments last year in India, of which 54 had a combined value of $2 billion, according to data from Venture Intelligence. The number of transactions was 14 percent higher than the 56 investments, with 52 disclosed deals valued at $1.86 billion in 2013.\nWarburg Pincus LLC said last month it will invest 18 billion rupees in Piramal Realty Ltd. Sunteck has private equity investments from Kotak Alternate Opportunities (India) Fund.\nSunteck, whose cost of borrowing is about 12 percent, will look for strategic partners to grow without raising its debt levels, Khetan said. Shares of the company have declined 2.5 percent this year, versus an 11 percent drop in the S&P BSE India Realty Index comprising 13 stocks.\n“We now feel there are lot of distressed assets in the market so we can grow the company to a different level, but we will require capital,” Khetan said. “We will look to cut our debt levels further and still do acquisitions with our strong cash flows.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T02:12:38.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
