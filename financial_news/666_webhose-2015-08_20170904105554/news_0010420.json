It said they had admitted their crimes, but did not provide details or say whether they were related to the reporter and the official from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). \nThe article said the reporter for Caijing, Wang Xiaolu, admitted to colluding with others in \"fabricating and spreading false information about the transactions of securities and futures.\" After a semicolon, the sentence continues, saying Liu Shufan, an official at the CSRC's stock issuance department, admitted to \"insider trading, forging official documents and stamps and taking bribes.\" The Xinhua article did not say how the two cases were linked. \nWang wrote an article published by Caijing on July 20, amid the government's unprecedented efforts to save the stock market. It said the regulator had started researching possible scenarios for state-backed investors to pull out from the market. The way the article was written those scenarios could involve anything from an end to stock-buying to selling shares already purchased. A CSRC spokesperson dismissed the Caijing story as false that day. \nThe Xinhua report said Wang told investigators that he regretted having \"irresponsibly fabricated and spread a false report,\" knowing that the information in it would have severe impact on the bourse. He said he learned the information through private connections, but did not name those people. \nThe Xinhua report also said Liu took advantage of his position to help a listed company issue extra shares and received several million yuan in return from a person surnamed Wu who manages the company. He also illegally made more than 1 million yuan by trading the firm's shares through a relative's trading account and made several million yuan illegally via other deals, the report said. \nLiu admitted to forging stamps for the CSRC, a court and the civil affairs office in Beijing's Xicheng District to fake divorce papers and buy properties for his mistress in Shanghai, Xinhua said. \nThe Xinhua report also revealed the identity of four Citic Securities employees who were taken away by the police earlier, including Xu Gang and Liu Wei, who sit on the executive committee that manages the company. The other two are Fang Qingli, who oversaw the firm's margin trading and short-selling operations, and Chen Rongjie, director of alternative investment department. \nThese are among the eight people that Xinhua said on August 25 had been detained by the police . It did not say who the other four are. It is unclear whether or how these people are connected with Wang and Liu. \n(Compiled by Wang Yuqian) Financial Reporter, CSRC Official Detained, State Media Says Journalist for financial news magazine accused of spreading false information and CSRC official said to be involved in insider trading Compiled by Caixin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:36:57.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
