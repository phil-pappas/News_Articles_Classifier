The committee will then take necessary action against company owners who are found violating the law.\"\n\nMajor General Bin Surour said that records from almost 10,000 company visits found that 9,662 inspected firms were compliant. He added that the PCLA-Dubai patrols closely monitor areas in Bur Dubai and Deira.\n\nHe said that the inspections are part of the PCLA commitment towards protecting labours' rights and ensuring their safety and are provided with a healthy work place and environment, which includes their protection from the hazards of working under direct sunlight and dangerous high temperatures.\n\nIn early July, the PCLA launched an awareness campaign among employers and workers on the importance of abiding with the law which is also based on risk-prevention. It also urged companies to provide water and cold juices during resting periods.\n\n\"We have to take all kind of preventive measures to protect outdoor workers against the summer heat,\" Bin Surour said.\n\nThe decision, which was implemented in 2005, was launched to promote health and safety precautions for outdoor workers while on duty, in accordance to international standards. A fine of AED5,000 per worker will be imposed on companies violating the midday break rule.\n\nInspection patrols are conducted between 12pm-3pm daily, and will continue until September 15th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:37:20.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
