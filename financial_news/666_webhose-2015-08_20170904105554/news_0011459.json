Levels last week were 0.4 per cent lower than a year ago.\n“The longer that the sell-off on global markets continues, the more impact it will have,” CommSec chief economist Craig James said.\n Volatility ‘won’t scare off shoppers’", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/volatility-wont-scare-off-shoppers/story-fni0dcne-1227498703822"], "published": "2015-08-26T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T17:31:07.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
