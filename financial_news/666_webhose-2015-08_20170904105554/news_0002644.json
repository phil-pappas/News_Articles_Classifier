US retail sales rise more than expected in July By Michele Maatouk | Sharecast â€“ 55 minutes ago Print \n  US retail sales rose 0.6% in July from May, according to data released by the US Commerce Department, beating expectations of a 0.5% increase. The figures for May, meanwhile, were revised up from a 0.3% fall to flat. \nDennis de Jong, managing director UFX.com , noted that every piece of data coming out of the US in the next couple of weeks has taken on extra significance as it could be the difference between an interest rate hike in September or December. \n\"Janet Yellen and her Fed colleagues will be pouring over everything ahead of their meeting in September and she will be encouraged that retail sales have bounced back slightly from a disappointing performance in June,\" he said. \n\"Consumer confidence isn't quite where the Fed would want it to be, although the labour market is looking fairly resilient and today's figures are unlikely to make Yellen delay any longer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T18:14:05.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
