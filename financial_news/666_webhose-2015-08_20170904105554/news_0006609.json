Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3 percent.\nMSCI's all-country world stock index eased 0.31 percent.\nBritain's FTSE 100 closed down 0.4 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst index of 300 leading shares managed a gain of 0.2 percent, after earlier declines. Germany's DAX dropped 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 fell 0.3 percent.\nThe worries about China came on a day when trade in the yuan was relatively calm after Beijing fixed the currency's exchange rate marginally higher for the third successive session.\nChina's central bank on Tuesday set the yuan's midpoint near Monday's closing price at 6.3966 per U.S. dollar. In the spot market, the yuan closed flat at 6.3938 .\nConcerns about slowing growth in China also hit copper prices, which slid to a six-year low of $4,983 a tonne, to pierce the psychological $5,000 level, and were last down 1.8 percent at $5,022 a tonne.\nBut oil prices rebounded from initial declines after bullish U.S. housing data and on bets on an inventory decline. Brent oil futures settled up 7 cents at $48.81 per barrel to steady after a three-day fall while U.S. crude rebounded from nearly a 6-1/2-year low to settle up 1.8 percent at $42.62.\nInvestors will look to U.S. inflation data and minutes of the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, as they seek for clues as to when the Fed will begin raising interest rates.\nMost investors are expecting a rate increase to occur by the end of the year. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were down 13/32 in price to yield 2.1961 percent.
