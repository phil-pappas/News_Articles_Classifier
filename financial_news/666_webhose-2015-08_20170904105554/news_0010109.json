Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger A-REITs are still delivering strong returns for retail investors seeking exposure to high-yielding real estate, with the sector benefiting from global demand for commercial property and improving leasing conditions.\nAFR Weekend analysis of the annual results this reporting season of the trusts on the S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT index shows a strong, broad-based lift in profitability, and increased distribution payouts to shareholders. Most forecast rising earnings and bigger distribution payouts in 2016.\nPatient investors have been rewarded with annual total returns averaging well into in the double digits over the past three years. Some, such as Bunnings owner BWP Trust, the diversified Growthpoint Properties group and mall owner Westfield Corp, have exceeded 20 per cent.\n\"Overall, A-REIT reporting has been strong, with pretty much everyone meeting or exceeding guidance,\" says Stuart Cartledge, managing director of Phoenix ­Portfolios, which manages two funds that invest in listed property securities.\nCartledge says the key themes to emerge this reporting season were a big rise in net tangible assets, driven by income growth and a bigger contribution from cap rate compression – even among office assets, where leasing conditions are tougher – and a strong lift in specialty sales turnover at better-quality shopping centres.\n\"Given that speciality tenants pay most of the rent in the big shopping centres, their health is paramount to the outlook for rental growth in this space,\" he says.\nJames Maydew, deputy head of global listed real estate at AMP Capital Investors, says the latest results highlight that A-REITS remain a good long-term, risk-adverse asset class and one that should still appeal to mum and dad investors who want exposure to real estate and its rental income.\n\"A-REITS still look attractive when you compare them with the broader equities market and results from the recent reporting season have been strong,\" Maydew says, pointing out that while the Australian equity market has fallen 14 per cent since peaking on April 27, A-REITS have fallen only about 5.8 per cent.\n \"It shows the defensiveness of the asset class,\" he says.\n\"There is huge demand for good quality real estate around the world. The top 20 sovereign wealth funds are all lifting their allocations to real estate, some through direct investment, but also through listed property.\"\nThree-year commitment Maydew says A-REITs are also now far better placed to cope with any increased market volatility than they were following the global financial crisis, when values and returns plummeted.\n\"Leverage is the biggest change. Most A-REITs generally have a lower form of leverage. They have also diversified their debt sources, having been heavily dependent on the big four banks during the GFC. This became a big negative for them when the banks became unwilling to increase their exposure to real estate.\"\nAnother change, Maydew says, is the retracement of the trusts' exposure to offshore markets – a move they made before the GFC to boost earnings. Except for a small number of A-REITs, such as Goodman Group and Westfield, which he says have the capability to operate offshore, all the A-REITs have sold out of their overseas positions.\nBut he cautions that retail investors should have at least a three-year investment timeline for A-REITs, to get the benefits that come with owning real estate, \"otherwise they behave like equities\".\nHe also says some of the emerging asset classes, such as childcare centres, self-storage and healthcare trusts, which have performed well to date but suffered more heavy share prices falls this week than other A-REITS as equities fell, require greater scrutiny. \"Trusts that have exposure to the residential market are also riskier,\" he says.\nAtchison Consultants managing director Ken Atchison says A-REITS look attractive on a yield play, with their spread to 10-year government bond rates high and widening.\nAcross the S&P/ASX 200 A-REIT index, yields average 5.7 per cent, with some trusts exceeding 6 and 7 per cent, compared with 10-year Australian government bonds at 2.65 per cent and US bonds at 2.15 per cent.\n\"Dividend yields have not followed bond yields down, the margin has been widening,\" Atchison says. \"Bond rates would have to rise quite a lot to make it discouraging to invest in A-REITs.\"\nWhile a recent report by Aberdeen Asset Management said current asset pricing was unsustainable and the commercial property market – especially office property – faced a looming price correction, the consensus appears to be that the bull market has further to run locally.\n\"We're only halfway through the real estate cycle in Australia,\" Maydew says. \"We're not at the same point as London, Tokyo or New York.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-08-28T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:49:49.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
