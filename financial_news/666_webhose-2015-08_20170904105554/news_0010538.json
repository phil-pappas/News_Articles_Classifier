It's way too risky.\nIf you are in full-time employment, you have only one source of income. Should anything happen to the business and you lose your job, how would you pay for your outgoings? How would you continue to look after your dependents? What would happen if you couldn't find another similar job? It's an incredibly scary prospect, far too terrifying for me.\nIt used to be that freelancing was the riskier career path: no job security, no idea where your next job would come from. But that's certainly no longer the situation.\nThe way I operate, I have about 20 clients, of which about five I work with on a week-to-week basis. The remaining 15 send work my way on average about once a month. What that achieves is a properly diversified income stream.\nAdvertisement So even if I were to lose one of my major clients, I could still pay the mortgage. If I were to have just one job, I could lose it at any point as a result of any number of variables – a downturn in the economy, a personality clash with a superior, further disruption in my industry. Were this to happen I would be left high and dry. I can't afford to be in that position.\nI would also become incredibly bored working in just one role. I couldn't stand the thought of doing the same thing day in day out, writing on just one topic. It would be mind-numbing to me. At the moment, all the different topics I write about feed into each other. So I could be writing about export markets in the morning and small business in the afternoon and the cross-pollination of the different areas helps me to generate ideas. It also keeps me engaged and interested and across all the different areas in the economy.\nDid I mention the other incredible benefits of freelancing?\nYou set your own hours, rather than having to be tied to the nine-to-five treadmill. Sure, I'll often work 70 hours a week, sometimes more, but I do it when it suits me, not when it suits someone else. Of course, I always meet my deadlines, but I need flexibility in terms of when I work to achieve that. I get more done out of hours because the phone doesn't ring and I need peace and quiet to write.\nFreelancing also means you can avoid sitting in peak-hour traffic day in day out, another massive waste of time. Not having to travel into the CBD when everyone else does generates a colossal productivity lift for me because the more I work, the more successful I am and the more I earn. Squandering time in traffic does not help me to achieve this.\nI always said that if I had to go back to working in an office I would. But the further into my freelancing career I get, the scarier that prospect seems. I've been in business for myself for more than 10 years and I remember the soul searching I did before setting out on my own. Would I be a success? Where would I get clients? Would I be able to pay the bills? But I need not have been concerned because it's been one of the best decisions I ever made.\nFreelancing isn't for everyone – you do need to be naturally disciplined and know how to spend time on income-generating activities rather than become distracted by peripheral tasks. And many people simply don't like working for themselves.\nBut if, to use an old-fashioned term, you're a self-starter, it might be the best career move you ever make. I know it was for me.\nHave you switched to the freelance life?
