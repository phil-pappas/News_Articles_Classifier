Maybe it’s because they don’t want to wait 18 months for the Dow Jones Industrial Average to get back what it lost.\nThere’s a tendency for investors and analysts to see a sharp, historic selloff in the Dow DJIA, -0.25% and believe that’s an all-clear signal to buy stocks. Like billionaire investment guru Warren Buffett says, be greedy when others are fearful.

Wall Street analysts also cheered the improved “valuation” and “risk-versus-reward” profiles, as 11 Dow stocks were upgraded over the last week, while just one was downgraded, based on data provided by FactSet.\nAfter falling 1,897 points amid a six-session losing streak through Tuesday, the Dow bounced 988 points the past two sessions, the largest two-day point gain in history. On Friday, the Dow slipped 42 points in morning trade.\nBut before new investors pat themselves on the back for buying on the recent dip, they should keep in mind that Buffett also said, some things take time.\nBloomberg Can you afford to wait as long as Warren Buffett can to start making money? The Dow’s 52-week low this week came less than 70 weekdays after it reached a 52-week high, the ninth-fastest the index has done that in its history, according to data provided by Sundial Capital Research.\nIn all, there were 21 times the Dow went from a new high to a new low in less than 100 days, according to Sundial Research. The data show that after those declines, the median number of days it takes to get back to a new 52-week high is 5.5 times the number of days it took to hit a new low. That suggests the Dow might not make back what it lost for 385 days (77 weeks), or about a year and a half.\nAnother saying often heard on Wall Street, and attributed to famed economist John Maynard Keynes, is that the market can remain irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.\nThe bounce back after Black Monday in October 1987, when the Dow crashed 23% in one day, might have seemed very quick to rattled investors, but it still took 262 weekdays, or just over a year. And after the low hit in September 2001, it took about two years to make everything back.\nSundial President Jason Goepfert said the damage done by the recent tumble was “severe,” so it’s unlikely to see stocks shoot right back up to new highs like nothing happened.\n“It will take time to work off the kind of selling we’ve seen,” Goepfert said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T19:59:08.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
