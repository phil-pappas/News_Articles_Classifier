It said that to operate as a multi-state UCB, the minimum capital requirement would be Rs 100 crore, to operate beyond two districts and as a state-level UCB, the capital threshold is Rs 50 crore and a capital of Rs 25 crore if the UCB is at the district level.\nThe committee recommends that licences for setting up UCBs be issued only to financially sound and well-managed cooperative credit societies with at least five years of track record as it reckons setting up an UCB from scratch is difficult. “It also said that providing banking access in unbanked areas should be done by incentivising existing banks and left it to the RBI to decide on the mode,” said the report.\nPutting in place a Board of management as suggested by the Malegam committee has to be one of the mandatory licensing conditions for licensing new UCBs and expansion of existing ones, the committee has recommended. Further, the depositors must have a say on the Boards. For this, a majority of the board seats may be reserved for depositors by making suitable provisions in the bye-laws, the report said.\nThe committee was constituted in January by RBI to study the UCB model and it had to study the recommendations of earlier committee reports while making its own.\n 21, 2015 12:26 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T12:56:47.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
