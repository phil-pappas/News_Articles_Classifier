The Goldfield Corporation, headquartered in Florida, through its subsidiaries Power Corporation of America, Southeast Power Corporation and C and C Power Line, Inc., is a leading provider of construction services for electric utilities, with operations primarily in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States including Texas. \nThree-Months Ended June 30, 2015 \nFor the three-months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period last year: Revenue increased 32.1% to $33.5 million from $25.3 million -- attributable to higher revenue from both master service agreement (MSA) and non-MSA work. Income from continuing operations before income taxes tripled to $2.8 million from $693,000 despite losses of $1.2 million incurred from continued adverse weather conditions causing construction delays in the current quarter on Texas projects, which are now substantially complete. Net income rose to $1.3 million ($0.05 per share) from a net loss of $238,000 ($0.01 loss per share). Net income (loss) for the three-months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 included special after tax charges of $201,000 and $665,000, respectively, in discontinued operations from a previously disclosed environmental remediation project, which is now substantially complete. \nSix-Months Ended June 30, 2015 \nFor the six-months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period last year: Revenue increased 35.4% to $64.0 million from $47.3 million -- mainly attributable to growth in MSAs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes remained approximately the same at $1.2 million despite losses aggregating $5.1 million recognized in the six-months ended June 30, 2015 (largely in the first quarter) on the substantially completed projects in Texas. Net income increased over three-fold to $466,000 ($0.02 per share) from $97,000 (nil per share). Net income for the six-months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, included special after tax charges of $201,000 and $665,000, respectively, in discontinued operations from the environmental remediation project mentioned above. \nBacklog \nTotal backlog as of June 30, 2015 was $218.2 million compared to $223.5 million as of June 30, 2014. Backlog represents total revenue estimated over the life of an MSA plus estimated revenue from fixed-price contracts. Of this backlog, $73.0 million (33.4%) is expected to be realized within twelve months. \nCompared to December 31, 2014, backlog as of June 30, 2015 declined $56.8 million (20.6%) and 12-month backlog declined $12.4 million (14.5%). These declines largely resulted from completion of certain MSA work and reduction of some future estimated work from these MSAs. Growth in non-MSA contracts partially offset the decrease in MSA backlog. \nExisting MSAs have initial terms ranging from one to four years and generally provide for extensions. Total MSA backlog assumes the exercise of renewal options. Revenue from the exercise of renewal options represent $101.1 million (59.5%) of total estimated MSA backlog as of June 30, 2015. The estimated backlog from MSAs is calculated by using recurring historical revenue from current MSAs and projected needs based upon ongoing communications with customers. The size and amount of future projects awarded under MSAs cannot be determined with certainty and revenue from such contracts may vary substantially from current estimates. \nJohn H. Sottile, President and Chief Executive Officer of Goldfield said, \"We have now substantially completed our unprofitable Texas projects and have accomplished a reorganization of this operation. This will permit us to seek other projects from new and existing customers. Fortunately, our work outside Texas has remained strong. The general demand for electrical construction services is positive. Our focus is to achieve operating efficiencies, improved profit margins and to secure well qualified labor to take advantage of these opportunities.\" \nAbout Goldfield \nGoldfield is a leading provider of electrical construction and maintenance services in the energy infrastructure industry, primarily in the southeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States including Texas.
