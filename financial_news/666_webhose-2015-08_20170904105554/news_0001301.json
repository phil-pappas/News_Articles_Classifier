The 10-year yields have tumbled off highs around 19 percent hit in early July when a standoff in talks between Greece and its creditors took the country to the brink of financial ruin.\nThe guarded optimism concerning Greece had little impact on other southern European bond markets, with Italian and Spanish 10-year yields flat on the day at 1.83 percent and 1.99 percent, respectively, stabilising after a sharp rally on Friday on falling oil prices.\n\"There's lots of positive noises coming from the Greek talks but generally most of the good news is now priced in to the market,\" said Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.\nGERMANS PREFER \"THOROUGH\" DEAL\nNegotiations on the bailout began on July 20 after Athens agreed to European institutions' and the International Monetary Fund's austerity demands. A senior Greek finance official told Reuters the aim was for euro zone finance ministers to review the accord on Aug. 14.\nScepticism over a swift deal remained in Germany where a senior parliamentary ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel said he believed a deal with Athens on a bailout was some way off. A government spokesman later said a swift conclusion to negotiations would be desirable, noting a thorough deal was more important than a quick one.\n\"In our view the risk to a new 86 billion euro bailout is whether it can be implemented over the full three years as, if it is perceived as too punitive, then the risk of further extreme voting sentiment will undoubtedly rise,\" Mizuho strategist Peter Chatwell said.\nGerman 10-year yields -- the euro zone benchmark -- were 1 basis point higher at 0.66 percent as were other top-rated euro zone bond yields.\nFalling oil prices have revived concerns about subdued inflation in the euro zone that could see the European Central Bank extend its 1-trillion-euro asset purchase programme due to end in September 2016.\nThat overshadowed a steady July U.S. labour market report on Friday that suggested the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates as soon as next month, driving all euro zone bond yields sharply lower.
