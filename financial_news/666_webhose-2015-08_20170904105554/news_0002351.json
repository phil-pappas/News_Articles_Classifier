Ryan Stuart Share on twitter by Tess Ingram Australia's battered miners have been given a shot of confidence by former White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, who says he doesn't \"buy into the hard landing in China\" and thinks China and India will both provide strong demand for minerals over the next decade.\nMr Sperling, a former adviser to US presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, told the Diggers and Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie that while Australia is dealing with \"quite a challenging commodity issue\" he believed China's economy and demand for minerals would remain strong and the Australian dollar would continue to fall in the near term, providing respite for local exporters.\nA sustained decline in commodity prices across the board dampened sentiment on the first day of the annual conference, which was expected to attract around 1800 attendees.\n\"You're having a slowdown [in China] , you've got the problems on the property side, but I am not one who buys into the hard landing in China,\" he said in the conference's opening address.\nMr Sperling is also a consultant with bonds giant PIMCO.\n\"Everyone says the same thing – is China going to be slowing down demand for metals, they are transitioning from infrastructure-led to sustainable growth. I think that's partially right. It's obviously the case they are moving and being pressured by the world, and feel they are moving to more consumption led growth. But everybody always throws in that they will be decreasing infrastructure investment. That part of the scenario is not quite as clear to me.\"\nSpeaking to Fairfax Media after his address, Mr Sperling said he believed the Chinese government would be focused on ensuring GDP growth remained around 7 per cent.\n\"I think they are more committed to hitting 7 per cent growth than some people think, I think they have capacity to prime the pumps some and I think they have more infrastructure needs and commitments from a modernisation and urbanisation front than some people are predicting.\"\n Inevitable growth demands from India Noting conditions remained extremely challenging for miners, Mr Sperling said he was not \"not offering easy optimism but I am not in the hard landing camp either\" and said it was too soon to call whether the recent volatility on Chinese markets would have a detrimental impact on its economy. But it was inevitable, he said, India's demand for minerals would grow.\n\"If China couldn't grow that much forever, well on the other side India can't have this little demand forever,\" he said.\n\"India is buying 3 per cent of metals globally. I know right now at 3 per cent that's not a lot … but remember – China went from 10 per cent of your resource exports to 60 per cent in ten years. So I would say as much as it is difficult for people to struggle through this time, I think it would be wise for more companies to look 5 to 10 years out and ask not just what is their China strategy, but what is their India strategy. Because there is no way there will not be an increase in demand.\"\nTouching on everything from the US economy to the recent troubles in Greece, Mr Sperling also turned his attention to Australian economic conditions and said he believed the local currency would continue to slide towards 65¢, with the RBA presented with scope to lower interest rates.\n\"There is a helpful bearishness. If you look at trends in US, I think that the ability for [the Australian Dollar] to go lower, the number of people betting for it to go lower … they think it will be as low as 65¢ by the end of year, it seems likely to be going in that direction,\" he said.\n\"If I was betting, I would probably bet that it does move below 70¢ in the next six to nine months.\"\nMr Sperling said he hoped his insights would provide \"small comfort\" to miners challenged by lower prices that in turn, continued to be threatened by soaring supply, nodding to the supply debate in the iron ore sector that ignited a war of words between the major miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto and their smaller rival Fortescue Metals Group.\n\"I'm not going to try to get into the middle of the family feud, only to say that you're not the only industry where you're hearing this topic,\" he told the conference.\nIn iron ore, companies would continue to experience \"tough times\" he said and in the global gold sector, the outlook isn't much rosier.\n\"It's hard to be here and be wildly optimistic that the winds are heading in the right direction on the gold front. With interest rates in the US looking like they might be higher, with more companies in the US particular sitting on lots of cash and giving out greater dividends, there may be more people feeling that the opportunity cost of holding gold is going up,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/china/china-pmi-final-caixinmarkit-index-falls-to-2year-low-of-478-in-july-20150803-giq70t.html", "https://twitter.com/TessIngram"], "published": "2015-08-03T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:10:46.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
