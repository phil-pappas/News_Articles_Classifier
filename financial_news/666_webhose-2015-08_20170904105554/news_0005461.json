First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) of all, we can't get around the obstacle (of reforms). Secondly, populist siren songs only end in mirages,\" Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told the assembly. \n\"Finally... irresponsible policies have a price,\" he added. \nDuring an interview with news radio Cadena Ser, the Podemos secretary for political affairs, Inigo Errejon, accused the government of debating the Greek bailout in parliament \"for propaganda reasons\". \nRajoy is betting on Spain's economic recovery to win re-election to a second term despite poor personal approval ratings. \nSpain emerged in 2013 from five years of on-off recession, and the government forecasts the economy will grow by 3.3 percent this year -- more than twice the average forecast for eurozone countries -- and by 3.0 percent next year. \nBut unemployment stood at 22.4 percent in the second quarter, the second-highest rate in the eurozone after that of bailed-out Greece. \nEurozone finance ministers on Friday gave the green light to the latest Greek bailout package, which averted the country's expulsion from the euro but will require more sacrifices from Greeks. \nFinland, one of the eurozone countries most sceptical about pouring more aid into Greece, also backed the bailout last Thursday. The German parliament will vote on it on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:00:58.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
