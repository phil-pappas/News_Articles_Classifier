Photo: Bloomberg\nFemale representation on the BHP Billiton board of directors has grown, with a new female director set to join and another set to take a bigger role.\nThe miner announced on Friday that British businesswoman Anita Frew will join its board on September 15.\nLike chief executive Andrew Mackenzie, Ms Frew is Scottish and has worked in several financial institutions in the UK, including on the board of Aberdeen Asset Management, which is one of the top five shareholders in BHP.\nMore recently she has been chair of chemicals company Croda and deputy chair of Lloyds Banking Group.\nAdvertisement Ms Frew will be an independent non-executive director, and her arrival will come barely two months before former Goldman Sachs banker Carlos Cordeiro departs the board.\nMr Cordeiro has been a director since 2005 and will stand down at the annual general meeting in Perth on November 19.\nMs Frew will be just the third woman on BHP's 11 person board, alongside Carolyn Hewson and Baroness Shriti Vadera.\nBaroness Vadera has been elevated to the position of senior independent director in the wake of the passing of Sir John Buchanan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:40:03.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
