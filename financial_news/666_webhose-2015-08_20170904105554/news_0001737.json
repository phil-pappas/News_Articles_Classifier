The firm said they would then provide a full response. \n\"Until we have done that, any court proceedings are premature and unnecessary and we continue to reserve all our rights,\" the spokesperson said. \n\"All Vedanta's operating subsidiaries take the health and safety of their employees, the wellbeing of surrounding communities and the environment very seriously.\" \nIn a statement, Leigh Day alleged that Vedanta's mining operations had spilled sulphuric acid and other toxic chemicals into the rivers, streams and farmland near to where the communities live and farm. \n\"As one of the world’s largest mining companies, Vedanta should be doing all it can to assist these communities yet they continue to devastate the lives of the local people who are powerless against such a big company,\" Day said. \n(Reporting by William James; Editing by Tom Heneghan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T22:40:20.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
