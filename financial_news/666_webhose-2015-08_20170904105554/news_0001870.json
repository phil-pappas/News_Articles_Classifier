Speaking to the Wall St Journal , Lockhart said that \"my priors going into the September meeting as of today are that the economy is ready and it is an appropriate time to make a change\". He added that: \"I think there is a high bar right now to not acting\" and that 'it will take a significant deterioration in the economic picture for me to be disinclined to move ahead\", but acknowledged inflation could come under pressure due to the recent decline in the oil market. Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) 's Jim Reid noted: \"The comments were interesting given that Lockhart is seen as something of a centrist in the Fed camp who moves with the consensus. Lockhart had also previously said back in May that he is more prepared to take the risks of waiting rather than being too early.\" 0800: Company results from the FTSE 100 this morning include Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) , London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) and IP Group (LSE: IPO.L - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T14:09:02.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
