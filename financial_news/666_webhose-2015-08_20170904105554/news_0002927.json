What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.\nToday’s Social Security question is about the effect of the WEP and the GPO on Social Security benefits.\nQuestion : I am a single woman (widow) of 76. I waited to apply for Social Security benefits until I was almost 66. I am not working presently. I worked for at least 15 years in the U.S., paying into Social Security. I worked for the World Health Organization for 10 years, paying into retirement fund, living overseas in developing countries and not paying into Social Security. I do not understand the reasoning behind why the Social Security benefits I accrued while working in the U.S. are offset by my U.N. pension income. I feel I earned the full Social Security benefits regardless of what else I did.\nIt seems that this law imposes unequal expectations on earners like myself. My Social Security benefits are reduced by two-thirds of what I would otherwise receive. (I receive a bit over $600/month from Social Security and my full benefits would be over $1,800/month).\nI know many people receiving their retirement and also getting their full Social Security benefit. For instance, I know someone who worked for a national laboratory and retirement benefits were more than his month’s salary. And he also got full Social Security benefits. Why were they not offset, like mine? Thank you for doing this. It is a great service.\nAnswer : Social Security’s benefit formula is progressive, so it disproportionately rewards those who have low average covered earnings. There are two ways you can have low average covered earnings. You can earn very little for many years or you can earn a bunch but for very few years. Someone who earns a bunch for very few years and works in non-covered employment is viewed as trying to double dip on the system — to, effectively, pretend to the system to be poor and then get a disproportionately high benefit.\nNote that if you don’t work at all in the years you aren’t in Social Security-covered employment, you get a higher benefit than if you do work. So Social Security is, in effect, taxing those who work as schoolteachers, firemen, policemen, college professors, etc., in state and local government jobs that aren’t covered by Social Security.\nLet me go on the record. Social Security, as designed, is terribly unfair in more ways than I can count. It needs to be frozen in place and pay off what it owes. But a new system (see the Purple Social Security Plan as an example) needs to be instituted to replace it. Social Security’s most ardent supporters do not, I suspect, have a real idea of the system’s complexity, unfairness, implicit sexism, implicit racism and means for randomly redistributing across the population based on who knows what about the system’s rules.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.thepurplesocialsecurityplan.org/"], "published": "2015-08-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:20:45.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
