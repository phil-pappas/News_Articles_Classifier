(AP) - A high-end hotel could be on its way to Burlington International Airport.\nVermont Public Radio reports Burlington asked developers Thursday to submit proposals for what could be a 120-room hotel on airport grounds.\nDirector of Aviation Gene Richards says a hotel could be the latest addition to an area that's seen dramatic expansion over the last 15 years. He says taxpayers won't be asked to finance the \"expensive endeavor,\" but the city would be heavily involved in the venture.\nOfficials say the hotel could include a top-floor restaurant featuring views of surrounding communities and mountains.\nRichards says a hotel could be up and running by late 2017 if the city finds a developer with interest in building the facility.\nDevelopers have until Oct. 15 to respond to the city's request.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
