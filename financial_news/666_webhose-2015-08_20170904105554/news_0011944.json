Ladbrokes has come under increasing investor criticism for it's poorer online offering, an area in which Paddy Power has gained increasing market share. \nAlongside the merger announcement both Betfair and Paddy Power issued financial results. \nBetfair's results for the first quarter showed that revenues increased 15% despite the comparative period containing the World Cup where betting volumes are elevated. \nMeanwhile, Paddy Power reported operating profit growth of 33% to €80m (£58m) for the first six months of the year. \nThe news was welcomed by investors who pushed shares in both of the companies higher in early trading. Betfair shares were 18% higher, whilst Paddy Power's rose 14%. \nInvestors in Ladbrokes seem worried by the new bigger competitor sending its shares 5% lower in early exchanges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T11:23:37.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
