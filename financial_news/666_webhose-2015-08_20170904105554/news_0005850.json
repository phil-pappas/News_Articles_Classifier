For instance, the Oromia Diaspora toured around Oromia to witness the development efforts. Many have changed their mind about their communities in particular and the country in general. The National Diaspora Day opened Wednesday here in Addis Ababa is indeed a success. Tributes must be paid to the umbrella organizer Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to the various Ethiopian consulates abroad. This has proved that political affiliation should not be seen as a hindrance to be on board in development ventures. Ethiopia is common to us all regardless of ideology, race and religion. So is nation building. \nPresident Dr. Mulatu Teshome, speaking at the opening ceremony of the diaspora day said that the ongoing development endeavours is sustained not only by Ethiopians at home but also through the engagement of the Diaspora. Ethiopia has escaped numerous ups and downs. With the will of God, the future is bright for Ethiopians. \nIt is through the combined efforts of Ethiopians at home and overseas that can truly change the ugly faces of the country for good. \nIn fact, Ethiopia is becoming the hub of investment. Investors from the four corners such as from China, Turkey, the United States of America, Europe and the Middle East are coming to Ethiopia for investment. \nAccording to Ethiopian Investment Commission citing World Bank (2013), Ethiopia has grown at an average rate of 10 per cent since 2010. In 2012, Ethiopia was the 12th fastest growing economy in the world, managing to grow faster than other African countries such as Rwanda, Mozambique, Zambia, and Ghana, as well as China and India. The international community is giving testimonies about the development achievements the country has made. \nTowards meeting the aspirations of the public, the government has enormously promoted investment and job creations. It has put in place sound policies and strategies. To pave the way for further development, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established Diaspora Directorate to help Ethiopian expatriates in overseas invest in their country. Ethiopian expatriates may live lavish life with all facilities. But they should never forget their people, communities and motherland. \nThis generation is shouldered with the responsibility of bequeathing better Ethiopia to posterity. In this regard, a lot is expected from Ethiopian expatriates. \nThe government alone does not satisfy the ever increasing development needs of the public in poor countries like Ethiopia. Understandably, the priorities of the government will only be on areas where there will be no or limited private investment such as in big projects viz; roads, hydropower, clean water provision etc... Of course, the government is also duty-bound to create as many jobs as possible for the youth and women where the contribution of the Micro and Small-Scale Enterprises, which in the beginning were criticized, is enormous. \nAnd there are numerous investment areas where the Diaspora can engage either privately or in joint ventures: In textile and garment, leather shoes and leather products and many more. With a view to ensuring equitable development, both the federal and state governments have put aside investment destinations in all states. \nOf course, there are benefits that the government offers for investors. Fiscal incentives include exemptions from customs duties on construction machinery, equipment and building materials required for investment depending on the types of investment, as well as production machinery and equipment. Income tax exemption is also available for developers and resident firms based on international best practices. \nAll told, the Ethiopian Diaspora can benefit from investing in their country thereby sustaining the ongoing development endeavours. Such the development ventures can create enormous jobs for the youth and women, lifting millions from poverty thereby changing the mindset of many youths who always aspire to flee the country through illegal means and die.
