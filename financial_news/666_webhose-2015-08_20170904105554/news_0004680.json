U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's Chef de Cabinet Susana Malcorra described the agreement as 'historic' but warned that the work ahead is immense.\n\nThe eight Millennium Development Goals had helped focus attention on the needs of poor nations for the past 15 years.\n\nThe new Sustainable Development Goals will aim to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty, reduce inequality within and between states, achieve gender equality, improve water management and energy, and take urgent action to combat climate change.\n\nMeeting the goals would cost between 3.3 trillion and 4.5 trillion a year in state spending, investment and aid, analysts say, an amount roughly equivalent to the United States 2016 federal budget of 3.8 trillion.\n\nMore than 100 countries agreed on a framework in Ethiopia last month to bankroll the sustainable development goals by mobilizing domestic resources such as taxes, leverage private investment and channel foreign assistance.\n\nWorld leaders will meet from Sept. 25-27 at the United Nations in New York to formally adopt the new sustainable development agenda. Pope Francis will address the United Nations before the summit starts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:44:19.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
