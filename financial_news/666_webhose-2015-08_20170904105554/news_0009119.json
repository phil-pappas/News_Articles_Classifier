If you cash in by subdividing the land, developing the parcels, and selling them off for a hefty profit, it could trigger a whopping income tax bill. Here’s the rub: in this scenario, the federal income tax rules generally treat you as a real estate “dealer.” As such, your profit from developing and selling the land is considered profit from selling “inventory.” That means the entire profit — including the portion from pre-development appreciation in the value of the land — will be higher-taxed ordinary income rather than lower-taxed long-term capital gains. The maximum federal rate on ordinary income is 39.6%. You may also owe the 3.8% net investment income tax and state income tax too. Yikes!\nIt would be much better if you could arrange to pay lower long-term capital gains tax rates on at least part of the profit. The current maximum federal rate on long-term capital gains is 20%. If you also owe the 3.8% net investment income tax, the effective maximum federal rate is 23.8%. That’s much better than the 43.4% (39.6% + 3.8%) maximum federal rate on ordinary gains recognized by a real estate dealer.\nS Corporation developer entity strategy\nThankfully, there is a strategy that allows favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment for all the pre-development appreciation in the value of your land. This assumes you’ve held it for investment rather than as an established dealer in real estate. Understand this: even with this strategy, any profit attributable to subsequent subdividing, development, and marketing activities will still be high-taxed ordinary income, because you will be treated as a dealer for that part of the process. However, if you can manage to pay “only” 23.8% on the bulk of the profit (the portion from the pre-development appreciation), that’s something to celebrate.\nExample: The pre-development appreciation in the value of your land is $2 million. If you employ the S corporation developer entity strategy explained later in this article, that part of the profit will be taxed at a federal rate of no more than 23.8% (the maximum federal rate on long-term capital gains). If you expect to reap another $1 million of profit from development and marketing activities, that part will be taxed at ordinary federal income-tax rates, which can be as high as 43.4%.\nWith this dual tax treatment, the maximum federal income tax hit is $910,000 [(23.8% x $2 million) + (43.4% x $1 million)]. Without any advance planning, the entire $3 million profit would probably be taxed at the maximum 43.4% ordinary income rate, which would result in a much bigger $1,302,000 hit to your wallet.\nWith the preceding background in mind, here’s the drill for paying a much smaller tax bill on your real estate profits.\nStep 1: Establish an S Corp to be developer entity\nIf you individually own the appreciated land all by yourself, you can establish a new S corporation owned solely by you to function as the developer entity. If you own the land via a partnership (or via an LLC treated as a partnership for tax purposes), you and your co-owners can form the S corporation and receive corporate stock in proportion to your ownership interests.\nStep 2: Sell the land to the S Corporation\nNext, sell the appreciated land to the S corporation for a price equal to the land’s pre-development fair market value. If necessary, you can arrange a sale that involves only a little cash and a big installment note owed by the S corporation to you (and the other co-owners, if applicable). The S corporation will pay off the note with cash generated by selling off parcels after development. As long as you have: (1) held the land for investment and (2) owned the land for more than one year, the sale to the S corporation will trigger a long-term capital gain eligible for the 23.8% maximum federal rate.\nStep 3: Develop the land and sell it off\nAfter buying the land, the S corporation will subdivide and develop the property, market it, and sell it off. The profit from these activities will be ordinary income passed through to you (and the other co-owners, if applicable). If the profit from development and marketing is big, you will probably pay the maximum 43.4% federal rate on that income. However, the average tax rate on your total profit will be much lower than 43.4%, because a big part of that total profit will be pre-development appreciation taxed at the much lower 23.8% rate.\nThe bottom line\nThe S corporation developer entity strategy explained here can be a huge tax-saver in the right circumstances. But this is not a good do-it-yourself project. Contact your tax pro for assistance.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:09:04.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
