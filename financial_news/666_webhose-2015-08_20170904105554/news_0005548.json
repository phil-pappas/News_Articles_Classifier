The yuan also strengthened in spot market trading, changing hands at 6.3918.\n\"We just need to see if the yuan is going to stay halfway stable over the next few days, then confidence is going to come back,\" said Markus Huber, senior equity sales trader at Peregrine & Black.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.07 points, or 0.01 percent, to 17,409.32, the S&P 500 lost 1.51 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,081.88 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 17.26 points, or 0.34 percent, to 5,016.30. For the week, the S&P is currently up 0.3 percent.\nEuropean stocks were on track for their worst week in six after exporting companies with exposure to China saw their stocks fall after the yuan was devalued. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares was down 0.1 percent. The Euro STOXX 50 traded down 0.6 percent.\nEconomic growth in the euro zone slowed in the second quarter as France stagnated and Italy lost momentum, held back by an uncertain global outlook that is even weakening investment in powerhouse Germany.\n\"The impact from slower growth in China will likely be largely offset by robust demand from the U.S. and the UK,\" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg bank.\nEarlier on Friday, the Greek parliament voted to approve the country's third financial rescue by foreign creditors in five years. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras still faces a confidence vote later this month.\nCrude oil futures fell to levels not seen since early 2009 before recovering slightly. U.S. crude oil was up 6 cents at $42.29 a barrel after hitting a new 6 1/2-year low of $41.35 a barrel due to a big increase in U.S. inventories. Brent was down 0.8 percent at $48.80.\nThe U.S. dollar fell 0.1 percent against the yen at 124.24 yen, and rose 0.4 percent against the euro, which fell to $1.1106.\nThe greenback came under pressure this week as China's devaluation curbed expectations the Federal Reserve's long-awaited interest rate increase would come as early as its Sept. 16-17 meeting, but strong U.S. retail sales data on Thursday and good industrial production data on Friday backed the view that the Fed was ready to hike.\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose to 2.20 percent after having fallen to a near four-month low of 2.04 percent on Wednesday. Gold prices were little changed on the day but up 2.0 percent for the week, the best weekly performance in three months.
