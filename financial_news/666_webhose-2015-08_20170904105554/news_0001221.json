The shares will open at 120p on Tuesday. \nAs well as Marwyn, the major shareholders on the first day of trading include Invesco (NYSE: IVZ - news ) , the hedge fund Ruffer, and Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) . They have committed to stumping up more cash when Gloo is ready to sign its first deal, expected within months. \nThe team behind the plan, chief executive Rebecca Miskin, a former senior executive at Hearst, and Juan Lopez-Valcarcel, who most recently worked in digital education at Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) , are now hunting the US, UK and Europe for acquisitions. \nIt is understood that they hope to buy in the UK first. Gloo will seek to combine “marquee” traditional print or video brands that have yet to make a successful leap to digital distribution, and combine them with technological know-how \nThat might mean linking a traditional magazine with apps that make it easy for readers to buy featured products, or a major overhaul of the digital nuts and bolts of the business to gain insights on readers for advertisers, according to people familiar with the strategy. In the long-term Gloo aims to become a sustainable large-scale media group that will seek a transfer to London’s main market. \nThe company currently has only one member of staff beyond Ms Miskin and Mr Lopez-Valcarcel, and is headquartered in an attic at Marwyn’s offices, but has access to the investor’s analysts and due diligence resources. \nMarwyn is pursuing a similar strategy in the European telecoms market via Zegona Communications (LSE: ZEG.L - news ) . It listed as a shell in March and last month wrote its first big cheque when it agreed to buy the Spanish operator Telecable de Asturias for €640m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T09:16:50.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
