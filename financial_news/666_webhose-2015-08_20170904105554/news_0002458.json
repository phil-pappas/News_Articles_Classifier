Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by John Kerin Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris urged the Abbott government to make tax reform contingent on the states agreeing to reform planning laws and slash redtape because it remains one of the biggest productivity hindrances for business.\nMr Harris was speaking during a panel discussion on ways to lift productivity at an Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Business Leaders Summit in Canberra.\nThe Productivity Commission handed down a low key draft report on reforming the workplace relations system in early August, which seeks to tweak the existing system rather than go for wholesale reform.\nMr Harris said although the discussion over equalising Saturday and Sunday penalty rates for non-essential service workers had grabbed headlines planning regulation remained overly complex in Australia.\nHe also said it had been the subject of numerous inquiries and reviews that set out what government's needed to do to reform it.\n\"I know how many inquiries there have been though, I haven't done one myself,\" he said.\n\"This is the area where if you are talking about innovation you can achieve a great deal … but it can't be incremental … we have to ask do we really have to do this.\n\"When we talk about tax reform on behalf of the States perhaps we also need to talk about States reforming their planning regulations,\" he said.\n Mr Harris also sought to explain the commission recommending the introduction of enterprise contracting, which was aimed specifically at small business.\nHe said enterprise bargaining was a process usually reserved for big enterprises with big legal and professional sections putting it beyond small business.\nAnd although there had been some suggestions in the media that the commission should have gone in harder and dumped the award system. Mr Harris said many small businesses would have little to work with without it.\n\"The enterprise contract is deliberately designed for small business … but it is not designed to deprive people of anything. We feel it is in keeping with the underlying principles of the industrial relations system,\" he said.\nMr Harris said he had been unsurprised by the government's response to what was a draft report on workplace changes.\n\"It's a report to government and they have not ruled anything out,\" he said.\nFlexibility needed Small Business Minister Bruce Billson said improvements to the workplace relations system were needed to improve flexibility because the competition for talent was global.\nHe said smart people with smart ideas could just as easily earn a living in California or Israel unless Australia had the necessary settings in place to lift productivity and be internationally competitive.\nAnd, he acknowledged reducing red tape for small business was primarily a state responsibility but a process the Commonwealth was keen to drive.\nGoogle Australia and New Zealand managing director Maile Carnegie said in relation to the use of technology in the workplace it was vital to ensure it was shared and not only accessed by the privileged.\n\"Technology can drive incredibly exciting growth but it can also drive exponential cost savings,\" Ms Carnegie said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JohnKerin2"], "published": "2015-08-17T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:05:17.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
