TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX INC (FOXA) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its notable return on equity, attractive valuation levels, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations and increase in stock price during the past year. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Media industry and the overall market, TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX INC's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. 36.30% is the gross profit margin for TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 14.25% is above that of the industry average. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 53.66% to $1,761.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of 13.10%. Compared to where it was a year ago today, the stock is now trading at a higher level, regardless of the company's weak earnings results. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year.
