That state's Republican and Democratic senators both criticized China's devaluation and linked it to the Trans Pacific Partnership trade talks, even though China was not a party to those negotiations.\n\"The U.S. needs to ensure American businesses and workers have a backstop to fight back against currency manipulation,\" Ohio's Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown said.\nOhio Republican Senator Rob Portman struck a similar note.\n\"We cannot afford to sit idly by as China refuses to play by the rules,\" Portman said. \"Any negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership must prioritize combating currency manipulation by our foreign competitors.\"\nDemocrats and labor unions say the TPP deal could unleash a flood of cheap imports, forcing U.S. plant closures and killing good jobs in steel and other industries.\nSteel has been a source of tension in the U.S.-China trade relationship for years.\nU.S. steelmakers have filed a series of actions accusing rivals in China and other countries of dumping products below cost in the U.S. market. The Obama administration has backed the industry on some of those petitions, slapping duties on imported steel products.\nSince July, U.S. steelmakers including AK Steel, U.S. Steel Corp and Nucor have filed trade petitions over imports of hot-rolled steel and cold-rolled steel. China was named in the cold-rolled steel complaint.\nIn June, the U.S. Department of Commerce said it would look into a third complaint about imports of corrosion-resistant steel, which also named China.\nU.S. steelmakers scored a victory in June when Congress approved stronger anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.\n\"China has consistently intervened directly in foreign exchange markets to ... make their exports more competitive and impose new barriers to imports,\" said Thomas J. Gibson, head of industry group American Iron and Steel Institute.\nPrice, representing Nucor, said China had built \"massive excess capacity in steel, aluminum, and many other industries that is unrelated to market demand or legitimate development needs.\"\nThe solution, he said, should be for Chinese steelmakers to shut some of those plants.
