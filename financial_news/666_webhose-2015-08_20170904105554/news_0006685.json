We should admit that this isn’t going to work.” \nMr Soini admitted that Finnish opposition would not derail a a third bail-out, citing an emergency voting procedure whereby financial assistance can be granted if supported by a qualified majority of 85pc of the votes cast. Finland has a share of less than 2pc of the vote. \n\"If we vote against a deal, it goes to the emergency procedure, and a package is implemented regardless of us,\" said Mr Soini. \"I don't believe that this [bail out] policy will provide solutions, and I think that, in the longer term, 'Grexit' is the most likely scenario,\" he said. \nGreece is scrambling to unlock a third bail-out deal ahead of a €3.5bn payment to the European Central Bank on August 20. \nIt is understood that Greece's parliament plan to vote on reforms by the end of next week, which will then be presented to the rest of the eurozone in the hope that a new aid program can become effective before the ECB payment deadline. \nHowever, reservations from Germany could delay a deal. The country has insisted it will not rush talks as it seeks further guarantees before providing taxpayer money to keep the cash-strapped country afloat. \nIt has tabled the idea of a second €5bn bridging loan in order to extend talks with Athens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T16:59:55.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
