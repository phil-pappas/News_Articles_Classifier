Daewoo, in turn, owns 85% of PT Bio Inti Agrindo (PT BIA), an Indonesian plantation company. The latter is currently converting tropical forest into palm oil plantations in West Papua, a region rich in biodiversity, according to the Council of Ethics. \nThe Council said it had been in contact with Daewoo several times last year and had sought information about the impacts on biodiversity of its forestry activities. But \"the information Daewoo has provided to the Council provides few answers,\" it said. \n\"In the Council's view, Daewoo is doing little to preserve biodiversity and important ecological values in the concession area,\" it added. Neither Daewoo nor PT BIA are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the Council noted. \nNorges Bank said it has therefore concluded that further engagement with the company \"is not appropriate\". \nThe four companies join a list of 60 that have already been excluded from the oil fund's investment portfolio because of their involvement in weapons manufacturing, tobacco production, human rights violations or environmental damage ( see table ). Major mining companies feature prominently on the list of those excluded on environmental grounds. They include: Rio Tinto, Norilsk Nickel, Freeport McMoRan, Vedanta Resources and Barrick Gold. \nA June vote by the Norwegian parliament also committed the fund to divest from mining and power companies that base 30% or more of their activities on coal, or gain more than 30% of their revenues from coal. \nGraham Cooper Excluded companies (as of 17 August) Production of weapons that through their normal use may violate fundamental humanitarian principles \nProduction of nuclear arms", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T22:21:54.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
