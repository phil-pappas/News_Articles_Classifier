The Cairn India operated Rajasthan block is currently producing around 172,224 bopd, accounting for more than 27 per cent of the country’s domestic crude production,” the official added.\nMayank Ashar, MD and CEO Cairn India said, “In about six years since we started production from our fields from our Rajasthan block, we have successfully completed 300 million barrels of production.”\nThe company’s shares were up 3.2 per cent at Rs 130.30 at 2.55 pm.\n 26, 2015 3:06 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:55:44.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
