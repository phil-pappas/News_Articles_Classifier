Wayne Taylor by Katarina Kroslakova Favourite designer?\nHedi Slimane in his early years at Dior Homme for basically transforming the male silhouette. And Giorgio Armani in his early years for his mastery of fabrics.\nFavourite watch?\nRolex Explorer, any era. I don’t wear a watch at the moment but the release of the Apple Watch actually piqued my interest in traditional watches. The Rolex Explorer is understated and underappreciated, it seems. Not too flashy and tells the time. It’s on my list.\nFavourite car?\nAn old BMW 3 Series, or a Land Rover Defender for if I ever had time on my weekends. I appreciate cars that don’t beep too much. I had a brand new hire car in Italy recently and I swear there was not a moment it wasn’t beeping at me for some reason. Key in ignition, beep. Door open, beep. Luggage in the boot, beep. Speed camera ahead, beep. Need to shift up a gear, beep. Cars should be quiet.\nMost treasured tech?\nMy MacBook Air. It makes life – and emails – while travelling easier.\nYour preferred charity?\nAll charity is worthwhile and an underrated concept. I have a rescue Kelpie. Cruelty and negligence towards animals bewilders me. Cruelty in general I obviously find disturbing but seeing animals treated like a commodity gets to me.\nFavourite drink?\nAperol Spritz in the European summer and red wine in the Melbourne winter. I seem to be stuck between the two at the moment, so can I say both? Or does that sound like I drink too much? And coffee every morning – I live in Melbourne after all.\nFavourite way to travel?\nTurning left whenever I can. Or in a four-wheel-drive on a back road of New Zealand’s South Island.\nBest spot for relaxation?\nI’ve never had a lie-on-a-beach overseas vacation so it would have to be the family beach house on Main Beach, up in Queensland. Salt air, salt water and family dinners cure everything.\n Favourite destination for inspiration?\nNew Zealand for its connection to Rodd & Gunn and its naturalness. It’s hard not to be inspired when in R&G heartland, especially the South Island; the colours and changes in seasons are pretty epic.\nEurope and North America are great for observing people, for inspiration and for shopping. I try to visit a new destination at least once each major work trip to keep an open mind and not fall into too much of a routine. This month I’m going to Copenhagen for 24 hours in between appointments.\nWhat was your first luxury purchase?\nA pair of leather-soled Prada penny loafers that I wore for about a decade before they finally gave out. They taught me the value of well-made shoes that last.\nWhat does luxury mean to you?\nSymbolically? Time. Physically? Things that last and quality that is made to last – whether it’s clothes, leather, luggage, shoes, buildings or furniture. Usually these things take time to build and craft. So I guess it all comes back to time!\nJohn Prikryl is the creative director of Rodd & Gunn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:13:56.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
