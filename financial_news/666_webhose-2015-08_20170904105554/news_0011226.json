As Reisman explains, clinical efficacy cannot work without buy-in from those stakeholders who should be rewarded based on their value in preventing avoidable complications of disease.\n“To embark on a journey centered on medical excellence, delivery systems and suppliers of diagnostic services, devices, and pharmaceuticals will need to participate in health ecosystems with value/risk-based contracts that reward superior clinical and financial results,” Reisman writes.\nCreating incentives to preempt illness and medical events is the only way to keep costs from escalating at their current rate, he writes.\nReisman’s commentary is part of a year-long series appearing in The American Journal of Managed Care to mark the publication’s 20th anniversary.
