Brendon Thorne by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell ï»¿ Next Capital's decision to test the initial public offering window during reporting season is likely to be vindicated by the end of the week, with fund managers told order books for Vitaco's $250 million raising were filling up quickly.\nWhether it was the lure of a free lunch or interest in tapping China's consumer sector, it was said to be standing room only when Vitaco chief executive Ryan d'Almeida fronted investors at sponsor broker JPMorgan's Sydney office on Monday.\nd'Almeida, on day two of a one-week investor roadshow, pitched the forecast 22.6 per cent revenue growth in the 2016 financial year and expected 33.5 per cent improvement in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to $28 million.\nIt's understood discussion at the lunch - and one-on-one meetings before and after - centred on three key issues; Vitaco's sales into China; the company's recent acquisition of supplements brand Musashi; and payments to existing shareholders Next Capital, Mike Thompson and management as part of the float.\nVitaco's investor presentation revealed it made $4.6 million in direct sales to Asia in the June quarter, which was up from $4 million in March and a paltry $647,000 at the same time last year. But fund managers expect the real exposure to China is harder to work out, with most of the sales filtering through Vitaco's Australian and New Zealand businesses. And it is assumptions and modelling around these sales which is likely to determine who sees value in Vitaco at 18.5-times to 20.5-times profit, and who lets the opportunity pass.\nAs for Musashi, Vitaco expects the brand to contribute $4 million earnings and $26 million revenue in the 2016 financial year. Vitaco picked up the asset on July 1 and in the group's pathfinder revealed it did not know too much about Musashi's historical financial information.\nHowever, it is understood management told fundies it was confident the $6.5 million Musashi would prove to be a bargain buy, picked up from a vendor who had no real interest in running the business. [The vendor, Post Holdings, acquired Musashi as part of a larger acquisition from Nestle last October]. And management also pointed to cost-outs in the business unit.\nAnd as for vending shareholders, Next plans to retain a 15.9 per cent stake at the float, while Nutra-Life founder Mike Thompson would own 3.6 per cent and management 1 per cent. The shares will be subject to the usual voluntary escrow arrangements.\n Vitaco will front Sydney investors again on Tuesday, before moving to Melbourne on Wednesday. The $227 million to $251 million bookbuild is due to close Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:08:16.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
