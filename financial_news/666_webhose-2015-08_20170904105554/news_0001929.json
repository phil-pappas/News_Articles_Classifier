It's a shame,\" Mr Charlton said. \n\"It's not applicable for all situations but certainly there would be situations it could be seen to address but it's some way off.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T09:43:22.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
