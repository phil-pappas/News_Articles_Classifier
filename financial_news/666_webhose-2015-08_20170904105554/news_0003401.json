They still need to find the whole plane and our spouses as well. We still want them back,\" she said.\nThe airline described the discovery as \"a major breakthrough for us in resolving the disappearance of MH370.\n\"We expect and hope that there would be more objects to be found which would be able to help resolve this mystery,\" it said in a statement issued as soon as Najib had spoken.\nThe fragment of wing was flown to mainland France after being found last week covered in barnacles on a beach on France's Indian Ocean island of Reunion.\nDespite the Malaysian announcement that the wing was confirmed as coming from MH370, prosecutors in France, where it was still Wednesday evening, stopped short of declaring they were certain, although they said there was a very strong likelihood that was the case. A piece of luggage also found in Reunion would be examined by French police.\n\"The real work is yet to begin\" in inspecting the wing fragment, John Goglia, a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, told Reuters.\n\"They will identify everything they can from the metal: damage, barnacles, witness marks on the metal. They're going to look at the brackets (that held the flapron in place) to see how they broke. From that they can tell the direction and attitude of the airplane when it hit. There's a lot to be told from the metal.\"\nThe examination of the part is being carried out under the direction of a judge at an aeronautical test facility run by the French military at Balma, a suburb of the southwestern city of Toulouse, and witnessed by Malaysian officials.\nOfficials from the United States and manufacturer Boeing were also on hand. Boeing declined to comment.\nFlight MH370 went missing on March 8 last year while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. It is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from Reunion.\nThe Balma test centre specialises in metal analysis and is equipped with a scanning electron microscope capable of 100,000 times magnification. It was used to store and analyse debris from an Air France jet which crashed in the Atlantic in 2009.\nThe Boeing 777 was minutes into its scheduled flight when it disappeared from civil radar. Investigators believe that someone may have deliberately switched off the aircraft's transponder, diverted it thousands of miles off course, and deliberately crashed into the ocean off Australia.\nIn January, Malaysia Airlines officially declared the disappearance an accident, clearing the way for the carrier to pay compensation to relatives while the search goes on.\nA $90 million hunt along a rugged 60,000 sq km patch of sea floor 1,600 km (1,000 miles) west of the Australian city of Perth has yielded nothing.\nThe search has been extended to another 60,000 sq km (23,000 sq miles) and Malaysian and Australian authorities say this will cover 95 percent of MH370's flight path.\n(Additional reporting by Tim Hepher , Siva Govindasamy, Praveen Menon, Emmanuel Jarry, Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah, Ebrahim Harris and Alwyn Scott; Writing by Peter Graff ; Editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T22:25:13.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
