Coty stock fell by 4.7% on July 9 to $30.04, and P&G fell by 0.4% to $80.66. \nBut despite the downbeat reaction, Coty had already risen by almost 21% to $31.52 between June 15 and July 8. P&G rose by 3.7% to $80.99 over the same period. On June 15, the New York Post reported that P&G had divested its brands to Coty . Deal upshot \nWhile the deal seems to be a win-win for both Coty and P&G, Coty has a tall task ahead in terms of growing sales and profitability, particularly in developed markets. Coty’s sales have been almost flat over the past three years. The sales increase in constant-currency terms was negative in fiscal 2014. Organic sales declined by 7% in color cosmetics. \nSales in P&G’s beauty business, too, have been almost flat over the past three years at ~$19.5 billion. Any growth in emerging markets, or the prospect thereof, has been offset by foreign currency headwinds. \nIn contrast, consumer product peers L’Oréal (LRLCY) (OR.PA) and Estée Lauder (EL) have had very consistent constant-currency sales growth across segments over the past five years. \nFor its part, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY) (MC.PA) has a very strong brand in Sephora. Importantly, Sephora and most other premium peers aren’t facing the same headwinds in developed markets. In fact, they’re a strong attractor for prestige channels. \nAnd while the brand acquisitions from P&G have propelled Coty higher in terms of scale, it remains to be seen whether Coty can maintain its third position and grow along with the number one and two players in the beauty industry—L’Oréal and Estée Lauder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T18:17:03.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
