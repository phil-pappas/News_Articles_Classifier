Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Listed cloud accounting company Xero will use a raft of new partnerships and agreements to try and evolve from its traditional accounting roots to become an all-round player in the booming fintech industry, however plans for a US initial public offering have been put back.\nXero announced numerous new commercial partnerships at its Xerocon conference in Melbourne last week, including agreements with NAB, Moula and OzForex. The company's Australian managing director Chris Ridd said it was part of becoming a \"true fintech\" player.\n\"If you look at the next five to 10 years, we're evolving into a true fintech with a big data play,\" Mr Ridd said.\nThis vision was backed up by Xero's head of strategic partnerships, financial services, Ben Styles, who said Xero was increasingly looking to appeal to small businesses, by smoothing out all of their dealings with financial services companies.\nAttendance at Xerocon hit 1600 people in 2015, up from 130 four years ago. Supplied \"Going to a bank is a really painful process for businesses. Our agreement with Moula gives businesses the ability to share their financial data with Moula and then Moula can make an instant lending decision so businesses can receive same-day loans,\" Mr Styles said.\nXero's extended partnership with NAB will also now let businesses make enquiries about new business loans from their accounting dashboard and automatically share financial data. Xero said it is also in the process of securing relationships with other banks.\n\"We've announced our preferred partners… But we're not picking winners,\" Mr Styles said. \"We'll soon have other lenders connecting with us too.\"\n﻿ OzForex and CGU alliances Xero and money transfer platform OzForex have also partnered to allow their customers to automatically make international payments against Xero invoices.\nAnother agreement with CGU Insurance will let Xero customers obtain CGU business insurance Quote: s directly through the software. Eventually this will enable real-time insurance Quote: s, with customers able to have their insurance premiums automatically adjusted as their business grows and goes through different cycles.\nThese new deals come as Xero has seemingly pushed back plans for an initial public offering in the United States.\nMr Ridd said there was no set timeframe for when the US IPO would occur.\n\"We will be guided by internal as well as external factors. We have indicated that we won't list in this financial year. We think the conditions could be right next financial year, particularly as Xero globally bypasses $200 million in subscription revenue this financial year,\" he said.\n\"A US listing will help to establish Xero's credibility in the market, as it did in Australia and New Zealand before it.\"\nUS IPO delayed The US IPO was originally planned for 2015, but in March it was delayed until at least early 2016 and now it seems unlikely to occur before mid-2016.\nAttendance at this year's Melbourne Xerocon exceeded 1600, up from about 130 people at the first conference in 2011.\n\"Xerocon four years ago could have been run in a café,\" Mr Ridd said.\nMr Ridd admitted the event was expensive to throw each year and that Xero made a loss from it.\n\"It's a lot of money and we invest quite a bit of it ourselves, so it doesn't recover costs,\" he said.\nAt Xerocon the business announced it had reached 250,000 Australian customers and it has set its sights on reaching 1 million customers worldwide.\nIn Australia, Britain and the US it faces stiff competition from MYOB, Sage and Intuit, but Mr Ridd was unfazed.\n\"Four years ago at Xerocon it was about why the cloud, but we don't have to have that discussion any more. The competition has woken up and that keeps us on our toes about having to innovate,\" he said.\nOther announcements at Xerocon this year included deals with Dropbox, Adobe, Bigcommerce, Insightly, Veda and Mindbody.\nThe partnership with Dropbox will integrate the Xero Tax and Dropbox for Business platforms, making it easier for customers to store, share and collaborate on documents.\nAdobe is working with Xero to build in its eSign digital signature technology across the accounting platform and Bigcommerce will let 95,000 retail merchants and online stores push sales data directly into Xero.\n\"The fact that we have customers in 150 countries around the globe means we're a big and attractive platform for these businesses to work with,\" Mr Ridd said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-08-17T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:08:25.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
