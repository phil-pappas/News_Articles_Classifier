The Minneapolis office of Grandbridge Real Estate Capital provided the financing. Bloomington-based Cushman & Wakefield/NorthMarq, which is under the same Pohlad family umbrella that includes United, will continue to manage the properties and leasing. \nInformation from United Properties listed it as the seller, but CoStar Group lists IRET as the owner of the property. United Properties representatives declined to comment on the ownership structure. \n\nMortenson reveals Northeast plan : Golden Valley-based Mortenson Development has unveiled initial plans for a 28-story apartment tower above 6,000 square feet of retail space on a bank site in the hot Northeast area of Minneapolis. \nIn May, Mortenson said it was “evaluating options” for a mixed-use project at 333 E. Hennepin Ave., now home to a U.S. Bank branch and a Papa John’s restaurant. Now, those ideas are on paper as Mortenson has submitted preliminary concepts to the city of Minneapolis Planning Commission for feedback. \nMortenson is among four developers planning to build residential towers in that area. \n\nWeidner closes on purchase of AIDS Project office : The two developers planning a six-story rental development in Elliot Park in downtown Minneapolis have secured their first site for the project. \nAn entity related to Washington-based Weidner Apartment Homes paid $4.5 million cash this week for a 1.7-acre site at 1400 Park Ave., according to an electronic certificate of real estate value made public Thursday. The seller is the Minnesota AIDS Project nonprofit, which has its offices there. \nTUESDAY, AUG. 18 \nTwin Cities industrial properties are seeing their highest absorption numbers in more than a half-decade. In the past few months, Shakopee has cemented its status as one of the region’s industrial property hotspots with plans to welcome Walgreen Co. supplier AmerisourceBergen Corp. into a 216,000-square-foot distribution facility, shown here under construction, plus build an 820,000-square-foot build-to-suit space for Amazon. (Staff photo: Bill Klotz) \nIndustrial property market barreling through 2015: Twin Cities industrial properties are seeing their highest absorption numbers in more than a half-decade, fueled by pent-up demand from increasingly confident tenants and an influx of nationally known companies deepening ties to the area. \n\nThe strong run comes as companies creep back into the marketplace with renewed confidence after an economic downturn put development plans on ice. In the first half, absorption on area industrial properties hit 1.38 million square feet, according to a Monday report from Cushman & Wakefield/NorthMarq. \nAbsorption through the back half of the year is expected to increase by 1.95 million square feet, the firm predicted, likely pushing industrial leasing rates past pre-recession levels hit in 2005. The upbeat outlook translates to a series of deals this year involving properties with 100,000 square feet of space or more. \n\nNew casino coming to northwest Minnesota : With its planned new casino on the outskirts of Bagley in Clearwater County, the White Earth Nation vows to bring more than new gaming options to northwest Minnesota. \nThe new Shooting Star Casino on Highway 27 between Ebro and Bagley, scheduled to open in spring 2016, will kick-start economic growth in and around Clearwater County, and bring 40 permanent new jobs to the area, the tribe says. \nBill Marsh, general manager of the White Earth Nation’s Shooting Star Casino, said the project will provide opportunities for Native American subcontractors during construction. \nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 19 \nUnions say settlement shows risks of ‘alter egos’ : Minnesota construction trade unions are turning up the heat on union-signatory contractors who set up a separate non-union company, or “alter ego,” with the intent — in the unions’ view — of sidestepping their collectively bargained obligations. \nUnions say the practice, known as “double-breasting,” is an attempt by union-signatory contractors to avoid paying union wages and benefits, though others say it’s a legitimate effort to become more competitive in union and non-union marketplaces. \nWhat’s not disputed is that the practice has inspired a number of union-driven complaints in Minnesota, including a recent case that resulted in a $1.3 million settlement against Corcoran-based Hicks Concrete and Construction Science. \n\nLand sold for ‘lifestyle’ project: Minnetrista-based Level 7 Development has closed on a land deal for its proposed mixed-use “lifestyle” development on 110 acres of farmland near Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chanhassen. \nAccording to electronic certificates of real estate value filed with Hennepin County on Monday afternoon, the developer paid roughly $10.47 million for the land near Highway 212 on the southwest corner of Lyman and Powers boulevards. \nIn February, Level 7 submitted to the city a proposal that shows plans for 360,000 square feet of one-story commercial space, 40,000 square feet of one-story offices, and a three-story, 190-unit apartment building in the 78-acre first phase. \n\nRosedale expansion to go before city in September: A proposed expansion project that’s expected to bring another anchor tenant to Rosedale Mall in Roseville is up for city reviews next month. \nPlans for the 141,000-square-foot expansion on the mall’s northeast side are expected to go before the city’s Planning Commission Sept. 2, followed by City Council review on Sept. 21, said Paul Bilotta, the city’s community development director. \nBilotta said the mall has submitted applications related to platting and a planned unit development amendment for the project. Besides the additional square footage, the mall has plans for a 450-space parking structure and interior remodeling work. \nTHURSDAY, AUG. 20 \nMarket ripe for expansion: Minneapolis officials are beginning to map out an expansion of the city’s largest farmers market, at 312 East Lyndale Ave. N., that would include indoor space near a planned light rail station. \nCity Council members discussed the prospective market expansion at a study session earlier this month, where many of them voiced strong support for the effort. Still in its preliminary stages, the project is an outgrowth of former Mayor R.T. Rybak’s push to strengthen Minneapolis’ farmers market system. \nGreg Goeke, the city’s director of property services, said the market, nestled east of Interstate 94, is ripe for investment — particularly as the area around it tilts toward large-scale redevelopment. Talks to bring a professional soccer stadium to Minneapolis focus on a nearby swath, and the Southwest Light Rail Transit line’s Royalston Station stop will sit a few blocks away. \n\nStadium contingency fund $10M to the good, MSFA says : Amid concerns about change orders for the Vikings stadium project, the chair of the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority says the owner’s contingency fund for the project is tracking nearly $10 million ahead of where it was expected to be at this point. \n“I want to be clear: We do not have a cost overrun,” said Michele Kelm-Helgen, board chair of the MSFA, which is overseeing construction of the 65,000-seat stadium on the public’s behalf. “We clearly have ample funds in our contingency.” \nBut not everyone agrees that all is well with the project’s finances, and the former treasurer of the MSFA warns that the owner’s contingency may be insufficient to keep up with escalating costs. \nFRIDAY, AUG. 21 \nMN construction hiring slows in July: Minnesota’s construction sector shed 2,000 jobs in July, but the losses suggest a return to normalcy after a strong post-recession comeback rather than a slowdown. \nState data released Thursday compares last month’s performance with job gains made in July in recent years, driven by stimulus funding and demand that built up during the downturn. The apartment construction boom and major public projects like the new Vikings stadium also boosted construction hiring. \nThe sector actually added 2,361 jobs last month on an unadjusted basis, according to the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. But seasonally adjusted construction job losses fed into the state’s overall 3,900-job drop for July. That’s still a long way from offsetting year-over-year unadjusted gains of 43,719 jobs – a growth rate of 1.5 percent. \n\n3M will quadruple space for design center : Maplewood-based 3M Co. is poised for another significant campus upgrade as the company nears completion of a $150 million research and development facility on its corporate headquarters site at Interstate 94 and McKnight Road. \nThe latest project, announced Wednesday, is a nearly 40,000-square-foot interior renovation for a new 3M Design Center, which will be four times as big as the company’s existing design space, 3M said. \nThe new three-level space will be carved out within an existing campus structure, known as Building 223.
