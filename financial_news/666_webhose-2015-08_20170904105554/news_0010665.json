But it needs lighter, faster vehicles for the future.\nThe new JLTV aims to combine the protection of the MRAPs with the off-road mobility of the original Humvees, which were slowed considerably by the addition of protective armor. The Army also wants better communications gear for the trucks.\nCharlie Szews, chief executive of Oshkosh, told Reuters last week he was upbeat about his company's vehicle, which he said would offer the government exactly what it wanted: \"the most vehicle they can get for under $250,000 in FY11 dollars.\"\nSzews said the Oshkosh JLTV was \"fully loaded\" and meets the Army's high-end targets for performance, at or below the target price. He said the company also saw good prospects for future military sales and had several demonstrations planned for potential buyers next summer.\nLockheed said it was disappointed by the decision and would await a briefing from government officials before deciding whether to protest the contract award.\nNo comment was immediately available from AM General.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Dan Grebler and Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:47:14.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
