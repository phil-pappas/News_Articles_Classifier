Photo: Jessica Hromas\nChanging the tax mix by increasing the goods and services tax (GST) while reducing personal and corporate tax rates would \"undoubtedly\" stimulate the economy, says the boss of the nation's largest bank.\nCalling for action on Australia's big policy challenges, Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive Ian Narev said the bank supports the Business Council of Australia's view on tax policy, \"which is we need to have a debate where everything is on the table [to] work out a tax policy that is good for the country in the long term\".\nIn its submission to the government's tax discussion paper released last week , the BCA called for a reduction in personal income and company tax rates, a move away from inefficient state taxes, an increase in the rate of the GST and a broadening of its base in order to compensate for the lost revenue. This revenue-neutral changing of the tax mix was also central to the Financial Services Council submission to the tax discussion paper, along with many others.\nWhile stopping short of explicitly endorsing a rise in the GST and cut to corporate tax, Mr Narev said during an interview after delivering the bank's $9.14 billion full-year profit on Wednesday that the BCA's proposal \"has got to be on the table\". Mr Narev also recognised that, in the context of arguments for a higher GST, it is crucial to consider \"the whole fairness dynamics in the tax debate\" including compensation for lower income earners paying extra GST, which is a regressive tax.\nAdvertisement Yet is clear that cutting personal and corporate tax rates and funding those by an increase in the GST would stimulate business investment, he said, which would boost productivity and economic growth.\n\"Now there is no doubt the combination of an increase in GST and a reduction in corporate tax, from the point of view of how it looks to stimulate business investment that would be a net positive thing,\" Mr Narev said.\n\"Instinctively, it is really worth looking at â€“ it certainly needs a really good look. If you increase the GST and reduce corporate tax, you are undoubtedly going to stimulate some business investment. That is a clear phenomenon. If the only lense is what is going to stimulate business, that combination undoubtedly works.\"\nThe Financial Services Council submission to the tax paper includes modelling by KMPG which finds increasing the GST to 15 per cent and broadening its base to include health, education and fresh food would deliver $42 billion to the financial year 2016 budget. This extra revenue could then be spent on a welfare package for low-income earners to compensate them for the regressive nature of the GST and to offset lost revenue from cuts to personal income tax rates, the company tax rate, and the abolition of various inefficient state taxes.\nThe new tax mix would allow Australia to improve the medium-term fiscal sustainability of all governments by boosting productivity, competitiveness and GDP growth.\n\"One of the challenges for a period of time, and I think we are all guilty of this, is we keep saying what others are doing is holding back the policy debate, whereas we actually need to start focusing on what we can each do as businesses, and on each side of policy, to advance the policy debate and get some of these things wrestled down,\" Mr Narev told reporters on Wednesday as he reported the bank's record full-year profit .\n\"I think what we need is a combination of the right tax policies, the right cuts to non-essential spending, the right increases to spending such as on quality infrastructure.\n\"I think we have reached the point where rather than business saying government has to do more, and government saying business has to stand up and do more, we actually have to pick a few of things off and work together with them to wrestle them down to the point of good policy.\"\nOther bank bosses have also been advocating for reform to fix the mix of taxes. National Australia Bank boss Andrew Thorburn said last month Australia is \"at a crossroads\" and without structural reform of the tax system and federation \"our living standards will inevitably fall\".\nThe comments come ahead of the National Reform Summit, convened by The Australian Financial Review and The Australian on August 26, which has tax policy on its agenda. In addition, as part of its national policy series, The Australian Financial Review will host the Tax Reform Summit on September 22 and 23, which will be addressed by Treasurer Joe Hockey .\nMr Hockey said earlier this week Australia had a problem with its overreliance on personal income tax to support revenue. \"So in developing a better tax system, we need to consider the sustainability of our heavy reliance on income tax, especially personal income tax,\" he wrote in The Australian. \"This is because we need to take into consideration the negative impact and disincentive of higher taxes.\"\nRoger Brake, the general manager of the tax white paper taskforce, told the FSC conference on the Gold Coast last week there is strong support from the 850 submissions received on the March discussion paper for reducing personal income and company tax rates and for abolishing state stamp duties .\nHe also said the taskforce is paying close attention to international competitiveness issues, pointing to the UK, where the corporate tax rate is moving to 18 per cent by 2020. In Asia, the average corporate tax rate is 22 per cent, much lower than Australia's 30 per cent. Economists say higher corporate tax rates can limit wages and productivity growth.\nMr Narev said he hoped there is enough urgency in Canberra to pursue reform and urged policy makers and business to understand their respective challenges and to work together to overcome them.\n\"We have to, as business, understand the political realities associated with different policies, just as we hope politicians understand business realities. We need to make sure these are given careful consideration,\" he said.\n\"But we also need to make sure these things work to a timetable that reflect the fact we don't have forever to get these policies right, as a country.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/politicians-told-to-stop-bickering-and-start-tax-and-federation-policy-reform-20150717-giesvz", "http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/tax-reform-plan-coming-into-focus-20150806-git84n", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/commonwealth-bank-profits-suggest-banks-glory-days-ending-20150812-gixkrq", "http://www.afr.com/news/policy/industrial-relations/ir-system-has-created-a-class-of-conservative-riskaverse-managers-20150813-giyi45", "http://www.informa.com.au/conferences/financial-services-conference/afr-tax-reform-summit"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:51:39.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
