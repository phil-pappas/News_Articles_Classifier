Steven Siewert by Matthew Stevens China's hostile re-entry of the global currency war with the biggest devaluation of the yuan in two decades could not have come at a worse time for the once in a generation decision that sits heavy on Paul O'Malley's​ desk.\nIn November, O'Malley will celebrate his eighth year at the helm of Australia's biggest integrated steelmaker, BlueScope Steel. And there is plenty of noise around that says by the time this bronze anniversary comes around, O'Malley will have made a decision on whether or not to close BlueScope's last remaining raw steel mill at Port Kembla.\nIn June, Port Kembla management told the mill workforce that their business needed to take a \"game-changing approach\" to cost reduction at the mill. The ambition was remove between $50 and $100 a tonne from its cost base to sustain a competitive future. To put that task into some sort of context, it costs about $480 a tonne to produce the hot rolled coil that BlueScope makes at Port Kembla. And hitting management's target of sustainability has only got harder since financial year-end.\nThe price of Chinese HRC has fallen nearly 30 per cent this year reaching lows in recent weeks as the Middle Kingdom's domestic steel demand continues to undershoot production schedules. As a result, through July, forecasts of Chinese steel exports rose by up to 25 per cent with expectations now that up to 100mt of product will leak into regional, North American and European markets.\nPaul O’Malley of BlueScope steel. Steven Siewert That potential has been made almost certain by a devaluation that will leave all class of Chinese steel exports more competitive and leave BlueScope even more firmly poised on dilemma's horn.\nTo understand how pointy that horn is, consider that the devaluation news from China lobbed almost simultaneously with confirmation that the big six of the US steel industry had trooped off to Washington for the third time this year in search of tariffs on imported steels.\nCertainly, it will not have helped O'Malley's mood to hear that Australian hot rolled coil sat among the US majors' targets. For the record there, China was not on that list, only because its steel is already targeted by US tariffs. Again, given the struggle BlueScope and fellow domestic producer Arrium have had in securing anti-dumping protections, this would likely bring O'Malley no particular succour.\nO'Malley has long argued for an anti-dumping regime that is fleeter of foot and more readily deployable. BlueScope argues that even the beefed up regime of recent years is too slow and too easily beaten.\n The most recent \"boron scam\" is a classic example. Apparently some foreign steelmakers have danced around our anti-dumping tariffs by subtly changing the specification of their steel through the addition of a bag of boron to their raw materials mix. It is reported this window of opportunity is being closed slowly.\nThere appear to be two choices on the future of BlueScope's corner of Port Kembla. It can work with everyone from workers to government to a point where it can competitively make raw steel through the cycle. Or it can shut the mill down and then, just as it is elsewhere around its manufacturing region, rely on other people's steel mills to provide it with the raw materials of its value-adding coating and painting operations.\nLooked at through the prism of right now, where Chinese hot rolled coil is selling at around $US300 a tonne, there is little doubt that BlueScope can buy hot rolled coil much cheaper than it can make it. Estimates of the short term EBITDA gain to be extracted from a switch to the import model range from $300 million to circa $450 million. Deutsche Bank reported the share price upside ranged between 38 per cent and 67 per cent even after accounting for closure costs of between $500 million and $1 billion.\nThe problem for O'Malley, of course, is that the closure of a blast furnace is a decision for the ages rather than just the now. Jobs would go, economies local and regional would be dented and Australia's long history in steel would be one uncertain chapter from its end. Arrium's arguably more financially vulnerable Whyallaworks in South Australia would be left Australia last functioning blast furnace.\nFor all that, Arrium was one of the few listed companies with an obvious exposure to competitive risk by the yuan's devaluation that was not spanked by investors on Wednesday. Then again, when past slip-ups and continuing structural flaws have seen your share price slide sixfold over a year to a spare 12.5¢ a pop, there is not a whole lot of downside left.\nBlueScope, on the other hand, lost more than 2 per cent as investors assessed, and then acted on, the implications of China's devaluation.\nIt has to be said that retreat was modest in comparison with the spanking delivered to listed steel producers in the US where falls ranged between 3 per cent and nearly 9 per cent. A similar level of pain was inflicted on the US and European aluminium producers overnight as it was on the minerals and energy sectors.\nThat mood flowed through to trading on ASX on Wednesday as investors aggressively addressed the effect the yuan's lower value might have on commodities demand. Battle-scarred Fortescue felt the full force of our new normal with its share price trading down by 8.5 per cent to $1.78 a share. The Third Force's bigger brethren in iron ore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, were also marked down though not as heavily as they were in UK trading.\nCSL set to harvest R&D Investors seemed just a tad disappointed with CSL's promise merely to sustain the steady single digit revenue and profit momentum exhibited in its 2015 results. But it is hard to guess why.\nSure, growth capex is going to rise by maybe 20 per cent through the coming year as a range of growth projects reach fulfilment and yes the confusion of its currency mix mean there has been a 10 per cent depression of its balance sheet despite the helpful depreciation of the Australian dollar.\nBut the business sits on the cusp of fulfilment of the promise made by now comfortable, embedded chief executive Paul Perreault​ when he was delivered the helm of Australia's medical marvel just over two years ago.\nPerreault's appointment in February 2013 closed one of the longest and most successful CEO tenures in recent Australian commercial history. But any worries that the end of the 23-year long Brian McNamee era might unsettle the business must surely now have been put to rest\nPerreault said the future would be about the commercialisation of the CSL's continuing R&D achievements. So it is that the business will spend $US500 million through FY16 ensuring that it is ready to deliver on that promise as plants for new and improved product lines are completed in Switzerland, Germany, North America and dear old Broadmeadows in Melbourne's west.\nAt the same time as signalling the mechanics of a new financial momentum from 2017, Perreault confirmed that shareholders should expect a repetition of the $A950 million on-market share buyback that was completed through the back end of FY15. The logic of that foreshadowed capital management was spelled out by CFO Gordon Naylor who called out that the routine of buybacks since 2005 had added 23 per cent to CSL earnings per share.\nCSL's Australian shareholders have others reason to celebrate. The withering of the Australian dollar against the greenback saw a 10 per cent increase in their US denominated and unfranked dividend translate into a whopping 39 per cent increase in their payout in the local currency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:11:23.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
