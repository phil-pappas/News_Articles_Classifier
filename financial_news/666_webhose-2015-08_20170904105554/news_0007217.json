Photo: Brand X Pictures\nOne of Australia's largest institutional investors, the $50.3 billion industry superannuation fund UniSuper, has strongly criticised funders of class actions, saying there is little justification for them taking such a handsome share of settlements.\nUniSuper head of legal and risk Luke Barrett said Australia's litigation funding landscape was dominated by a few players that quickly partnered with the law firms leading class actions, which meant that when a class action was put to shareholders there was only ever the option of one litigation funder.\n\"The big question is, why are litigation funders able to charge 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the recovery amount?,\" said Mr Barrett, who will next month be speaking at the Maurice Blackburn and BusinessDay corporate conduct and class actions symposium in Melbourne,\n\"That can often be a multiple of what the legal fees were, and then in the big shareholder class action normally they will be.\"\nAdvertisement Mr Barrett said he was yet to see evidence of any need for litigation funders to take such a big slice of class action settlements.\nTheir fair share? \"The litigation funders will say that their 30 to 40 per cent commission - for want of a better word - is fair compensation for their value add.\n\"My question back to them is what is the value add and is 30 to 40 per cent of the compensation a fair amount of compensation for that?\"\nHowever, Mr Barrett said bringing in more litigation funders to Australia was not \"always a positive development\" as it was hard to compare their fee structures to the incumbents and would not go to the heart of the issue surrounding the lack of competition in the industry.\n\"At the moment, even though there may be multiple litigation funders, the first litigation funder to partner up with a law firm to bring a particular class action enjoys a formidable position,\" he said.\nMr Barrett confirmed UniSuper has participated in class actions in the US and in Australia, but he would not be drawn on what actions the fund had joined.\nMr Barrett also revealed UniSuper had lobbied litigation funders in the past to get a lower fee for participating in a class action than what was being offered to retail investors.\n\"With some irony, we are often rebuffed by the litigation funder that it would unfair for them to charge a lower fee scale to a particular subset of investors. Now at first glance that sounds fair, but if the standard scale of fees is so generously in their favour, is the position really that the right thing to do is to charge an unfair amount to everyone?\"\nMr Barrett also addressed the perception that institutional investors participating in class actions were effectively suing themselves (by owning stakes in the sued companies) and putting their dividend payments at risk.\n\"That concern simply does not apply if you're no longer a shareholder. And even if you are still a shareholder, the class action might actually go ahead with or without you anyway, so your dividends might be impacted to a similar extent even if you don't go into it.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.mauriceblackburn.com.au/symposium/"], "published": "2015-08-21T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T14:04:08.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
