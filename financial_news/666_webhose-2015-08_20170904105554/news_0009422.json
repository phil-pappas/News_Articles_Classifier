Alibaba and Foxconn declined to comment. The person was not authorised to disclose the matter and so declined to be identified.\nThe deal represents Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba’s first direct investment in India. Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group in February agreed to buy 25 percent of Indian payment services provider One97 Communications.\nIn October, Snapdeal, which connects small businesses with customers in an online marketplace, secured a $627 million investment from Japan’s SoftBank, itself an early backer of Alibaba.\nAlibaba was in direct funding talks with Snapdeal in March, but opted to instead invest together with SoftBank and Foxconn, the person familiar with the $500 million investment said.\nFoxconn founder Terry Gou told shareholders at an annual meeting two months ago that India is a key market this year for his group.\nIn March, Snapdeal Chief Executive Kunal Bahl said his company was not looking to raise money immediately and was well capitalised for the next couple of years.\nFirst Published on August 03, 2015 11:57 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T18:06:10.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
