High end models were designed to be user-upgradable in years to come. Sure, they're pricey, went the sales pitch. But that's the cost of future-proofing. So come 2015, we wonder whether the investment was worth it.\nA few things are sure. The sales staffer who impressed you with the benefits of Smart Evolution back then probably can't tell you anything about the upgrade kits that have since hit the market. You won't find the kits on prominent display in stores, and they're never featured in catalogues. Even though the retailer that supplied us took our email address and occasionally sends breathless promo messages, we've never received a note about an upgrade option. It's almost as if the industry is happy to push top dollar upgradable panels, but doesn't actually want us to upgrade.\nIn fact, last year and this have both seen Evolution kits, although the 2015 unit hasn't reached Australia yet. 2014's SEK-2500 unit retails around AUD$389 and the later SEK-3500 will set you back US$398 from Amazon. Are they worth it? It's a lucky dip.\nOn paper, the 2500 boosts processing power, improves picture quality and upgrades Smart Hub, Samsung's interface control centre, and Smart Interaction, its gesture and voice command system. But user experiences were hit and miss. The quad core processor is undeniably faster and system response times are perceptibly lower, so it's a snappier TV to operate. Whether or not image quality improves seems to depend largely on the source of your content. Netflix customers generally report better vision, but it's hard to pick any improvement on free to air channels.\nTaking the Tizen gamble The 2015 3500 unit is much more ambitious. It upgrades the set to the all-new Tizen operating system. Now, Tizen is a big gamble for Samsung. It competes with Google's Android, also based on the open-source Linux system, and is aimed at providing a consistent platform for PCs, tablets, smartphones, wearables, smart home appliances and, of course, TVs. The company's Gear 2 smartwatch and Z1 phone, for instance, run on Tizen, and a bunch of new Tizen handsets are on the way.\nThe operating system is just fine for your TV. The new Smart Hub running on top of it is to the taste of some, while it irks others. That's par for the course with an interface. But Tizen itself is quick and stable, and clips along courtesy of an eight core processor built into the 3500. The problem is that unless Tizen proves popular in the smartphone market, it's destined to be dumped in favour of Android. So it may not be here for the long term, on phones or televisions.\nBoth upgrade kits have been beset with firmware problems, with too many users reporting decreased performance, faults and missing functionality. It's a good argument for hanging back on the new 3500, resisting the temptation to fly one in from Amazon, until the bugs are worked out. And if you haven't already bought the older 2500, bypass it altogether unless you find one at a bargain price. They can turn up online for $150.\n The devices offer one advantage that isn't spruiked but turns out to be a real bonus for some. They are external to your TV, connecting via a single cable and offering their own HDMI, USB and other input ports and RCA and optical audio out, replacing the ports on the rear of the panel. Accessing the standard ports can be a first class pain when the television is wall-mounted or even free standing close to a wall. By acting as an external, connected hub that can be positioned below the panel and inside an entertainment cabinet, the kits make it much easier to connect other devices. With home theatre, a Blu-ray player, a media box, Google's Chromecast and a recorder attached, a Samsung has a mass of cables, frustrating to install and swap around. With the external hub attached, shorter cables can be used, and easily connected in the cabinet below the panel.\nIf your existing set up is awkward to access, that alone may justify an upgrade kit. Otherwise, there's a reason Evolution hasn't set the world on fire. It's proven to be great for some, but not the game changer sales folk used to claim.\nPeter Moon is a technology lawyer with Cooper Mills. peter.moon@coopermills.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T04:06:32.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
