SAGE also provides systems for the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Kate Geraghty by Simon Evans The chief executive of robotics company SAGE Automation, which is forming an alliance with big Spanish shipbuilder Navantiaâ€‹, says Australian companies need to become better at inserting themselves into sophisticated global supply chains.\nAdrian Fahey says establishing a separate company in Australia where both SAGE and Navantia will be major shareholders is the culmination of increasingly closer links between the two. The move had its genesis in 2007 when SAGE made several trips to Spain to outline its credentials, even though it was small.\n\"We wanted to be front of mind,\" he said. \"What we have done is got out of our armchair and actually gone somewhere.\"\nMr Fahey said the final negotiations about the size of each firm's shareholding are still being hammered out, but physically establishing a new corporate entity is an important step in \"solidifying\" the relationship between the two companies who have been working on the control systems for the Royal Australian Navy's new destroyers over several years. It will be called Navantia SAGE Automation Group, also known as NSAG.\nSAGE works across a range of industries in high-end automation and control systems and its customers include Swiss-based commodities trading house Glencore, BHP Billiton, Orica and Santos. It has also built an electronic lane-changing system for the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nThe company employs about 260 people and has annual revenues of close to $64 million, while Navantia employs about 6000 people and is the ninth-largest shipbuilder in the world. Navantia is owned by the Spanish government.\nMr Fahey said that while government-backed trade missions overseas were valuable, there were too many businesses sitting back and waiting for government assistance.\nHe said Navantia and SAGE's new business was a good model for Australian businesses attempting to become a part of complex global supply chains. \"This is a long-term play,\" he said.\n But while there were incredible complexities in the computerised systems and the opportunity to access very big markets overseas for those with the expertise and the ability to harness those opportunities, the falling Australian dollar meant the timing was right for those who wanted to emphasise how cost competitive they could be.\nThe new corporate vehicle being established by Navantia and SAGE comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott outlined on Monday in Adelaide that he would make announcements in the next day or so that would \"minimise\" the problem of Australia falling victim to the so-called \"valley of death\", where work on major shipbuilding projects stopped and started as big contracts ended, causing serious economic problems because of a lack of continuity.\nThere is speculation Mr Abbott will announce a $20 billion project spread across South Australia and Victoria for the construction of up to nine frigates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:55:23.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
