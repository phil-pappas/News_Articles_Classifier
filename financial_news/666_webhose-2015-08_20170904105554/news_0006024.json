Prices range from under $200 to way more than $1,000. \nApple MacBook Air (11-inch) \nSuper lightweight, easy to carry and offering long battery life, the MacBook Air is Apple's most affordable line of portable computers. \nThe Air come in two sizes - either 11-inch or 13-inch screens. At the lower end is the $899 model with an 11-inch display, 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of flash-based storage. Double the storage and the price rises to $1,099. For 13-inch models add $100 to those prices. All machines run on Intel dual-core i5 processors. \nApple claims the 11-inch MacBook Air can provide up to 9 hours of computing on a fully charged battery and as much as 12 hours on the larger model. Either model would be perfect for a full day's use at school and many hours of homework too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T01:09:22.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
