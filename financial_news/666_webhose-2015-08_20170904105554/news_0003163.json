Paul Jeffers by John Kerin and Simon Evans Prime Minister Tony Abbott's $39 billion warship plan will sacrifice 1000 jobs in Melbourne to save Education Minister Christopher Pyne's seat, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews claims.\nMr Abbott on Tuesday announced new frigates and offshore patrol boats would be built primarily in Adelaide in a bid to protect 2500 jobs in naval shipbuilding.\nDefence Minister Kevin Andrews said the total cost was in the order of $89 billion, including $50 billion to be spent on submarines – though there was no further indication on where the subs would be built.\nSenior Liberals had said ahead of Mr Abbott's announcement that as many as three lower house seats would be lost in South Australia at the next election unless the government shored up jobs in the wake of the loss of the automotive industry and a downturn in engineering and construction.\nBill Shorten called for warship and submarine work to be spread across struggling shipyards nationally. Joe Armao But the plan, which will not see work on offshore patrol vessels start until 2018 and the frigates from 2020, may still come too late for Newcastle-based Forgacs​ shipyard and Melbourne-based BAE Systems shipyard at Williamstown where hundreds of jobs are under threat following the wind-down of naval ship projects.\nMr Andrews said Mr Abbott may have announced most of the work would take place in Adelaide to save federal seats.\nBAE shipyards in Melbourne, Forgacs in Newcastle and ASC in Adelaide have laid off hundreds of workers as work winds down on the $9 billion Adelaide-based destroyer construction.\n\"I do fear that Tony Abbott is far more concerned about Christopher Pyne's job than the jobs of hundreds of Victorian shipbuilders and that is a disgrace,\" Mr Andrews said.\n Forgacs chairman Peter Burgess said another 300 jobs would go by Christmas unless the shipyard obtained immediate shipbuilding work and 600 jobs had been lost over the past 12 months.\n\"It appears to be too little too late unless there is more detail,\" Mr Burgess said. \"Forgacs has a proud history in naval ship construction on both the AWD and Anzac frigate projects and would like to continue to be part of that.\"\nBAE Systems has said its shipyard could close unless immediate new projects are found, threatening a further 700 to 800 jobs.\nMr Abbott said Adelaide was the centre of Australia's naval shipbuilding infrastructure. It is home to government-owned ASCM which is a prime contractor in the troubled air warfare destroyer project.\nBut he hinted work could be spread across Australian shipyards. \"The yard for building the major surface ships will be in Adelaide because the infrastructure is here,\" he said.\n\"Now the subordinate yard may be in South Australia. It may be somewhere else. It may be at Williamstown [in Melbourne] for instance.\"\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten called for both the warships and the submarines to be built in Australia and the work to be spread across struggling shipyards nationally.\nMr Abbott conceded the naval shipbuilding industry could not entirely avoid job cuts with the sector due to halve from 2000 to 1000 as work winds down on the $9 billion project to build three air warfare destroyers.\nBut he said the workforce should rebuild to at least 2500 ongoing positions by 2020.​", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:08:36.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
