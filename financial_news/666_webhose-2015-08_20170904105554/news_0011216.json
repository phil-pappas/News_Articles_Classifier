Photo: Nicholas Rider\nMonday's meltdown on global markets has driven up the chances of another cash rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia, according to market pricing.\nEconomists, however, say the markets are over-reacting.\nUS investment bank Citi on Tuesday reported a surge in bets on a third cut for the year, with interest rate swap markets now showing a 76 per cent chance of a 25 basis point reduction by the November board meeting of the RBA.\nThis compares with a 48 per cent chance when measured on Friday morning, and a 64 per cent chance of a November cut before the Australian stock market opened on Monday.\nAdvertisement A separate index prepared by Credit Suisse has the chance of a 25 basis point cut at the RBA's next board meeting, in September, at 37 per cent, up from 21 per cent before jitters began to take hold late last Friday and less than 20 per cent for most of last week.\nThe RBA has cut the cash rate rate twice this year, from 2.5 per cent to a record low 2 per cent, and now seems inclined to leave it there.\nDespite the shortening market odds of another cash rate cut this year, economists have cautioned that the hit to Australia's real economy from the drop in share values this week will be too small to warrant another reduction.\nA recovery in the Australian stock market on Tuesday morning added weight to the warning against over-reaction.\nEven UK-based Capital Economics, one of the most bearish forecasters on Australia, says Monday's stock market rout will not translate to weaker consumer demand and business investment.\n\"While we remain more concerned than most about the Australian economy, we don't think that the recent sharp falls in equity prices will filter through into much weaker investment or consumption,\" chief economist for Australia Paul Dales wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nWhile conceding that the real state of China's economy will determine Australia's outlook, he says the sharp sell-off in equities in Shanghai was also overdone.\n\"The collapse in equity prices on the Shanghai market is unlikely to translate into much weaker real activity in China and the lagged effects of earlier policy loosening by the People's Bank should shore up economic growth,\" he said.\nNomura economists Rob Subbaraman and Michael Loo also argue that the slowdown in China and the rest of Asia is nothing like the region's 1997 crisis, when capital flight undermined currencies and economic growth while driving up sovereign debt ratios\n\"The trend growth slowdown in China has no doubt hurt the rest of Asia's exports, while the collapse in commodity prices has also reduced demand from other emerging markets for Asian exports,\" they wrote on Tuesday.\n\"However, looking specifically at Asia (excluding Japan), our fundamental view is that growth is not about to collapse and financial crises are unlikely,\" they said.\nThis view as echoed by HSBC's chief China economist Qu Hongbin and greater China economist Julia Wang. They say Chinese authorities are a long way from exhausting monetary and fiscal policy measures to maintain growth rates around 7 per cent.\n\"The market is concerned about many things, but China running out of options is not one we should be worried about, in our view,\" they said.\n\"As these anticipated easing measures are delivered, the economy should be on track for a modest recovery in the second half of 2015.\n\"We maintain our full-year GDP forecast at 7.1 per cent.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/china-must-act-as-circuitbreaker-to-end-stock-market-rout-20150824-gj6ptj", "http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/global-market-meltdown-exposes-brutal-truth-20150824-gj6ukq"], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T12:04:05.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
