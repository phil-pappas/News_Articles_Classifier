NAB previously forecast a low of 71 US cents. \nIt is the first large bank to predict that the Aussie dollar will fall below 70 US cents. \nNAB said the US Federal Funds rate rising from its near zero per cent level combined with the People's Bank of China gradually moving its currency lower will push the local dollar even lower. \n\"The beginnings of what is still expected to be a long slow US interest rate tightening cycle, suggests such a further easing in the Chinese exchange rate is likely, which is likely to be something of a drag on other Asian currencies more broadly and also for the Australian dollar,\" the NAB said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Qantas Sells Syd Airport lease for $535m AAP \nQantas has sold back its lease on Sydney Airport's Terminal 3 four years early for $535 million.
