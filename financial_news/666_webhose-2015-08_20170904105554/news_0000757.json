Photo: Louise Kennerley\n\"Over our 42 year history, we have always taken matters like this seriously. We are in regular contact with stakeholders of the companies we own including the boards and management, and Transfield Services is no exception\".\nAdvertisement Fairfax Media revealed on Tuesday that HESTA, one of the country's biggest superannuation funds, had ordered investment managers to dump its Transfield stock.\nThe 3.5 per cent stake in the company was worth about $23 million.\nHESTA, First State, Christian Super in ban HESTA chief executive Debby Blakey said that human rights abuses inside the offshore detention camps exposed the company to a heightened risk of future litigation that could harm its long term share price performance.\nShe cited: \"a substantial body of evidence pointing to the negative impacts of prolonged mandatory detention of asylum seekers\" and \"evidence that there have been numerous sexual and physical assaults in the detention centres\" .\nMs Blakey said the decision taken by the $32 billion health industry fund to exit its investment in Transfield was ultimately based on financial rather than ethical considerations and came after more than a year of engaging with the company's management team and directors on the issue.\n\"Strict confidentiality clauses in Transfield's government contracts meant the company was unable to answer questions we needed answers to,\" she said.\nHowever a Victorian nurses union is among campaigners that have claimed victory for pressuring HESTA and First State Super, another top 10 industry fund with many nurse members, to sell-out of Transfield .\nOther funds that don't own Transfield shares have taken the step of black-listing them, in line with their stated environmental and social governance values.\n\"Christian Super formally excluded Transfield from its investment universe in March,\" chief executive of the small faith based fund Peter Murphy said.\nLast week, Transfield briefed analysts and investors and released a statement defending its track record and talking down the seriousness of some of the alleged abuses. Allegations against staff range in seriousness from verbal abuse, to drugging and sexual assaulting an asylum seeker.\n\"Transfield Services has a clear code of business conduct and is committed to openness and transparency in its dealings with all stakeholders. The care and wellbeing of asylum seekers in particular is paramount,\" the statement said.\nAllan Gray working behind the scenes Many professional investors argue they can be more effective in influencing a good corporate citizenship in companies they are a part owner of than they could by divesting.\nMr Mawhiney said shareholders could often play a role in driving positive change.\n\"We will continue to engage constructively,\" he said.\nAllan Gray holds an almost 19 per cent stake in Transfield Services, worth roughly $107 million.\nThe boutique $4.4 billion funds management firm is listed on the HESTA website as one of 19 Australian equity houses with a mandate to manage part of its domestic shares portfolio.\nFund management firms keep the money they manage on behalf of big institutional investors in segregated accounts. This means they have the ability to divest a particular stock for a super fund at their instruction, without having to sell out of it in the pooled funds that smaller clients invest with them through.\nMs Blakey told Farifax Media that three external fund managers had previously held Transfield shares on HESTA's behalf and that all were active in the review process.\nAnother grilling Invesco, Transfield's second largest shareholder with an 8.5 per cent stake worth roughly $48 million, is also listed as one of HESTA's Australian equity managers.\nIt is expected that Transfield will face a grilling from analysts and investors when it hands down its full-year results, for the period ended 30 June 2015, on Thursday 27 August.\nThe Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents 30 non-profit super funds managing about $400 billion, has been putting pressure on Transfield Services to justify the governance risks associated with its detention centre business for more than a year.\nIn addition to HESTA's divestment action at least six other ACSI members are currently reviewing their own holdings, including $26.2 billion construction industry fund Cbus and $10.2 billion public sector fund VicSuper.\nOther major industry funds represented on the ACSI, alongside HESTA and Cbus, are: Media Super, UniSuper, Hostplus, Local Government Super, LUCRF, State Super, and QSuper.\nOf the nine financial analysts that cover Transfield Services three rate it a \"buy\", five \"neutral\", and one \"cautious\", according to Bloomberg data.\nAnalysts estimate the detention centre contracts contribute between 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the company's total revenue, which was $1.9 billion in the last half.\nBetween being awarded the $1.2 billion government contract to run the detention centres in February 2014 and February this year the stock rocketed up 141 per cent.\nHowever it has pulled back by 45 per cent since then, having lost more than a third in value since May. At Thursday's close the shares were fetching $1.09.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/hesta-divests-transfield-citing-detention-centre-abuses-20150818-gj1krb", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/hesta-dumps-transfield-citing-detention-centre-abuses-20150818-gj218u.html"], "published": "2015-08-21T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T14:07:06.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
