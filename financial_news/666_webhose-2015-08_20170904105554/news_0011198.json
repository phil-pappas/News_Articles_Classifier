Photo: Rob Homer\nThe corporate cop needs more money that is independent of the government because it is busiest when governments are cutting back, financial system inquiry head David Murray says.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission should also be exempt from the Public Service Act so it can pay its people more, the former Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief said.\nMr Murray also reiterated his call for ASIC to have the power to stop financial products before they get people into trouble – a recommendation he said had received a lot of criticism since his final inquiry report was released in December. ASIC itself has called for this \"product intervention\" power.\n\"Government budgets go through a cycle to do with the state of the economy,\" he told a Governance Institute conference in Sydney on Wednesday.\nAdvertisement \"Normally the seeds of misbehaviour are sown when markets are strong and that's the time when the economy is in good shape. By the time the economy is in bad shape and the government is tightening the screws on the budget, ASIC is then getting ready to sort out the wreckage from the boom time,\" he said.\nHe has recommended a \"public funding\" or user-pays model, where companies who are regulated pay fees.\nDebate over form ASIC and many in the business community agree with this, but there is debate over what form it should take. ASX Ltd managing director Elmer Funke Kupper told the conference the Securities Exchange Commission in the US is funded via a fee on each transaction, but it receives too much money.\n\"Sometimes it is said the most profitable party in the US markets is the SEC, so we need a better model,\" he said, and there would need to be regular reviews of any user-pays funding for ASIC to say whether it is the right amount.\nHe doesn't agree with one suggestion that only those who are convicted by ASIC pay its fees. \"I struggle with that. Now you are getting into questions about whether you are going after someone to make money or because they have done something wrong.\"\nThe federal government has cut $171 million over four years from ASIC's funding. In July it announced a partial response to the Murray inquiry and appointed a mix of public and private sector people to conduct a \"capability review\" of ASIC, which is considering its funding and powers.\nMr Murray said ASIC should not be subject to the Public Service Act because it limited pay and the ability to attract the best people and meant the commission's employees did not work under the same conditions as the businesses it is regulating.\n\"They have got to be separated from the Public Service Act,\" he said. ASIC faced the same difficulty he did when he led the Future Fund – it couldn't pay as well as the corporate sector and people had leave entitlements out of sync with markets and the private sector.\nReliance on disclosure not working Mr Murray said relying on pages and pages of disclosure to protect consumers had not worked and \"product intervention\" powers for ASIC were necessary.\n\"There is information asymmetry between companies and individuals.\" If ASIC did have such a power, it might be able to spend less on financial literacy education, he said.\nMr Murray criticised ASIC's requests for details on companies' \"culture framework\", saying it was an onerous task to comply with this – for the company and for ASIC to sift through the information it received – and it was not clear what it achieved.\n\"Culture is important, but we risk it becoming the issue, not prosecuting the criminal conduct,\" he said.\nASIC deputy commissioner Peter Kell defended its approach. \"We're in furious agreement,\" he said. \"Culture is not some abstract concept, it is shorthand for capturing the incentives that drive an industry. It is reflected in remuneration, it is driven by the amount of resources you put into a compliance area.\n\"What do you do when someone reports a breach? What happens in terms of your processes and policies for reporting breaches? Is that set up to game the system so every breach fails the test, or do you act promptly?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:31:38.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
