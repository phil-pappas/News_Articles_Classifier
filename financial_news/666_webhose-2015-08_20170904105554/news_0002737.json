The subindex has risen 37 percent so far this year, one of the best performer in the Tokyo market.\nDrugmakers, which have also risen more than 35 percent so far this year, lost 1.5 percent. The land transport subindex, which includes railway companies and truck companies, fell 1.9 percent.\n\"This time the U.S. payroll data will be a big event to see whether the Fed will raise rates in September,\" said Masahiro Ayukai, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\"So it is natural some market players are closing their positions ahead of data,\" he added.\nDisappointment over earning results hit some other shares.\nRakuten fell 8.6 percent after its quarterly earnings fell short of strong market expectations.\nRicoh and Konica Minolta, both manufacturer of printers and other products, fell sharply following fall in net profits in the quarter to June. Ricoh fell 6.1 percent and Konica Minolta 8.4 percent.\nSumco, manufacturer of silicon wafer products, also failed to keep initial losses after its announcement of profit growth due to strong demand for products for smart phone and dividend hikes. It fell 4.5 percent, erasing earlier gains of 7.9 percent.\nThere are growing worries that sales of smart phones may be slowing globally, hitting many Japanese suppliers of components to companies such as Apple and Samsung Electronics .\nOn the other hand, Softbank rose 4.5 percent after it announced a share buyback plan and fairly upbeat earnings.
