Photo: Brendon Thorne\nThe Reserve Bank is still on hold, but its latest statement hints that the cycle of rate cuts it initiated almost four years ago might be over.\nThe cycle began in November 2011 with the central bank cutting its cash rate from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent. The most recent cut, from 2.25 per cent to 2 per cent, was announced in May.\nIn its May, June and July cash rate statements this year, the Reserve said that \"further depreciation\" of the $A seemed \"both likely and necessary, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices\".\nIt wants the $A to more closely track the descent of key commodity prices, boost the competitiveness of Australian companies and give the economy a boost. Another rate cut would push the currency down, but in its new statement the Reserve seems happier about where the $A is, and the pace of its descent.\nThe Australian dollar \"is adjusting to the significant declines in key commodity prices\", it says. The currency was just above US75¢ ahead of the Reserve's meeting in July, and was just under US73¢ on Tuesday as the Reserve met again.\nOf course the statement itself had a predictable effect. The central bank said, as it has in recent months, that its monetary policy settings were appropriate but would be determined in future by what it learns about the economy and financial conditions. Financial conditions include the $A, and traders had pushed the $A back up to about US73.8¢ by 5.30pm. The Australian sharemarket also trimmed its gains for the day – dividends look less attractive if fixed interest rates here aren't headed lower.\nIf the $A continues to rebound in response to the latest statement and commodity prices stay weak, the Reserve's concerns that the currency is not low enough would presumably be resurrected to an extent.\nThe central bank and its board are correct in arguing and believing that the currency should be lower given how far the prices of key export commodities including iron ore and coal have fallen, however. Economists also expect further $A weakness, to align the currency more closely with the commodity price slump, and after US interest rates start rising as they almost certainly will before the end of this year, to reflect a smaller interest rate premium for the $A over the US dollar.\nThere was a second hint in the new statement that the Reserve's thinking about rate cuts is changing.\nIt has been assumed that the Australian economy's trend growth rate – that is, the growth rate that keeps employment and inflation stable – is 3 per cent a year, or a touch above that.\nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens noted in a speech on July 22 however that while economic growth of 2.2 per cent in the year to March was below what is considered to be trend growth, jobs growth had actually picked up, hours worked had increased, and the unemployment rate was the same as it was a year ago.\nThere were several possible explanations, Stevens said, and one of them was that \"trend output growth is lower than the 3 per cent or 3&frac14; per cent we have assumed for many years – perhaps the growth we have seen is in fact closer to trend growth than we thought\".\nIf trend growth is lower the Reserve has less need to cut rates to give additional impetus to the economy. It might in fact be pushing too hard on inflation if it does cut – and the question at least is raised gently in the latest statement. The economy's rate of growth \"has been somewhat below longer-term averages\", the Reserve says, but \"has been associated with somewhat stronger growth of employment and a steady rate of unemployment over the past year\".\nThe statement does not go on as Stevens did in his speech last month to raise the possibility that the answer might be that trend growth is lower. The statement is evidence however that the issue Stevens alerted the markets to in his speech is a live one for the Reserve's board as it considers where interest rates should be.\nThat is new information for the markets, as is the Reserve's changed language on the $A. Retail sales numbers on Tuesday showing better than expected 0.7 per cent sales growth in June and healthy 4.9 per cent growth for the year to June was also news: nobody thinks rates will rise here soon, but there was enough in it all to produce the market reaction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:51:54.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
