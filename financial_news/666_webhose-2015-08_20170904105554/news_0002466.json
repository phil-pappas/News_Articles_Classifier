Reuters Share on twitter by Karen Maley Emerging markets were dealt a fresh blow last week with China's currency devaluation adding to the problems caused by plunging commodity prices and sluggish global growth.\nThe US-denominated MSCI Emerging Markets Index is now clearly in bear-market territory, having fallen about 20 per cent since its peak last September.\nFor years, investors have been flocking to emerging markets, lured by their buoyant growth rates and attractive demographics. And the trade has paid off, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index generating annual returns of just under 10 per cent during the past decade and a half.\nBut conditions have become tougher in the past year, as commodity prices have plunged in tandem with a slowing Chinese growth.\nAt the same time, expectation that the US central bank will soon raise interest rates has pushed the US dollar higher, and reduced the extent to which emerging markets can rely on lower rates to bolster growth.\nAlthough the yuan only fell 3 per cent against the US dollar last week, most commentators believe that we've seen only the first stage in a process that is likely to have the Chinese currency fall at least 10 per cent.\nThis creates problems for China's main trading partners – countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam – because it makes it more expensive for China's consumers to buy their products. Investors fear that in order to claw back their competitiveness, these countries may try to push their own currencies lower.\nAs a result, Asian currencies lost ground last week, with the South Korean won hitting its lowest level in four years. More than a quarter of South Korea's exports go to China and the country's exporters also compete with Chinese-made electronic goods in global markets.\n At the same time, investors are worried that a weaker yuan will cut China's demand for commodities such as rubber, coal, copper and oil, crimping the export earnings of countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam. The Malaysian ringgit fell 3.8 per cent last week to hit its lowest level since September 1998 during the Asian financial crisis.\nFears that the weaker yuan will push up the price Chinese buyers must pay for Indonesian exports such as coal and palm oil weighed on the Indonesian rupiah, causing it to slide to a fresh 17-year low against the US dollar.\nBut Asian currencies are not the only ones coming under pressure. The Russian rouble hit its lowest level in six months against the US dollar and the euro, as investors worried that the weaker yuan will reduce Chinese demand for oil and put yet more downward pressure on the oil price.\nThe problem for many emerging countries, however, is that they have amassed mountains of debt denominated in US dollars and euros. In Asia, for instance, debt levels are almost as high as they were just before the region's debt crisis. As a result, many countries cannot allow their currencies to fall too far because this would leave them with a crippling interest bill (expressed in their local currencies) on their foreign debts.\nThis leaves central banks in some emerging countries with no choice but to keep monetary policy fairly tight to support their currencies, even though this risks triggering a sharp slowdown in economic activity.\nThere are also fears that sharp currency falls could spark an abrupt unwind in the carry trade. Many hedge funds have generated hefty profits by loading up on US dollar or euro-denominated debt, on which they pay low interest rates, and using the proceeds to buy higher-yielding securities in emerging-market securities.\nBut this carry trade is appealing only if investors are confident they won't suffer hefty foreign-exchange losses on their investments. As soon as they start to fear heavy currency losses, foreign investors rush to dump stocks and bonds, putting upward pressure on interest rates in emerging markets.\nThe risk is that China's move last week to devalue its currency has underscored the risks of investing in emerging markets. And this could presage a new period of turbulence for these countries as they grapple to contain foreign capital outflows, at a time when their export earnings are under pressure from a weaker yuan.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-08-16T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:13:05.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
