Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey New Speaker Tony Smith has warned MPs on all sides he intends to lift the standards of Parliament.\nMr Smith, who holds the Melbourne seat of Casey, has become the 30th Speaker of the House of Representatives after winning a ballot of Liberal MPs on Monday.\nMr Smith replaces Bronwyn Bishop who resigned in Sunday last week due to her misuse of travel entitlements . He is the fifth speaker in less than four years.\nHe beat off three rivals fellow Victorian Russell Broadbent, South Australian MP Andrew Southcott and Queenslander Ross Vasta. Mr Smith won the final ballot against Mr Broadbent by 51 votes to 22.\nSpeaker Tony Smith takes the chair in the House. Andrew Meares Upon being ratified by a sitting of the House of Representatives, Mr Smith said Parliament \"should be a robust place\" but \"it needn't be rude and it needn't be loud\".\n\"I'll give a fair go to all on the floor of this CHamber but in return I do expect a level discourse that reflects that,\" he said.\nMr Smith he would not be attending regular party room meetings.\n\"The Speaker should only be, but should be seen to be, independent of the partisan day-to-day fray.\"\n Former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop enters the chamber while Tony Smith is congratulated by colleagues. Alex Ellinghausen His appointment was tense. Mrs Bishop sat at the back of the chamber, her expression unmoving.\nManager of Government Business Christopher Pyne protested her ouster, saying she had been \"felled in the most unfair circumstances\".\nBefore the 2013 election, the Coalition promised to maximise the independence of the Speaker by ensuring he or she would not attend party room meetings when Parliament sat.\nMrs Bishop, who was handpicked by Tony Abbott, refused to honour this and attended meetings. Her handling of the Parliament was also considered overtly biased.\n'Hyper partisanship' Labor leader Bill Shorten welcomed Mr Smith's decision to stay independent of the party room but also called on him to redress the overt bias Mrs Bishop displayed. IN her short period in the chair, she ejected almost 400 Labor MPs and just a handful of Coalition MPs.\n\"You can make this a place where straightforward questions get straightforward answers,\" he said.\n\"The new Speaker has an opportunity and an obligation to lift the accountability of this Parliament.\n\"We cannot afford for Parliament to repeat the hyper-partisanship we saw under Bronwyn Bishop.\"\nMr Abbott largely stayed out of choosing Mrs Bishop's replacement at the behest if his MPs who are fed up with his so-called captain's picks.\nCoalition split Mr Abbott voted for Mr Broadbent, Treasurer Joe Hockey backed Dr Southcott while Scott Morrison was behind Mr Smith. Mr Smith's victory is also a filip for Mr Morrison in terms of being able to marshal influence.\nMr Smith is the fifth Speaker since November 2011, when Harry Jenkins was forced out to make way for Peter Slipper so the Gillard government could by a precious extra number n the hung Parliament.\nAfter Mr Slipper's fall from grace concerning allegations over his use of parliamentary expenses and sexual harassment claims, which were later dismissed, Labor's Anna Burke filled the chair. Mrs Bishop took over after the Coalition won the election in September 2013.\nRead next Laura Tingle previews the week ahead", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-10T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:05:47.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
