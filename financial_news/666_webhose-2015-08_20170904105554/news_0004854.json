Will that transfer the bug?\" the company replied: \"Re: little ones, try to not put water in mouths\". \nIn some areas it was reported that supermarket shelves had been stripped of bottled water by concerned customers. \nLeona Worth of Fulwood, Preston, told the Lancashire Evening Post: \"I am very concerned I have two young children. I have only just heard about it on the news. I am panicking because I have been drinking water all day. \n\"I've never heard of this before. I'm a concerned parent.\" \nCarly Whittam, from Woodplumpton, said: \"I have been off sick with a virus. I have been in bed all week. I'm concerned that this the water is what has caused it because I’ve been feeling worse again today. \n\"We won’t be letting the kids drink water.\" \nMartin Padley, the chief scientific officer for United Utilities, thanks customers for their \"immense patience\". \nWe apologise for the inconvenience but the health of our customers is absolutely paramount.\" \nAccording to United Utilities, cryptosporidium causes a gastrointestinal illness called cryptosporidiosis. \nThe illness lasts from a week to three weeks in healthy individuals, but \"can be prolonged and life threatening in severely immunocompromised individuals\", the company said. \nResidents in the North West can find out if their supply is affected on the United Utilities website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T15:17:51.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
