The council provides a platform for stakeholders to review progress achieved in the implementation of the Human Resource Development Strategy for South Africa 2010-2030. In terms of the country's economic development, a major priority of the HRDC has been to address the production of professionals required in key sectors. \nIn this regard, the council has been looking at the issue extensively. Earlier this year, the council participated in the Cell C's 'Take a Girl child to work' initiative as part of its corporate social investment. Addressing the media on the side lines of the meeting, Pick n Pay Chairman Gareth Ackerman echoed Ramaphosa's sentiments emphasising the need for people to be skilled. \n\"Government needs to work with business to create jobs,\" he said. Ackerman said business must invest money in creating jobs. Also speaking was W&RSETA CEO Joel Dikgole who said there is a need for more skills in the country. \"As Seta we believe that our role is to get those unemployed young people working. We are repositioning the wholesale industry to become an employer of choice,\" he said. \nDikgole called on other partners to get involve in the skilling and creation of jobs. Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande said his department was looking at strengthening the universities to produce relevant skills. \"Our economy is not growing as we would like it to grow, we need more skills,\" he said.
