Barclays’ dark pool was full of predators there at Barclays’ invitation.” \nMr Schneiderman alleged that Barclays removed from a marketing document intended for institutional investors the dark pool’s then-largest participant a high frequency trading firm Barclays knew engaged in predatory behaviour in the dark pool. \nThe investigation into Barclays was \"aided significantly\" by \"a number of former Barclays’ employees, who observed much of the conduct described in the complaint\", the Attorney General claimed. \nOfficials quoted one Barclays employee as saying: “I had always liked the idea that we were being transparent, but happy to take liberties if we can all agree.” \nAnother allegedly said: \"If we can help ourselves we should; it's in our control.\" \nEarlier this month, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Barclays was in talks with the New York State Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle the allegations. \nBarclays declined to comment on possible settlement talks. \nThe tactics of high frequency traders were the subject of author Michael Lewis's book, Flash Boys, in which he reveals how they use ultra-fast computers that allow them to see other buyers’ orders before they are executed. At the most basic level, they use this time advantage to buy the stock before the first deal has been processed and sell it on to the original purchaser at a slightly higher price, a process known as “front-running\". \nCritics have attacked dark pools for making stock markets less transparent, with nearly 40pc of stock trades now taking place away from traditional exchanges, up from a little over 15pc seven years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:48:39.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
