Penney and Nordstrom both rose 4.5 percent after the department store chains posted better-than-expected quarterly results.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,609 to 1,317. On the Nasdaq, 1,343 issues fell and 1,323 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 90 new lows.
