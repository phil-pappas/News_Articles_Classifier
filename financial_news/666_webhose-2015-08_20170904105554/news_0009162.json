Share on twitter by Tony Walker Whatever else might be said about Bronwyn Bishop she is not Betty Boothroyd, nor could she be compared with John Bercow, the present Speaker at Westminister, from whence comes our parliamentary traditions and practice.\nBaroness Boothroyd, a former dancer in a chorus line, served as an immensely popular Speaker of the House of Commons from 1992 to 2000, after which she was awarded a peerage.\nOf her election as Speaker, then Conservative prime minister John Major said: \"You have become our Speaker-elect because this House trusts you. It believes you enjoy in abundance the qualities necessary to protect and sustain the House and to safeguard its rights.\"\nIn the case of the present incumbent John Bercow, Speaker since 2009, members of the House of Commons might not share the same affection for him as they did for Boothroyd, but he retains cross-party support and was re-elected after the 2015 election.\nIn the Bagehot column in The Economist in 2012, the writer noted that Bercow inhabited his role with \"conspicuous modesty, ditching court dress, queuing for taxis and lunching on sandwiches\".\nIn the Westminster tradition that extends to Australia's sister parliaments of New Zealand and Canada it would be hard to contemplate a greater contrast than that which exists between the incumbents of those offices and Bronwyn Bishop – or circumstances in which a Speaker is held in lower esteem, both by her colleagues and by the public.\nInexcusable profligacy Rather than \"queuing for taxis\" or \"eating sandwiches\" Bishop has summoned helicopters and demanded five-star accommodation in which a distant relative to the humble sandwich might have been petit fours served on a silver salver.\n But beyond Bishop's inexcusable profligacy, her contempt for her obligations to the public purse – unpublished stories of her indulgences abound – the fact is, she has proved herself to be a very poor Speaker, and arguably the most biased among all her predecessors from Sir Frederick William Holder on.\nShe has squandered the confidence of many on both sides, judging by the failure of prominent Conservative frontbenchers to come to her defence over the abuse of her parliamentary entitlements.\nIn the more than 100 years since Federation, there have been good Speakers and indifferent Speakers, and Speakers who have lost confidence of the House, such as Labor's Jim Cope, but it is hard to locate an example where a Speaker has behaved in such a partisan manner.\nAt last count she had exercised her right under the standing orders to kick Labor representatives out of the chamber on 393 separate occasions versus seven non-Labor. Under Bishop's reign the tumbrils are always at the ready.\nWhat is to be done to restore confidence in the Speaker's role enshrined in Section of 35 of the Constitution? The most expedient would be for Bishop to stand aside to enable the elevation of her deputy, Bruce Scott – the respected Nationals member for Maranoa in Queensland.\nConsider UK-style independence, nominations Thought might also be given to bolstering the independence of the Speaker to mirror the practice in Westminister where convention has it that occupants of the office are regarded as independent and are not opposed at election, although on occasions this convention is honoured in the breach.\nWe might also consider another Westminster practice, which is to require that candidates for Speaker be nominated by at least 12 members of parliament, three of whom would be from a different party. Under this formula Bishop would never have become Speaker.\nIn preparation of this column I asked two respected former Speakers, Liberal David Hawker and Labor's Anna Burke what remedies they might suggest; bearing in mind that Burke took over in difficult circumstances following the tawdry Peter Slipper affair, in which an entitlements scandal felled Julia Gillard's \"captain's pick\" designed to bolster Labor's numbers in a knife-edge parliament.\nNeither believes a British model would work in Australia, where parliamentary majorities are thin and the requirements of Senate voting mean a party could hardly afford not to contest a lower house seat.\nHowever, Hawker's and Burke's own examples are worth noting. Both worked hard to avoid the appearance of partisanship. The former attended party room meetings, but excused himself when legislation was being discussed. The latter did not attend Caucus meetings.\nBishop, on the other hand, continues to behave like the high-handed political warrior she is, hardly leavened by very belated statements of contrition over her entitlements abuse. Australians should yearn for a Betty Boothroyd in order to restore a modicum of respect for a tarnished institution.\nTony Walker is The Australian Financial Review 's international editor.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/tonywalker1"], "published": "2015-07-31T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:04:59.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
