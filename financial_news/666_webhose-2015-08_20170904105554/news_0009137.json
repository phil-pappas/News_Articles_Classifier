Its app allows smartphone users to connect with drivers and bypass traditional taxi services. \nDespite its spectacular growth, Uber has faced troubles in many countries. The company decided to suspend its low-cost service in France after a nationwide taxi strike in protest against Uber turned violent. \nUber confirmed this week it plans to invest $1 billion for expansion in India, as it seeks to overcome problems after rape allegations against one of its drivers in that country. \nBritain's largest trade unions said this week it would take legal action against Uber over pay and conditions for drivers. \nIt claims the app is in breach of a legal duty to provide drivers \"basic rights on pay, holidays, health and safety and on discipline and grievances.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:13:12.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
