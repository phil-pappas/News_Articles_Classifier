However, in August last year British Gas representatives broke into my home while I was at work – thinking they were at a different address – and replaced my electricity meter with a pre-payment one. I returned home in the evening to find internal doors open and furniture moved – I thought I had been burgled.\nApparently, British Gas did this because of the debt incurred by the other household. But the company was very slow to put this right. Initially, it wouldn’t believe me, has since been slow to communicate and rude in response and has offered no reassurance that this won’t happen again. It has not offered any compensation beyond the standard £35 a missed visit would trigger.\nI complained to the energy ombudsman who responded in December to say it could not help as I am not a British Gas customer. I find this unbelievable. Can you help? HW, Middlesbrough, Teesside\nThis is one of the worst cases we have seen this year. The fact that British Gas would break in to the wrong house and then fail to move heaven and earth to put it right afterwards is shocking. And this is not the first instance of this happening to Money readers. It is nothing short of disgraceful that you were left hanging on for nearly a year. We got in touch with British Gas and a spokesperson said your address was confused with a similar local address.\n“This is an exceptionally rare incident and the meter was replaced again very quickly. We completely understand HW’s frustration and we have apologised for this mistake and provided a gesture of goodwill.” British Gas has also upped its offer to £300.\nThis, in our view, is a derisory offer of compensation. In your shoes we would have brought an action against the company, but you have decided to accept this and move on.\nWe welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
