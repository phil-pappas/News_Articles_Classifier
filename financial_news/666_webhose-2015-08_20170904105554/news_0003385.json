There’s a 68 percent chance the Fed will raise its benchmark at or before its December meeting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n“We remain bearish on front-end Treasuries,” JPMorgan analysts including Jay Barry, Bruce Sun and Phoebe White in New York wrote in the report dated July 31. “Fed tightening will pressure short-term rates higher during 2015.”\nTreasuries were little changed Tuesday, with the two-year note trading at a price of 99 29/32 as of 10:20 a.m. in Tokyo, based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Benchmark 10-year notes yielded 2.15 percent.\nThe probability that the Fed will boost its benchmark by its September meeting is 38 percent, based on the assumption that the effective federal funds rate will average 0.375 percent following the increase, the data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nBecause of their short maturity, two-year notes are among the most sensitive to what the Fed does with its benchmark, the target for overnight lending between banks. The current target range is zero to 0.25 percent.\nAn investor who bought two-year securities Tuesday would lose about 0.6 percent if the JPMorgan forecast is accurate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T04:44:09.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
