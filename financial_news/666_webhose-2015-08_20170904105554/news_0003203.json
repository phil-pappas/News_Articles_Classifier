Paes had been bestowed the honour way back in 1996 after his bronze medal in the Atlanta Olympics.\nThe 28-year-old, who has won three mixed doubles Grand Slams in her career, beat competition from squash player Deepika Pallikal, discus thrower Vikas Gowda, track and field star Tintu Luka, rising shuttler P V Sindhu, and hockey captain Sardar Singh for the coveted honour.\nSania's name was recommended by a Sports Ministry-constituted awards committee headed by Justice V K Bali, the retired Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court.\nThe committee included eminent athletes such as Dola Banerjee, M M Somayya and Bhogeshwar Baruah and sports journalists apart from top officials of the Sports Ministry.\nIt is learnt that the committee recommended 17 names for the Arjuna awards, including those of Jitu, Rohit, gymnast Dipa Karmakar, hockey player P R Sreejesh, wrestling duo of Bajrang and Babita, athlete M R Poovamma, shuttler K Srikanth and boxer Mandeep Jangra.\nThe recommendations will now be sent to the Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who will take a final decision. Only after the Sports Minister signs the file, the names would be made public. The awards are to be given away by the President Pranab Mukherjee on August 29, the National Sports Day.\nSania won her career's first ever women's doubles Grand Slam title with Martina Hingis in July.

In 2006, she was bestowed the Padma Shri -- the country's fourth highest civillian honour.\nSania's mixed doubles trophies had come in the Australian Open (2009), French Open (2012) and US Open (2014).\nRohit has been India's batting mainstay in the ODIs and became the highest individual scorer with a knock of 264 against Sri Lanka last year.\nJitu, on the other hand, has been in splendid form, winning seven international medals in the last one year besides an Olympic quota berth.\nSreejesh was recommended for his outstanding show as India's goalkeeper. He was part of the team that won the Asian Games gold medal last year, which also fetched the side a direct qualification for next year's Olympics.\nDipa has been rewarded for becoming the first Indian woman gymnast to win a medal at the Commonwealth Games, while boxer Mandeep has been recommended for his silver medals in the Asian Championships and the Commonwealth Games.\nSrikanth has been one of India's top performers on the badminton court, winning three titles this year.\nThe list of sportspersons recommended for Arjuna awards: P R Sreejesh (hockey), Dipa Karmakar (gymnastics), Jitu Rai (shooting), Sandeep Kumar (archery), Mandeep Jangra (boxing), Babita (wrestling), Bajrang (wrestling), Rohit Sharma (cricket), K Srikanth (badminton), Swarn Singh Virk (rowing), Satish Sivalingam (weightlifting), Santhoi Devi (wushu), Sharath Gaekwad (para-sailing), M R Poovamma (athletics), Manjeet Chhillar (kabaddi), Abhilasha Mhatre (kabaddi), Anup Kumar Yama (rollerskating).\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >>> @TOISportsNews http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Sania Mirza,Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna,Martina Hingis,Leander Paes,Deepika Pallikal ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-08-11T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:28:00.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
