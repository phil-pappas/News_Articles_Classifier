Photo: Virginia Star\nMillion-dollar super targets labelled scare campaign One of the great things about Australia's compulsory superannuation is that it is founded on the belief that all Australians deserve a dignified retirement.\nEven after most Australians have received 12 per cent super for their working life, $1 million nest eggs won't be norm.\nYet when it comes to debating the big issues around superannuation – the objectives of the system, the tax rules or indeed, what makes for a dignified retirement - all too often the debate centres on the expectations of high-income earners as opposed to what is relevant for most working Australians.\nCurrently, the average super payout at retirement is about $160,000. Photo: Sam Bennett\nIncreasingly, the public commentary around superannuation is telling us that you need at least $1 million to retire in comfort . Some financial \"professionals\" – many with vested interests – go even further and claim $2 million is a more realistic figure.\nThere are several problems with this messaging, aside from the obvious one that it is probably making a great deal of Australians – older ones, in particular – feel despondent about their future.\nCurrently, the average super payout at retirement is about $160,000. However, even averages can be misleading, due to a relatively small amount of people having very large super nest eggs. A more typical retirement payout is around $100,000.\nTom Garcia is the CEO of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST).

Yes, our savings pool has grown to nearly $2 trillion, but a lot of this money belongs to very-high-income earners, with these savings having entered the pool as \"voluntary\" rather than \"compulsory\" Super Guarantee contributions over the past few decades.\nEven after most Australians have received 12 per cent super for their working life, $1 million nest eggs won't be norm – a typical super payout will more likely be about $500,000 in today's dollars.\nMany published calculations of the amount of income available from a $1 million lump sum either completely ignore the role of the Age Pension or are based on preserving capital, which – as the government recently pointed out – is not how super was designed. Super wasn't set up to fund tax-free accumulation of inheritance for the kids.\nTalk of the $1 million nest egg as a retirement benchmark also places undue emphasis on the size of superannuation balances when, really, we need to be talking about income. And in the case of most Australians approaching retirement now and for the foreseeable future, this income will be made up of two components: super and the Age Pension.\nImportantly, this doesn't mean that super isn't doing the job it set out to do or that the vast majority of older Australians need give up any hope of achieving a decent standard of living in retirement.\nThe impact of 12 per cent super over the next three or four decades will be profound – and even more so if the current timetable for 12 per cent by 2025 is brought forward as many, including the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST), would like to see happen. There will be more self-funded retirees but the biggest impact will be the drop in the proportion of retirees receiving the full Age Pension and a corresponding rise in those receiving a part-pension. This will significantly reduce the budgetary pressure on funding the Age Pension.\nWhile everyone's idea of comfort is different and there is no doubt that the more super you can save the greater the retirement income you can generate, even modest super balances make a significant difference.\nFor example, the typical retirement income for an individual retiring with a super balance of $150,000 works out at around $590 per week (tax-free) when combined with Age Pension entitlements. This equates to more than two-thirds of the take-home pay for a median wage earner and an income that is nearly 40 per cent higher than the Age Pension alone.\nAIST has conducted various interviews over the years among different groups of retirees to find out more about what retirement is really like. A consistent theme among part-pensioners is that even relatively small amounts of super have had a significant and positive impact on their financial security and general well-being.\nAs we discuss the challenges of ensuring that our super system is both equitable and sustainable in the long term and whether or not more changes are needed, we can do without the feverish scaremongering that $1 million of super isn't enough and that the Age Pension can't be relied upon.\nThis not only makes many people miserable, it also undermines confidence in the super system. Concern about not having enough super to retire with could also encourage those approaching retirement to take on unnecessary risk or see them vulnerable to the next get-rich-quick financial scam.\nThe super story is a positive one but it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Australians deserve a better understanding of how super works jointly with the Age Pension to provide a tax-free retirement income. Defining the purpose of super, one of the key recommendations to Government from the Financial Systems Inquiry, would certainly help promote more relevant messaging.\nTom Garcia is the CEO of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST), which is the peak body for the not-for-profit superannuation sector, where more than half of working Australians have their super invested.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/milliondollar-super-targets-labelled-scare-campaign-20150731-gip1d4.html"], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:34:21.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
