More Farnes mark 90 years in National Trust \nOnce the government has purchased the land, architects, developers, councils, housing associations and small builders will compete to acquire individual sites, and proceeds from these sales will be diverted back to the Exchequer. The homes built on the new sites will be offered to young first-time buyers at a 20 per cent discount, under the government’s Help to Buy scheme. \nExplaining the deal, Mr Clark said the fund would help ensure a “wide range of new properties” were available to those ready to start out on the housing ladder. \n“We are also helping bring back into use more brownfield land for development, keeping the country building and delivering the homes our communities need,” he added. \nMinisters signalled that housebuilding would be one of their priorities in office by setting out ambitious targets in the Queen’s Speech , including the 200,000 new homes pledge. A new Housing Bill will offer 1.3m housing association tenants big discounts to buy their homes, with receipts channelled towards building more affordable housing for other aspiring homeowners. \nIn addition, the government is bringing forward proposals to ensure that every “reasonably-sized” housing site includes a proportion of starter homes, and will look into exempting developers from certain levies if they are building first-time properties. \nChancellor George Osborne’s summer Budget included the introduction of automatic planning permission on designated brownfield sites to speed developments on empty plots. He also took aim at “Nimby” councils by introducing a new law which would allow ministers to impose a housing plan on a local authority if it had failed to produce one, as well as penalties on councils that failed to process planning applications quickly. \nResponding to Monday’s announcement, Andy Rose, chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, said his organisation was ready to support the government in delivering more high-quality starter homes. \n“We look forward to working with our key delivery partners including councils, developers, housing associations, small builders and architects in taking this forward, through the identification and purchase of land suitable for exemplar Starter Home sites,” he said.
