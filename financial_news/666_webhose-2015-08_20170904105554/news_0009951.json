Eddie Jim by Lucille Two of Victoria's safest Liberal seats will now be up for grabs after former Victorian premier Denis Napthine and former roads minister Terry Mulder announced their resignations.\nThe pair were instrumental in proceeding with the $6 billion East West Link toll road, which cost the Coalition the election in November 2014.\nUpon announcing his intention to resign, Dr Napthine urged Premier Daniel Andrews to build the road, labelling the new government's proposals, the west gate distributor and western distributor proposals, as \"dogs\".\nAfter 27 years in parliament, Dr Napthine said committing Victoria to the the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which has headquarters in Geelong, was one of his proudest achievements.\nDenis Napthine announced his retirement on Monday after 27 years in parliament. Robert Prezioso Dr Napthine became premier in early 2013 after the resignation of Ted Baillieu but moved to the back bench after leading the coalition to defeat in the November 2014 election.\nIt was his second time as leader of the Liberal Party, the first was when he replaced Jeff Kennett after the shock 1999 election defeat.\n\"I don't have any regrets as my time as premier, I came in to be premier about 18 months out from an election, in challenging circumstances,\" Dr Napthine said.\n\"There is a fair bit in life, and in politics you can say 'woulda, shoulda, coulda' but you deal with the cards you are dealt with. It was a unique opportunity to become premier in those circumstances, at that time. And what you do is you grab it with both hands and run with it.\"\n The then premier cooking burgers for McHappy Day. Cassie Cowling Both Dr Napthine and Mr Mulder's seats, in the regional Victoria's south-west are held by the Liberal Party with margins of more than 11 per cent.\nMr Mulder said after 16-years in parliament, he looked back with pride.\nVictorian Liberal Leader Matthew Guy described Dr Napthine as a friend, a colleague and an inspirational politician. \"We share a birthday, a friendship and a strong belief in the Liberal Party as the best party to govern this great state,\" Mr Guy said.\nThe Liberal Party is due to pre-select a new candidate on September 20 in Dr Napthine's electorate, with a byelection expected to follow soon after.\nAt the Warrnambool Airport upgrade.
