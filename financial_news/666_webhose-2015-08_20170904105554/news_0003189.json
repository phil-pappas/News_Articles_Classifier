Andrew Meares Share on twitter by James Eyers The federal government is resisting desperate calls for it to move faster on allowing new investment vehicles to be created that would let investment managers capitalise on the liberalisation of funds management trade in Asia .\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen said the creation of new structures that can be sold to Asian investors should be taken out of the tax white paper process and \"progressed more quickly\".\nThe creation of \"collective investment vehicles\" (CIVs) was a key recommendation of the 2009 report by corporate adviser Mark Johnson on how Australia might become a successful financial centre .\nThe industry says creating CIVs has added importance given the establishment next year of the Asian Region Funds Passport , a trade regime that will allow investment managers to sell funds directly to retail investors in participating countries, and recent free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea.\n\"The white paper progress is going nowhere in a hurry but sensible measures like alternative collective investment vehicles can and should be progressed in a bipartisan fashion, as soon as possible,\" Mr Bowen told the Financial Services Council conference on the Gold Coast. \"They are, for example, crucial to the ability of Australian fund managers to take advantage of the Asian funds management passport once it is up and running.\"\nIn a speech to the FSC conference on Friday morning, Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will say \"the government is considering the design features of a possible new range to tax flow-through CIVs that could be offered by Australian fund managers\". But the reforms remain part of the tax white paper process, which will run into next year.\nDelays introducing CIVs comes amid growing frustration from participants at the FSC conference about the time corporate and tax law reform takes in Australia, especially compared to jurisdictions like Singapore, which Australia is competing against to manage the swelling pools of Asian capital.\n\"They are nimbler and are ahead of us,\" said Andrew Cannane, general manager of corporate client services at Perpetual. \"The region is continuously competitive and will continue to be so. Singapore moves so much more quickly and their philosophy is one of continous improvement.\"\n Under current laws, fund managers can only create investment funds as unit trusts. But these are not well understood by Asian investors, limiting the amount of foreign funds managed in Australia. Deloitte said last year that if the foreign funds under management in Australia doubled, this would boost Australian GDP by $330 million.\nFSC chairman and CEO of Schroder Investment Management Greg Cooper said Australia needs a \"set of modern, flexible vehicles that resonate with international investors. We need these vehicles now, otherwise our ability to capitalise on the free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea will be hampered.\"\nMr Bowen applauded the government on progressing other recommendations of the Johnson report, including legislating the investment manager regime, which creates tax certainty for foreign investors, and progressing participation in the passport.\nMr Frydenberg will say the government wants the passport to become the de-facto regional standard, which will require broad participation by countries in the region, including Japan , which is not currently a member. Japan's \"inclusion would be a huge step towards a truly regional framework, and one that Australia would wholeheartedly support,\" Mr Frydenberg will say. He also wants to expand its membership further, including to states such as India.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/eyersj"], "published": "2015-08-06T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:09:25.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
