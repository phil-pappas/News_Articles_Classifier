The judge has not yet issued a ruling.\nIf the aquarium, which already has three belugas, succeeds in bringing the whales to the United States, some would remain in Atlanta on display and the others would go to marine facilities across the country including SeaWorld parks and other aquariums, the permit application said.\nSeaWorld has come under scrutiny for its killer whale shows.\nScott Higley, a spokesperson for Georgia Aquarium said \"the decision will be based on what is best for the collective beluga population in accredited facilities in North America. They will only go to accredited facilities that already care for belugas.\"\nTwo baby beluga whales born at the aquarium have died since 2012, although their deaths have not been raised as an issue in the case.\nIf the permit is denied, the whales' fate would remain in the hands of Russia. No final court decision is expected for several months.
