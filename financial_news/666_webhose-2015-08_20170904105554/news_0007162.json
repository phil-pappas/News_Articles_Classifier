Cognizant follows January-December as its fiscal year.\n“Our second quarter sequential revenue increase in dollar terms was the strongest in our history. These results validate that our business strategy and our investments position us well to capture the emerging opportunities as clients look to transform into digital businesses,” Cognizant CEO Francisco D’Souza said.\nFor the quarter, Cognizant had said earlier it expects revenues to be “at least USD 3.01 billion”.\nCognizant has raised its revenue guidance for 2015 to USD 12.33 billion, up at least 20.1 per cent compared to 2014 (from USD 12.24 billion or 19.3 per cent growth).\nFor the July-September quarter, Cognizant expects its revenue to be at least USD 3.14 billion.\n“Our strong performance has allowed us to raise our full year revenue and EPS guidance for the second time this year, despite the impact to our full year revenues from the announcement that Health Net would be acquired by Centene Corporation,” Cognizant CFO Karen McLoughlin said.\nLast month, Cognizant had anticipated a USD 100 million hit to its incremental revenue in July-December of 2015 stating that it expected its USD 2.7 billion contract with Health Net may not be implemented if the latter is acquired by Centene Corporation.\n“We continue to optimise our existing services and aggressively invest in new services to enable clients to drive higher levels of operational efficiency.Â These new solutions, being developed and deployed across all of our major business units, are fundamentally changing business models,” Cognizant President Gordon Coburn said.\nWith over 100 development and delivery centres worldwide, Cognizant has about 218,000 employees as of June 30, 2015.\n 05, 2015 4:46 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:20:17.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
