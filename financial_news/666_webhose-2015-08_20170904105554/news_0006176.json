Photo: Sasha Wooley\nBanks and other lenders have been falling short of meeting their responsible lending obligations in the booming market for interest-only home loans, the corporate watchdog has found in a critical report, putting pressure on lenders to change their practices.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission on Thursday released a review that revealed a range of flaws in how 11 lenders, including the big four banks, were assessing customers for interest-only mortgages.\nA review of 140 customer files across the lending institutions found that in 40 per cent of cases, lenders wrongly calculated how much time borrowers had to repay the principal when the interest-only period of the loan ended, assuming they had more time than was actually the case.\nIn more than 30 per cent of files, there was no evidence the banks had properly considered whether an interest-only loan was appropriate for the borrower in question.\nAdvertisement And in more than a fifth of cases, the lender had not properly assessed the borrower's living expenses, ASIC said.\nOther flaws included inconsistent assessments of irregular income from borrowers, and a failure to properly assess how borrowers' already existing debts, as well as new debts, would be affected if interest rates rose.\nThe report said ASIC was \"disappointed\" that the practices of \"many lenders\" fell short of its expectations and were at risk of breaching responsible lending laws.\n\"In the current environment of low interest rates and strong demand for housing, it is important that credit licensees make robust assessments of the capacity of consumers to make the required repayments, with appropriate buffers in place to account for higher interest rates in the future,\" the report says.\nAll of the 11 lenders had changed or promised to change their practices following the release of ASIC's recommendations for responsible lending, the watchdog said. It has launched further investigations with some lenders and is considering enforcement action, it said\nThe review was launched as part of financial regulators' heightened scrutiny of the mortgage market amid concerns some banks have let their lending standards slip when interest rates are at record lows.\nDemand for interest-only home loans has jumped by 80 per cent since 2012, accounting for a near-record 42 per cent of all home loan approvals in the March quarter.\nWhile they are most popular with investors, who can claim a tax break on interest payments, the report said there had also been strong growth in interest-only lending to people paying off a loan on the house they live in. Owner occupiers accounted for 41 per cent of interest-only loan approvals in December last year.\nASIC deputy chair Peter Kell urged banks to lend responsibly, in a way that ensured consumers could afford the debt if interest rates rose. Interest-only loans revert to being principal and interest loans after a period of up to 15 years, making it important borrowers can afford principal and interest repayments.\n\"Interest-only loans may be a reasonable option for some borrowers. However, lenders must have robust processes in place for assessing a customer's ability to afford a loan, taking into account the increased repayments once the interest-only period ends,\" he said in a statement.\nVarious banks have been tightening their lending policies in this area, with Westpac taking action last week.", "external_links": ["http://download.asic.gov.au/media/3329474/rep445-published-20-august-2015.pdf"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:43:19.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
