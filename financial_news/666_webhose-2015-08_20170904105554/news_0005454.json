Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup US TV and movie streaming giant Netflix has claimed its first casualty in Australia, with digital movie and TV show store EzyFlix pulling down its virtual shutters.\nEzyFlix posted a message on its website on Tuesday telling users Access Digital Entertainment, its parent company, had decided to close the website.\nNo reason was given for the closure but Australian services like EzyFlix and ASX-listed Quickflix have been under increased pressure since the introduction of Netflix to the Australian market in March. The number of rivals for TV streaming eyeballs has swelled in recent times, with the emergence of Foxtel's Presto service and Fairfax Media and Nine Entertainment-owned Stan.\nRoy Morgan Research estimated recently that Netflix reached 737,000 Australian household subscribers in July, reaching about 1.89 million people. This made it by far the most popular digital streaming platform in Australia, with total household subscriptions to other similar services reaching only 177,000.\nWhile EzyFlix struggled Netflix's Australian user numbers continue to climb. Reuters EzyFlix said on its website that movies rented or bought on the site would no longer be available.\n\"If you have purchased or redeemed an UltraViolet title through EzyFlix these may be accessed through several other digital movie services,\" it said.\nThe Australian Financial Review contacted EzyFlix for comment but did not get a reply before publication.\nDifferentiation in a crowded market In June 2014 EzyFlix founder Craig White told Gizmodo it was differentiated from Netflix because it was not a subscription model and it allowed users to buy and rent new-release movies.\n\"EzyFlix.tv is not a subscription video-on-demand service and has no monthly fees or lock-in contracts. We allow customers to buy the films and TV shows they love from $2.99, or casually rent new-release movies for $5.99 without any monthly obligations or subscription,\" he said.\nIn July digital consultancy Telsyte reported that there were more than two million active subscription video on demand services (SVoD) customers in Australia at the end of June.\nThe Telsyte Australian SVoD/OTT Video Market Study found that Netflix, Stan, Presto and Quickflix were the four market leaders, representing 90 per cent of all paid subscriptions.\nBut Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said it was unlikely the SVoD market would be a \"winner-takes-all\" marketplace .\n\"Our research has shown that consumers are quite likely to have multiple SVoD subscriptions. They will have them for different content types depending on the content rights' structures that are in place,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "http://ezyflix.tv/index.html", "http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2014/06/ezyflix-talks-the-future-of-streaming-movies-in-australia/", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-08-18T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:11:53.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
