Assuming many of these mobile users are Gen Y, he suggested banks help educate them on finances.\nBut then walking in from my mailbox the other day, I noticed I had three credit card offers; we probably get at least one a week. Are these the banks that are going to help customers save, or are the banks going to try to saddle customers with debt?\nGary Silverman, am FT columnist, wrote recently about how the CFPB was cracking down on banks for charging credit card customers for services, like identity-theft protection, that they never wanted. The amounts of the refunds and the size of the fines would have been staggering two years ago, but after money laundering violations and LIBOR, they seem merely impressive. CIti paid out $700 million to customers and $70 million in fines. Totals for other banks included $389 million at JPMorgan Chase, $214 at Discover, $210 at Capital One and $57 million at US Bancorp.\n“Call me a cockeyed optimist, but I’d bet that our banks would do better in the long run if they tried to serve the people in their communities rather than to steal from them,” Silverman concluded.\nI just might call him a cockeyed optimist. Banks have been doing this for too long and it’s become part of their way of doing business, like stacking up bounced checks starting with the largest first so they can collect charges for a host of smaller checks that then bounce.\nIn the UK, mortgage payment protection insurance that was mis-sold by banks cost them more than $18 billion. Billion with a B. (I had some risk vendor explain that their software could have detected the mis-selling and saved the banks fines and refunds, as if a multi-billion operation in those banks was somehow overlooked by the bankers.)\nThe effort to help, rather than fleece, customers is what sets Simple and Moven apart. With technology and a debit card, they help users track spending and encourage them to save when they have a little extra at the end of the month. Simple was acquired by BBVA Compass and Moven has licensed its system to TD in Canada, to Westpac NZ in New Zealand and is working with Accenture to take it global.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a4b5883e-316c-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html#axzz3h88EYwdq"], "published": "2015-08-05T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:31:24.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
