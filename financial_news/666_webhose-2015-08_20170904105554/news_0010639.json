At one federal office with seven desks for each worker, the answer is probably not.\nThe Australian Taxation Office is continuing its culling program targeting empty space with the doors on a Darwin office it opened in the Howard era looking like they are about to close.\nThe ATO's office at 24 Mitchell Street in the Northern Territory's capital city has been withering on the vine for years.\nAdvertisement It now has seven staff and 52 work stations. Of course, 45 of these desks empty. The federal government's contracts website Austender records the cost of renting the office space at $694,000 a year, or $99,000 per employee.\nThe remaining handful of workers at the office now face the prospect of voluntary redundancy, if the ATO makes a final decision to shut the doors.\nIt comes as the Tax Office makes the biggest proportional cutbacks to its workforce compared to any other employer in the Commonwealth public service.\nThe ATO was in the process of completing its 4700-person reduction across its ranks.\nThe Australian Services Union's Jeff Lapidos said the Mitchell Street office closure was \"another disgraceful example of poor administration of the ATO and a failure to address the needs of a capital city\".\nThe lease expires in April and the closure will help the Tax Office reduce the vast amount of vacant office space it held across the country.\nStaff at the office had been working on GST and excise issues and doing business assistance visits.\nIt is believed the office was opened in the Howard years along with a number of others across Australia to help people cope with changes accompanying the introduction of the goods and services tax.\nMany of these offices, particularly across regional Australia, have now closed .\nATO correspondence said business assistance visits were now done by phone while the audits taken care of by staff at the office were not specific to the Northern Territory.\n\"We realise that this is a difficult time and will support you through this consultation process,\" a note to staff said.\nATO shopfront services will continue to be available through the myGov shopfront in the Darwin Service Centre on Knuckey Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:46:14.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
