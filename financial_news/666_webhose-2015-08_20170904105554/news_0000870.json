Paul Sanders by Fiona Carruthers So does everyone who interviews you ask about The Simpsons ?\n(Long laugh down the phone line from LA) Yes. It's ironic that it was one of the easiest jobs I've ever had – I did it in a day. I basically met with Matt Groening [the show's creator]. He described it, did a few pencil sketches of the characters – and the whole thing came to me in the car on the way home. I ran straight into my studio; put it down on a cassette, sent it to the producers and got a message back within a few hours saying 'it's great'. On my tombstone I think it will just say: 'He wrote The Simpsons theme.' I've written more than 90 hours of orchestral music that I've slaved over for 30 years. But the thing I'll be best remembered for took less than an hour.\nAnother funny aspect to the story is that Matt and me had had a chequered past – he used to be a rock critic and he wrote a terrible review of my band Oingo Boingo. I wrote a letter to the editor complaining about him and they printed it. We had a joke about 'no hard feelings' when we met up again years later to work on the tune. I never knew why Matt chose me and I never asked him, but I imagine it was because of the film scores I was doing at the time.\nWe're thinking The Simpsons jingle helped pay for more than a few family holidays over the years?\n(More laughter) To be honest, I didn't earn that much from it initially. I certainly didn't do it for the money, just for the enjoyment. The amount was not impressive – a few thousand at best, but the royalties have been good, or so my accountant tells me. The most lucrative part was having sung those three syllables 'The Simp-sons'. That was me and two others on vocals. It's paid for my health insurance. It also got me into the Screen Actors Guild [SAG] for people who do vocal work.\nMost memorable piece of music you've written?\nCertain scores stay with me, usually because they were the most pleasurable ones to work on. I have 16 children with Tim [Burton]. I'll always have great fondness for Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas . More recently, writing the theme song for Tim's Alice in Wonderland [2010] was fun, but that was the hardest yet to pull out of my head.\nDescribe the process of creating an original score?\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements I try to keep my mind as blank as possible. Sometimes 'a feel' comes to me right away and other times I have to work to find it. Having the initial idea is not so hard. But deciding where that idea goes is pretty excruciating. There's no sure-fire method. I pace around a lot. I drive in the car. It helps me to put all my ideas on a CD – then drive around LA and just listen. It's basically a matter of working on it day and night. Just working it, working it, working it and waiting for it to formulate into something. It's like trying to get a pot of water boiling but you can't see if the fire under it is still alight. You wonder: am I going to sit here for a year or a minute until this water finally boils? You don't know – but you do know you don't have much time. That's the worst part.\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't matter what I think – what matters is what a director thinks. When you compose for film, if the director can't hear what you hear, you have to be able to walk away and reset yourself. There's no easy way around that.\nWhat's on the table now?\nI've just finished the final mixing on Tulip Fever, a fun little Indie film directed by Justin Chadwick – who did Mandela – due for release later this year. It's written by [Sir] Tom Stoppard, the playwright. I try to mix up the big and little jobs. I did the music for The End of the Tour [an American biographical drama based on the writer David Foster Wallace], which opens soon, followed by [the American computer-animated fantasy film] Goosebumps .\nMost regular work trips?\nI'm in London every couple of months and I get up to New York as often as I possibly can. When I had the time, I used to fly to NYC every time I finished a film score. I wasn't done until I was on that plane to New York. But life is a bit busy for that now.\nSome tips on your favourite cities?\nLondon and New York are probably my two favourites. In NYC, I always stay at [Robert De Niro's] The Greenwich Hotel ( www.thegreenwichhotel.com/ ) in Tribeca. In London it's always Claridge's in Mayfair ( www.claridges.co.uk/ ). Hong Kong is another favourite, I could just sit and look at the Hong Kong skyline forever. When I'm in LA, I'm always working and we hardly ever go out. So sushi and Japanese food are my treats when I'm travelling. In London, I love Ikeda ( www.ikedarestaurant.com/ ). In New York, I go to Omen [at 113 Thompson Street, near Prince Street, in SoHo]. I'm a nomad at heart and I only wish I could compose in a hotel, but there's not the technology for that. If there was, I'd be composing in Hong Kong, Tokyo or Sydney.\nFamily's favourite bolthole?\nWe live in LA through the week and we have a beautiful home in Santa Barbara on the beach. That's our compound. Every Sunday we have a big game of water volleyball in the pool. It's a ritual and we do it rain or shine, all year round. I work 6.5 days a week, but Sunday afternoons I take off. The other Sunday, there was 22 of us. The [extended] family needs this release – we need to get our aggression out. It's very competitive water volleyball, there's a lot of pounding of fists.\nMost memorable trip?\nI took a year off to travel Africa when I was 18. On my 19th birthday I crossed into Nigeria. The Nigerian border guards were very tough, but when they looked at my passport they said: \"Oh it's your birthday. Sorry we don't have a cake for you. Come on in.\" I'm a big fan of tribal music. That year, I spent time in Mali, Ghana, Zaire, Uganda, Kenya. For a middle-class American kid from the suburbs in LA, to be transplanted to Africa was like going to Mars or Jupiter. I ended up getting extremely sick and almost died. I had malaria three times. But I loved that trip. I have all my drums from India, Africa, plus my gamelan (percussive music set) from Bali in my office loft studio in LA so I can bang away at all hours of the night.", "external_links": ["http://www.thegreenwichhotel.com/", "http://www.ikedarestaurant.com/", "http://www.claridges.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-08-02T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:36:44.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
