Photo by Professor Metze View all 20 photos \nA capacity, standing room only, audience packed into the Baltimore City Community College Fine Arts Theatre on July 31, 2015, to honor the young men and women in Baltimore for their grace and dignity in completing their 2015 class despite the trials and tribulations of the April 27, 2015, violence and destruction that disrupted parts of the beautiful, charming, city. Photo by Professor Metze \nYear Up Baltimore successfully produced the largest graduating class its history with the young men and women who triumphantly marched across the stage for the final graduation ceremony of 2015. A host of VIP small business owners and state and city leaders made the trip to the BCCC campus to support the young urban professionals. \nThe electrifying keynote speech of Lockheed Martin's Stephanie Hill was a perfect complement to the theme of Year Up. She gave a speech that brought the capacity crowd to their feet again and again. Hill sent thunderous, ear shattering, applause to the beautiful auditorium with her amazing life story and incredible lifesaving achievements to inspire the Baltimore youth. \nThe graduates lined up on time to enter the ceremony with the Founder and CEO of Year Up, Gerald Chertavian, on the front row to greet each graduate as they walked up on the stage. There was a new and very important feature to this year's graduation. As the Year Up Baltimore graduates walked across the stage to shake hands with Baltimore Interim Director Raphael Rosenblatt their names and photographs flashed across the giant screen with HIRED in bold red letters to let the audience know that the Year Up graduate was leaving the program with a job. \nThe CEO of the Year Up national organization said that Year Up was designed not to give a handout. Year Up was designed to give Year Up graduates a hand on their way to a hard working career. The miracle of the Year Up program is the way that they have taken urban youth from the streets of the Baltimore region and taught them the keys to living successfully in corporate America in one single year. \nHoward University School of Business has produced millionaire business school graduates in four years. Year Up produced a student this year who has the highest salary of any Year Up graduate in the five year history of the Baltimore program. \"We teach Year Up graduates how to dress, speak, and even sit to be successful in the business world,\" said Rosenblatt. \nStephanie Hill brought the point of knowing how to speak in the language of the corporate world is essential to being successful. \"I had to learn how to communicate in the way that allowed my suggestions to be heard. I was the first woman of color to achieve being a corporate executive in my position at Lockheed Martin. I was eager and enthusiastic. I attended corporate meetings and was the first person to raise my hand with my ideas,\" Hill said. \nHowever, what Hill found at the start of her corporate career, 28 years ago, was a lesson that every Year Up graduate is learning now. There is a language in the corporate world that allows executives and CEO's to speak to each other. Unless executives learn this lesson their ideas will fall on deaf ears. Hill listened and learned from her colleagues. \n\"I would share my ideas and nothing would happen at first. My male colleague would share the exact same point I made and the other executives would say, 'Great idea, Michael' and it was the SAME idea that I had made!\" Hill experienced this communications breakdown several times. She thought her male colleague was stealing her ideas. She later realized that Michael was not stealing her ideas. He liked what she said and was rephrasing it in a way that his male colleagues could understand. When Hill learned this corporate communications language her ideas were accepted and praised. \nHill helped to develop technology that saved the lives of American fighting men and women in Iraq. This technology identified where Islamic terrorists were planting the weapons of destruction that where blowing up American soldiers and destroying combat vehicles at an alarming rate. Her ability to learn the keys to corporate communications allowed her to share her ideas with the men in her executive circle that took her ideas from the suggestion stage to the blueprint stage to saving lives on the battlefield. \nThe male executives were not shy about their sentiments. \"I want to know why she is here,\" said one male executive colleague. Hill proved her value to the corporation by hard work, excellent work ethic, and persistently going to the drawing board to come up with ideas that worked. \"I am an eternal optimist. I have a husband and three children. My children say mommy the glass is 3/4 full. You said it is half full!\" To Stephanie Hill the glass is never half empty. \nShe praised the largest Year Up class in Year Up/Baltimore history for their \"Grace and dignity\" during the worst riots by urban youth in recent Baltimore history on April 27, 2015. She noted that not one Year Up Baltimore student was involved in the violence and destruction that caused 20 million dollars to small business owners, big business owners, city, and state expenditures to the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland. \nThe President of Baltimore City Community College said the Year Up Baltimore graduates were a welcomed addition the BCCC family and he agreed that he was proud of the way the Year Up students conducted themselves on April 27, 2015. \"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, and I quote, 'Riots are the voice of the unheard,' Well, Baltimore is listening now. Year Up Baltimore has been listening,\" Dr. Gordon F. May said. \nAs the college leader spoke the well behaved, well dressed, Year Up Baltimore students joined the capacity, standing room only, audience rose to their feet in an arousing extended standing ovation for what Year Up Baltimore students and staff had achieved by working together. Interim Executive Director Raphael Rosenblatt was joined by Latonya Hines, Internship Services Manager; Scott Robertson, Director of Corporate Partnerships; Walter Reeves, Admissions Coordinator; Geoffrey Colbert, Program Manager; Jeannine Sydnor, Associate Director of Partner Relations; Terence West, Employment Placement Manager; and Anthony Larkins, Associate Director of Admissions & Outreach Services; as they stood with the Year Up Baltimore graduate of 2015 to let each student know that they were proud of them. \nFounder Chertavian took a dream in 2000 that he nurtured with a team of dedicated Year Up staff, corporate partners, community partners, and board members that include: Paul Salam, Co-Founder and Senior Managing Director, Providence Equity Partners serves as chairman of the National Board of Directors is joined by Gail Snowden, Retired Chief Executive Officer, Freedom House, Tim Dibble, Managing General Partner, Alta Communications; Peter Handrinos, Partner Latham & Watkins; Melody Barnes, Chief Executive Officer, Melody Barnes Solutions, and former White House Director Domestic Policy Council; Gerald Chertavian, Founder and CEO, Year Up; Shanique Davis, Senior NDC Engineer, AOL and Year Up graduate in 2008; Lisa Jackson, Co-Founder and Principal, Jackson Ellis Associates; Rod McCowan, Principal, Accelerance Group, Pedro Noguera, Peter L.

Year Up Baltimore has shown urban youth that their lives matter. But even more is needed in Baltimore today, Year Up Baltimore has proven that small business and corporate America, often criticized and portrayed as cold, heartless, greedy people in business suits without concern for the poor and needy. This is not true. Year Up has proven that corporate America does have a heart and does care about the urban centers that created the basis for their wealth. \nIn over 40 years of journalism and education work, the present writer has never seen an urban youth program that deserves more support, financial assistance and corporate sponsorship than Year Up Baltimore. For those who witnessed the riots in Baltimore and gave up hope for the youth in Baltimore, the graduation program on July 31, 2015, restored hope for those who made the effort to attend the graduation ceremony. We must never give up on the youth of America. \nThe Founder of Year Up did not give up on the urban youth of America 15 years ago. He reached down to give them a hand up. “I would like to close this message with a section of a poem by Dr. Maya Angelou, which has stayed with me through the years: \n“We pledge ourselves and our resources to seek for you clean and well-furnished schools, safe and non-threatening streets. Employment which makes use of your talents that does not degrade your dignity. You are the best we have. You are all we have. You are what we have become. We pledge you our whole hearts.” –Professor Maya Angelou. \nAfter five years of covering Year Up Baltimore the present journalist has interviewed hundreds of Year Up Baltimore students, staff members, and corporate partners, community partners, and small business and large corporation partners. The journalist has interviewed United States Congressmen, city leaders, state leaders and Year Up Baltimore parents. The responses to those interviews all have confirmed that Year Up Baltimore is an excellent program to help the young men and women in Baltimore who are trying to improve their lives. Having written more articles on the Year Up Baltimore program than any journalist in America the writer is convinced that it is a program well worth small business and major corporation support. \nYear Up Baltimore needs your support. Contact Interim Executive Director Raphael Rosenblatt at 410-462-8446 to speak with his staff at Year Up Baltimore on the Baltimore City Community College Campus on 2901 Liberty Heights Avenue in Baltimore, Maryland 21215. Corporate sponsorships and valuable internships are essential to the Year Up program. Many small business owners and large corporations have said that in many cases they gain more from the interns than the cost of having interns play a vital role in their business operations. \n“Wealth is of the Heart and Mind not the Pocket.” Who said this? Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President John F. Kennedy? No, it was Kashir Al-Sabir, Year Up Baltimore class of 2015. The 10,000 graduates of the Year Up program are the young people who have embraced their role as the future leaders of America. “This year Year Up marks its 15th anniversary in helping to close the Opportunity Divide – now operating in 14 cities around the country and serving more than 2,500 students annually, providing internships for 250 corporation partners. You can celebrate this milestone with us by visiting MyYearup.org to view and vote on student stories and share your own.” –Year Up Baltimore \nThe present writer began his series of articles on the Year Up program in Baltimore because it is the city that gave refuge to his intellectual role model and most important historical figures in education: Daniel Alexander Payne. Payne was the first African-American college president, a friend of President Abraham Lincoln and the first African-American published poet from South Carolina. Payne was forced to flee his native South Carolina in 1832 after the African-American anti-literacy laws passed by the South Carolina State Legislature made his teaching African-Americans to read a crime. He was forced to close his Tradd Street School in Charleston. \nBaltimore gave Payne a place to live and work. It was a beautiful city to Payne then and it is still a beautiful city to Year Up Baltimore students today. Payne loved Baltimore for saving his life and his career. \nThe writer would like to thank the Baltimore Police for their assistance in helping him as he covered the Year Up graduation. Special thanks to Samuel P. Mirabile of Mirabile Construction Company, Inc., and to former Baltimore Police Officer Dawson for opening the gates. The next Year Up Baltimore graduation will be in 2016. Examiner,com will be there as in the past five years to tell the truth of their amazing work for the youth of Baltimore. \nPlease help the youth of Baltimore. They need your support.
