Fairfax Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray Trade Minister Andrew Robb says \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars are on the line if Canberra and Beijing fail to ratify the free-trade agreement by the end of December.\nMr Robb, who is meeting Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng in Beijing on Friday, admitted \"both of us are a bit pushed to get it finished\" but said he would argue the case for a ratification in 2015 so tariff reductions can start immediately.\n\"If we exchange letters before the end of December, both countries can get the first tariff cut,\" he told The Australian Financial Review in Shanghai. \"We both get an advantage and come the first of January we get the second cut.\"\nMr Robb said he wanted to clear up any confusion in Beijing following the recent opposition to the deal from the trade union movement and the Labor Party, which have raised concerns about a clause allowing Chinese companies to import foreign labour on big projects.\n\"I want to reassure them the government is putting in every effort … whatever it takes to get this thing across the line,\" Mr Robb said.\nThe agreement, which was signed in June, phases out tariffs of up to 30 per cent on a range of Australian food and wine products over four to nine years.\nStarting point crucial The starting point is crucial because the first year of tariff cuts is worth $300 million to the agricultural industry, the National Farmers' Federation says.\n Broken down, the NFF said the delay could cost the dairy industry up to $60 million, the red-meat industry about $100 million, wine exporters $50 million and the grains sector $43 million.\nNFF chief executive Simon Talbot said many investment projects, which were dependent on a 2015 start date, might also be put in jeopardy by a delay.\n\"We are seeing record growth in the agricultural industry on the back of this agreement, which brings with it investment and jobs,\" he said in Shanghai.\n\"We are here to reassure Chinese government officials that we are committed to this deal.\"\nMr Robb said he was confident the agreement would be in place by the end of 2015 but it would \"go to the wire\".\nHe expected the process on the Australian side, including the enabling legislation, would be finished by early December.\nMutual agreement \"Usually then you've got to allow 30 days before there's an exchange of letters ... but you can accelerate that by mutual agreement,\" he said.\n\"It's all still doable but like all these deals the timing goes to the wire. From an economic point of view we're talking lots of money – hundreds of millions. The government certainly wants our industries to benefit from every bit of it.\"\nThe seafood industry would lose out from any delay, said Andrew Ferguson, who was travelling with Mr Robb as part of the trade delegation. Under the agreement, tariffs on seafood will be phased out over four years.\n\"If we could get a lump off this year and a lump off next year, it would effectively halve that 14 per cent tariff,\" said Mr Ferguson, managing director of South Australian company Ferguson Australia, which exports 180 tonnes of lobster a year.\n\"It also opens up the market opportunities more quickly, so we can start engaging directly with China.\"\nMany seafood companies export now to neighbouring countries such as Vietnam, from where the products make their way to China through the so-called \"grey\" channel.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-08-27T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:49:07.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
