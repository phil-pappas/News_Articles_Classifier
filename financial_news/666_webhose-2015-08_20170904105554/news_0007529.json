(AP) -- A self-described middleman in an alleged bourbon theft ring in Kentucky says he bought barrels of whiskey from the accused ringleader and arranged more purchases. \nIn court records, Dustin Adkins says Gilbert \"Toby\" Curtsinger sold cases of Pappy Van Winkle bourbon. Adkins says Curtsinger indicated the supply was available because labels were \"messed up.\" \nAdkins says he started out buying quarts of bourbon before acquiring two barrels from Curtsinger. Wanting his friends to share in a \"good deal,\" Adkins says he arranged nine more barrel purchases. \nAdkins recently pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal conspiracy to receive stolen property over $10,000. \nCurtsinger has pleaded not guilty to charges that include engaging in organized crime. Defense attorney Whitney True Lawson says releasing such documents jeopardizes chances for a fair trial locally. Follow the quotes you care about most.
