The greenback was close to multi-year highs against emerging market currencies including the South African rand, Brazilian real and Indonesian rupiah.\nThe euro fell 0.25 percent to a two-week low of $1.0847 .\nDON'T FIGHT BULL MARKET\nInvestors narrowed the odds on a September U.S. rate hike, with Fed fund futures <0#FF:> implying around a 1-in-2 chance, compared with around 1-in-3 after weak wage growth data last week.\nYields on 10-year Treasury notes rose 3 basis points on the day to 2.24 percent, having hit two-month lows around 2.14 percent earlier this week.\nIn stocks, Europe's index of the leading 300 shares was up 0.8 percent at 1,593 points, Britain's FTSE 100 was up a third of one percent and Germany's DAX up 1 percent.\nFrance's CAC 40 was also up 1 percent, led by a 8.5 percent surge in SocGen shares after the bank reported second-quarter results that beat analysts' forecasts.\nA report on Spain's service sector, which showed the fastest pace of growth in three months and strongest hiring in eight years, also boosted investor sentiment in Europe.\nEarlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.5 percent but MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent.\nIn China, the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen was flat after curbs on short-selling prompted a sizable bounce on Tuesday.\nThere were also signs Chinese consumers could be taking over from manufacturers as the driving force for growth as the Caixin/Markit survey of services climbed to its highest in 11 months.\nLosses on Wall Street on Tuesday had been modest with the Dow ending 0.27 percent lower, while the S&P 500 eased 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq 0.19 percent.\nApple hit its lowest in over six months, apparently in part on worries about demand in China.\nU.S. futures pointed to a higher open on Wall Street on Wednesday.\n\"Rate hikes eventually burst bubbles, but it usually takes at least three. We think it is still too early to fight this bull market,\" Citi's U.S. equity strategy team said in a note to clients.\nIn commodity markets, Brent oil rose 1 percent to $50.46 a barrel and U.S. crude gained 0.8 percent to $46.12, while gold eased to $1,085 an ounce.
