\nMerkel will address the chamber and has dispatched trusted allies, including her powerful hardline Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, to talk conservative MPs out of allowing their misgivings to get the upper hand. \nSchaeuble threw his weight behind the plan approved by eurozone finance ministers Friday in an interview with public broadcaster ZDF, calling support for it \"the right decision with everything taken into account\". \nAddressing nagging doubts about the International Monetary Fund's involvement in the bailout, a sacred cow to most conservatives, Schaeuble asked them to trust the IMF would agree by October to participate in the bailout. \n\"I am quite certain that we will come to a common assessment of the situation and I am also quite certain that the IMF will take part in this programme,\" he said. \nA Commerzbank (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) research note outlined the reasons for the German attachment to IMF involvement in the bailout, seeing it as a guarantor of stability and rigour. \n\"The IMF is the only organisation which has decades of experience with helping failing countries,\" it said. \n\"And it can only use this expertise if it has the opportunity to exercise pressure\" by helping to foot the bill. \nSchaeuble last month floated the prospect of Greece taking a \"timeout\" from the euro as an alternative to a fresh bailout, horrifying some eurozone partners but convincing voters at home of his vigilance on conditions of aid to Athens. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , he has said repeatedly in interviews over the last week that he can ask German lawmakers to approve the rescue deal with a clear conscience. \nMerkel on Sunday credited the \"tough stance\" by Berlin and Schaeuble in particular with convincing Greece to swallow bitter pills she says are required to \"get it back on its feet\", including deep-cutting economic reforms. \nIn recent days Berlin has hailed a dramatic change in tone from Athens, particularly since the departure last month of flamboyant ex-finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, a virulent critic of Berlin's austerity demands. \nBut while the IMF has insisted on significant debt relief for Greece, Germany has ruled out a writedown and argued instead for longer maturities or lower interest rates on the principle. \nThe Bundestag debate is to begin at 0700 GMT with a vote expected at around 1000 GMT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T11:27:46.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
