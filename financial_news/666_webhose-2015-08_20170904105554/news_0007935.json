Introducing an arbitrary cap on fares is simply passing the bill on to taxpayers.\" \nRail minister Claire Perry acknowledged that \"rail fares put a strain on family finances\" but added: \"That's why today, for fares we can control, we are putting an end to inflation-busting fare increases (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:02:20.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
