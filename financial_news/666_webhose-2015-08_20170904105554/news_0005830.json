The improvement was led by a 4.8 percent jump in goods purchases. Growth in spending on services, the sector that generates the most US jobs, was unchanged at 2.1 percent for the second consecutive quarter. \nPersonal (LSE: PGH.L - news ) income rose 0.4 percent for the third month in a row in June. Real disposable income picked up slightly, to 0.5 percent growth following two months of 0.4 percent. \nInflation remained tepid. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3 percent year-over-year in June, accelerating slightly from May. \nExcluding food and energy, which can be volatile, so-called \"core\" PCE prices rose 1.3 percent for the sixth consecutive month, still well below the Fed's 2.0 percent target for price stability. \n\"Spending had a good Q2, even with some slowing in June,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \"The trend in core PCE prices remains tame -- with no clear acceleration or deceleration.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:07:43.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
