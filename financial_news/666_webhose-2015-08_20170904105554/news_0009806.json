Hillhouse was also not an investor, said a third source who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject. \nA spokeswoman for Uber declined to comment. \nWith the close of the $1 billion round, Uber is re-lining its war chest for a drawn-out battle with Chinese car-hailing app rival Didi Kuaidi, which last month raised $2 billion. \nThe two are locked in a turf war, spending heavily on subsidies to lower the cost for users and inflate the money earned for drivers of their services. \nThe deal was oversubscribed, said the second source directly familiar with the fundraising. According to a fundraising document seen by Reuters last week, this round values Uber China at $7 billion, with the unit planning to list on the mainland by 2020. \n(Additional reporting by Shu Zhang; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Stephen Coates)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T09:59:57.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
