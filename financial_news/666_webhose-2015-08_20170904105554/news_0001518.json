So far this year, the country has amassed a surplus of $5 billion, according to the minister.\n\"There has been a very sharp drop in imports coupled with a import substitution move,\" Monteiro said. \"Our exports are also growing in volume. If we had the same prices of the past year, our trade surplus would have topped $10 billion by now.\" (Reporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier, writing by Walter Brandimarte; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T19:26:53.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
