However, this will not be made mandatory, said Nilesh Sathe, member-life, Irdai said.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of an insurance conference organised by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B), Sathe said corporate agents would be given an option to tie up with nine insurers. Thus, banks can decide to continue with the existing bancassurance arrangement, or tie up with more insurers.\nALSO READ:  No distinction between FDI and FII a dampener for insurance sector Sathe also said they are reviewing other guidelines, including sum assured not being paid for suicide-related claims after reinstatement of the policy. He said it was not fair that a customer pays premium for several years and when suicide instances happen after reinstatement of policy due to lapsation, suicides in that year are not given full sum assured but only premium refund.\nALSO READ:  General insurance sector growth 3-year low at 9.3% in FY15 Also with respect to agents, he said Irdai is looking into norms to see if simpler products could be sold by agents without any major examination. He added for complex products like annuity or unit-linked products, they can be made to take two-three day training and a test. The regulator has already taken a hit of Rs 35 crore since licensing fee from individual agents collected by Irdai has been discontinued, he added.\nHighest NAV products were discontinued from the market due to misselling and false claims of high returns. Sathe explained that if companies now send such products for approval, they may look into them. \"We are not averse to these products,\" he said,\nALSO READ:  Irdai looks to simplify approval process for online products Bancassurance will be a major reform by Irdai in the next few weeks. As per current rules, corporate agents (like banks) can tie up with only one life, one non-life and one standalone health insurance company as part of the distribution tie-ups. These norms will be gazetted in the next few days and published.\nIrdai in its earlier draft had done away with the capping of insurance business from one insurer by a bank. In its first draft, Irdai had mandated banks to cap business from one insurer to 50 per cent; Irdai has removed this cap.\nALSO READ:  IRDAI to announce host of new norms from October This would mean that those insurers without a bank partner or promoter would still have to wait longer to get business from bancassurance. The regulator has said an insurer can have tie-ups with up to three insurers in any line of business --- life, non-life or health.\nIn FY15, insurers with bank partners or promoters had an increase in the business from bancassurance. The industry almost gets 55-65 per cent business from the bank channels.\nALSO READ:  Irdai steps in to get rid of the middleman Irdai, in an earlier draft on corporate agents released in March, had said no corporate agent (including banks) can get more than 90 per cent of the premium from any one insurer in the first year.\nIt had said this limit should gradually come down to 75 per cent and 60 per cent during the second year and third year, respectively. From the fourth year onwards, it said this limit should not be more than 50 per cent.\nIndustry sources said banks, especially large public sector banks, had approached the finance ministry and requested that the cap be removed, since otherwise their valuations could take a hit. They also added if it was optional, not all banks would open up their network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:02:13.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
