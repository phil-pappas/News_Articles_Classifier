Although the number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits at the end of July rose for the second straight week, new claims remained at an overall low level, reflecting an improving labor market. \nThe Dow was down 0.7%, the S&P 500 fell 0.8%, and the Nasdaq shed 1.6%. \nStocks on the Move Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox Class B (FOX) and Class A (FOXA) fell 6.7% and 6.4%, respectively, after the company reported that it closed fiscal 2015 with a mixed quarter. The company reported revenue slightly below expectations but EBITDA and EPS above projections. Management lowered its fiscal 2016 guidance for EBITDA to an implied range of $6.75 billion to $6.9 billion, slightly below current expectations. Morningstar equity analyst Neil Macker notes that we are maintaining our wide moat rating and we expect to maintain our fair value estimate for the shares. \"Currently trading in 4-star territory, the stock may offer an attractive entry point to investors with a longer horizon,\" Macker said. \nDeutsche Telekom (DTEGY) slipped 1.2% despite reporting solid first-half results, primarily driven by its U.S. operations with an extra boost from the strong dollar. Morningstar senior equity analyst Allan Nichols notes that he plans to raise the fair value estimate for the local shares and the ADR, but he does not plan to change the firm's no moat rating. \nShare of Time Warner (TWX) fell 0.8%. The media company reported strong second-quarter results ahead of expectations because of the strength of video games and TV licensing revenue. Total revenue grew 8.2% year over year to $7.3 billion, led by 14.9% growth at Warner Brothers. We are maintaining our wide moat rating and our fair value estimate, said Morningstar equity analyst Neil Macker. Macker also thinks the shares, which are now trading in 4-star territory, may offer an attractive entry point for investors with a longer-term investing horizon. \nViacom (VIA) shares slumped 13.4% after reporting fiscal third-quarter results that showed a revenue decline from the year-earlier quarter, due to the fact that no major films were released during the period. \nForeign Markets European markets were lower. The FTSE 100 and Germanyâ€™s DAX were down 0.1%, and the Paris CAC was down 0.4%. \nAsian shares were mixed. The Shanghai Composite shed 0.9%, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%, and the Hang Seng fell 0.6%.
