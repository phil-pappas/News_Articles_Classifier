Get out your calendar\nBeing financially caught short by hefty bill costs can leave you in shock when these one-off expenses randomly arrive in the mail or pop up in your inbox.\nMark on your calendar when your next big bill is due, that way you will be prepared for it once it arrives.\n2. Start a plan\nThese once-a-year bills can sometimes only be paid in one hit and not small increments so you will need to have the cash there ready to go by the due date.\nWork out roughly what you think the cost will be if the bill hasn’t yet arrived this year — the easiest way to do this is to base it on last year’s bill — and then work out how much money you need to set aside every pay cheque so you can afford it.\nFor an $800 car registration bill that’s $15.40 a week, $30.70 a fortnight or $61.50 a month.\nSource: istock\n3. Stash the cash\nOne of the easiest ways to afford these costly expenses is by setting up a separate bank account with automatic direct debits set to leave every time you get paid.\nHigh-interest savings accounts are delivering low returns, often around the two per cent mark, but they can still be a good place to tuck away your money.\nAnother simple but smart trick is by grabbing an envelope and putting in any spare notes or cash that you accumulate throughout the week.\nThis will quickly add up and come bill time you hopefully will have a nice little stash of cash — if you haven’t dipped into it — to pay the expense.\n4. Pay the bill\nMake sure you pay the bill by the due date.\nOften companies will slug you with interest charges if you don’t pay on time and that can hurt.\nThen once you can tick it off as done and dusted for 12 months, write down in your diary when next year’s bill is likely to be due and then start your preparation all over again.\nOf course if you are still struggling then make sure you talk to the provider and see if you can set up a payment plan.\nFIND a bank account with low or no fees\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/being-cashed-up-for-those-big-annual-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227482542685?sv=34ee0b39f8da5e3729e86820c98c5bf4&h=How+to+avoid+a+hole+in+your+hip+pocket", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+to+avoid+a+hole+in+your+hip+pocket&c=BEING+hit+with+whopping+once-a-year+expenses+can+put+a+gap+in+your+budget+so+follow+these+strategies+to+ease+the+burden.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/being-cashed-up-for-those-big-annual-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227482542685?sv=34ee0b39f8da5e3729e86820c98c5bf4", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/being-cashed-up-for-those-big-annual-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227482542685?sv=34ee0b39f8da5e3729e86820c98c5bf4", "http://moneysaverhq.dailytelegraph.com.au/campaign/banking", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/life-insurance-income-protection#itm_t=story&itm_l=hole-in-hip-pocket", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/being-cashed-up-for-those-big-annual-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227482542685?sv=34ee0b39f8da5e3729e86820c98c5bf4&title=How+to+avoid+a+hole+in+your+hip+pocket", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/being-cashed-up-for-those-big-annual-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227482542685?sv=34ee0b39f8da5e3729e86820c98c5bf4", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/being-cashed-up-for-those-big-annual-bills/story-e6frfmcr-1227482542685?sv=34ee0b39f8da5e3729e86820c98c5bf4&title=How+to+avoid+a+hole+in+your+hip+pocket"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T21:16:02.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
