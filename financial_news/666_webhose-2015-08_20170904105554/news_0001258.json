The Bloomberg Commodity Index fell for the third straight day, touching its lowest level since 2002.\nCredit-default swaps on companies exposed to plunging commodity prices weighed on the swaps gauge, which typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates. Crude oil’s decline to its lowest price since March 17 rekindled concern that energy companies will be less able to service their debt.\n“Commodities appear to be weighing on the market. They have a greater effect on the high-yield market, but both markets have been reacting in sympathy lately,” said Collin Martin, who heads fixed-income research at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “Even if oil prices were to rise a bit from here, they are likely still well below what many firms had budgeted for.”\nA swaps index tied to speculative-grade companies added 8 basis points to 375, the highest since January.\nThe cost to insure against default by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. for five years rose 29.5 basis points to 515.5. Five-year swaps on energy-services provider Nabors Industries Ltd. jumped 15 basis points to 361. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.\nThe cost of credit-default swaps of media companies including CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. also increased as investors grew skeptical about the health of the pay-TV industry.\n\",\"byline\":\"Michelle F.
