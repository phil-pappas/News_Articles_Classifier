Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Spring is likely to be strong in the Sydney auction market, with the clearance rate picking up over 80 per cent for the first time in five weeks.\nAn unremarkable six-bedroom house on an intersection in Epping on the upper north shore sold well over expectations at $2.2 million to a local investor from the Sydney CBD on Saturday.\n\"It was an average two-storey home on a busy intersection with traffic lights on the corner,\" said McGrath Epping sales agent Wayne Vaughan. \"As it was sitting in a conservation zone, it's not like it can be torn down and started again. We were hopeful of getting $2 million. It was a good result.\"\nThere is a growing sense that price growth is topping out in the current cycle in Sydney's buoyant housing market, but the rise to 80.3 per cent on the results of 702 auctions reported, up from the 78.3 per cent last week (out of a larger 989 reported results), suggests that competition and demand will remain strong in the coming spring season, when more homes are likely to come on to the market. The latest figure from CoreLogic RP Data is preliminary and subject to revision.\nMalaysian developer TA Global sold nearly 38 per cent of the second stage of its $700-million residential project in the eastern coastal suburb of Little Bay on Saturday. The first stage of the project had already sold out.\nMelbourne's seasonal pick-up There are also signs of a seasonal pickup in the Melbourne market. Fairfax Media-owned Domain Group said auction clearances rose for a second straight week to 79.5 per cent. CoreLogic figures reported a fall in the clearance rate to 76.5 per cent from 78.5 per cent last week, but spring is also likely to give a lift to the market in the country's second-biggest city.\nA three-bedroom converted warehouse in Richmond on the Melbourne city fringe sold at auction for $2.25 million after being declared on the market at $1.9 million.\n But other market observers say there are signs that Melbourne's market may be reined in. Karen Price, a buyers' advocate with agency Morrell and Koren, said she attended two auctions in Brunswick, on the northern city fringe that were passed in on Saturday.\n\"The vendor's head way was above where the market is,\" Ms Price said. \"That always tends to happen in a strong market. The vendors get ahead of themselves and think it's party time.\"\nIn Brisbane, the clearance rate of 60.2 per cent was down slightly on the previous week's 61.1 per cent, based on the preliminary result of 93 out of the 130 auctions for which results were reported.\nwith Su-Lin Tan", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-08-16T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:08:02.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
