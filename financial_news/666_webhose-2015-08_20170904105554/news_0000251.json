We don't offer a loan where that loan is repaid at your next pay. We offer longer-term loans.\"\nCash Converters said they had not yet received notification from Westpac and would release a statement when they do.\nIts latest accounts from the December half said it had a $70 million debt facility with Westpac that had been drawn to $56.9 million at December 31 2014.\nPayday lending has long been criticised by consumer groups, and this year the Australian Securities and Investments Commission flagged concerns that some in the industry were not complying with laws designed to protect consumers from predatory behaviour by lenders.\nA review of customer files found that two-thirds of borrowers had either taken out two or more payday loans in the last 90 days, or they were in default on a small amount loan.Until now, Westpac's position to fund payday lenders stood in contrast to rival National Australia Bank, which refused to fund the sector.\nMeanwhile, there were also reports on Tuesday that Westpac, NAB, ANZ Bank and Commonwealth Bank may have loan exposure of about NZ$300 million ($271 million) to struggling New Zealand coal miner Solid Energy.\nPrime Minister John Key this week said the government-owned miner was in a \"precarious\" position and the government was working out the next steps with the miner's lenders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:34:08.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
