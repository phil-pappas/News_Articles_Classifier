Photo: Louie Douvis\n The nation's biggest banks will be asked to pay the corporate regulator's costs if they are pinged over a long-running rate-fixing investigation.\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commission chairman Greg Medcraft confirmed on Friday that banks and wealth managers are the target of a plan announced earlier this month to claw back some of its running costs.\nProminent companies were put on notice they could be asked to foot the bill for investigations into their misconduct, on top of legal costs, if found guilty in future include: Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, ANZ Bank, AMP, Macquarie Group and IOOF Holdings.\nWhen quizzed by the parliamentary joint committee on corporations and financial services on Friday over the types of cases where ASIC intends to start flexing its muscle to recover costs, Mr Medcraft highlighted \"a very large investigation into the banks\" over manipulation in the bank bill swap rate.\nAdvertisement \"I think this sends a price signal to the market not to obstruct or delay us and should result in quicker and less costly investigations,\" Mr Medcraft said.\nChairman of the parliamentary joint committee, Liberal Senator David Fawcett, grilled Mr Medcraft on whether he expected the cost recovery push would help ASIC seek harsher penalties as he lashed the lenient sentences garnered for planners convicted of inappropriately advising clients to invest in failed schemes such as Trio, Timbercorp and Great Southern.\nNationals Senator John Williams asked whether the ability to recover costs could enable ASIC to revisit the case of disgraced accountant and adviser Peter Holt, who was banned for just three years.\n\"To be frank I'm not sure. That was the appropriate determination for the time. If people have new information they should come forward,\" ASIC commissioner Greg Tanzer said.\nClawback action only if success likely ASIC clarified it would only seek to use its power to clawback investigation costs in instances where doing so was likely to succeed, would not cause excessive financial hardship, or reduce the pool of funds available to pay victims.\nThis means it's unlikely to be applied in the case of collapsed stockbroker BBY, which is expected to leave its clients at least $16 million out of pocket.\nMr Medcraft called for law reform, in response to the failure of BBY, to force brokers to quarantine client funds so they are protected in case a firm goes bust.\n\"This is not the first time this type of thing has happened. We have raised the matter with Treasury that the law needs to be amended so client monies can't be co-mingled.\"\nASIC deputy chair Peter Kell said the watchdog would continue to ask the government for more powers to help it clampdown on corporations where there was evidence a toxic leadership culture [and] was encouraging wrongdoing by foot soldiers, particularly in the troubled financial advice industry.\n\"We do not have a distinct straightforward power to go after management instead of just frontline staff. We don't have powers for profit disgorgement.\"\nLast year's financial system inquiry, chaired by former Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray, recommended the government conduct a review of ASIC's efficiency and effectiveness.\n\"We think we are efficient and effective within the resources we have,\" Mr Medcraft said.\nNationals Senator John Williams offered his support to champion the regulators plea for more authority.\n\"Take two weeks and come back to me with a list of what extra powers you want to enable you to do your job better.\"\nWhistleblowers listened to The hearing heard that ASIC receives about 9500 complaints a year and is currently working with up to 50 \"whistleblowers\", mostly from the troubled financial services sector.\nASIC commissioner Cathie Armour said the processes companies have in place to support whistleblowers was a key indicator of culture.\nDeputy chairman of the parliamentary joint committee Labor Senator Deborah O'Neill called out ASIC's own track record in this area for having failed in the past to react to whistleblowers in a professional and timely way, particularly in relation to advice scandals at the country's biggest bank CBA and listed wealth manager IOOF Holdings.\nASIC executive Warren Day said internal processes had since been improved with all whistleblowers now assigned a dedicated case manager.\nIn addition to reacting to tip-offs, ASIC said it was trying to improve its proactive oversight.\n\"We are having very frank conversations with the very top levels of banks and their boards, and calling out problems of culture as we see them,\" Mr Medcraft said.\n\"Almost every company we have approached in this way has welcomed it and engaged with us constructively â€¦ it's when they don't that we really focus in.\"\nLiberal MP Ann Sudmalis was sceptical of the focus on culture.\n\"It seems too little, too late. By the time you establish a culture is bad there are usually quite a number of dudded individuals.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:42:45.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
