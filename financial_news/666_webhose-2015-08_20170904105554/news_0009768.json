Managing director Stephen Heath said like-for-like sales during July were up 12.8 per cent, with long term management initiatives starting to pay off. The company heavily invested in marketing and staff, particularly in its Fantastic and Plush stores to recover from last year's negative like-for-like sales result. But he warned the falling Australian dollar could slow the sales drive. \"The continuing depreciation of the Australian dollar will partly offset some of the improvements being made,\" he said. \"We will continue to focus on our product offer, customer service and employee engagement to increase shareholder value.\" The group is set to limit foreign currency exposure by selectively raising prices, pushing down costs and developing new and existing products. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation lifted 30 per cent to $26.1 million. The company sold its premium furniture brand Dare Gallery business and Dandenong property which helped boost the company's cash by 73.8 per cent to $36.7 million. The market welcomed the good news with shares in Fantastic up 21 cents, or 10 per cent to $2.30. RECORD SALES PUSH PROFIT * Net profit up 125 per cent to $13.2 million. * Revenue up 11 per cent to $496.9 million. * Dividend up 12 cents to 15 cents.
