Construction work fell at its fastest pace in over 13 years in 2015. Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Construction work done fell last financial year at its fastest rate in more than 13 years, as resources-dominated infrastructure investment took its biggest tumble to date.\nThe $198 billion total work done in the year to June was down 6.2 per cent on the $211 billion figure of a year earlier. It was the biggest annual decline since the 9.5 per cent slump in the year to December 2001, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed.\nEngineering construction – the measure of big-ticket work done on resources and civil infrastructure projects – slumped 14.8 per cent to $105.7 billion in the year to June, its largest yearly decline since that ABS data series began in 1987.\nThe deteriorating environment, which is likely to speed up further before bottoming out in 2018, was illustrated by contractor WorleyParsons, which on Wednesday posted an annual loss of $54.9 million on project write-downs and dispute settlements.\nStalled: the outlook is for less spending on roads, bridges, railways and dams but more on home building. Bloomberg Residential construction posted another strong year, with the seasonally adjusted total of work done up 10.6 per cent to $57.3 billion in the year to June from 2014.\n\"The 'baton pass' from engineering to residential building is proceeding,\" CommSec chief economist Craig James said. \"The outlook is for more home building and less spending on roads, bridges, railways and dams.\"\nQuarterly residential reversal On a quarterly basis, the picture was reversed, however, as sharp declines in house building activity in Queensland, SA and the ACT – along with a mild decline in Victoria – offset strong performances in NSW and Tasmania. Residential work fell 3 per cent to $14.6 billion in the three months to June, the biggest quarterly decline since September 2010.\n Engineering construction, ironically, rose 5.6 per cent in the June quarter – the first in seven quarters – to $26.5 billion. For the June quarter, total construction was up 1.6 per cent from the March quarter at $49.8 billion.\nNon-residential construction declined 1.8 per cent in the June quarter to $8.7 billion.\n\"Despite the quarterly figures residential building continues to do the heavy lifting in the economy,\" Master Builders Australia chief economist Peter Jones said. \"While residential building is at an advanced stage of the cycle, we expect some further growth in 2015-16.\"\nDespite the pace of growth in residential, the weakness in engineering means inflationary fears aren't being stoked, Mr James said.\n\"The Reserve Bank will be pleased about current trends in construction,\" he said. \"Overall activity has not fallen off a cliff, and while there is a sniff of inflation in home building, overall construction inflation is at five-year lows. The RBA will continue to stay on the interest rate sidelines over coming months.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-08-26T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:04:00.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
