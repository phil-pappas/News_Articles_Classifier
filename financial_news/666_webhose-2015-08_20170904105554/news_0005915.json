We no longer have a democracy ... but a Eurozone dictatorship.\" \nHe and 12 other left-wing politicians are intending to start a rival anti-austerity movement to Syriza - but have not quit their current party outright so far. \nHowever, Mr Tsipras has defended the bailout plan, explaining: \"We took a painful decision of responsibility, and took a step back. Our position cannot be served by escape or by fantasy. \n\"We took the decision to remain alive instead of committing suicide and complaining how unfair it was.\" \nGreece needs to complete the bailout deal with all relevant parties by 20 August, as this is when a €3.2bn debt repayment to the European Central Bank is due. \nHowever, there is a contingency plan in case the bailout deal is not achieved, as the European Commission has been told to draw up proposals for an interim loan which would allow Greece to pay its bills if Eurozone members reject the plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T11:21:20.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
