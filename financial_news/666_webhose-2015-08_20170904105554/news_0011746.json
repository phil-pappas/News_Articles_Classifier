The declines have erased gains made in the first quarter and left the index in a loss for the year. \n\"February was wrong, as it's clearly been proved the markets were way too optimistic ... August is wrong, it's way too pessimistic,\" said Michael Browne, fund manager at Martin Currie, adding that August was often a weak month for equities. \n\"We have taken advantage of the opportunities that the markets have presented to us in a negative August ... in the expectation that we are going to come back in September.\" \nThe FTSE's rally on Friday built on a 3.6 percent gain in the previous session, as strong U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . data eased concerns about slowing Chinese growth. The index closed up 1 percent for the week. \n\"Clearly, we're getting back to normality,\" said Richard Hunter, Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) 's head of equities. \nEnergy stocks were among the top gainers as oil prices recovered. Oil company BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) rose 3.4 percent and Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 2.5 percent. \nThe index's top gainer was satellite communications company Inmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) , rising 4.3 percent after the launch of its third Global Xpress satellite, which will provide mobile broadband service to customers in the remotest regions, including air flights. \nAmong mid caps, Debenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) fell by 7.1 percent after UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) cut its rating, citing survey findings that suggest customer intent to purchase from the company's stores is the lowest among peers. \nFootwear company Jimmy Choo (LSE: CHOO.L - news ) lost 4.2 percent after underwhelming first half results. \n(Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T21:09:51.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
