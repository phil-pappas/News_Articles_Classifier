Source: Supplied\n“Base rates can vary from little better than nothing to 5.25 per cent if you stick to the account conditions such as minimum monthly deposits and no or low withdrawals,’’ he says.\n“If you’re not sure you can do that, you might be better off with an account that has a good flat rate.”\nThe deals on offer for young savers can quickly change and if you don’t do regular check-ups on the rates on offer, before you know it your youngster might be receiving little or no interest at all.\nBankWest’s Kid’s Bonus Saver has the most competitive junior account — for a young customer who pockets a maximum of $250 per month and makes no withdrawals they’ll receive a rate of 5.24 per cent.\nFirst Option Credit Union’s kids bonus saver account is the next best available — offering an interest rate of 5.15 per cent if the child deposits a minimum of $5 per month and makes no withdrawals.\nGiven the Reserve Bank of Australia has kept the cash rate at a record-low two per cent, for those kids who are receiving interest rates north of five per cent it’s not a bad deal.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Help+your+kids+grow+their+savings&c=CASH+conscious+junior+savers+can+reap+far+better+returns+on+their+savings+than+their+peers%2C+but+they+need+to+stick+to+a+plan+and+check+rates+regularly.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-keep-an-eye-on-your-kids-savings-to-help-them-grow/story-e6frfmcr-1227463684190?sv=6ab244667c62168ce9058b1ff6492d00", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/banking#itm_t=story&itm_l=kids-savings-accounts", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-keep-an-eye-on-your-kids-savings-to-help-them-grow/story-e6frfmcr-1227463684190?sv=6ab244667c62168ce9058b1ff6492d00&h=Help+your+kids+grow+their+savings", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-keep-an-eye-on-your-kids-savings-to-help-them-grow/story-e6frfmcr-1227463684190?sv=6ab244667c62168ce9058b1ff6492d00", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-keep-an-eye-on-your-kids-savings-to-help-them-grow/story-e6frfmcr-1227463684190?sv=6ab244667c62168ce9058b1ff6492d00&title=Help+your+kids+grow+their+savings", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-keep-an-eye-on-your-kids-savings-to-help-them-grow/story-e6frfmcr-1227463684190?sv=6ab244667c62168ce9058b1ff6492d00", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-keep-an-eye-on-your-kids-savings-to-help-them-grow/story-e6frfmcr-1227463684190?sv=6ab244667c62168ce9058b1ff6492d00&title=Help+your+kids+grow+their+savings"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T11:09:25.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
