Photo: Bloomberg\nAn improving job market edged the US Federal Reserve closer to an interest rate hike at its July meeting even as policymakers continued to express broad concerns about lagging inflation and the weak state of the world economy, according to minutes released on Wednesday.\nOne Fed policymaker was ready to vote for an interest rate hike at the July 28-29 meeting, while a group of others \"viewed the economic conditions for beginning to increase the target range for the federal funds rate as having been met or were confident that they would be met shortly,\" according to the minutes .\nThat sentiment, combined with a broader recognition among \"many members\" that full employment was close, led the committee to say in its policy statement that it only needed to see \"some\" more improvement in labour markets before hiking rates.\nMost Federal Reserve policymakers said they want to maintain the US central bank's massive balance sheet even after they begin raising interest rates, the minutes also showed, and to manage any reductions carefully when the time comes.\nThe Fed currently reinvests the proceeds from maturing Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in its $US4.5 trillion portfolio so as to continue downward pressure on business and household borrowing costs. Investors are keen for any details on when and how the Fed might shrink its holdings.\nIn the minutes, the Fed made clear that officials expect to keep up the reinvestment policy during the early stages of interest-rate normalisation, and to only pare reinvestments when economic conditions and the outlook allow.\nNo decisions on how to shrink the balance sheet were made at the meeting, and officials agreed to discuss the policy further at future meetings.\n\"Most participants thought that it might be best either to wind down reinvestments or to manage them in a manner that would smooth the decline in the balance sheet in a predictable way,\" the minutes said. \"However, some participants supported ceasing reinvestments all at once at the appropriate time.\"\nOfficials also discussed using different strategies to pare mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries.", "external_links": ["http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150819a.htm"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:40:52.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
