Choi, director of the SEC's regional office in San Francisco, said Dargey promised investors their money would go to develop specific real estate projects approved under the EB-5 visa program. Foreigners may gain U.S. residency if they make a qualified investment of at least $500,000 in a project that creates or preserves at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers.\nDargey misled investors about their ability to obtain permanent residency by investing in the Path America projects, the SEC said.\n\"He misused millions of dollars to enrich himself and jeopardized investors' prospects for U.S. residency,\" Choi said.
