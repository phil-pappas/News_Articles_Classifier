The stock was down 3.6 percent as of 10:51 a.m, with the Hang Seng Index up 0.6 percent.\nThe decline may reflect “investors’ knee-jerk reaction to any negative news or uncertainty at a time when sentiment is still fragile as the stock market is still trying to find its feet,” Linus Yip, a Hong Kong-based strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd., said by phone. “We have to wait for more information to see if the incident will have an impact on the brokerage’s operations.”\nManaging Director Xu Gang was among the eight named by Caixin. Citic declined to comment on the report. In a stock exchange statement on Wednesday, the company said it was operating normally and hadn’t received any official notice related to a reported probe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:26:15.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
