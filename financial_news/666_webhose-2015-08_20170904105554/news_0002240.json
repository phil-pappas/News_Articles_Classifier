Andrew Quilty Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose Superannuation experts warn that the government must make people wait longer before they are allowed to start drawing down their compulsory savings, but neither the government nor opposition is prepared to move first, fearing it would be unpopular.\nDepending on your age, Australians are allowed to start accessing the money saved on their behalf through the superannuation guarantee once they turn 55, known as the \"preservation age\". At present those born before July 1, 1960, can access their super at age 55. The preservation age rises progressively depending on your age to 60 for those born on July 1, 1964 and onwards.\nActuaries have warned that the preservation age needs to rise to reflect that people born today are expected to live much longer than when the system was introduced nearly 25 years ago.\n\"I agree we need to look at possibly lifting it [the preservation age] but the political environment around it is too difficult, the community is not ready,\" shadow minister for financial services and superannuation Bernie Ripoll said.\n\"It is just too politically difficult.\"\nMr Ripoll lashed the Abbott government for shutting down debate around the issue with its promise not make any changes to superannuation policy\nThe Prime Minister and his Treasurer, Joe Hockey, have pledged \"no unexpected or adverse changes\" to super policy this term, or probably next term either .\n\"Promising no change ever is just bogus. The Parliament needs to be able to have a debate with industry and the community about these sorts of issues,\" Mr Ripoll said.\n He made the comments at the Financial Services Council's annual conference on the Gold Coast on Wednesday.\nWhen asked why Labor would not show leadership on the need to raise the preservation age, Mr Ripoll said it was not an urgent policy issue.\n\"The evidence is that the vast majority of people who start drawing on their super at 55 are conservative about what they do with it so I don't think there is any urgency to limit access.\"\nHead of superannuation research at actuarial firm Rice Warner Nathan Bonarius disagreed.\n\"The preservation age should definitely go up. It should have been lifted when the age pension eligibility age was.\"\nFollowing a reform by the former Labor government, the age pension eligibility age is set to rise from 65 years to 67 effective from 2024.\nMr Bonarius also backed a call by BT Financial Group boss Brad Cooper last week to link future rises in both the pension eligibility age and the super preservation age to changes in average national life expectancy.\n\"It doesn't matter how sensible and conservative retirees are with their money, if they are allowed to start drawing on their super at 55 years, most of them are going to run out of money if they live longer than expected,\" Mr Bonarius said.\nHe also said that any changes to make it more difficult for people to access their super should be flexible for those who can not work longer, and should be accompanied by more support for older workers.\nMichael Keating, a former head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet who was involved in the development of the superannuation system under the Hawke government, also backed the call.\n\"I do see a case for raising the preservation age,\" Mr Keating said.\n\"It is a complex issue though because the facts are that highly trained people in good jobs already tend to want to work longer anyway, but even in the lead-up to the retirement age the participation rate among people who never finished school is much lower.\n\"A national program focused on upskilling people in this cohort would make enormous policy sense and do a lot for them personally as well.\"\nNational Seniors chief executive Michael O'Neill agreed it is \"inevitable\" that the preservation age will have to rise.\n\"What will be important is grandfathering arrangements and giving people adequate notice of planned changes,\" Mr O'Neill said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-08-05T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:08:59.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
