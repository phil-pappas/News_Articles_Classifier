Price of diesel has also reduced from GHÈ¼2.98 pesewas to GHÈ¼2.89 pesewas. \nIn a random interview, the drivers told the GNA that a gallon of petrol, which contained about 4.50 litres, was sold at GHÈ¼15.00 at Goil, with the same litres going for more than that price at other OMCs. \nThey, however, mentioned that despite the drop in fuel prices, lorry fares remained unchanged. \nKofi Ansu, a taxi driver who plies the Sunyani-Abesim road, said drivers had resolved not to reduce the fares because a downward review would affect them due to the unstable nature of the fuel prices. \nInterestingly at all the taxi ranks, as well as the different unions under the Ghana Private Road and Transport Union (GPRTU) and the Progressive Transport Owners Association (PROTOA) at the main Bosoma lorry park, the drivers' main concern was about the stability of the price of the commodity. \nThey explained that that determined the sustainability and profitable growth of the commercial transport business. \nIronically the issue of environment regarding cleanliness, security and health and safety measures like availability of fire extinguishers and the attitude of the attendants at the fuel retail outlets was also the concern of some private vehicle owners interviewed by the GNA. \nBut that was not a priority of most of the commercial drivers so long as the cost of petrol/diesel and other fuel products remained 'manageable' to keep them in business. \nMeanwhile, attendants at some of filling stations in the Municipality indicated that daily sales of the products kept decreasing because of the unstable nature of the prices.
