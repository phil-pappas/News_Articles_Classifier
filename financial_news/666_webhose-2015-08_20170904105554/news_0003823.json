The bank said a conditional home loan could take as little as five minutes to approve. \nIt did not detail its plans for migrating business banking customers onto a new origination platform. NAB has been approached for more detail. \nThorburn told investors late last year the bank understood it had to provide business product origination. \n\"We understand that we have to retire legacy systems because that's actually going to take complexity and cost out of the system,\" he said at the time. \n\"But it's just a matter of doing some things that we know we can deliver, and as we get towards the end of that, then we will work out what the next bit is going to be.” \nNAB was last year forced to write down $106 million from its development of a mortgage origination lending platform for its UBank subsidiary. \nAn internal review had found the benefits of certain software were substantially less than anticipated, the costs of development were higher than expected, and there was uncertainty over whether some capabilities would even be deployed. The bank started to build the platform but did not complete it after deciding to deploy resources into its Oracle-based core banking overhaul instead. UBank was used as a testbed for NAB's shift to the Oracle core. It migrated the online-only subsidiary across first in 2012 . \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T03:51:33.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
