However, the projection period falls under the award period of the VII Central Pay Commission (VII CPC). In view of this, a higher than normative growth over the outlay of 2015-16 (B.E.) has been provided for 2016-17; whereas, a normative growth has been provided in 2017-18 (second year of projection period)..…It is pertinent to mention here that, award of VII CPC and its impact on Government finances poses a risk”.\nSimilarly, for pensions too, which includes both Defence and Civil pensions — higher than normative growth has been provided for the projection of outlay on Pensions during 2016-17.\nThe expenditure on central government employees’ salaries is projected to grow to Rs 116510 crore in FY17 from Rs 100619 crore budgeted for FY16.\nIn case of defence, the statement says: “Defence expenditure on Revenue account mainly comprises of salary expenditure of armed forces and their operational expenses. In view of the likely impact of the award of the VII CPC, higher than a normative growth over the base of Rs 1.52 lakh crore (B.E. 2015-16) has been provided during the first year (2016-17) of the projection period”.\nThe Pay Commission, therefore, has the opportunity now to come out with the recommendations according to the government’s pockets so that a higher fiscal deficit burden could be avoided, especially when there is a need to push public investment to boost growth.\n 27, 2015 10:27 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:38:51.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
