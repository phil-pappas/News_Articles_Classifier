They reason as follows:1. Diversification between stocks and bonds is a good thing.2. Diversification between U.S. and foreign markets is a good thing.3. Therefore, a foreign bond fund is a good thing.It is hard to argue with either of the first two propositions. The conclusion is debatable. Adding foreign stocks to your portfolio gives you some protection against U.S. economic decay, and adding bonds gives you some protection against a world-wide stock crash. What additional safety do you get by owning Japanese or German bonds—with their ridiculously low coupons?But if you must, for psychological reasons, complete your boxed set of U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, U.S. bonds and foreign bonds, then buy BNDX. It’s cheaper than other international bond funds.Or take a chance on bonds that yield more than the ones from Germany and Japan. Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond ( VWOB ) yields 4.6%, perhaps enough to compensate for the higher risk of default. Thankfully this portfolio does not include large positions with proven deadbeats like Argentina.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 BNDX Vanguard Total International Bond 3,455 0.19 314 RIGS RiverFront Strategic Income 488 0.22 395 VWOB Vanguard Emerging Markets Govt Bd 395 0.34 561 IGOV iShares International Treasury Bond 449 0.35 592 ISHG iShares 1-3 Year International Trs Bd 146 0.35 600 HYEM Market Vectors EM High Yield Bd 407 0.4 660 BWZ SPDR Barclays Short Term IntlTrs Bd 196 0.35 676 ITIP iShares Intnl Inflation-Linked Bond 62 0.4 681 IHY Market Vectors Intl Hi-Yld Bd 165 0.4 702 HYXU iShares Global ex USD High Yield Corp Bd 239 0.4 799 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
