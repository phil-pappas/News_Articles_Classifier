Louise Kennerly by Jenny Wiggins and Anthony Macdonald Asciano's board is expected to recommend a takeover bid worth around $9 billion from suitor Brookfield Infrastructure Partners when the ports and rail group reports its annual results today.\nAsciano's shares went into a trading halt on Monday morning ahead of an announcement early on Tuesday.\nA deal between Asciano and Bermuda-based Brookfield Infrastructure was expected to be signed overnight.\nBrookfield Infrastructure has had exclusive rights to do due diligence on Asciano's Pacific National rail assets and Patrick port assets after approaching the company's board in June with an indicative offer worth $9.05 in scrip and cash.\nBut Asciano's shares closed on Friday at $8.11, well below the indicative bid, indicating investors remain uncertain about the structure of the deal.\nInvestors remain wary of holding too much Brookfield Infrastructure scrip, even if the group lists in Australia, due to its complex structure and management fees . Institutional investors have said they will only accept a takeover bid if most of the offer is in cash.\nA sale of Asciano to Brookfield Infrastructure will change the dynamics of the Australian logistics industry, and will create a stronger competitor to rail group Aurizon.\n​Brookfield Infrastructure already owns Brookfield Rail, a 5100-kilometre freight rail network in Western Australia, as well as the Dalyrmple Bay coal terminal in north Queensland.\n Lance Hockridge, Aurizon's chief executive, said on Monday that he would not speculate on \"hypothetical scenarios\" ahead of any takeover deal but was \"not going to rule anything in or out.\"\nAnalysts said Aurizon could acquire some of Pacific National's rail assets if Brookfield succeeds in buying Asciano and sells off parts of the business.\nBrookfield Infrastructure owns 30 port terminals in North America and Europe, and believes it could transfer the intellectual property that Asciano has used in automating its Australian ports to North American ports.\nIt also believes it could negotiate global deals with shipping lines to use its ports throughout the world.​", "external_links": ["http://www.aspecthuntley.com.au/docserver/01650994.pdf?fileid=01650994&datedir=20150817&edt=MjAxNS0wOC0xNyswOTo1Nzo0OSsxNDQwMCs2MjM4NytGYWlyZmF4IDEgREFQK3JlZGlyZWN0Ky9pbWFnZXNpZ25hbC9lcnJvcnBhZ2VzL1BERlRpbWVvdXQuaHRtbCsvaW1hZ2VzaWduYWwvZXJyb3JwYWdlcy9wZGZkZWxheWVkLmpzcA=="], "published": "2015-08-17T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:10:25.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
