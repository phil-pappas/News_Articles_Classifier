Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has hinted at a downgrade in growth forecasts at the mid-year economic update, saying the previous May growth forecast reflected \"conditions at the time\".\nMr Cormann said that while the government's May budget GDP growth forecast was within the Reserve Bank's new range - down to 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent from 2.75 per cent to 3.75 per cent - he acknowledged the bank's revised forecast was weaker.\nThe Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December will update the economic and fiscal outlook from the previous budget.\n\"In regards to the Reserve Bank's economic growth forecast, it is true that they have weakened slightly. However our budget growth forecast remains within the range of what is forecast by the Reserve Bank,\" he said.\nThe government's May budget predicted growth of 2.75 per cent next year, moving up to 3.25 per cent in 2017 and 3.5 per cent thereafter.\nBack then, Treasurer Joe Hockey rejected suggestions these were overly optimistic.\nOn Monday, Mr Cormann said the budget growth forecast reflected \"conditions at the time\".\n\"Obviously our growth forecast reflects conditions at the time of the budget,\" saying it was based on best avaliable information at the time.\n 'No reason' expense probe should be secret Mr Cormann also said he saw \"no particular reason\" why the Finance Department's investigation into former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop's alleged misuse of expenses should be kept confidential.\nSo far, when asked about the ongoing probe, the department have said they do not comment on individual members' entitlements.\nMr Cormann said however that once the investigation is complete, the decision would be up to his department's secretary, Jane Halton.\n\"That will be entirely a matter for the secretary of the Department of Finance,\" he said.\nHe said there has been \"no political interference\" in the matter.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-10T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:05:02.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
