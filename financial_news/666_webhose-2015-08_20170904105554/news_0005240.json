The shock of a swift decline in oil prices this time last year has subsided, and lower prices now seem baked into the thinking of investors and analysts as a potential \"new normal\" for the sector. \nBut what about the American worker? \nFor years, we have been reading and hearing about major growth in oil and natural gas, with new mining techniques unlocking a golden age for energy and the accompanying job market for workers willing to go to places like North Dakota and Wyoming. More Headlines Should You Buy Tesla on Uber Rumor? \nEnter lower prices and the accompanying job cuts for not just the start-up prospectors, but the super-major oil companies, which dominate the industry. Oil and gas extraction lost 8,200 jobs last year, or 4% of that workforce, when payrolls overall gained almost 1.5% over the same period, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nJobs that have been cut, however, can be brought back. What may be more telling is how the major oil companies are adjusting for this new normal for the long-term as the fall in prices has led to a sharp drop in earnings as well. \nAccording to data from job search engine Indeed, where I am chief economist, the six major oil companies have reduced their job postings globally as a share of total offerings by as much as over half since July of 2014. \nWhile there has been an uptick in posting share as the price has steadied, it seems unlikely this figure will return to heights when prices were hovering near $100 a barrel. \nThis has major implications for the global workforce of course, but is a shift in particular for the American worker, who for years has been told that energy was a booming industry offering relatively high-pay and a solid future. The new reality is that this sector may have peaked with the higher prices last year, and that the trend has normalized to a smaller part of the U.S. economy. \nLuckily, there is a silver lining for the adaptable. Job opportunities are flattening out in energy just as the economic recovery is creating them in other areas. According to Indeed's industry trends, we're seeing growth across all sectors we track, from transportation to financial services, with no signs of dissipating through the rest of this year. \nFurthermore, we expect ongoing growth in the related area of renewable energy, with continued investment and focus in coming years. In recent analysis from Indeed, we found job postings for the U.S. solar industry up 43% from 2013 to 2014 . \nThe oil industry, of course, will continue to work and lobby for a return to growth. Last week, right on the heels of the six-year low, it was reported that the U.S. government would ease a ban going back to the 1970s oil crisis on crude exports to Mexico. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:45:24.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
