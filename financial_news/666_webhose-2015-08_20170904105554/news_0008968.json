However, we have received equipments worth $32 million and we are expecting the remaining $6 million to arrive by October this year. \"We have already set up eight strategic centres in each province from where the targeted beneficiaries will access the implements,\" he said. \nVP Mnangagwa said the farming implements will come a long way in enhancing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security at household level as adopted in the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim-Asset). He said some of the implements have been distributed. \nVP Mnangagwa said Government had struck a deal with Egypt which would see the country supplying cotton, wheat and maize to the North African country through contract farming.

Egypt will supply all the resources, implements and inputs needed for the production of the crops and we will provide land. We will then sell them the produce at our own price,\" he said.

This was the agreement that we made in the first place. We hope that will be followed in the ongoing farm downsizing exercise,\" he said.
