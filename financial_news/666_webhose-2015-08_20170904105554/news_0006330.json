Near-term support is at 1.0888, the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion, with a break below that exposing the 1.0814-18 area (50% level, May 27 low). Alternatively, a push above the 23.6% Fib at 1.0980 clears the way for a test of the 14.6% expansion at 1. 1036. Prices are wedged too closely between near-term support and resistance levels to justify taking a trade in line with our long-term outlook from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will continue to stand aside until a more attractive opportunity presents itself.
