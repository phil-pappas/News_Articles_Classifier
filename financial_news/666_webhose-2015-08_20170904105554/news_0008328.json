It noted that a weaker euro and Brazilian real harmed its profit.\nRental income grew 23 percent to 1.51 billion shekels, while net operating income rose 25 percent, helped by the consolidation of its Atrium European Real Estate subsidiary.\nGazit-Globe said it would pay a dividend of 0.46 shekel a share for the second quarter.\nGazit-Globe operates in the United States through Equity One and in Canada through First Capital Reality Inc .
