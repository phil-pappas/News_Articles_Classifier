The changeover would also cut private-sector compliance costs in half, it claimed, while the \"most significant savings would be for small and medium-sized businesses\". \nForty-five thousand surveys are currently used each month to gather information on companies that represent around 55pc of the total economy. Using turnover data from VAT receipts filed by eligible businesses should increase that coverage, with around 1.75m companies required to file VAT returns each month. \nBusinesses selected for the ONS' electronic data collection programme could be completing returns online as early as spring 2017, the ONS said, which would lead to \"significant savings\". \nUse of the tax numbers could also mean that economic data is compiled in a more timely and complete fashion. \nIn a feasibility study on changing its processes (PDF) , the ONS said that improving the timeliness of regional data in particular would be one large potential advantage, allowing policymakers to more quickly assess which parts of the UK are performing better and worse. \nNick Vaughan, director of national accounts and economic statistics at the ONS, said: \"These plans are part of a wider ONS agenda to develop new and better sources of data and keep producing the highest quality statistics possible.\" \nWork on developing the new approach began in 2012, when the ONS began a review of the data sources it uses. \nVAT data is supplied under the VAT Act 1994, which allows the ONS to access the figures on the basis of \"disclosure of information for statistical purposes (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) \".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T13:56:43.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
