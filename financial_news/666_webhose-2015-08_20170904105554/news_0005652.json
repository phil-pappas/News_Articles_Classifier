It was the first automotive manufacturing facility in the world to be a Gold Certified Leader in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). \nSince starting production, Lansing Delta Township has manufactured the Saturn Outlook, Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, Acadia Denali and Buick Enclave. A white Outlook was the first vehicle produced on May 24, 2006. \nThe plant currently employs approximately 3,200 employees on three shifts. \nGM has announced more than $580 million in investments for Lansing Delta Township facility over the last two years, including $63 million in 2014 to expand the plant by nearly 263,000 square feet and $520 million earlier this year for tooling and equipment associated with future new vehicle programs. \n\"Producing the 2 millionth vehicle would not be possible without the great people we have here,\" said UAW Local 602 President Bill Reed. \nWhile most vehicles follow somewhat of a bell curve for sales during their lifecycle, the Enclave has continued an upward trajectory after more than seven years. Minor dips in 2009 and 2012 reflected overall trends in the recovering auto industry, but record-setting 2014 sales represented a 39-percent increase over the Enclave's first full year of production. As of June 2015, more than 500,000 Enclave models had been sold worldwide. \n\"The Enclave led Buick's product renaissance, redefining what consumers should expect from a full-size luxury crossover,\" said Duncan Aldred, vice president of Buick. \"It is fitting that an Enclave is the 2 millionth vehicle to roll off the line in Lansing, demonstrating continued consumer demand.\" \nThis milestone for Lansing Delta Township is part of GM's celebration of 500 million vehicles built globally, more than any other automaker. \nAbout General Motors Co, General Motors Co.
