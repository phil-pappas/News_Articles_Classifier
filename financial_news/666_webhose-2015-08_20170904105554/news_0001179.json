The almost 40% increase in battery life from the original model means that most car journeys won't require any gas at all. Chevrolet estimates that around 90% of car trips will be completed using only the battery charge, alleviating much of consumers' \"range anxiety,\" or fear about the range of a battery. \nGeneral Motors ( GM - Get Report ) announced that Chevrolet's 2016 Volt will hit the market this fall with a price tag of $33,995 and that drivers will be entitled to a federal tax credit. Outside California, the price could drop to $26,495 when government incentives are applied. \nThe outgoing Volt model could travel only 38 miles on the electric charge, and its successor is also over $1,000 cheaper, as Chevrolet works to convert customers to the electric-hybrid models. \nMust Read: 5 Big Dividend Stocks Billionaire John Paulson Loves \nChevrolet claims that the 2016 Volt will save customers about $5,500 in fuel costs over a five-year period. The car takes 4.5 hours to recharge, and fuel efficiency has also been improved when the engine kicks in after the first 53 miles. \nGM reported weak numbers for the previous model of the Volt, selling only 18,805 vehicles in the U.S. last year. With oil prices remaining low, many customers have been opting for larger sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
