It has a 50 per cent stake in streaming service Stan, as well as interests in Sky News Australia, Daily Mail Australia and ASX-listed Yellow Brick Road.\nNine recently splurged $925 million on a five season deal with the NRL, which was a 105 per cent increase on the previous agreement.\nIn April the company agreed to sell its Nine Live division, which included the Ticketek business, for an enterprise value of $640 million. The deal was completed on July 31.\nShares in Nine Entertainment plunged in June after the media group slashed its full-year earnings guidance, sparking an ASIC investigation. The company said it expected group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to be in the range of $285 million to $290 million, before specific items and including Nine Live.\n“In what has been a difficult free-to-air advertising market, our June quarter share performance was short of our expectations,” Mr Gyngell said.\nBut Nine’s CEO said its ratings performance has improved markedly since the beginning of July, which was expected to underpin revenue share over the second half of the year.\n\"We are optimistic about the prospects for Nine as we continue the ongoing integration of our television and digital businesses, focused on monetising the distribution of our premium video content in an evolving world.”\nThe group said its full-year share of the ratings will be \"marginally down\" on the 2015 financial year given the intensely competitive market, coupled with the timing of certain major events, while television programming costs are expected to increase by 2 per cent during the period.\nNine will pay a final fully franked dividend of 5c on October 19, bringing the year's total distribution to 9.2c.\nShares in Nine were up 2.8 per cent mid afternoon at $1.49.\nThe Australian\nOriginally published as Nine logs $598m full-year loss ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/nine-entertainment-logs-598-million-full-year-loss-tips-slide-in-ratings-share/story-e6frfm1i-1227500874765?sv=a890c48382bf1ffc17dc4099937316ea", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/nine-entertainment-logs-598-million-full-year-loss-tips-slide-in-ratings-share/story-fni0dcne-1227500874765", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/nine-entertainment-logs-598-million-full-year-loss-tips-slide-in-ratings-share/story-e6frfm1i-1227500874765?sv=a890c48382bf1ffc17dc4099937316ea&title=Nine+logs+%24598m+full-year+loss", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/nine-entertainment-logs-598-million-full-year-loss-tips-slide-in-ratings-share/story-e6frfm1i-1227500874765?sv=a890c48382bf1ffc17dc4099937316ea&h=Nine+logs+%24598m+full-year+loss", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/nine-entertainment-logs-598-million-full-year-loss-tips-slide-in-ratings-share/story-e6frfm1i-1227500874765?sv=a890c48382bf1ffc17dc4099937316ea&title=Nine+logs+%24598m+full-year+loss", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/nine-entertainment-logs-598-million-full-year-loss-tips-slide-in-ratings-share/story-e6frfm1i-1227500874765?sv=a890c48382bf1ffc17dc4099937316ea", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Nine+logs+%24598m+full-year+loss&c=NINE+Entertainment+says+its+full-year+ratings+share%26nbsp%3Bis+likely+to+fall+after+it+posted+a+net+loss+of+nearly+%24600+million+following+a+string+of+writedowns.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/nine-entertainment-logs-598-million-full-year-loss-tips-slide-in-ratings-share/story-e6frfm1i-1227500874765?sv=a890c48382bf1ffc17dc4099937316ea"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T09:55:31.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
