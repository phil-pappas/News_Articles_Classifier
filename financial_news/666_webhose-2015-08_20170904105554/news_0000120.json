This could mean that the Central Bank's tools are working,\" Mr Bodo said. \nCommercial banks in Kenya quoted the shilling at 101.13 units to the dollar at the close of trade last week, a weaker position from the post-US President Barack Obama visit, during which the shilling managed to touch the 100-unit mark. \nThe end-month dollar demand from energy sector importers, who are seeking foreign currency to pay their import bills, saw the shilling weaken further but this has eased even as the Central Bank spent close to $3 million last week on a mopping up exercise. \nThe gain, however, is only in Kenya with the other regional currencies experiencing a slump throughout the year due to an increased import bill, weak exports and other geopolitical factors. \nTanzania's shilling has shed 21.2 per cent with Uganda's losing 20.6 per cent. The shilling is trading at close to 3-1/2 year lows and down 11.5 per cent against the dollar this year, although the central bank has hiked rates 3 percentage points since June. \nLast month, Tanzania hinted at introduction of monetary policies as a tool to save the weakening shilling. The country is the only one in the region that has been depending on fiscal policy as an intervention method to cushion its currency. Tanzania has seen its shilling struggle further during the second quarter of 2015, moving from 1,788 units to 2,107 units per dollar as at the start of this month. \nThe rising import bill has seen regional currencies lose their competitive edge against the dollar even as the exports earnings remain weak. All the East Africa nations have seen their import bill rise, dimming hopes of bridging the deficit gap. \nFor instance, Kenya's import bill has increased to $8.6 billion dollars this year on account of increased inflows of industrial supplies and petroleum products compared with $7.9 billion over the same period last year. \nThe Ugandan shilling is currently trading at 3,495/3,505 due to high demand by private companies paying for clients' imports. Uganda has raised its base lending rate from 12 per cent to 14.5 per cent in the last four months to tighten liquidity in the market. \nFaisal Bukenya, head of market making at Barclays Bank, said that the dollar inflow into the market is low with the little getting in being snapped up by dealers, explaining the pressure. \n\"The demand for the dollar is at a high amid an increased local currency liquidity. This is keeping up the pressure on the local unit as everyone is out to get the dollar,\" Mr Bukenya said.
