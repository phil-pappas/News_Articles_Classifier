Since last price change, there has been a decrease in international prices of both petrol and diesel. INR-USD exchange rate has, however, depreciated during this period.\n“Combined impact of both these factors warrants a downward revision in prices, the impact of which is being passed on to the consumers with this price decrease,” the statement said.\nState-owned fuel retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) — revise petrol and diesel prices on 1st and 16th of every month based on average imported cost and rupee-dollar exchange rate in the previous fortnight.\n“The movement of prices in international oil market and Rupee-USD exchange rate shall continue to be monitored closely and developing trends of the market will be reflected in future price changes,” the statement added.\nFirst Published on July 31, 2015 10:14 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T15:46:30.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
