New Zealand stocks jumped 1.2 percent in the first hour of trading, and copper futures rallied after exchange-traded funds tracking mainland Chinese stocks climbed in New York.\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose for the first time in seven days, pausing a slump that sent it to a 10-month low as the U.S. succumbed to the global rout. Some of the biggest names, from Apple Inc. to Merck & Co., drove the rebound, which followed a volatile day in equity markets from China to Europe. Dovish words from the U.S. central bank aided the rally, with Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William C. Dudley casting doubt over a September interest-rate increase in an unscheduled address.\n“Equity markets are fighting back but are not yet that far off their lows,” Sharon Zollner, a senior economist in Auckland at ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd., said in an e-mail to clients. “Volatility is now markedly higher and is likely to stay that way over coming months as nervous traders react, and overreact, to news, particularly relating to the Fed and to China.”\nYen Damped Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.3 percent in Chicago, rising to 18,770 after soaring 5.4 percent in the previous session. Contracts traded in Japan gained 0.1 percent to 18,460 by 3 a.m. in Osaka, with the yen down 0.3 percent to 120.28 per dollar in a third day of losses. The currency, which typically moves at odds with Japanese equities, reached a seven-month high at the peak of the market rout.\nThe S&P 500 ended Wednesday up 3.9 percent, its steepest increase since November 2011, with technology stocks and health care shares driving the bounce back. Futures on the gauge added 0.1 percent by 8 a.m. in Tokyo, with contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.2 percent.\nWhile greeted with cautious optimism among investors, the rebound came amid heightened volatility around the world. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the VIX, fell for a second day on Wednesday, yet remains double the level of a week ago after its record six-day surge.\nWith the U.S. rebound only solidified in the last few hours of trade, futures on indexes elsewhere in Asia were mixed, amid concern over gyrations in Chinese markets. Contracts on Hong Kong gauges were down at least 0.4 percent, while futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index and the Kospi measure in Seoul climbed more than 0.5 percent in recent trading.\nIn Perspective Concern that Chinese policy makers may fail to prevent a hard landing in the world’s second-largest economy has convulsed global markets. Stocks worldwide have slumped more than 8 percent since China’s surprise devaluation of the yuan on Aug. 11, with prospects of the first interest-rate increase in the U.S. in almost a decade also injecting an element of uncertainty.\nTraders of Chinese stocks were whipsawed Wednesday as the central bank’s interest-rate and reserve ratio cuts failed to soothe anxieties over the faltering economy. The Shanghai Composite Index ended the day down 1.3 percent after surging as much as 4.3 percent earlier in the session. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong, also fell, declining 0.9 percent.\nYet the swings pale in comparison to past market ructions. China has the world’s most volatile stocks right now after Greece, but the fluctuations are 30 percent lower than the average of six financial market crashes, including the ones in 1929 in the U.S., Japan in the early 1990s and Thailand in 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe greenback shrugged off Dudley’s dovish comments on rates, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index gaining the most since the start of July after a report showed July orders for capital goods in the U.S. climbed by the most in more than a year. The data fueled losses in Treasuries, with 10-year yields jumping 10 basis points to a one-week high of 2.18 percent. The strong goods orders were viewed as a sign corporate spending was finding its footing prior to the recent market turmoil.\nCommodity Moves Copper futures traded on the Comex started Thursday up 0.7 percent to $2.2510 a pound, after sliding 2.9 percent in the previous session to drive the Bloomberg Commodity Index back to a 16-year low. Copper moves are closely linked to sentiment about China given the country is the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals.\nU.S. crude oil continued to seesaw, rising for the second day this week. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 1.3 percent to $39.11 a barrel after sinking 1.8 percent Wednesday on an increase in American fuel stockpiles.\nGold was little changed early Thursday, trading at $1,123.57 an ounce after tumbling more than 3 percent the past three days.\n“It’s definitely a positive to see markets move higher,” said Tom Manning, chief investment officer of Boston Private Wealth, which oversees about $9 billion in assets. “I don’t know that we found the bottom. I’m not convinced we don’t have more negative days to follow. We’re not likely to go from extreme volatility to extreme calm overnight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:33:52.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
