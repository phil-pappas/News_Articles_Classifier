Time will tell whether this takes a further toll on growth across the sector.\" \nEEF said the most directly exposed manufacturing sectors were road vehicles, which account for 16 percent of exports to China, followed by metal working machinery and leather goods. \nThe survey of 284 companies also showed just over a fifth of manufacturers were still worried about a re-escalation of Greece's crisis. \nManufacturing has been one of the weak spots of Britain's strong economic recovery this year. Official figures last week showed manufacturing output slipped 0.3 percent in the second quarter as the economy overall expanded 0.7 percent.
