And that's just the hardware. The iPhone 6 runs on the latest iOS 8 to offer exclusive features, such as Apple Pay, TouchID and more. Apple's iOS 9 is slated to come later in the fall. \nPricing for the iPhone 6 starts at $199 for the 16GB model with a carrier contract and rises to $299 for a 64GB model and up to $399 for a 128GB handset. Prices without a carrier contract begin at $649.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T15:25:23.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
