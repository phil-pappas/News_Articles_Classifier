Will Russell Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Julie-anne Sprague Rio Tinto iron ore managing director Andrew Harding does not really like taking calls at his desk on the 23rd floor of Perth's Central Park office tower.\nThe man overseeing the lion's share of the miner's $US1 billion ($1.3 billion) cost-cutting drive might be afforded glimpses of the glistening Swan River, but it means little to his Garmin Vivoactive​ fitness band.\nMr Harding is an obsessive step tracker, so he'll ditch the desk and take calls on the mobile while strolling down St Georges Terrace.\nHe's not alone in changing his workday behaviour.\nMacquarie's Mark Barnaba skips sitting in airline lounges for a walk around the airport. Bohdan Warchomij McKinsey Australia & New Zealand managing partner John Lydon​ has ditched coffee meetings for a walking meeting.\nThe Fitbit​ fanatic aims to rack up five million steps a year – requiring about 14,245 steps a day (when accounting for a fortnight he agrees to give himself off).\n\"I would have met people for coffee [pre Fitbit],\" Mr Lydon said.\n\"Now I say, let's go for a walk. I'm familiar with most locations in most capital cities now.\"\n Transfield Services chairwoman Diane Smith-Gander says her dog often gets an extra walk if she is close to her step goal. Philip Gostelow Willing walkers Mr Lydon is increasingly finding willing walkers.\nIT research group Gartner predicts 68.1 million wearable electronic fitness devices will be sold globally this year, generating $US9.1 billion in revenue. Another 91.3 million are expected to be sold in 2016 to generate $US11.6 billion.\nMacquarie Group WA chairman Mark Barnaba​, who walks to most meetings, ditches airline lounges to walk around the airport. After all, he's got a 10,000 daily step goal to meet.\nGrainCorp chief executive Mark Palmquist says Fitbit trackers help reduce executive stress. \"I will just go for a long walk around the airport,\" Mr Barnaba said.\nMr Lydon is also an airport pacer. \"I'll be the last one on the plane,\" he said.\nMr Harding said he had more doubled his average daily steps (from about 7500 to 15,700) since getting his first tracking device two years ago.\nIt has required a daily walk as early as 5am and walking a lot more during the day – especially when he's on the phone.\nMcKinsey Australia chief John Lydon swaps meetings over coffee for a walk to help him achieve his daily step goal. Louise Kennerley \"I used to train for marathons and I would do three runs of maybe 30 minutes or 45 minute each week but what I didn't appreciate was how much I didn't move on the days I didn't run,\" Mr Harding said.\nStruggling \"I was struggling to get 7000 steps [a day].\"\nMr Harding said the lifestyle change had changed his daily behaviour that ultimately made him better at his job.\n\"You are outside, you get to reflect and ponder and it's good for weight management,\" Mr Harding said.\n\"It's good for stress management. It motivates you to be healthy.\"\nGrainCorp chief executive Mark Palmquist​ said his Fitbit kept him honest.\n\"If I have a low step day, it gets me off my seat to put a couple more steps on,\" Mr Palmquist said.\n\"What I find is that I go grudgingly but I come back after a walk and I feel better. It relieves stress.\"\nThe benefits to GrainCorp are broader, he said.\nMr Palmquist said he and his employees often met up 15 minutes to 20 minutes before an external meeting and walked to the meeting together.\nReaping the rewards \"It's beneficial. You get set up for what you want to accomplish. You have an agenda but you are more organised in your thought processes and what are the real issues,\" he said.\nAt McKinsey, employees can sign up to teams that compete internally for the highest number of steps. The winning team wins tickets to the AFL grand final.\n\"It joins up people from different departments and builds camaraderie across the organisation,' Mr Lydon said.\nMr Lydon regularly tops the leader board of his Fitbit friend, Transfield Services chairman Diane Smith-Gander.\nShe's frustrated things such as Pilates and cycling do not add to her daily step count, which averages around 7500 steps.\nBut she wears her Fitbit Force every day, opting to leave her expensive Swiss Ebel watch at home.\n\"If I'm close to 10,000 steps [at the end of the day] the dog gets an extra walk,\" Ms Smith-Gander admits.\nSleep before steps \"I've certainly seen a lot more of Martin Place after dark. But I always put sleep over steps.\"\nMr Harding recently walked about a kilometre before realising he had left his Garmin on its charger at home. He walked back, put it on, and re-did the walk.\nHe is also known to pace around his house late at night.\n\"Quite often I walk back and forward from front door to back door through the sitting room, past the TV, ignoring the stares of appreciation from my wife and three daughters,\" Mr Harding jokes.\nMr Palmquist admits to feeling disappointed when he's about to walk out the door and realises his Fitbit battery is about to go flat.\n\"It is disappointing because I want to record it [the steps] but I haven't cancelled anything yet because I can't track it.\"", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/stepping_execs_hype/index.html", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SpragueJA", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117338550731714891115/posts"], "published": "2015-08-12T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:07:48.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
