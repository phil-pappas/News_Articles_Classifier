In this part, we’ll explore the 2Q15 financial performance of Ford’s North America operations. \nWhile Ford gained market share in the global markets, its market share in North America came down in 2Q15. Lower market share in North America was largely due to fewer sales of the F-150. Record earnings \nFord’s North American operations posted pre-tax profits of ~$2.6 billion in 2Q15, as you can see in the chart above. This is the highest-ever profit that Ford has posted in North America. The North American automobile industry has shown strength for the last several quarters. Tesla (TSLA) gets most of its revenues from North America. \nFord’s North American operations have been profitable since 2010. Strong performance in North America has helped Ford weather challenges in other markets, including South America and Europe. We’ll discuss Ford’s performance in Europe in the next parts of this series. \nGeneral Motors’ (GM) North American operations also posted a record adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $2.8 billion in 2Q15 at a margin of 10.5%. A higher market share of trucks and crossovers boosted GM’s 2Q15 profit margins. More to come for Ford? \nFord expects its performance in North America to further improve in the second half of 2015. The F-150, which has historically been a key driver of Ford’s profits, didn’t contribute much to its 2Q15 profits. According to Ford, the company ramped up production levels for the F-150 towards the end of the quarter. This should translate into higher sales in the coming quarters. \nCurrently, Ford forms 2.49% of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) and 0.55% of the iShares Russel 1000 Value ETF (IWD). \nIn the next part of this series, we’ll talk about the 2Q15 performance of Ford’s South America operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:43:57.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
