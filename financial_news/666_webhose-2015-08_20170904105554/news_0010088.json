MTZ hit a 52-week low of $14.66 before settling a notch higher at $14.97 on Aug 25. Shares of this leading infrastructure construction company have been caught in a downward spiral since it reported disappointing second-quarter results on Aug 17. \nMasTec’s shares have delivered a negative year-to-date return of 35.07%. The company also underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 24.54%. \nWhat Led to the Drop? \nMasTec’s second-quarter adjusted earnings of 8 cents per share slumped from 39 cents earned in the prior-year quarter due to adverse impact of rain and flooding across multiple segments as well as significant disruptions within the Electrical Transmission segment. \nDrop in commodity prices, devaluation of the Canadian dollar, softness in wireless spending along with adverse weather, late project starts in oil and gas and a struggling wind farm project in Canada, led to the disappointing first half. MasTec lowered its 2015 guidance and now expects revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion and earnings per share between 73 cents and 83 cents. \nIn addition to a higher tax rate, the guidance assumes that revenue in the second half of 2015 will decrease in the mid double-digit range compared with the prior-year levels owing to lower Canadian Oil & Gas revenues. This is the result of a decrease in demand, combined with the impact of adverse foreign exchange rates, as well as expected revenue declines during the second half of 2015 in Electric Transmission and Wireless services from the comparable period last year. \nThe company anticipates wireless segment revenues to remain flat or slightly decline from the first half of 2015. The Electrical Transmissions segment’s performance during the second half of 2015 will continue to show weakness when compared to the same period last year. However, the segment is working on replenishing its backlog and normalizing its operations. \nMasTec incurred $7.5 million of Audit Committee investigation-related costs in the second quarter, for a cumulative total of $10.5 million on a year-to-date basis. MasTec expects to incur an additional $5 million during the balance of 2015, with the great majority of this cost expected in the third quarter. \nThese bearish factors have triggered a downward tendency in this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stocks estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate plunged 52% to 66 cents per share and 8% to $1.56 per share for 2015 and 2016, respectively. \nStocks to Consider \nSome better-ranked stocks in the construction sector are Dycom Industries Inc. DY, Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. CBI and EMCOR Group Inc. EME. While Dycom sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Chicago Bridge and EMCOR Group carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
