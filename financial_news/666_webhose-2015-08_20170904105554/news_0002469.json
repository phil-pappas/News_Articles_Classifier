One should plan for the future especially if precautionary actions take time to be effective. But it is also important to monitor last-minute changes in the weather forecast or in the economic outlook and adjust your plans accordingly. \nWe all know the enjoyment of that first day on holiday. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is tempting to stay outside all day whether you prefer to doze, read a good book, or go for a swim or long run. But linger too long in the sun and your skin may take on a slightly pink glow. \nWhile you probably won’t want to move from your comfortable spot in the sun, if you ignore the warning signs, you may have a painful sunburn that evening. Yes you can treat the sunburn, but it might spoil the rest of your holiday. Better to take preventive action. \nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) ) at the Bank of England must also consider the current outlook and plan for the future. When the economy is doing well and inflation is low, it is tempting to enjoy the good news. And today the UK economy has plenty of good news. GDP growth was 0.7pc in the second quarter around its long-run average before the financial crisis. \nIt has been at this rate or higher for five of the last six quarters and is expected to remain around here for at least the next year. The UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 in 2014, and is expected to be one of the two fastest growing economies in 2015 (along with the US). \nDespite a moderate fall in last week’s numbers, wage growth has recently been particularly sunny. Over the last three months, the growth in average weekly earnings (excluding bonuses) in the private sector was 3.3pc . When accounting for the low rate of inflation, real spending power has increased at its fastest pace over the last months than has occurred since 2007. \nThe underlying rate of wage growth may be even stronger, as more new hires have been in lower paying sectors and for workers with less experience and qualifications groups that have had the greatest challenge finding employment. \nBank of England estimates suggest this “composition effect” may have caused underlying wage momentum to be understated by up to 1pc recently. These effects could also be reducing measured productivity growth. \nTuesday's consumer prices inflation (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) release is likely to confirm that inflation has continued to hover around zero. With such low inflation today, it is understandable to want to avoid pre-emptively ending this holiday. A solid recovery is finally here. Increasing interest rates prematurely could moderate companies’ willingness to invest and consumers’ willingness to spend. \nBut unfortunately monetary policy works with lags much longer than a sunburn affects your skin. An increase in interest rates is generally believed to take somewhere from one to two years to have its maximum impact. Maintaining interest rates at the current low levels during an expansion risks creating distortions. \nTherefore, interest rates will need to be increased well before inflation hits our 2pc target. Waiting too long would risk undermining the recovery especially if interest rates then need to be increased faster than the gradual path which we expect. \nBut with inflation starting from about zero today, there is no need to act before we are confident that inflation is heading back toward 2pc within about two years as expected. \nSterling’s continued appreciation, plus the most recent falls in energy and commodity prices, will keep inflation low for longer. The changes China made last week in its exchange rate regime may also reduce some international prices over the next few months. \nAll of these factors give us a bit more time before inflationary pressures build in the UK. But an extended period of low headline inflation may also obscure growth in underlying cost pressures a haze which can burn off quickly. \nUnfortunately it is not possible to predict the exact date when it will be appropriate to raise interest rates. The appropriate time will depend critically on when there is more evidence that inflation is heading towards target as forecast. \nSome key indicators that I’ll be watching are domestically generated inflation, core inflation, and the pass-through from sterling’s recent appreciation to prices. \nMeasures of core inflation and domestically generated inflation are largely below pre-crisis averages and not yet at levels generally consistent with 2pc inflation. \nBut measures of domestically generated inflation have been stable over the last 18 months despite very low headline inflation and are showing signs of increasing. \nMuch of the weakness in core inflation can be explained by low energy prices and sterling’s strength, suggesting that core inflation should begin to recover from current low levels as last year’s sharp fall in energy prices rolls off. \nRisks from sterling’s recent movements are the hardest to evaluate — but critical. Sterling’s appreciation from early 2013 to mid-2014 did not reduce import prices by as much as has historically occurred, thereby causing less drag to inflation. If this lower degree of pass-through continues, or any pass-through occurs faster than in the past, inflation could recover faster than we forecast. \nEnjoy the sunshine and low inflation this holiday season. But remember that neither are likely to persist. Stay vigilant against sunburn. I and my colleagues on the MPC will also remain vigilant to changes in the economy in order to support our solid recovery. \nJust as with all holidays, the current break in inflation will pass quickly. \nProfessor Forbes has been a member of the Monetary Policy Committee since July 2014.
