Meanwhile, commodities fall on weak data from China. \nAlmost £4.4m was wiped off the value of Independent Oil & Gas on Monday morning after an internationally listed backer unexpectedly pulled out of a planned investment due to falling oil prices. \nThe North Sea-focussed firm is poised for its biggest one-day fall in its two years as an Aim-listed company, as shares plunged by more than 50pc in early morning trade. \nDespite signing a letter of intent on May 27 for a $10m equity investment at 23.79p, the unnamed backer, with a multi-billion dollar market capitalisation, dramatically left the Aim-listed company in the lurch amid fears a second dip in crude prices is underway. \n“The decision from our potential investor is unexpected based on the progress made to date and clearly disappointing. It is a decision based on external factors and not a reflection on our team and assets,” Mark Routh, chief executive, said. \nIndependent Oil & Gas had advised shareholders that it was working on a transaction, and management had said it was confident the deal would conclude shortly. \nThe company said its short-term priorities were now to secure funding for the Skipper (BSE: SKIPPER.BO - news ) commitment well, located in the northern North Sea; to secure a licence extension for the project; and to buy out its partner in the licence, Alpha Petroleum. \nThe stock was changing hands at 5.4p, down 54.2pc, before 11am on Monday morning. \n* Oil declines a fourth day as US drillers add rigs to fields Meanwhile, commodity stocks dominated the FTSE 100 fallers as weak data from China and a broker downgrade weighed heavily on the industry. \nAfter dominating the FTSE favourites on Friday, mining stocks tumbled in morning trade as Chinese data showed exports slumped by a mammoth 8.3pc year-on-year in July and imports contracted by 8.1pc. \nWith growing fears over China’s ailing economy, Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets noted markets had initially been called higher on hopes that \"the negative China data dump\" would mean more stimulus from Beijing. However, this was short-lived and Mr van Dulken questioned whether concerns over the Chinese economy \"are becoming too much to deal with”. * Chinese warning lights flash as tumbling factory gate prices pave way for more stimulus Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) also slashed its commodity price forecast due to the ”increasing problems in China”. Analysts said the metal price forecasts issued at the start of the year \"were not bearish enough\". \nHunter Hillcoat, of Investec, said “there are clear signs that the market is attempting to establish appropriate levels in the 'new normal' environment”. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) suffered a double downgrade, as the stock was lowered from a “buy” to “sell” rating, while the three majors, Rio Tinto , BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) maintained a “hold” rating. \nMr Hillcoat said “mining shares appear set for a fifth straight year of underperformance relative to wider equity markets”. This year mining stocks have underperformed on Britain’s benchmark index by an average of 25pc. \nGlencore is trading at 202.5p, down 0.3pc, while Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) is off by 0.6pc, BHP Billiton is 1.6pc lower and Anglo American has fallen 1.8pc. \n* Investors should stick with emerging markets despite turmoil in Shanghai", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:41:00.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
