Arsineh Houspian by Duncan Hughes There has been a six-fold increase in self-employed people buying business properties for their self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs), say sales agents specialising in commercial investment properties.\nThe traditional retirement nest-egg strategy of lawyers, dentists and doctors is spreading to those involved in information technology services, education and recruitment agencies, the agents claim.\n\"Demand is unprecedented,\" says Tom Tuxworth, senior manager for CBRE, about growth in the past five years. \"I'm getting more and more inquiries from small and medium business owners who are hearing about the tax strategies and super savings.\"\nSMSF specialists, such as Craig Day, executive manager for Colonial First State, say SMSFs have traditionally been popular with self-employed people who like to be in control. \"They want to run their own business, they want to run their super,\" Day says.\nResponsibilities But Debby Blakey, chief executive of HESTA, an industry fund with about $33 billion under management, encourages those saving for retirement to consider their options, including industry funds that include low-cost life insurance.\nBlakey says: \"If you take responsibility for your own business, then it can be a lot of extra work to take extra responsibility for your own fund.\"\nOngoing responsibility for running a fund can continue for decades and a trustee's personal circumstances can change dramatically during that period, she adds.\n Those who are self-employed often put a lot more time and thought into preparing their companies than preparing for their retirement, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA).\nSelf-employed Australians make up more than 10 per cent of the paid workforce, in sectors ranging from primary production to property and transport, but more than one in four has no super, ASFA research reveals.\nMore than half of those who are self-employed have super balances of less than $40,000.\nBuilding capital rather than paying rent, augmenting super savings and making the most of generous capital gains tax concessions for self-employed businesses are popular reasons for considering buying business property via a DIY super fund.\nRisks The major risk is if something goes wrong with the business in the lead-up to retirement, which is what happened to many companies in the fallout from the global financial crisis.\nMany businesses in this situation can be hard to sell, particularly when the seller is its key person.\nAnne Graham, managing director of McPhail HLG Financial Planning, warns about potential liquidity problems in having a single \"chunky\" asset, like property, dominating a super scheme.\n\"You need to leave yourself some wriggle room in case something happens to property,\" she says.\nCompelling strategic reasons include the potential for positive returns through rental income and capital gains, and having rental income or realised capital gains taxed at concessional superannuation tax rates.\nFurther, assets held within an SMSF are generally protected from creditors in the event of a bankruptcy.\nAn individual, or their business, may be able to claim an annual tax deduction of up to $30,000 for contributions to their super – or $35,000 if aged 50 or over.\nEmployment income includes reportable employer super contributions, such as salary sacrifice contributions, but not super guarantee contributions.\nSeek advice It's wise to consult with a certified financial planner and accountant to ensure the business and super strategies suit your risk appetite and retirement expectations.\n\"An election must be lodged with the trustee of the superannuation fund indicating the amount of the contribution that will be claimed as a tax deduction, and that election must be acknowledged by the trustee of the fund,\" says Graeme Colley, director technical and professional standards for the SMSF Association.\nMany SMSF members make basic mistakes about correctly structuring a fund in their haste to purchase a property, which often results in long delays as lawyers and accountants are brought in to sort out the problems, Tuxworth says.\nPopular SMSF properties range from $500,000 to $2 million but are typically about $1 million for 150-square-metre premises, which could house around 10 to 12 staff, he says.\nCommercial property returns are dependent on the term and yield of the tenancy, says Daren McDonald, a partner at accounting and advisory firm ShineWing Australia, about calculating potential as a basis of comparison for alternative strategies.\nWhat you need to know Types of property that can qualify as business real property include commercial premises such as a doctor's surgery, shops, factories and farms. Is purchasing property allowed under your SMSF's trust deed and is this appropriate to your investment objectives, risk profile and liquidity? Trustees may need to engage a lawyer and financial adviser to confirm this. Get specialist advice on limited recourse borrowing used to purchase a property. Under limited recourse borrowing rules a trustee of a SMSF may be permitted to borrow to acquire an asset. An SMSF is only permitted to purchase property from a related party – such as a member of the SMSF – for its market value. Trustees may need to obtain an independent professional valuation prior to transferring a business property to their fund. Costs are likely to include legal fees, stamp duty, strata levies, rates and property maintenance. Assets cannot be used as security for a loan. Remember that in the event of a member's death, the trustees may be required to sell SMSF assets to pay a death benefit to the member's beneficiary. Tax may apply to both the assets of the SMSF and death benefit payment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T09:04:43.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
