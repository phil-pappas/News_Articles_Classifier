The US 10-year Treasury yield fell three basis points to 2.1% as ISM's purchasing managers' index (PMI) on manufacturing fell to 52.7 in July from 53.5 a month earlier, compared to forecasts of 53.5. A reading above 50 signals expansion while a level below indicates a contraction. \nThe Commerce Department revealed US consumers spent at a slower pace in June. The core PCE price index also rose just 0.2% in June and 1.3% year over year, well below the Fed's 2% inflation target. \n\"Admittedly, today's data continue a run of weaker-than-expected numbers that includes falling consumer confidence and weak wage growth on the ECI index,\" said Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics. \n\"All this may make the Fed less inclined to hike rates in September. However, the Fed will probably place more weight on the recent firming in core inflation and the decent news on the labour market. Based on our forecast that these two trends will continue, a hike in September remains a good bet.\" The Greek 10-year bond yield also slid, down nine basis points to 11.9%, as the Athens stock market opened at a record low following a fall in the economic sentiment index and manufacturing PMI. Greece and its creditors have agreed that new pension reforms will not have any impact on anyone who was eligible to retire by the end of June, Reuters reported. Greece will implement pension reforms including raising the retirement age limit by the end of October. Greece is also reportedly unlikely to ask for an increase in emergency funding from the European Central Bank for weeks as its liquidity buffer has risen due to cash inflows and help from the central bank. \nGerman bunds and UK sovereign bonds were also lower, while Spain saw a 10 basis-point rise. \nWeak Chinese manufacturing data also affected the market, as it added to concerns about a slowdown in the world's second largest economy. \nChina's Caixin purchasing managers' index (PMI) on manufacturing activity, which was previously sponsored by HSBC, declined to a two-year low of 47.7 from June's 49.4 on a 100-point scale. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 48.3. \nAnother index by Chinese industry group, the Federation of Logistics & Purchasing, and the government statistics bureau dipped to 50 from June's 50.2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T05:47:40.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
