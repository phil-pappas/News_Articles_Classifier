Judith Evans ©Getty Looking for alternatives \nWhat does a caravan park in Cornwall have in common with hurricane insurance in Florida? If you’re a retail investor, either may well appear in your portfolio — as could renewable power generation contracts, personal loans, aircraft leases and even timber. \nIf a wealth manager or multi-asset fund manager is running your money, and especially if you are an income investor, chances are they will have looked beyond equities, bonds and vanilla property investments in the search for yield in recent years. More The Art Market all dressed up IN Investments Investors pull £2.7bn from M&G fund \nAsset classes traditionally financed by banks or big institutions, and previously deemed too long-term, illiquid or risky for retail investors, are now being packaged up as listed funds and traded on stock markets, where portfolio managers can buy them — leading to their possible presence in your Isa or self-invested personal pension (Sipp). \n“There’s a lack of return on bank deposits, there’s growing pressure on investors to look elsewhere for income, and there are growing concerns over fixed income markets, so people have broadened and deepened where they look for that yield,” says Gary Potter, co-head of multi-manager at F&C Asset Management. \n“At the same time, as the result of the credit crunch, banks have been deleveraging their balance sheets. There are a multitude of influences promoting the backdrop for [funds investing in] assets of an alternative nature.” \nThe crisis, during which many markets fell sharply in sync, also drove the hunt for so-called “uncorrelated” assets, which do not mirror the market movements of equities or bonds. But these assets carry different risks, and fund managers vary widely in their assessments of which “alternative” asset classes offer a sensible trade-off between risk and return. \n“Specialist property, student accommodation, medical centres, even garage forecourts — they’re canaries in the gold mine, reaching out for new ways of generating returns,” says David Coombs, head of multi-asset investments at Rathbone Brothers. Taking a trip \nThe move towards “alternatives” has been under way since at least the financial crisis, but as interest rates remained in the doldrums , asset allocation has continued to shift in this direction. \nInvestment in real estate, unclassified investments such as insurance, and “other” holdings such as commodities rose 11 per cent in the year to February 2015, according to data from Lipper, which covers European funds of funds. \nMr Potter’s F&C MM Navigator Distribution Fund, which he runs with Rob Burdett, holds unconventional assets including the Darwin Leisure Property fund, which invests in holiday parks around the UK. \nVisitors to Darwin’s Sandymouth caravan park in Cornwall praise the children's’ bingo, well-stocked bar and sightings of the TV adventurer Ben Fogle; like many of Darwin’s properties, Sandymouth is in an area of natural beauty. \nWill Mr Potter and Mr Burdett’s visit be as sunny? They say the income-generating fund has so far been a strong contributor to performance; it has returned 120.5 per cent since March 2008 against 17.11 per cent for the average fund in the Investment Association’s property sector. \nUnlike many alternative funds, it is open-ended rather than listed on an exchange, but it is unregulated, so not available directly to most individual investors. \n“Cash flow is significant and there’s no debt in the parks business — you can’t get a mortgage for a caravan,” says Mr Potter. “We’ve been involved since 2009 and the fund has done a phenomenal job for us. \n“Even so, it still only makes up 3 per cent of the portfolio. We’re not betting the ranch.” \nOther investors are less keen to jump on board. Mr Coombs has liquidity concerns : how easy would it be to sell the underlying properties if investors pulled their money out? \nElsewhere, the F&C duo also hold Blue Capital Reinsurance, a fund that buys insurance contracts protecting property owners in the event of disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, storms and fires. The fund pays out in the event of such catastrophes , but in the meantime collects a steady stream of premiums. \n“It appealed to us because it produces an income that is largely in dollars and typically yields 6 per cent annually. That was attractive, given that it’s a fairly stable fund from a capital point of view,” says Mr Potter. \nThe multi-asset team at Henderson Global Investors also favour this asset class but are waiting to buy until it undergoes a correction in prices. \n“It’s got too expensive for now, but we do like it because of the double-digit annualised returns and total lack of correlation to financial markets,” says James de Bunsen, a fund manager focusing on alternatives. \nDownload Sunny days \nOver the past three years, investors have piled into renewable energy investment trusts, which have grown from zero in 2012 to a market capitalisation of more than £2bn. \nHenderson’s alternatives team remain positive on the funds, which buy assets linked to solar and wind farms, even though the government has cut some subsidies for renewable energy and signalled it may slash others. \nWhile there may be less potential for new launches in the future, says Mr de Bunsen, existing vehicles such as Greencoat UK Wind and Bluefield Solar Income — which rely on existing contracts, and hence are relatively unaffected by subsidy changes — should continue to offer value. \n“In terms of looking at alternatives for yield, we still think they meet all the criteria,” said Mr de Bunsen. \nRenewables have ballooned in tandem with infrastructure investment trusts, which finance long-term projects such as roads, schools, airports and energy grids, usually with some form of public sector involvement. \nEnthusiasm for these trusts, which were trading this week at an average premium of 13.73 per cent, has helped drive discounts among the entire investment trust sector to an all-time low, says the Association of Investment Companies. \nIn the past year, another new sector has fizzed into being: the first investment trust buying peer-to-peer loans launched in May 2014, and investors have since poured more than £1.2bn into this trust and its imitators. \nP2P Global Investments buys loans made through peer-to-peer platforms such as Zopa or Funding Circle, which act as marketplaces matching up lenders with individuals or small businesses who want to borrow. Unlike banks, they do not take the loans on to their balance sheets, and lower overheads enable them to offer competitive rates. \nP2PGI’s target annual yield of 6 to 8 per cent — the trust uses leverage to enhance its loan exposure — has attracted equity income managers as well as multi-asset funds: Neil Woodford ’s Woodford Investment Management is one of the biggest shareholders. Don’t try this at home \nAlternative investments have helped fund managers such as Mr Potter and Mr Burdett to keep yield-hungry investors happy. Their Distribution fund has delivered top-quartile performance over the past five years. \nBut caravan parks, aircraft leases and the rest come with big health warnings for ordinary investors: indeed, the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, has barred direct sales of unregulated funds such as Darwin Leisure Properties to most retail customers. \nJake Moeller, head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, points out that multi-asset fund managers are generally limited in the amount of exotic assets they can hold by regulations such as the European Ucits directives and by Investment Association and Association of British Insurers sector classifications. \n“There are lines of defence built into these funds,” he says. \nManagers have been especially cautious since the collapse of the Arch Cru funds in 2009, adds Mr Moeller. In the Arch Cru scandal , at least 15,000 people were sold “cautious” funds of funds that actually bought high-risk, illiquid assets such as private equity, venture capital and even shipping. \n“A lot of fund managers are very conscious of liquidity, I think from the Arch Cru experience. They’re not going to cut off their nose to spite their face. Plus the financial crisis was a wake-up call for everyone on liquidity,” says Mr Moeller. \nLiquidity, the ability to sell off assets if needed, is a key concern. Daily trading in a fund is ideal, says Mr Moeller. \nInvestors like listed funds because they can be constantly bought and sold, but this still relies on buyers coming forward; smaller investment funds are especially prone to thin trading volumes and sharp movements in share prices. \nThe underlying assets in open- and closed-ended funds may also be difficult to buy and sell. For example, aircraft leasing funds offer a steady income stream as airlines rent jets, but the aircraft themselves are fairly seldom bought and sold. This means the net asset value of an aircraft leasing fund depends on an assessment of the value of the jets, which may not prove accurate. \n“The second-hand valuation of the aircraft is very subjective. For example, if the fund owns three Airbus A380s, how can you calculate the second-hand value of an A380 when very few have been sold on the secondary market?” asks Mr Coombs, of Rathbones. \n“[The valuations] are usually based on the second-hand value of a [Boeing] 747 but those planes typically go from passenger to cargo, whereas there are not many cargo sheds that can accommodate an A380.” \nRisk is often discussed in terms of volatility, and asset classes that use models rather than day-to-day market movements to assess pricing may appear to have very low volatility. But they are no less risky. Liquidity risk and credit risk are just two other factors to consider. \n“I wouldn’t buy these [aircraft leasing] funds because I can’t readily understand the risks — so how can I work out what return I want for those risks?” adds Mr Coombs. \nIn sectors that carry high premiums, a fund manager may decide it is not worth their time to make the calculation. “There’s been such a desperate search for yield that some of the income producing alternative asset classes have really been bid up,” says Mr Coombs. \nMeanwhile, herding behaviour among investors can also contribute to liquidity concerns. \n“If you look at the top 10 holdings of some of these funds, there are a lot of wealth managers with similar client bases. That worried me because then you have quite consensual thinking when things go wrong,” says Mr Coombs. \n“When buying closed-ended funds, I would always look for as diverse a shareholder base as possible.” \nThere may be movement out of “bond proxy asset classes” when interest rates rise, increasing yields from government and corporate bonds, says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown . \nAs for retail investors, all but most sophisticated should not buy alternatives directly, advisers warn; a string of scandals have resulted from direct sales of asset classes such as student accommodation to ordinary investors, even as multi-managers have successfully incorporated them into portfolios. Back to vanilla \nAlternative asset classes may seem to offer exotic flavours of investment, but some fund managers argue they are not actually so different from plain vanilla. \nDavid Jane, a veteran multi-asset fund manager at Miton Group , believes many so-called alternative offerings are just regular investments seen through a different lens. Often, he argues, an ordinary share or bond may offer similar exposure.
