The firm, which advises big banks, foreign governments and even the Vatican, said it would seek a stay against the decision in New York state court. \nThe New York State Department of Financial Services found that Promontory was not sufficiently independent in its work for Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) , a London-based bank that helped clients evade U.S. sanctions against Iran and other countries. \nIn 2012, Standard Chartered settled with state and federal regulators for $667 million for violations. The bank was fined another $300 million by New York last year. \nThe bank initially reported possible problems in following sanctions rules to authorities in 2010. It hired Promontory to provide reports about the scope of the bank's violations. \nPromontory \"made changes to 'soften' and 'tone down' the language used in its reports, avoid additional questions from regulators, omit red flag terms or otherwise make the reports more favorable to the bank,\" the New York state watchdog said. \nIt made the changes at the direction of the bank or its counsel, or on its own initiative, the department found. \nPromontory also omitted timelines that would have shown an increase in violations over time, while including those that showed a decrease. \nWitnesses from Promontory who testified before the department in recent weeks \"lacked credibility,\" according to the report. For instance, a former analyst testified that an instruction from the bank's counsel to make language \"more bland\" meant \"more accurate,\" the report said. \nIn recent years, New York has been scrutinizing the independence of consultants retained by banks to report to regulators. As a result, Deloitte LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers settled similar investigations, agreeing to refrain from certain work for a year or two. \nNew York's Department of Financial Services said it intends to deny Promontory requests for confidential information until further notice. \nThe ban will immediately impact work Promontory is doing for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd, according to a source familiar with the situation, as a waiver allowing access to that bank's confidential information will not be approved. \nA spokesman for Promontory had no immediate comment. Nor did a spokesman for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. A spokeswoman for Standard Chartered declined to comment. \nPromontory earned $54.5 million from its work on the Standard Chartered project, and another $12.4 million from other work for the bank between 2007 and 2014.
