The strong dollar cut a record $52.2bn from the value of dividends paid out during the three months.

This was powered by increases in Europe and Japan. \n“Though the headline decline seems disappointing, it is concealing very positive underlying increases in dividends,” said Alex Crooke, head of global equity income at the asset manager. \n“A dividend-paying culture is extending into new markets, beyond those where paying an income to equity investors is already deeply entrenched.” \nHeadline dividends in Europe were down 14.3 per cent because of the weakness of the euro, but underlying growth was 8.6 per cent, propelled by bigger payouts from Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium. The quarter represents a seasonal peak for European dividends. \nA similar trend was seen in Japan, where dividends were down 7.1 per cent on the weak yen but up 16.8 per cent on an underlying basis as payout ratios rose and earnings growth was strong. Japanese companies have faced pressure from the government and investors to increase from a low base the proportion of profits they hand back to shareholders. \nSimilar pressures in South Korea increased dividends there by an underlying 37.4 per cent. \nMeanwhile, US payouts were up 10 per cent to $98.6bn in their sixth consecutive quarter of growth. \nThe rising underlying numbers around the world indicate that equity income investors should take a global approach, said Mr Crooke. \nRecovering financial companies — which account for about a quarter of all dividends — helped to boost the numbers, with companies ranging from Germany’s Allianz to Bank of America and Citigroup increasing their distributions. \nFinancial dividends were up 0.3 per cent, even with currency movements taken into account, reaching 18 months of steady increases. \n“This is less about a renewed boom to financial payouts and more about a gradual return to normality,” said Mr Crooke. \nHenderson now forecasts total global dividends of $1.16tn this year, an upgrade of $29bn. This would represent a 1.2 per cent headline decline, or a 7.8 per cent underlying increase.
