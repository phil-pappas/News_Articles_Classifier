Lower doses of resveratrol were twice as effective as the higher dose in stopping tumours growing, although this effect was only seen in animals fed a high-fat diet.\nThe study is first to look at the effects of a lower daily dose – equivalent to the amount of resveratrol found in one large (approx. 250ml) glass of red wine – comparing it with a dose 200 times higher.\nSamples of tumours from bowel cancer patients given different doses of resveratrol showed that even lower doses can get into cancer cells and potentially affect processes involved in tumour growth.\nThe study opens up new avenues for the role of purified resveratrol in preventing cancer, but suggests that it may only be effective for people with a specific genetic make-up, particular diets and lifestyles.\nIt also doesn’t mean that drinking red wine reduces cancer risk, as drinking alcohol increase the chances of developing the disease.\nKaren Brown, professor of translational cancer research at the University of Leicester, said that this was an early laboratory research and the next stage is for clinical trials to confirm whether resveratrol has the same effects in people at high risk of bowel cancer.\nThe study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n 30, 2015 6:04 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:15:22.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
