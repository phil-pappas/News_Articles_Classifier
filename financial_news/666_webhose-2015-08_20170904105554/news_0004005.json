The share price peaked at $15.91 on March 2, 2012, but slid below $3 less than five months later, wiping out several billions of dollars of market value.\nThe settlement is not reflected in court records. It typically takes a few months for similar class-action accords to win judicial approval.\nIn a statement on Friday, Zynga said the settlement removes the \"distraction of protracted litigation.\"\nNicole Lavallee, a partner at Berman DeValerio representing the shareholders, said she is pleased with the settlement.\nOn Thursday, Zynga said its second-quarter loss narrowed to $26.9 million, or 3 cents per share, from $62.5 million, or 7 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 30 percent to $199.9 million, though the number of monthly active users fell 32 percent to 83 million.\nZynga shares closed up 19 cents, or 7.8 percent, at $2.64 in Friday trading on the Nasdaq.\nThe case is In re: Zynga Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 12-04007.
