China's Ministry of Public Security could not immediately be reached for comment outside regular working hours. \nChinese authorities have been probing possible market manipulation following recent gyrations in the country's equity markets, cracking down on alleged malicious short selling and other strategies seen as hampering stocks from bouncing back. \nLi, a former MTV Networks executive, was appointed Country Chair, China in 2011, according to a page on Man Group's website archived by Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) on Aug. 6.
