The Malaysian ringgit gained on month-end \ncorporate demand in thin liquidity. \n\"These are just technical rebounds after sharp falls,\" said \nYuna Park, a currency and bond analyst at Dongbu Securities in \nSeoul. \n\"There are some bargain-hunting needs, given the speed of \nthe recent risky asset tumble. But everything is up to China's \nstance. It will take time to see a recovery in sentiment.\" \nChinese shares lost about 4 percent with investors \ndisappointed at the absence of policy action from Beijing, \nespecially given concerns that the sell-off in local equities \nwould further hurt the economy. \nOn Monday, Chinese stocks lost nearly 9 percent in the worst \ntrading session since 2007, dampening world stocks, commodities \nand emerging currencies. \nThe Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah \nfell to their lowest since the Asian financial crisis 17 year \nago. \nThe won gained after North and South Korea agreed to end a \nstandoff involving an exchange of artillery fire that had \nheightened military tensions in the divided peninsula. \nThe agreement helped Seoul shares rise 1.5 percent. \nCurrency traders covered bearish bets on the won as they \nalso stayed wary of possible intervention by South Korea's \nforeign exchange authorities to keep it stronger than 1,200 per \ndollar. \nForeign investors, however, continued to sell local stocks \nand bonds, limiting the won's upside. \nThey were set to become net sellers in the main exchange for \n14th straight session, unloading 3.1 trillion won ($2.6 billion) \nin total during the period, Korea Exchange data showed. \nTAIWAN DOLLAR \nThe Taiwan dollar rose as local stocks jumped 3.4 \npercent on hopes the government will soon step in to shore up \nmarket confidence after the market plunged to a near three-year \nlow in the previous session. \nOn Monday, vice finance minister Wu Tang-chieh, who is in \ncharge of the National Security Fund, said the government is \n\"aggressively evaluating\" the possibility of buying local \nequities. \nThe Taiwan dollar started Tuesday's session weaker and fell \nto 33.000 per the U.S. dollar, its weakest since September 2009. \nForeign investors were net sellers in the domestic stocks \nfor the previous 13 consecutive sessions on fears of a \nhard landing in China's economy, the island's main export \nmarket. \nSpot ringgit advanced as Malaysia's exporters bought it for \nsettlements in thin liquidity. \nThe Malaysian currency gave up some of earlier gains as some \nforeign investors sold the currency on rallies. \nIts non-deliverable forwards also strengthened \nas some offshore funds bought it to unwind currency hedges. \nCURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLAR \nChange on the day at 0515 GMT \nCurrency Latest bid Previous day Pct Move \nJapan yen 119.38 118.41 -0.81 \nSing dlr 1.4063 1.4099 +0.26 \nTaiwan dlr 32.655 32.960 +0.93 \nKorean won 1194.40 1199.00 +0.39 \nBaht 35.63 35.76 +0.36", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T09:03:31.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
