The bulk of that spending will go to television, the report predicts, but 2016 will be the first year in which spending on digital media breaks the $1 billion level.\nAdding in 2015 spending, the Borrell reports predicts total ad spending in this election cycle will be $16.5 billion, with about half of that spent on the national elections and half on local contests.\nThe increased spending is a continuation of a trend that has its roots in the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, says Kip Cassino, the report’s principal author. That decision allowed unlimited spending on elections by corporations and unions.\n“The amount of money let loose by the Citizens United decision has certainly been the overwhelming effect that is driving the money in these elections,” says Cassino.\nCassino says that advertising rates keep rising, so more spending doesn’t necessarily mean a greater number of ads cascading in front of Americans’ eyes between now and November 2016. Still, he tells MarketWatch, we should expect a “deluge” of ads as presidential, congressional and local candidates set their sights on Election Day.\nAs the 2016 races approach, meanwhile, companies that work in political advertising are anticipating the need to add staff.\nJim Walsh, CEO of DSPolitical , a voter-targeted digital ad network for Democratic campaigns and progressive causes, says he expects digital advertising to “explode.” Walsh’s firm has worked for Senate Democrats including Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. This season, he says, he expects to work with “pretty much any campaign you can imagine.”\nBrian Donahue, CEO of Craft Media/Digital , an agency that works for Republican candidates and corporate and nonprofit clients, also expects digital to take off. “There’s so many advertising opportunities that have become available to advertisers and agencies like ours that were not available even two years ago,” says Donahue. Donahue’s firm is involved in both digital and television advertising and expects to work with super PACs this cycle. Craft has worked with the National Republican Congressional Committee and lawmakers including Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona.\nWalsh says his company started in 2010 with two employees and has grown to 30. The company is expanding its downtown Washington office to accommodate 72 staff members. He says he’s “absolutely” planning to hire ahead of 2016.\nDonahue says his firm recently hired two new account executives and is seeking candidates for digital advertising positions. Craft has 23 employees.\nWhile online ads may be a hot way to target voters, TV viewers have already seen a blizzard of political advertisements. Take, for example, ads promoting Republican White House hopefuls as the numerous contenders vie for the GOP nomination.\nSee: Republican debate on Fox News takes raucous turn\nBetween Jan. 1 and Aug. 4, more than 7,800 television spots focusing on the Republican battle have aired, according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group. That’s up from 1,023 during the same period in 2011.\nElizabeth Wilner, senior vice president for political advertising at Kantar Media, says the need to build name identification and to qualify for the debates is what’s behind the huge jump in TV spots. Both candidates and the groups that support them — for example, New Day for America, a group backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich — are trying to get names out there, she says. “It’s a pretty crowded Republican field,” observes Wilner.\nOverall political TV ad spending could reach $4.4 billion this cycle, Kantar has estimated .\nWilner also cites the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision as a major factor behind ad spending this year.\n“This year, we’re seeing, instead of having the candidates be out there doing most of the advertising, we’re seeing candidate-specific outside groups” doing most ads on candidates’ behalf, Wilner says. “We didn’t see that in 2012.”\nCiting the example of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Wilner says that year, there were groups backing him with ads. But they were still “hanging back a bit, and trying to let the Romney campaign take the lead.”\nNow, Wilner says there is a “more sophisticated application [by outside groups] of what the laws permit.”\nCassino’s firm predicts total ad spending of about $12.6 billion in 2020, the next presidential election year. He estimates that, by then, spending on digital ads will have jumped to within 30% of broadcast TV levels as television audiences erode further and voters spend even more time online.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://craftdc.com/", "http://dspolitical.com/", "http://cookpolitical.com/story/8685"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T15:55:05.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
