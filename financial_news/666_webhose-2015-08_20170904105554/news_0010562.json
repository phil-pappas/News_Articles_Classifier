For a start, the picture is no bleaker than it was at the time of the previous survey three months ago, and there are large parts of the economy not covered by the bureau's quarterly capital expenditure (capex) survey, including the public sector, health care, education and training, and agriculture. The projections include only spending on buildings and structures, and equipment and machinery, not on computer software or other intellectual property. And capex plans can change if economic circumstances change - tourism or manufacturing might ramp up their investment spending in response to the lower exchange rate, for example. Even so, the outlook looks pretty grim. In mining, based on the average gap between plans and final capex over the past five years, investment in the 2015/16 year is likely to be down by over 35 per cent from 2014/15 and by about 50 per cent from the peak in 2012/13. But even outside the mining sector, the \"rebalancing\" narrative touted by the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury is still more fable than fact. The bureau's figures suggest a fall of around 12 per cent in non-mining capex in 2015/16, more than reversing the 10 per cent rise in 2014/15 and bringing this component of capex to its lowest point as a proportion of gross domestic product for many decades. No doubt much will be made of the increase in projected capex for 2015/16 between this survey and the previous one three months ago. Too much, in fact. The latest estimate for 2015/16, the third in a regular round of quarterly survey, was 9.9 per cent higher than the second. But plans are usually upgraded at this stage of the survey cycle. In the past five years, the projected value of capex was increased by an average of 8.2 per cent between the second and third surveys, and over the past 20 years the average increase was 10.0 per cent. An uplift of 9.9 per cent is nothing more than par for the course, meaning capex plans are following their usual pattern overall. And if the pattern continues to be followed, capex will fall by about 25 per cent overall this year. The rise in projected capex between the second and third surveys has not been even - a bit bigger than usual outside mining, but less than normal in the mining sector itself. But even then, the best that can be said is that non-mining capex might not fall quite as much as the figures indicate, while mining might turn out even worse.
