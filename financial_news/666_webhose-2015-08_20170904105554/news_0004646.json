Because of this, none of the bridesmaids wanted to step on one another’s toes to take initiative with setting up a bachelorette party, so it never got done. Eventually, after badgering the bride about which weekends she had free in the weeks leading up to her wedding, I stepped up and tried to plan it last minute. Given the short timeline, I worked with the bride and quickly gathered her friends’ numbers to coordinate schedules.\nIt took several hours of research, but I finally found a place, an Airbnb; and activities, dinner and a cruise around the bay; that were affordable and in-line with what the bride envisioned for her bachelorette party. Two weeks ahead of the scheduled weekend, I had hard confirmations from seven girls, including myself, so I went ahead and booked everything, spotting everyone with my own money.\nRead: Should my daughter elope or have a big wedding?\nIn hindsight, I should have asked them all to send money upfront, but it was summertime and we were renting a beach house in a town with slim pickings, so I felt it was best to book it before it was taken off the market. As friends have done for me in the bachelorette parties I have attended in my past, I trusted they would show up and would give me the money upon arrival.\nHowever, the morning of the bachelorette party, two of the girls bailed. One said she was sick, although I am a bit skeptical as she had been ignoring some of my texts earlier that week that referenced the weekend, and the other, I found out later, decided not to come because she felt she should have been the one to plan the party – not me -- she even cited the movie “Bridesmaids.” So petty!\nThe point is, I was left with a much larger bill for the Airbnb and cruise than I had initially anticipated – a few hundred dollars more than I had budgeted for. I clearly didn’t charge the other girls who did show up more than I originally said I would, so I ended up paying for the two no-shows’ portion of the Airbnb and non-refundable cruise tickets myself. Do you think I should ask them to pay their portion of the weekend even though they didn’t come?\nJan in New York\nDear Jan,\nI recently saw Paul Feig’s “Bridesmaids” and I thought it was a lot of fun, and probably summed up the friction between very different personalities who are thrown together in the run-up to a wedding. I watched it online after going to see “ Spy ” with Rose Byrne and Melissa McCarthy, and they are my two favorite comedians. I can’t remember the last time I laughed all the way through a movie. I only wish the same could be said for your bachelorette party.\nI received a similar letter earlier this year from a man who wanted to know whether he should charge a friend (probably now ex-friend) who didn’t show up to his child’s bar mitzvah. In that instance, there was no payment expected – except, perhaps a gift – so I advised him against any invoice. But I suspect he was more hurt by his friend’s impoliteness than the cost, and was merely looking for ways to tell his friend that it’s not OK to be a no-show.\nRead: Why Melissa McCarthy’s ‘Spy’ kicked butt at the box office\nYour case is very different. Attending a wedding is an expensive endeavor and arranging a bachelorette party is a time-consuming one, too. Nearly 79 million Americans are projected to attend at least one wedding this year, and those who are in the wedding party pay around $701 each, up 13% from 2014, according to the American Express “Spending and Saving Tracker.” A hefty chunk of that goes on airfare ($225), hotel ($170), dining out ($116) and dressing up ($95).\nAnd weddings are getting too pricey for a lot of guests: 72% feel destination weddings are too expensive to attend, followed by 62% who don’t like being forced to take a vacation for a wedding. And that’s people who can probably afford to go. The American Express Survey sampled over 1,800 adults who have a minimum household income of $100,000 per year. So you’re not alone in spending close to or beyond your means for someone else’s big day.\nSend an email to the two people who canceled at the 11th hour. Tell them how much you paid and, since they backed out without any notice (after confirming) that they ought to pay X amount. If they refuse, email the remaining guests and tell them that – as the sole organizer – you are left paying hundreds of dollars more and, since you were all in it together, you should share the financial burden together too. Explain your reticence and the delay in asking for the money.\nAdd a link to the film “ Bridesmaids ” in your email to soften the blow.\nAlso see: Are weddings too expensive for guests?\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, re-gifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends?
