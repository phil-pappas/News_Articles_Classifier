Those pundits, like Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post , who think it is too late to stop the Clinton juggernaut are closing their eyes to what is the slow-motion implosion of the Clinton campaign.\nIf there was any lingering doubt about Clinton’s ineptitude on the campaign trail, it was definitively laid to rest last weekend in Iowa, when she lamely joked how much she loves Snapchat because “those messages disappear all by themselves.”\nYou don’t have to be a hardened Clinton critic like Charles Krauthammer to deem this remark “cringe-worthy” in light of the swirling controversy surrounding her emails as secretary of state.\nClinton continues to dig deeper into the hole of dissembling she started when she disingenuously claimed in March that she used a private email server for the convenience of having only a single device for emails.\nAnd now two inspectors general, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the collective intelligence community are tracking down just how serious a breach of national security this “convenience” constituted.\nThis is not a joking matter and it’s not going away. And there is still the simmering controversy of the Clinton Foundation donations that is sure to come to a boil once again.\nThe talk of Vice President Joe Biden entering the race is not sentimental yearning to fulfill a dying son’s wish or glowing embers of political ambition, but the hard-nosed reality that Democrats may need someone to come to the rescue.\nWhether 72-year-old Biden would commit to serving only a single term or not, as some are suggesting, the fact is he would be stepping in as a caretaker president, preserving the legacy of the Obama presidency and preventing a Republican from winning the White House.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/its-too-late-for-democrats-to-start-rethinking-clintons-2016-viability/2015/08/16/aea13116-441f-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/08/17/krauthammer_hillary_clintons_snapchat_joke_was_cringe-worthy_shows_how_ham-handed_she_is.html"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T14:11:28.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
