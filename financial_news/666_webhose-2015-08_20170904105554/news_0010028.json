this isn't right',\" SDA national secretary Gerard Dwyer said.\nMr Dwyer said as well as offer advice, the union would help workers take legal action to win back unpaid wages.\n\"I think we will see a number of back-pay claims that will be made, we will see that there's been exploitation of people in a vulnerable position who've been paid below their award wage,\" he said.\n\"We'll be working with them and the relevant authorities to make sure they get their legal entitlements.\" The SDA's help hotline is 131 732.\nThe SDA's announcement come as the Fair Work Ombudsman launched legal proceedings against Sydney 7-Eleven franchisee Harmandeep Singh Sarkaria for underpaying two workers at his Blacktown store.\nThe ombudsman said on Monday that the workers were paid as little as $10 an hour and that one, a Pakistani migrant, was allegedly underpaid $43,633 over two years.\n7-Eleven's head office said it supported the ombudsman's action but Mr Dwyer said there were questions about how much the company knew about wage fraud in its stores.\n\"How could we have such large scale abuse going on inside those chains and the proprietors and the head office not to know that something is wrong?\" he said.\nFairfax Media revealed on Monday that 7-Eleven's corporate headquarters had engaged in a massive cover-u p of exploitation in its stores.\nMonday's developments came ahead of the evening's broadcast of a major expose on the 7-Eleven scandal on the ABC's Four Corners program.", "external_links": ["http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/workplace-relations/7eleven-stores-in-strife-20150830-gjayp2.html"], "published": "2015-08-31T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:08:45.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
