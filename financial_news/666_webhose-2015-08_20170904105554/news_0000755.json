But analysts still expect the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates later this year.\nU.S. stock futures fell sharply after the PMI report and most Asian stock markets and the Australian dollar extended early losses. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 sank to a more than six-month low on concerns about how China's slowdown would impact global growth.\nGROWING RISKS\nChinese authorities have struggled to stabilise the country's stock markets after a near-collapse in early summer, and stunned financial markets this month by devaluing the yuan by nearly 2 percent.\nThe central bank said the yuan move was a technical one and part of a reform process, but many investors fear the currency will be allowed to depreciate further amid political pressure to shore up flagging exports, potentially triggering a global currency war.\nThe gloomy PMI figure followed other official data last week that showed growth in China's factory output, investment and retail sales were all weaker than expected in July, dashing hopes that the economy was finally stabilising after a flurry of support measures over the last year, including four interest rate cuts and a massive stock market rescue.\nAnalysts have warned that China will struggle to meet its official economic growth target of 7 percent this year if it doesn't ratchet up policy support to combat cooling activity.\nSome economists believe current growth levels are already closer to half that.\nNew orders, a proxy for local and foreign demand, slumped to a three-year low. New export orders fared almost as badly, shrinking to their worst level since June 2013.\nA dearth in new business caused factory output to shrink for a fourth consecutive month to hit a trough of 46.6, a level not seen since November 2011 and down from July's 47.1.\nAs sales sag, the survey showed factories were cutting staff at a faster pace to rein in costs, depressing employment to a level not seen since the 2008/09 global crisis.\nWith demand so lacklustre, factories struggled again with deflationary pressure. Input prices fell for the 13th straight month, reflecting lower commodities prices, but output prices slid at their fastest rate in seven months as manufacturers were forced to slash prices amid fiercer competition.\nSOFT OUTLOOK\nThe latest PMI will reinforce bets that China must increase government spending, cut interest rates again and relax banks' reserve requirements to get the economy back on an even keel.\nTo worsen matters, Chinese financial markets have suffered unprecedented turbulence lately, further denting investor and consumer confidence.\nChinese shares tanked as much as a third during a selloff last month. That shakeout also raised fears of a tighter credit supply for companies, as state-controlled banks shifted their funding priorities to supporting the stock market instead.\nEquity and currency markets have also been hit by volatility after the yuan devaluation.\nA devastating explosion last week in the northern port of Tianjin, the world's 10th largest, flattened a big industrial area, though analysts at Capital Economics estimated disruptions on a national level to be \"transitory and small\".
