PUBLISHED: 17:43, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:52, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 GETTY TRUST: Talk it over with loved ones \nEvery year, thousands of families face a costly legal battle to take charge of a loved one’s affairs because they failed to set up a lasting power of attorney (LPA) in advance. \nAn LPA gives family or friends the power to make decisions about your property and finances if you are unable to do so, say, after suffering Alzheimer’s or losing your mental capacity for any other reason. \nYounger people should also consider setting up an LPA, known as a continuing power of attorney in Scotland, in case a major illness or serious injury prevents them from managing their own affairs. \nIf you don’t set up an LPA, you have no power over who is appointed to look after your health and finances. \nSarah Cash, head of the tax, trusts and estates team at law firm Hugh James says: “Appointing an LPA while you are in good health helps to ensure your finances aren’t placed under the control of someone you haven’t always trusted yourself.” \nSetting up an LPA is particularly important for women, whose greater life expectancy means they make up around 60 per cent of all applications after mental incapacity, Cash says. \nJanet Davies at Symponia, an organisation for later life financial advisers, says you need to act while you are still mentally alert. \n“If the person needing care can no longer make reasoned decisions on their own, then you have to go to court.” \nLast month, simpler LPA forms were introduced, which can be downloaded online at Gov.uk/opg . Appointing an LPA while you are in good health helps to ensure your finances aren’t placed under the control of someone you haven’t always trusted yourself Sarah Cash, head of the tax, trusts and estates team at law firm Hugh James \nDeborah Stone at MyAgeing Parent.com, which offers advice to families caring for elderly relatives, says: “The new forms are easier to follow and faster to complete, so now there is even less excuse for not taking steps to get one set up.” \nYou can continue to submit the old forms until January 1, 2016. \nAnd any existing document drawn up under the old system, including an enduring power of attorney, will remain valid beyond that date. \nStone adds: “If you appoint your attorney while you still have all your mental faculties, it will be your choice on who makes key decisions on your health and finances should you become too poorly to do so.” \nWith dementia affecting one in three people aged 65 and over at some point, there is a real incentive to act. \nShe adds: “Mental frailty can set in through a range of other conditions, such as a stroke.” \nAt that point, someone will need to decide where you should receive your care and how that is funded. \nHaving an LPA in place should your health deteriorate can be hugely reassuring for the individual and their family. \nDaniel Smith, a litigator at DAS Law, says there are two types of LPA. \nOne allows the attorney to manage your financial affairs, such as buying and selling property, claiming benefits, dealing with tax affairs, paying bills, and so on. \nSmith says: “The other covers your health and welfare, allowing the attorney to decide on medical matters, what care and treatment you need, as well as dealing with personal correspondence.” \nIn practice, many people set up both types of attorney to cover all eventualities. \nSmith says there is a £110 application fee to register an LPA, while legal costs if you have appointed a solicitor can range from £100 to £400 plus VAT. \nIf you haven’t set up an LPA in advance you will have to apply to the court of protection in England and Wales, or the sheriff court in Scotland, to become a deputy and make key decisions on their behalf. \nThe process can take up to six months and is far more expensive than setting up an LPA. \nThere is a £400 application fee, plus another £500 if a hearing is necessary, with legal fees on top. \nPlus you will also have to pay annual supervision fees. \nWith luck, the LPA will never be needed at all, but if you do need one, your loved ones will be glad you acted early.
