But a new study suggests that a college degree helps certain types of Americans more than others boost their incomes and protect their wealth during tough financial times.\nBetween 2007 and 2013, the median wealth of college-educated Asian families grew by 5.1% and fell for college-educated white families by 16%, according to a report released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. black and Hispanic families saw their median wealth fall much more precipitously—by nearly 60% and 72%, respectively. In fact, for those two groups the decline in median wealth over the Great Recession and recovery was smaller for noncollege educated households than for those with a degree.\nIn other words, the wealth premium that we’ve come to expect from a college degree, while present for white and Asian families, is “not only not there for blacks and Hispanics, it is reversed,” said William Emmons, a senior economic adviser for the Center for Household Financial Stability at the St. Louis Fed.\nWhy isn’t a college degree helping black and Hispanic borrowers as much as their white and Asian counterparts? For one, discrimination in the job market against these groups is well documented , so even with a college degree applicants may struggle to get a decent paying job.\nIn addition, white and Asian college graduates are more likely to go on to obtain a graduate degree and “rewards for those advanced degrees have gone up steadily,” Emmons said.\nBut probably the biggest factor is that college-educated black and Hispanic families were more likely than their white and Asian counterparts—and black and Hispanic families without college degrees—to have a large share of their assets tied up in their homes. One reason: Lenders targeted black and Hispanic borrowers for predatory mortgage loans in the lead up to the housing crisis; families with college degrees and therefore higher incomes made for better targets, Emmons said.\nThen when the housing market crashed their wealth declined sharply along with it.\nThe St. Louis Fed findings add to the growing body of evidence that higher education benefits some groups more than others, which may help to exacerbate the yawning racial wealth gap instead of shrink it. Black and Hispanic students are more likely to approach college with lower levels of wealth on average and are, therefore, more likely to have to borrow to attend school, according to a report earlier this year from Demos, a left-leaning think tank. Given that student loans tend to delay the accumulation of other wealth, such as buying a home, these higher levels of debt continue to put black and Hispanic college graduates at a disadvantage.\nThat may be why black and Hispanic graduates are more likely to regret owing so much in student loans than white borrowers, according to a recent survey from the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n“We’re not saying education is a bad thing or that college is a bad thing, just that it isn’t a silver bullet,” Emmons said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.cepr.net/documents/black-coll-grads-2014-05.pdf", "https://www.stlouisfed.org/itv/itb-12", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/04/us-usa-foreclosures-race-idUSTRE6930K520101004"], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:43:49.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
