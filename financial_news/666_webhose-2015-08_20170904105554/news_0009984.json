Reuters by Vesna Poljak The idea that China's central bank could outdo its response to the global financial crisis with a 1000-basis-point cut to the reserve requirement ratio might be one of the boldest moves proposed by an economist in a long time.\nThis hypothetical move, which even its own author has conceded could be interpreted as \"utter madness\", proposes a surprisingly neat trillion-dollar solution to China's problem of local government debt and the absence of a developed bond market, which it so desires.\nIt has been quietly floated by Huw McKay, Westpac's senior international economist, in his regular update on the Chinese economy. And though he identifies the concept as \"very, very left-field\", he also mounts a convincing argument that shows the idea is not as crazy at it sounds.\nFinancial reform as well as fiscal reform are important objectives for China's policy makers, but China is still not at the stage where, for example, it has a yield curve comparable with developed markets and thriving repurchasing activity.\nMr McKay recalls that in 1998 the People's Bank of China slashed the reserve requirement ratio (or RRR, the main policy tool within the Chinese economy) by 500 basis points to 8 per cent from 13 per cent in one hit. Unlike during the financial crisis, were China to conceive of a similar move this time, it would be for different reasons.\nOn Tuesday, the PBOC cut the benchmark lending and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point; it also lowered the RRR by half a percentage point to pump liquidity into the banking sector and boost activity. It was a small move amid the worsening rout in its sharemarket and question marks over the pace of growth.\n(Mr McKay published an opinion piece in The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday outlining how the sharemarket's collapse did not reflect the same magnitude of weakness in China's real economy .)\nTaking a more creative approach, Mr McKay on Thursday speculated that China could attempt a hugely collaborative move where the equivalent of 15 per cent of gross domestic product is placed in Ministry of Finance bonds, bought by commercial banks, and funded by a 10-percentage-point RRR cut.\n China has a problem with its levels of public debt owed at the local government level, but its central bank is healthy. The point is that China's reserve requirements have swelled to 36 per cent of GDP, but the cash is frozen on the PBOC's balance sheet, to no benefit.\nIt is \"a very tempting pool of funds just crying out for mobilisation,\" said Mr McKay in his report. \"They are also a huge administrative distortion serving as both a direct impediment to financial market development and an implicit tax on the banks.\"\nThe Ministry of Finance then buys the equivalent of 15 per cent of GDP in local debt held by the banks with the money raised. The sequence goes on, concluding with sovereign vehicles acquiring assets from the Ministry of Finance, the same assets that have been transferred over from local governments where the debt burden has been eased.\nIn the end, there is less debt at the local government level, where it is harder to service.\n\"Public debt stock would be split half/half central/local after this move (around 35 per cent of GDP each), rather than 20 per cent/50 per cent now,\" Mr McKay said. \"A half/half split is clearly a better starting point for debate on more sustainable vertical fiscal arrangements fitted for the purpose of taking China from middle to high income status by 2030.\"\nMr McKay conceived of many reasons why the bold plan would not work too. But he emphasised the result was consistent with China's own long-term objectives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:11:32.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
