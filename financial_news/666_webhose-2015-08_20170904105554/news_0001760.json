James Davies JGD Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Listed investment companies and exchange traded funds managed to bring in an extra $2.6 billion last year on the year before, with analysts linking the effort to a thirst from the self-managed super fund (SMSF) market for low cost investment options.\nData from the Australian Securities Exchange shows ETFs flows to ETFs were more than $5.5 billion in the last financial year, an increase of 78 per cent on 2013-14, where they attracted $3.1 billion. Globally, ETFs' assets under management last month surpassed hedge funds' at $2.971 trillion, research from ETFGI showed.\nListed investment companies similarly brought in a flood of cash through initial public offerings, with $810 million generated last year, 26 per cent more than the $640 million they collected the year before.\nIn the last few weeks, the ASX has seen $286 million raised for Argo Global Listed Infrastructure Limited and has received proposed listings from Contango, Future Generation and Glennon, a spokesman said. There are now around 65 LICs, he added, while there were 57 a year earlier.\nThe rise in capital raisings isn't surprising, analysts say, given the desire to create a platform for the growing market of self-directed investors who want cheaper investment vehicles.\nJosh Kannourakis, an equity research analyst at Baillieu Holst, said the past two years have created the \"perfect storm\" for the LICs sector, given the growth in SMSFs, the hunger for yield and advisers' changing investment behaviour following the Future of Financial Advice (FOFA) reforms.\n\"At the end of the day, many clients, especially SMSFs, are looking for a managed diversified portfolio targeting a specific market segment that exhibit good performance, transparency and attractive fee structures,\" he said.\n\"The growth in SMSFs is well documented, but anecdotally many large and small cap LICs that we research have seen the growth of SMSFs on their share registers outpace the strong growth in the SMSF market.\"\n \"SMSFs love LICs because, in many cases, they provide a smooth stream of fully franked dividends, are transparent, tradable on the ASX and have attractive costs relative to some managed funds.\"\nDIY investors are primarily driven by the desire for performance or fees, Morningstar analyst Alex Prineas added.\n\"SMSF managers are looking for either low-cost and transparency or if they are looking at active management, they want to be confident of outperformance, so anything in between, like closet indexing or active management where you're paying that extra fee but not outperforming, is generally being shunned.\"\nHe said LICs and ETFs tick those boxes, but in different ways.\nETFs offer passive access for a lower cost than managed funds and carry tax benefits that appeal to retail investors, he pointed out.\n\"LICs may cost a little bit more than ETFs, but relative to active managers a lot of LICs are low cost. Some of them are quite transparent and it seems investors like the ease of use of a listed investment,\" he said.\nMr Kannourakis said FOFA reforms has similarly \"levelled the playing field\" for LICs and ETFs among the financial planning community who can no longer receive commissions on managed funds.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:59:31.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
