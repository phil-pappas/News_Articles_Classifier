But investors hoping all that will change amid eased political relations with the U.S. should be cautious. \n“I don’t mean to be flippant, but [Americans] should be leaving their money in their U.S. bank,” said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, Inc. in New York. \nToday's flag-raising ceremony at the recently re-opened American embassy in Havana is garnering plenty of media coverage and anticipation, but Kavulich downplayed Cuba’s potential as a hub for commerce and conspicuous consumption.

Should the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control implement its expected changes, U.S. visitors to Cuba will triple, from 500,000 annually to 1.5 million. On a small island, that can generate a significant economic impact. \n“Now is the time for discovery, due diligence, and imagination -- to locate projects and partners, to position oneself for the tremendous, once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunities that will open up shortly,” said Richard Feinberg, a nonresident senior fellow in the Latin American Initiative at Brookings and an international political economy professor at UC San Diego. “But it’s not a market for the timid and risk averse.” \nWith those caveats, there are areas to pinpoint. \n“Interesting opportunities for joint ventures will emerge in badly needed infrastructure, in roads, ports, power generation and distribution,” Feinberg said. “More gradually in agriculture and pharmaceuticals. And, of course, tourism.” \nThe bread-and-butter option to trade on Cuba is the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund , a closed-end fund listed on the Nasdaq comprised of 60 securities. Because there are a limited number of shares, the per-share price can shoot up parabolically as demand grows. As of June 30, the fund only had $40.9 million in assets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T21:51:10.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
