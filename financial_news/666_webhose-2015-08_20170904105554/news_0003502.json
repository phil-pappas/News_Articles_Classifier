It was made popular in the 1920s by John J. Fitz Gerald , a writer for the Morning Telegraph . The name was also popular with jazz musicians in the 1930s and ‘40s who coveted gigs in posh Manhattan nightclubs.\nMost people still associate The Big Apple with NYC, but there may be a challenger. The challenger is Apple, Inc. (ticker: AAPL ).\nApple is the most valuable corporation in the world. At around $700 billion in market capitalization, AAPL’s free-float market capitalization is nearly twice the value of any other company. Accordingly, AAPL’s dominance has had a meaningful impact on the return of stock indices in the US and globally.\nApple has grown to become such a large portion of the S&P 500 that S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI) created ex-Apple indexes to see how the benchmark would have performed without AAPL’s influence. Figure 1 illustrates the difference in cumulative price-only returns of the S&P 500 with and without Apple stock over the years. Shown are cumulative price gains through August 5, 2015. Dividends and dividend reinvestment are not included.\nFigure 1: Cumulative S&P 500 price return with and without AAPL through August 5, 2015\nSource: S&P Dow Jones Indices data, courtesy of Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst. Figure by R. Ferri\nA look further back finds that since 1989 the annualized compounded price return of the S&P 500 has been 7.21% with AAPL and 7.06% without, according to SPDJI data. The 0.15% annual difference in return may not seem very large, but compounded over the years it can have a sizable impact in long-term performance in a portfolio. Active managers who excluded Apple because of its perceived high valuation at times would have difficulty adding value after accounting for this shortfall.\nApple’s impact on the S&P 500 is significant, yet in the grand scheme of things, the company doesn’t even rate in the top 20 of the most influence U.S. companies in S&P history. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at SPDJI, International Business Machines ( IBM ) had nearly double the influence in the early 1980s when PCs were new and IBM IBM was expected to dominate the market.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Fitz_Gerald", "http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500", "http://us.spindices.com/"], "published": "2015-08-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T23:26:13.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
