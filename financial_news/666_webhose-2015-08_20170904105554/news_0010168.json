In the currency market, investors reacted by unwinding recent moves that lifted both the yen and euro.\nSo the dollar, which would ordinarily fall on such a rate view, ended up outperforming its peers. The euro slid as far as $1.1290, peeling further away from a seven-month peak of $1.1715 set early in the week. It last stood at $1.1332.\nNot helping the common currency, the European Central Bank's chief economist said the risk has increased that the bank won't get inflation back up to where it wants, adding further action could be taken if necessary.\nAgainst the Japanese currency, the greenback fetched 120.07 yen, recovering from a seven-month low of 116.15 plumbed on Monday.\nNew York Fed President William Dudley said an interest rate hike next month seemed less appropriate given the threat posed to the U.S. economy by recent market turmoil.\nSteep falls and wild moves in Chinese stocks have compounded fears about slowing growth in the world's second biggest economy, sending markets across the globe reeling.\nOn Tuesday, China's central bank ratcheted up support for the stuttering economy by cutting rates and lowering the amount of reserves banks must hold.\nTraders said Dudley's relatively dovish tones, combined with upbeat data showing a big increase in U.S. business investment plans have further helped soothe market nerves.\n\"Risk sentiment continued to recover overnight, driving further reversion of the market moves from late last week/early this week,\" said Greg Moore, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\nSterling was a notable mover, suffering its biggest one-day fall in five months. It slid 1.4 percent to its lowest in nearly three weeks. The pound was last at $1.5480, near the overnight low of $1.5453.\nCommodity currencies had a less dramatic session but their failure to rebound on the back of improved risk appetite suggested there was still a degree of market caution.\nThe Australian dollar stood at $0.7120, having drifted up from Wednesday's low of $0.7070. It remained near a six-year trough of $0.7044 set on Monday.\nTraders said the market will continue to watch Chinese stocks for cues although Australia's capital expenditure data due at 0130 GMT will provide a bit of distraction.
