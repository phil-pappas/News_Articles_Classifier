China's central bank on Wednesday held a press conference to better explain a new policy where it devalued the yuan and will allow for more market influence in setting the daily fix. PBOC vice-governor Yi Gang dismissed suggestions the devaluation was an attempt to make China's exports more competitive, and said the PBOC will try to ensure normal fluctuations in the currency and will step in when the market is distorted. \"We won't see further significant depreciation (in the yuan) in an extreme sense,\" said Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Raiko Shareef. \"It's become apparent that the PBOC will intervene to support, and that helped the kiwi rally overnight.\" The kiwi was little changed at 89.54 Australian cents at 5pm in Wellington from 89.60 cents on Wednesday, it edged up to 82.29 yen from 81.19 yen and gained to 59.36 euro cents from 58.56 cents.
