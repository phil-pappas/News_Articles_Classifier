Once we have sound, vibrant, effective and efficient seed industry, the many of the aspects that are hindering agricultural development can actually be solved. \n'Seed is an input that is part of the important course element into the production sector so by providing improved seeds at a competitive price, farmers become more competitive,' Nunez-Rodriguez said. \nHe said when the licensing procedures are well in place that would be an input into developing the seeds industry in Ghana. \nThe Crop Varieties Licensing Policy would multiply actors in the seed industry which in turn would multiply seed availability. \nThe USAID Ghana boss said the many of the aspects of the policy needed to be strengthened as also is the connection between producers and researches. \n'Once this happens, and there is a licensing manual, then eventually the availability of improved seeds would be increased,' he said. \nThe workshop brought together representatives from the Ghana Seed Inspectorate Service, Seed Industry Associations and the Crop Research Institute (CRI) among other stakeholders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T04:38:14.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
