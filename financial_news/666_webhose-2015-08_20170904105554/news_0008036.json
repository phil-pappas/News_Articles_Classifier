The private sector airline last year ceased flying to a new airport in Mysore because of insufficient demand. \nIndia's ghost terminals were built largely by the previous government, which planned 200 'no frills' airports, encouraged by rising air travel and the need to connect far-flung regions. \nBut the empty check-in desks and cavernous baggage halls highlight the risks for Modi, too, of catering to powerful regional bosses and spending without a unifying strategy. \nChina's investment splurge has left dozens of similar ghost projects. \nThe civil aviation ministry declined to comment on whether Modi's government would stick with the 200 airport growth plan. But the incentive to grow in less-developed regions remains: on Tuesday, Modi pledged 27 billion rupees ($413 million) for four new airports in the impoverished state of Bihar, which holds elections this year. \n\"The AAI (Airports Authority of India) has invested in some airports without any economic logic,\" said Kapil Kaul, Delhi-based chief executive at consultancy Centre for Aviation (CAPA). \n\"Every state government wants to have a big airport, but you have to look at it from a national perspective and say where do we need airports, where is the demand and the growth coming from?\" he said. \nAcross India, more than half of the 100-odd domestic-only airports operated by AAI have not seen a scheduled flight this year, official data shows, though some are older airports designed primarily for chartered planes. \nThe AAI did not respond to requests for comment. \n[Graphics: \nFor data on India's airports, click http://pdf.reuters.com/pdfnews/pdfnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u=2015_08_19_09_08_50232627c466421b9baec539b8bd46d7_PRIMARY.jpg ] \nMORE PIGEONS THAN PEOPLE \nThe rush to build comes as passenger numbers grow 20 percent a year, to 38.8 million in the first half of 2015, leaving India's major airports, which account for four-fifths of traffic, saturated. \nPlans for a second hub in financial capital Mumbai are years behind schedule while the government has struggled to privatise four large airports to fund their expansion. \nThis means airlines cannot widen their networks to places like Jaisalmer dependent on feeder traffic from the gateways. \nIn the huge sunlit expanse of Jaisalmer's new arrivals lounge, two disused baggage conveyor belts gathered dust last week as pigeons nested in the roof. A group of cleaners sat next to the taxiway listening to music on their mobile phones. \n\"You should come here on your own. It's scary,\" said the airport's chief engineer. \nS.K. Singh, the local AAI director, defended the airport, saying Jaisalmer - famed for its huge sand-coloured 12th century fort - has a growing tourist industry, and the nearest functioning airport is 290 km (180 miles) away. \nAirlines are not so sure. SpiceJet's Kapoor said demand was linked to Jaisalmer's cooler winter months, making it tough to lure enough passengers. Officials at GoAir and IndiGo said they had no plans to start flights. \nAnalysts said the government would need to cut landing charges or provide funding to entice carriers. \n\"If that too doesn't work, it's better to lock up the airport and redeploy staff,\" said Amber Dubey, an aviation expert at KPMG. \n($1 = 65.3182 rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T12:43:40.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
