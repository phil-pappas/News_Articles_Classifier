Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of PhotoMedex, Inc., a Nevada corporation (referred to in this Report as \"we,\"\"us,\"\"our,\"\"PhotoMedex,\" or \"registrant\") and other statements contained in this Report that are not historical facts. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that characterize our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" included elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition or results of operations and statements - see \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" that appears at the end of this discussion. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. The following financial data in this narrative, are expressed in thousands, except for the earnings per share. Introduction, Outlook and Overview of Business Operations On June 22, 2015, the Company, and certain subsidiaries, sold the assets, and related liabilities, of the XTRAC and VTRAC business for $42.5 million in cash, including $750 in escrow. The Company realized net proceeds of approximately $41 million, substantially all of which were used to repay the credit facilities, including any outstanding forbearance fees. This asset sale was accounted for as a discontinued operation. Thus for the statements of operations, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, the activity related to the XTRAC and VTRAC business' operations through the date of disposition, and any gains or losses there from, are captured as discontinued operations. The XTRAC and VTRAC business assets and liabilities were reported to be held for sale as of December 31, 2014. Our technologies, products and research efforts are directed to addressing the worldwide aesthetic industry. We provide dermatologists, professional aestheticians, and consumers with the equipment and skin care products they need to treat acne, UV damage, hair removal and skin tightening and rejuvenation, among other skin conditions. In December 2011, PhotoMedex merged with Radiancy Inc. which brought to PhotoMedex the no!no!� line of home-use consumer products for hair removal, acne treatment, skin rejuvenation and lower back pain. In addition to a synergistic product line, Radiancy possesses a proprietary consumer marketing engine built upon direct-to-consumer sales and creative marketing programs that drive brand awareness. During 2013 and throughout 2014, we began to benefit from the impact of these marketing methodologies and expertise on our and NEOVA� topical skin care lines while continuing to realize organic and geographic growth of additional brands. To execute our strategic initiatives, we rely in part on a.) a skilled sales force to target Physicians and other healthcare professionals; b.) a developed expertize in global consumer marketing; and c.) a business model addressing the full product life cycle representing the ability to develop and commercialize innovative products from concept thru regulatory and physician acceptance, ultimately marketed directly to the consumer as dictated by normal product life cycle evolution. We believe that we are one of only a few aesthetic companies to have succeeded in taking professional technologies geared toward physicians and med spas and adapting them for the home-use market. Our professional- and consumer-use products are listed below, noting that this is not an exhaustive listing of our product portfolio but represents our current key areas of focus. \nKey Technology Platforms \n� Thermicon� brand Heat Transfer Technology. In this technique, a patented thermodynamic wire gently singes and burns off the hair above the skin's surface. It conducts heat pulses, which enable longer-lasting hair removal. This technology drives our home-use no!no! Hair Removal 8800� device, which is designed to reduce hair growth. Product variations include devices designed for men and for sensitive, small areas such as the face, among other versions including the recently launched no!no! Hair Removal PRO which introduces patented pulsed Thermicon technology producing 35% more energy aimed at removing more hair in less time. � LHE� brand Technology. LHE� combines direct heat and a full-spectrum light source to give a greater treatment advantage for psoriasis and acne care, skin tightening, skin rejuvenation, wrinkle reduction, collagen renewal, vascular and pigmented lesion treatments, and hair removal. Using LHE�, the Mistral intelligent phototherapy medical device can treat a larger spot size than a laser with less discomfort. In addition, our research finds that LHE offers meaningful results for thin, light hair. The technology is used in the no!no! Skin�, a handheld consumer product sold worldwide under the no!no!� brand. The no!no! Skin� is a 510(k)-cleared product that has been clinically shown to reduce acne by 81% over 24 hours. The technology is also used in the no!no! Glow�, which is a 510(k)-cleared device and is a miniaturized LHE device also delivering ant-aging benefits for the at-home consumer in a hand-held size. � Kyrobak�. Kyrobak uses clinically proven, proprietary technology to treat unspecified, lower back pain. The unique combination of Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) and Oscillation therapy is a non-invasive, relaxing method for long lasting relief of back pain. Used for better than 3 decades in professional rehabilitation and chiropractic settings, CPM has been proven to increase mobility of the joints, draw more oxygen and blood flow to the area, allowing the muscles to relax and release pressure between the vertebrae allowing the spine to open up and decompress. � NEOVA�. This line of topical formulations is designed to prevent premature skin aging due to UV-induced DNA damage. The therapy seeks to repair photo-damaged skin using a novel combination of two key ingredients: DNA repair enzymes and our Copper Peptide Complex�. The NEOVA line includes DNA Damage Control SILC SHEER SPF 45, an award-winning tinted sunscreen. The DNA repair enzymes of this sunscreen are clinically shown to reduce UV damage by 45% and increase UV protection by 300% in one hour. � Light-emitting Diode (LED) Technology. Our LED technology is used in both its Omnilux� and Lumi�re� Light Therapy systems. Omnilux is FDA cleared to treat wrinkles, acne, minor muscle pain and pigmented lesions, and is applicable to all skin types. Lumi�re is designed for use in non-medical applications and combines the LED light with a line of topical lotions to improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, skin tone and blemishes, giving aesthetic professionals a complete non-invasive skin care solution. \nOur revenue generation is categorized as Consumer, Physician-Recurring or Professional. Each segment benefits from the combination of our proprietary global consumer marketing engine with our direct sales force for U.S. physicians. Consumer The global consumer market is our largest business unit due to our success at bringing professional technologies into the home-use arena. Cumulatively, we have sold more than 5 million no!no!� products to consumers, the majority of whom have been in Japan and North America. We believe we have opportunity for further expansion given the cumulative number of the no!no! brand products we've sold (more than 5 million) versus the size of the major markets where we have presence and/or substantive marketing initiatives, including:, the United States with approximately 318 million people; Japan with a population of approximately 127 million people; Brazil (pop.187 million); Germany (pop. 81 million); United Kingdom (pop. 64 million); Columbia (pop. 47 million); Canada (pop. 35 million); Australia (pop. 23 million) and Hong Kong (pop. 7 million). \nOur consumer marketing platform is built upon a proprietary direct-to-consumer sales engine and creative marketing programs that drive brand awareness, in addition to presence in select retail and live Home Shopping Channels. Sales Channels Our multi-channel marketing and distribution model consists of television, online, print and radio direct-response advertising, as well as high-end retailers. We believe that this marketing and distribution model, through which each channel complements and supports the others, provides: � greater brand awareness across channels; � cost-effective consumer acquisition and education; � premium brand building; and � improved convenience for consumers. \nDirect to Consumer. Our direct-to-consumer channel consists of sales generated through infomercials, commercials, websites and call centers. We utilize several forms of advertising to drive our direct-to-consumer sales and brand awareness, including print, online, television and radio. Retailers and Home Shopping Channels. Our retailers and home shopping channels enable us to provide additional points of contact to educate consumers about our solutions, expand our presence beyond our direct to consumer activity and further strengthen and enhance our brand image. Distributors. In some territories, we operate through exclusive distribution agreements with leading distribution companies that are dominant in their respective market and have the ability to promote our products through their existing retail and home shopping networks. Markets North America. Our consumer distribution segment in North America had sales of approximately $12 million and $21 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our consumer distribution segment in North America had sales of approximately $25 million and $54 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We use a mix of direct-to-consumer advertising that includes infomercials, commercials, catalog, print, radio and internet-based marketing campaigns, coupled with select retail resellers, such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Henri Bendel, Planet Beauty, Bed, Bath & Beyond and others; home shopping channels such as HSN; and online retailers such as Dermadoctor.com and Drugstore.com. We believe these channels complement each other, as consumers that have seen our direct-to-consumer advertising may purchase at our retailers, and those who have seen our solutions demonstrated at our retailers may purchase solutions through our websites or call centers. International (excluding North America). In the international consumer segment, sales were approximately $6 million and $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the international consumer segment, sales were approximately $11 million and $16 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We utilize various sales and marketing methods including sales by direct-to-consumer, sales to retailers and home shopping channels. Our main international markets are Japan, United Kingdom and Australia with the recent additions of Germany, Brazil, Columbia and Hong Kong. Physician Recurring Physician recurring sales primarily include those generated from our NEOVA� skin care, a topical therapy combining DNA repair enzymes and copper peptide complexes to prevent premature skin aging. NEOVA represents a recurring revenue stream with significant market opportunities. In addition, our expertise in direct-to-consumer advertising and innovative marketing programs is anticipated to drive greater brand awareness and adoption for the NEOVA products. \nNEOVA� Sales of the NEOVA skin care products historically have been driven by physicians, who act as spokespersons to their patients in support of the NEOVA line. We have marketed to physicians in the dermatology and plastic surgery field, through a direct sales force but have begun to supplement these efforts with a direct-to-consumer approach to lead patients into those practices. NEOVA addresses a sizeable global market for anti-aging skin care products. In addition, we have increased marketing exposure to NEOVA by offering an introduction to the product line as an added-value purchase to consumers responding to our no!no! brand advertising. Professional Sales under the professional business segment are mainly generated from capital equipment, such as our LHE� brand products and our Omnilux and Lumi�re Light Therapy systems. We now possess a greatly expanded product offering for the physician community. We are also distributing through our direct sales force the LHE-based professional products in addition to our other equipment to physicians, dermatologists, salons, spas, and other aesthetic practitioners. We view this fully trained sales staff as a significant opportunity, as well as a resource in expanding the Professional segment of our revenues. Sales and Marketing As of June 30, 2015, our sales and marketing personnel consisted of 41 full-time positions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates in the three months ended June 30, 2015. Critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with them are regularly discussed with our Audit Committee. Those policies are discussed under \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in our \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Results of Operations (The following financial data, in this narrative, are expressed in thousands, except for the earnings per share.) Revenues The following table presents revenues from our three business segments for the periods indicated below: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Consumer $ 17,538 $ 28,453 $ 35,666 $ 69,323 Physician Recurring 1,695 2,407 3,427 4,779 Professional 691 939 1,505 1,711 Total Revenues $ 19,924 $ 31,799 $ 40,598 $ 75,813 \nConsumer Segment The following table illustrates the key changes in the revenues of the Consumer segment, by sales channel, for the periods reflected below: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Direct-to-consumer $ 12,097 $ 21,846 $ 25,870 $ 52,632 Distributors 556 711 651 1,339 Retailers and home shopping channels 4,885 5,896 9,145 15,352 Total Consumer Revenues $ 17,538 $ 28,453 $ 35,666 $ 69,323 \nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015, consumer products revenues were $17,538 compared to $28,453 in the three months ended June 30, 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, consumer products revenues were $35,666 compared to $69,323 in the six months ended June 30, 2014.The decrease of 38.4% and 48.6% during the periods, respectively, was mainly due to the following reasons: � Direct to Consumer. Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were $12,097 compared to $21,846 for the same period in 2014. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $25,870 compared to $52,632 for the same period in 2014. The decrease of 45% and 51%, respectively, was due to management's decision to significantly reduce amounts spent on short-form TV advertising during the period due to highly irregular response rates from this format as well as limited availability of relevant media at attractive cost-effective pricing. The decrease in revenue also has an impact on the total amount of sales returns liability as reflected in Note 9 of the financial statement footnotes. The methodology used to determine both the expense and the accrued liability has been consistently applied across all periods presented. � Retailers and Home Shopping Channels. Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were $4,885 compared to $5,896 for the same period in 2014. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $9,145 compared to $15,352 for the same period in 2014. The decrease of 17% and 40%, respectively, was mainly due to the timing of specials on the various home shopping channel customers, mainly in the United States (\"US\") and the UK. Furthermore, reduced levels of advertising in the Direct to Consumer channel negatively impacts sales at the retail level. � Distributors Channels. Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 were $556 compared to $711 for the same period in 2014. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $651 compared to $1,339 for the same period in 2014. The decrease in revenues of 22% and 51%, respectively, was generally due to the timing of purchase orders from our distributors. \nDue to the decline in revenues, discussed above, management determined that there was a risk of goodwill impairment for this segment. As of June 30, 2015 goodwill allocated to the Consumer segment was $20,138. We conducted a goodwill impairment analysis as of June 30, 2015. Our assessment concluded that there was not any impairment of goodwill. Our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach, with each method given equal weighting. Significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates, margins and the Company's weighted average cost of capital. We used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates. Our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions. Consumer has a fair value that is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 12%. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. Changes in our actual results and/or estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion. The following table illustrates the key changes in the revenues of the Consumer segment, by markets, for the periods reflected below: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 North America $ 11,802 $ 20,564 $ 25,127 $ 53,734 International 5,736 7,889 10,539 15,589 Total Consumer Revenues $ 17,538 $ 28,453 $ 35,666 $ 69,323 \nPhysician Recurring Segment The following table illustrates the key changes in the revenues of the Physician Recurring segment for the periods reflected below: For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Neova skincare $ 1,384 $ 1,888 $ 2,711 $ 3,815 Surgical products 281 489 653 885 Other 30 30 63 79 Total Physician Recurring Revenues $ 1,695 $ 2,407 $ 3,427 $ 4,779 \nNEOVA skincare For the three months ended June 30, 2015, revenues were $1,384 compared to $1,888 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, revenues were $2,711 compared to $3,815 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. These revenues are generated from the sale of various skin, hair, and wound care products to physicians in both the domestic and international markets. The decrease in revenues in the three and six month periods is generally due to a customer in the hair restoration business discontinuing purchasing a specific product designed for use in that type of procedure. Surgical products For the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, revenues were $281 and $489, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, revenues were $653 and $885, respectively. These revenues are generated from the sale of various related laser fibers and laser disposables in both the domestic and international markets.
