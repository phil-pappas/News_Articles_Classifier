Photo: Hulton Archive\nThere's a memorable scene in Pretty Woman where Julia Roberts' character goes shopping in a high-end store. Since she's wearing her, um, street gear, complete with knee-high boots and a revealing outfit, the shopkeepers immediately dismiss her. \"I don't think we have anything for you,\" they hiss. \"You're obviously in the wrong place. Please leave.\"\nWhat they don't realise is that she has a limitless credit card, courtesy of her new beau. She returns the next day, her arms full of luxury shopping bags. \"You work on commission, right?\" she sassily asks the same attendant. \"Big mistake. Big. Huge. I have to go shopping now!\"\nWe left empty handed. But will be returning as soon as we win the lottery.\nThat scene encapsulates customer discrimination, which occurs when sellers are biased against certain buyers. Of course, some of them regard it as discernment rather than discrimination. In the retail space, that behaviour may be driven in part by an aim to preserve the image of the store by keeping out those that are incongruent with the desired look. In other cases, it's more about not wasting time with people who appear as though they can't afford what's for sale.\nThis was brought to my attention last week in a column I wrote about blue-collar work versus white-collar work . Several readers commented on how differently they're treated when they walk into cafés and shops while wearing high-visibility work vests. They're frequently \"ignored or disrespected\" and \"frowned at\".\nAdvertisement The truth of their claims is evident in comprehensive research published in the Service Business journal late last year. The researchers conducted 270 mystery-shopping visits. At each visit, the shoppers fell into one of three categories:\nSome were dressed sloppily with oversized jeans and old sneakers. Some were clean and tidy but casual, with buttoned shirts and nice shoes. Others were quite fashionable with branded and expensive attire. Some of the results, as you can probably imagine, were quite predictable. For example, the well-dressed shoppers were far more likely to receive better service. Their experience of the store attendants was that they were exceedingly polite, patient and willing to help. In contrast, when customers were dressed poorly, they were more likely to receive negligent service.\nBut there were a couple of significant downsides for the well heeled, too. One of those was that customers who appeared to be well off experienced greater pressure to buy something, most probably because they looked as though they could afford it. Another downside, this one even more so, was that the seemingly wealthy were also given pricier Quote: s – anywhere between 10 and 40 per cent higher than what the sloppily dressed customers were Quote: d.\nSo, in effect, here's what this means. If your preference is to receive great service, ramp up the calibre of your clothing. But if your preference is to get a decent deal, it might be a good idea to dress down. As the scholars note, \"the better service comes, literally, at a price.\"\nBut much like the retail attendants in Pretty Woman, looks can be deceiving. A poorly dressed customer might be the one who's actually cashed up, while the one who's dressed to the nines may have very little disposable income. That's why, from a training perspective, it's wise to teach employees how to adopt a non-discriminatory approach to customer service.\nSuch an example was on show for my partner and me last week as we spent an entire weekend furniture shopping. We found ourselves in the kind of store where a single-seat sofa was priced at $22,000 and where an elegant dining table was valued at $60,000. (The chairs were an extra $3500. Each.) And yet despite being clearly, obviously, undeniably, unable to afford even one chair, we were still attended to as though we were Richard Gere there to spend big.\nWe left empty handed. But will be returning as soon as we win the lottery.\nHave you ever been the victim of customer discrimination? Or the culprit?\nFollow me on Twitter: @jamesadonis", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/Nu3x5SZrMHo", "https://twitter.com/jamesadonis"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:28:22.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
