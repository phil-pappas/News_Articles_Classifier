So when the “Queen of [entity display=\"QVC\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"qvc\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102632\"]QVC[/entity]” with more than 400 inventions and 200 patents bit on Marz Sprays in season four of ABC’s hit reality show, it was an omen the company would enjoy a flood of sales.After appearing on “Shark Tank” in July 2012, Keith and Brandon [tweet_Quote: display=\"Marz went from selling their vitamin and health supplement oral sprays at one weight-loss clinic to 10,000 retailers\"]Marz went from selling their vitamin and health supplement oral sprays at one weight-loss clinic to 10,000 retailers[/tweet_Quote: ] . Sales surged from $150,000 to north of $1 million. The father-son duo struck retail deals across the U.S. and dozens of countries. But it seems their 15 minutes of fame evaporated quickly. [tweet_Quote: display=\"CEO Brandon Marz shares how his Los Angeles-based company nearly drowned, how they managed to survive\"]CEO Brandon Marz shares how his Los Angeles-based company nearly drowned, how they managed to survive[/tweet_Quote: ] and the greatest lessons they learned.Ho: What kind of deal did you strike on “Shark Tank” and what did you get?Marz: The deal we shook hands on with Lori after our negotiation in the Tank was $200,000 for 25%. But we negotiated a buy-back option for half the equity at a multiple of four times the investment. Many of the Sharks afterward thought Lori was “out Sharked.”[caption id=\"attachment_913\" align=\"\" width=\"810\"] Brandon and Keith Marz, father/son owners of Marz Sprays, appeared on \"Shark Tank\" in 2012 to pitch their line of oral sprays for vitamins, sleeping, energy and weight loss. (Brandon Marz)[/caption]Ho: What value did Lori Greiner add to your business? What difference did she make?Marz: Lori is an incredibly talented business woman. She knows marketing as well as anyone and has been a great asset as a spokesperson for Marz Sprays. She has a passion for health and vitamins. She has said she uses C-Spray, our multi-vitamin spray, regularly to stay healthy.Ho: How many units did you sell at Wal-Mart?Marz: We did a test with Wal-Mart in the fourth quarter of 2012 and sold 18,000 units, our biggest order at that time.Ho: Why didn’t Wal-Mart (WMT) reorder from you?Marz: Our test allowed for placement in 450 stores. The test went well. We continue to discuss additional stores for a national roll-out. However, we do not feel we are ready for this type of commitment yet.A major mistake many small companies make is over-extending their distribution. We want to continue to develop our brand in a fashion that does not jeopardize our company by biting off more than we can handle. Upon raising capital and building the appropriate team and infrastructure, we believe we will one day be in every Wal-Mart.Ho: Getting a deal with Walgreens turned out to be both a blessing a curse. What happened?Marz: Walgreens sent us dozens of purchase orders and ordered approximately 60,000 units. When Walgreens did not pay the invoices on time, it forced us to stop sending them more products.When you are a small business and you get an order from the largest pharmacy chain in the world, you are beyond ecstatic. Momentum is created in retail very quickly. We went from one store to over 10,000 and had projections to get quickly to 50,000. When the dozens of purchase orders arrived with clear date-certain payment due dates, we did what any prudent business would do which is put together a budget and marketing plan.Keep in mind this wasn’t a small boutique, this was Walgreens. We never thought they wouldn’t pay on time. Our budget included hiring personnel to handle the implementation of the order, social media campaigns and other marketing plans to drive awareness of the product.When the payments due date came and went, our entire world was rocked. We lost momentum. We lost opportunities domestic and international because we did not have the capital to implement on our business plan. Furthermore, we could not attend trade shows or other business opportunity meetings without a travel budget. The damages are endless. We were baffled, how could the largest pharmacy chain in the world, a $100 billion company not pay us on time?Walgreens owed us over $500,000. But they offered us $25,000 to settle. We had no choice but to file a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court.Ho: What are the biggest lessons you learned from your Walgreens fiasco?Marz: Be careful! You just never know what is going to happen in business so be prepared and be conservative with your forecasts. Most small companies cannot sustain waiting over a year for a receivable.We are fighters, and we never gave up. Despite Walgreens not paying us on time and causing a whirlwind of damages for us, we were able to re-focus the business toward our online properties.In the [entity display=\"next\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"next\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3064\"]next[/entity] month, will be launching several new online campaigns focusing on health, travel and hang-over cures, all of which are perfect categories for our liquid vitamin sprays.Ho: How can other entrepreneurs avoid the same problems?Marz: They can’t. You can’t control when the other party doesn’t live up to their obligations. Despite the damages Walgreens caused us, we were not going to give up and knew we needed to go the distance against a behemoth like Walgreens. We spent nearly a year in Los Angeles Superior Court, just to be heard. The court ruled clearly that Walgreens was guilty of both breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.Most small businesses could never have sustained this fight. The judge was clear that Walgreens relied on the defense that they made a “mistake.” That mistake almost sent our business into bankruptcy. And Walgreens has not paid any damages toward their mistake. We kept a positive attitude. We believed in our fight, and we never gave up. We also were conservative with our budgeting, which allowed us to sustain a very difficult period.[youtubevid id=\"iBUrhhrKYyk\"]Ho: What are you doing now to move your business forward?Marz: Focusing on areas where we know we can be successful. We sell a lot of products online. We have some international distributors that are signing exclusive distribution agreements. We are about to launch in in several countries in South America, Singapore, and throughout Europe . 2016 will be a big year for our International growth. Also, in the coming months as our online campaigns begin, we expect significant online traction.Ho: What is your marketing strategy for selling online?Marz: There are a number of categories we are focusing online. Weight loss is our number one category given the vast number of people that are overweight. We also have products devoted to helping with overall health and wellness. Very soon we will be launching a campaign around our sleep spray product. This product includes GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), valerian root, and melatonin. It’s a little-known fact but if you do not sleep you are likely to gain weight.We also have multi-vitamin blend developed for children which we call Juicy. This product has vitamins A, B, C, D and E plus the nutrients from 29 fruits and vegetables. Children love taking ownership of the spray, love the taste and find it fun -- something you don’t typically hear from children taking gummies or chewable vitamins.Ho: Has appearing on \"Shark Tank\" and making a deal with Lori Greiner created any intended consequences or problems?Marz: Without a doubt more opportunities have been opened than closed from being on \"Shark Tank.\" Our country is comprised of small businesses and most people understand how difficult it is to run a small business and appreciate the hard-work to create a business and love asking us questions and talking about our experience on the show. We received a ton of exposure from being on \"Shark Tank\" and are very appreciative.Working with the “Shark Tank” family has been great. All the people that work on the show from Clay, the executive producer, to Lori and the other sharks and all the way down the line are respectful, courteous and class acts. We loved the experience and loved the people at the show.[caption id=\"attachment_47\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] \"Shark Tank\" star and entrepreneur Lori Greiner invested in Marz Sprays. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)[/caption]Ho: Are you going to try to license your idea to another company a la Kevin O’Leary?Licensing is a great model for certain companies and products. We have a few of our international distributors that are private labeling our products for distribution in their respective countries. We are not opposed to licensing arrangements and feel that we could be a strategic partnership for a larger health and wellness company that has distribution and wants to offer consumers an efficient and cost-effective way to deliver vitamins and nutrients.Ho: How much has Lori Greiner made on her investment in Marz Sprays?Marz: Due to confidentiality, we cannot comment on this.Ho: What is Lori doing for your company now?Marz: Lori has not been that involved lately with our company. After we didn’t get paid from Walgreens when the payments were due, we essentially stopped pursuing all retail opportunities unless ones came to us like a few did. Lori was and will be involved in that part of the business once we re-emerge into retail.Currently, we are focusing on our online and international business, neither of which she has been extremely involved in. As our comeback begins with our upcoming launch of our online campaigns and we continue to gain momentum internationally, we will then begin to focus on the U.S. retail market again. We hope that Lori will be involved in that part of our business.Ho: What is your sales in volume and dollars currently?Marz: In 2014, we did over $1 million in revenue in the first five months. We sold over 150,000 units and then, when Walgreens did not pay us on time, we were forced to pivot and change our focus to our online business and our international business. We essentially stopped business last year when we did not get our payments.It has taken us almost a year to recoup and build our online infrastructure and setup our fulfillment center. Now we are finally ready to begin generating revenue again. Next month, our online campaigns will begin and we project that we will end 2015 with a little over $2 million in revenue.Ho: How many stores overseas and the U.S. are you in now exactly?Marz: Overseas we are working with a few distributors in various parts of the world. We have a distribution agreement for Peru, Argentina and a few other countries in South America. We are fulfilling our first order for Singapore right now. We currently have products throughout several Caribbean islands and we are in negotiations with about half a dozen other distributors in and throughout the European Union as well as a few in Australia and South Africa.Many of those prospects are pharmacy chains with thousands of locations each. In the U.S., we went from just over 10,000 stores to just a few hundred independent pharmacy and grocery stores.
