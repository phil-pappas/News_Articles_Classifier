The tail between the average and lowest accepted prices narrowed to 0.15 from the previous 0.41, indicating stronger demand.\nThe benchmark 10-year JGB yield fell 1 basis point to 0.390 percent, after earlier rising as high as 0.415 percent.\nThe superlong zone lagged but prices were still well off earlier lows, with the 20-year yield and the 30-year yield both up half a basis point at 1.175 percent and 1.430 percent, respectively, after rising as high as 1.195 percent and 1.445 percent earlier.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price ended up 0.07 point at 147.69 .
