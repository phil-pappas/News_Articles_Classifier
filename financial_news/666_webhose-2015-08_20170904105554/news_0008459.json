More Calais migrant crisis hits UK business \nA year ago — before the introduction of stamp duty reforms in the Autumn Statement — London sales accounted for 43 per cent of total revenues. Under the new sliding system, a top rate of 12 per cent now applies to properties sold for £1.5m or more, which are disproportionally in London. \nGeorge Osborne, chancellor, simultaneously cut rates for all properties valued below £937,000, claiming that 98 per cent of buyers would pay less tax under the regime. \nThe stamp duty increase, combined with tax changes for foreign property owners and fears of a “mansion tax” in the run-up to the general election, have all contributed to subdued demand in the London housing market . \n“December’s rise in stamp duty appears to have had the single biggest dampening effect on demand,” said Tom Bill, head of London residential research at Knight Frank. \nAt the same time, the data show that homes valued at £1m or more contributed 34 per cent of all stamp duty receipts, compared to 26 per cent a year previously. \n“In the period between the general election and the summer holidays, buyers in London have taken stock of new market conditions, and appear less inclined to rush into making decisions,” Mr Bill added. \nBazaar Belgravia \nContinue reading \nKnight Frank’s prime central London sales index showed annual growth was 2 per cent in July 2015, compared to nearly 8 per cent a year previously. \nMeanwhile, average price increases in outer London boroughs are now outstripping those in the centre , according to separate research by CBRE, the property consultancy. \nAverage annual house price growth across 19 outer London boroughs including Waltham Forest, Enfield, and Barking and Dagenham is running at 11.3 per cent, according to CBRE’s Regional Land Report, released over the weekend. \n“We have seen significant growth in the outer boroughs,” said Jennet Siebrits, CBRE head of residential research. “The growth is swapping over [from central London].” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T13:03:21.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
