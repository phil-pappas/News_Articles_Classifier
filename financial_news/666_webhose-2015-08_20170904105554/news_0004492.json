Simon Alekna by Misa Han Primrose Riordan Frontbenchers Warren Truss, Eric Abetz, Barnaby Joyce, Sussan Ley and Ian Macfarlane took chartered transport to travel between large cities, costing taxpayers thousands of dollars.\nAnalysis of expenses data of ministers and shadow ministers reveals the ministers used chartered transport to travel between the cities when there were alternative transport options available, based on disclosures for the second half of 2014.\nNo Labor shadow minister took chartered transportation in the same period.\nUsing taxpayer funds for chartered flights for ministerial and electorate business is within Department of Finance rules, but a new review will focus on whether politicians' entitlements are within \"community expectations\".\nAgriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce was forced to take a charter flight from Canberra to Newcastle to avoid a five-hour drive. Andrew Meares Treasurer Joe Hockey said, for example, that Bronwyn Bishop's chartered return helicopter ride from Melbourne to Geelong did not pass the average Australian's \"sniff test\" .\nHere are some of the other charter flights claimed and the reasons for using the service:\nCanberra to Brisbane, $21,570 Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss took a chartered return flight from Canberra to Brisbane on the night of the 2014 federal budget, at a cost of $21,570, to address the Conservative Breakfast Club.\n Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss took a chartered return flight from Canberra to Brisbane on the night of the 2014 federal budget, at a cost of $21,570, to address the Conservative Breakfast Club. Renee Melides Mr Truss' spokesman said he incurred the expense because no commercial flights were available and the Royal Australian Air Force plane that he was supposed to take broke down.\n\"There was no alternative. We could not cancel the event late on the evening before the breakfast speech, which some 120 people were attending,\" the spokesman said.\nToowoomba to Canberra, $11,082 Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane claimed $11,082 to travel on chartered transport from Toowoomba to Canberra.\nGraphic Mr Macfarlane has explained previously he needed to be in Canberra that morning for a policy announcement with Tony Abbott but had to be back in Toowoomba later in the day for the opening of a refurbished arts centre, to which the federal government had contributed $2 million.\nThen he had to get back to Canberra for ministerial meetings at night and cabinet the next morning.\nSenator Barry O'Sullivan, whose home base is also Toowoomba, did the trip in two separate legs, a $406 Canberra-to-Brisbane flight plus a $183 one-and-a-half-hour car ride.\nCanberra to Hobart, $7018 Employment Minister Eric Abetz spent $7018 on chartered transport for a return trip from Canberra to his home base of Hobart on November 14, 2014.\nMr Abetz' spokesman said he had an estimates committee hearing in Canberra that conflicted with a commitment in Tasmania the night before and he took the charter plane because there were no commercial flights that morning that would have delivered Mr Abetz to Canberra in time for the hearing.\nCanberra to Melbourne, $6305 Sussan Ley, then Assistant Education Minister, spent $6305 on chartered transport travelling from Canberra to Melbourne's Essendon Airport, 17 minutes from the Melbourne central business district, on July 22, 2014.\nMs Ley's office said she had two conflicting official childcare engagements in Canberra and Melbourne – the release of the Productivity Commission report on childcare and the opening of mobile childcare services – within a few hours of each other.\n\"In order to ensure both important ministerial commitments were met, the most time-efficient and cost-effective direct form of transport available between the two cities at that time of day was organised within official rules,\" Ms Ley's spokesman said. He said Ms Ley had no control over when the Productivity Commission report was released.\nMelbourne MP Adam Bandt did the same trip at the cost of $334 in the same month.\nCanberra to Newcastle, $4250 Agricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce spent $4250 travelling from Canberra to Newcastle on chartered transport on September 4, 2014.\nHe visited the GrainCorp chief executive and discussed the government's proposed mandatory code of conduct for grain export terminals.\nMr Joyce's office said the drive from Canberra to Carrington is more than five hours, not taking into account peak hour traffic in Sydney on the Friday morning.\nThe spokesman said at the time there was no longer a direct flight to Newcastle and the only alternative, to Port Stephens, would have meant the minister would have been almost two hours late.\nNewcastle MP Sharon Claydon did the same route using a private vehicle, at the cost of $330, later in September.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/08august/Apology%20Generator/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/iframeresizer/iframeResizer.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-05T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:06:45.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
