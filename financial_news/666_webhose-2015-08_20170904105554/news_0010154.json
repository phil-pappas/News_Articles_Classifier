Uber — Lyft — Sidecar: The Most Affordable Rideshare Service in Major U.S. Cities \nThe answer to which rideshare service offers the best value depends on where you are, the length of your trip, and even what day it is, as rideshare pricing models and policies are frequently in flux. \nHarry Campbell, rideshare expert and founder of TheRidshareGuy.com , tracks the evolving pricing of the rideshare industry. He recommended paying special attention to differences in high-demand models at peak times. \n“Uber is famous for its surge pricing, which increases the cost of a ride during peak times like Saturday evenings,” Campbell said. “Lyft, on the other hand, has its own version of surge pricing called Prime Time. But since Lyft is less popular than Uber, it's often way cheaper during peak demand times. Additionally, Lyft caps their Prime Time pricing.” \n* Fees included. \nMethodology: Using the published pricing models of Uber, Lyft and Sidecar on their respective websites, the cost of a low-traffic trip — defined as a 10-mile, 20-minute ride — and the cost of a high-traffic trip — defined as a 10-mile 60-minute ride — were calculated and compared in each of the 20 most populous cities in America with two or more of the specified rideshare services in operation. Cities with only one of the qualifying rideshare services in operation were excluded and replaced with the next most-populous American city. Trip fares were calculated using general pricing rates, including all applicable fees, such as safety fees and city fees, but without surge or prime-time pricing. Variable fees such as tolls, airport fees, cancellation penalties and other trip-specific additions were not included in this analysis. Prices are accurate as of Aug. 21, 2015, and are subject to change at the discretion of the individual rideshare organizations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:14:55.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
