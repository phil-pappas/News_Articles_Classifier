(Staff photo: Bill Klotz ) Top Projects: Minnesota State Fair West End Market By: Elizabeth Millard August 21, 2015 7:06 am 0 \n1265 Snelling Ave. N., Falcon Heights \nProject cost: $16.9 million \nProject size: 36,500 square feet of new buildings and pavilions; 215,300-square-foot gross area \nOwner: Minnesota State Fair \nArchitect: Cuningham Group Architecture Inc. \nEngineers: Reigstad & Associates (structural); Anderson Engineering (civil); Spriggs Plumbing & Heating (mechanical); Collins Electric (electrical) \nEditor’s note: This is the 15th installment of Finance & Commerce’s Top Projects of 2014 series. Previous installments are available here . \nMaking major changes to an iconic landscape like the Minnesota State Fair is challenging enough, but developers and contractors also had less than a year — with a significant portion of it in the winter — to shepherd a project from groundbreaking to opening day. \nAlthough visitors might appreciate all that hard work when they see West End Market, the timeframe was certainly the most challenging aspect of the project, said Mike McGough of McGough Construction. \n“We started two months later than originally planned, and then ended up losing 32 days throughout the project due to cold weather and rain,” he said. \nEncompassing vendor pavilions, an amphitheater, service building, restaurants, museum, plazas and landscape areas, the West End Market replaces an area once known as Heritage Square. Built in the 1970s as a temporary project, the shops and restaurants there needed to be removed, and a new main entrance built as well. \nMcGough said that because of the short timeframe, materials were ordered well in advance and developers implemented lean construction techniques to increase efficiency. \n“My favorite aspect of the project, by far, was the experience of working collaboratively with the entire project team,” he said. “Most important, without the leadership and timely decision making from every Minnesota State Fair team member, the project would have had zero chance of success of finishing on time.” \nAnother aspect that everyone appreciated was the high-profile visibility of the project, said architect Brian Tempas of Cuningham Group Architecture. \n“This is a project that has a profound effect on the fairgrounds,” he said. “It will be seen by millions of people and enjoyed for a long time to come. I think everyone on the project had a sense that although this was a massive undertaking in a very shortened schedule, we were creating a place that’s important and enjoyable. We were a part of the state’s history.” \nAdditional photos of the West End Market by Staff Photographer Bill Klotz: Pause Play Play Prev | Next The new amphitheater in the Minnesota State Fair’s West End Market was built in the former Heritage Square area.
