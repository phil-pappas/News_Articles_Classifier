The benefits of existing infrastructure, geographical location and ease of travel, communication, and safety and security of the country more than outweigh any perceived costs. \n\"An efficient low tax environment is unlikely to see an exodus of expatriates or deter foreign investors from entering the market. Both Singapore and Hong Kong are testament to this. The UAE enjoys a similar geographical advantage as these markets, in terms of being a gateway to the fast-growth economies of the Middle East, the Indian sub continent and Africa. \n\"We are following closely the updates from the Ministry of Finance in order to best prepare our clients for the possible financial consequences of sales and corporation taxes in the UAE.\" \nThe six oil exporting states of the Gulf Cooperation Council have been studying the introduction of VAT for years. The plunge of oil prices since last year has slashed governments' income, making it more urgent for them to find new revenue; the UAE is expected this year to post its first budget deficit since 2009. \nBut VAT has been delayed partly because it is politically sensitive, and partly because GCC governments have been unable to agree on details. Analysts believe that to limit smuggling and damage to the competitiveness of economies, the tax would probably have to be introduced regionally rather than by individual countries at different times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T02:45:15.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
