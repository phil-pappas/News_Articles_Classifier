Photo: Dominic K Lorrimer, AFR\nThe proliferation of smartphones provides banks with an unprecedented opportunity to slash overheads and boost profits and will lead to the widespread closure of branches as more customers bank on the move, a survey by investment bank UBS shows.\nUBS analysts from London, New York, Hong Kong and Japan worked with KPMG on the 54-page report, published in July, which surveyed 67 bank management teams in 18 countries. Those banks on average expect a 5.6 per cent reduction in branches as a direct consequence of their mobile banking strategy.\nBut in Australia, where bank branch numbers have remained steady for many years, banks participating in the survey expect a larger reduction in the number of branches over the coming years, of 11 per cent.\nUsing the latest numbers from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority at June 2014 there were 5483 bank branches in Australia. The closure of 11 per cent would amount to 603 branches.\nAdvertisement Branch closure remains a taboo topic for management, given union pressure and the widespread belief that branches remain an important place for face-to-face interaction, which can deepen relationships. Many bank branches around the country have been reconfigured, removing tellers and creating drop-in environments, where customers can be sold additional products.\nUBS said globally over the next three years mobile banking could provide cumulative 10 per cent cost cuts and a 6 per cent revenue boost for banks. Within three years, 46 per cent of all banking transactions were expected to be mobile-related, up from 25 per cent today and 13 per cent two years ago, the survey found.\nTransformational technology \"We believe mobile banking will be a transformational technology in the future and that businesses that are more committed to this technology are likely to see the most benefit in the years ahead,\" UBS said.\nThe UBS report, titled \"Is a bank in your pocket the next big thing?\" and part of the Q-Series produced by the UBS Evidence Lab, points to a future where mobile phones provide a range of new banking features. These will include tap-and-go functionality at the point of sale, image capturing for deposits and payments, and social media banking apps. It also reckons banks will allow customers to store documents in the bank's cloud, and will provide voice navigation, mobile marketing and fraud-prevention alerts.\nThe arrival of internet-connected smartwatches will also change banking, UBS says. \"Going forward, emerging technology and innovation will further enhance mobile banking functionalities that aim to develop deep customer relationships and superior mobile banking experiences, such as communication enrichment, a comprehensive 'mobile wallet', and content monetisation, (for example) revenues related to music and e-book downloads.\"\nAustralia's big banks are increasing their integration of more customer-centric applications into their mobile offerings. Last week, Commonwealth Bank of Australia illustrated the potential of mobile phone banking when it announced a deal with Westfield to push to customers offers from the shopping centre they have entered, via the bank's app.\nReal-time monitoring CBA chief executive Ian Narev told a lunchtime audience in Sydney in July the bank was investing in real-time monitoring of customers.\n\"These days, you have to understand in real time what your customers are doing and react in real time,\" Mr Narev said. \"And that aspect in the use of technology to drive customer engagement will be our number one priority.\"\nNational Australia Bank announced last week that NAB Ventures, a $50 million innovation fund, would seek investment in start-ups working in big data and payments , in a sign accelerating the bank's mobile strategy is a priority for chief executive Andrew Thorburn.\nUBS also surveyed 20,681 consumers as part of its report, who evaluated more than 200 banks in 18 countries. They said mobility capability was already a key factor in the selection of a new bank and mobile customers had a higher likelihood of recommending a bank than non-mobile users â€“ suggesting the technology can boost \"net promoter scores\" (a key performance indicator at National Australia Bank).\nThe report also showed how the mobile channel is catching up to the internet channel, with mobile expected to be used by more customers than internet web pages in three years.\nUBS said the banks with the best mobile strategies in the world were Spain's BBVA, Bank of America and Fifth Third from the US, Swedbank and Canada's TD Bank.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/commonwealth-bank-app-to-target-westfield-shoppers-as-they-walk-in-the-door-20150730-ginkcm", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/nab-ventures-created-to-invest-50m-in-fintech-20150729-gin0tg"], "published": "2015-08-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:31:01.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
