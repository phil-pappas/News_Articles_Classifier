Construction of single-family houses accounted for all of the gains, shooting up 12.8 percent last month to the highest rate since December 2007.\nFueled by steady job gains and low mortgage rates, total housing starts have risen 11.3 percent year-to-date. The market is attracting more buyers and renters, as starts for apartment buildings have climbed 12.2 percent so far this year despite last month's drop.\nBut the report also showed the potential limits of new construction.\nApproved building permits decreased 16.3 percent in July to an annual rate of 1.12 million, after achieving an eight-year high in June. The decrease likely reflects some pullback after months of gains and was caused primarily by a sharp plunge in permits to construct apartment complexes.\nHomebuyers and renters have crowded into the housing market this year, pushing up prices to levels that have worsened affordability. Builders have relieved some of this financial pressure by ramping up construction, yet the increases in housing starts and building permits still lags the surging demand.\nPurchases of new homes are 21.2 percent higher through the first six months of this year than the same period in 2014. Existing homes are selling at an annual rate of 5.49 million, the fastest pace since February 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nConsistent hiring gains and low mortgage rates have led to greater optimism among builders.\nThe National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Monday reached 61 this month, up from 60 in July. Any reading above 50 signals expansion.\nStill, only 5.4 months' supply of new homes is available, compared to six months in a healthy market. Construction of single-family houses has risen at roughly half the pace of sales growth for new homes.\nIn the rental sector, prices are increasing at double the rate of hourly wage growth largely because of fewer vacant apartments available. Home rental prices are up 4.3 percent in the past year, according to the real estate firm Zillow. Average hourly earnings have improved a mere 2.1 percent.\nThe increased demand primarily reflects an economy operating from a stronger foundation of hiring as the recovery enters its seventh year.\nEmployers added 215,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate held at 5.3 percent for the second straight months. The economy has benefited from nearly 3 million new jobs in the past year, an influx of paychecks that has boosted the housing and construction sectors.\nLow mortgage rates have also helped sales. The average 30-year, fixed mortgage rate was 3.94 percent last week, according to the mortgage firm Freddie Mac. That is roughly two percentage points below the historical average.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
