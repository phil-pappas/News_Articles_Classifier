Following several sessions in which the government had previously played hardball, Prime Minister Dr Ruhakana Rugunda called a meeting at his office last Wednesday. \nThe meeting had Dr Rugunda, Finance Minister Matia Kasaijja and Education State Minister Prof Sandy Stevens Tickodri Togboa on the one hand and the striking staff, united as the Public Universities Non-Teaching Staff Executive Forum (Puntsef) on the other. According to sources at the meeting, Puntsef officials were quickly swept off the carpet by a quick concession by government. \n\"Government appreciated the concerns raised by the non-teaching staff and agreed to address the matter by ensuring equity in the salary enhancement across all categories of staff in public universities,\" said Kasaijja, at the urging of Dr Rugunda. \nPuntsef were beside themselves with excitement, but were stunned with what came next. The government agreed that enhancement would take effect from financial year 2016/17, and not immediately, as Puntsef had wanted. \nPuntsef Chairman Jackson Betihamah was quick to remind the ministers that his membership would not accept this, as they had already made too much sacrifice. \n\"With all due respect, we cannot take the minister's statement as members have repeatedly asked for a commitment from government to enhance their pay,\" Betihamah said. \nIt was then left to Prof Tickodri Togboa to explain that the state had agreed to enhance the administrative staff pay, but this would be done over time, as Kasaijja later explained in a statement released after the meeting.. \n\"The salary arrears arising out of non-payment of enhanced salaries in the FY 2015/16 shall be paid in a phased manner starting in FY 2016/17 and ending in FY 2017/18,\" Kasaija said. \nPuntsef members would get 50 per cent of the arrears, along with the pay rise in the next fiscal year, and the balance in the FY 2017/18. Puntsef members then insisted that the government put its commitment in writing before the meeting could end, which was done. \nFollowing this meeting, the Puntsef executive held their own session at Kyambogo, at which most rejected the outcome of the meet with the prime minister. \n\"Most wanted the money immediately, rather than a promise to increase their pay,\" Betihamah recalled. \"But we resolved to pass this on to the general assembly before we report back to the prime minister [on Monday].\" \nSTRIKE CHALLENGES \nAdministrative staff at Makerere, Mubs, Must, Gulu and Kyambogo universities held their respective general assemblies to agree on the matter on Friday, while Busitema will hold its session today, as they have varied campuses. After the meetings, Puntsef will report their position to the prime minister, before deciding when to end their industrial action. \nJust four days into the strike, some non-teaching staff at Mbarara University were threatened with dismissal for participating in industrial action. Elsewhere, an official was seen breaking the padlocks of residential halls at Kyambogo University to allow students on a short course to reside there temporarily. But Betihamah urged the affected staff to remain resolute. \n\"Workers have the right to lay down their tools when they feel cheated, I urge all the non-teaching staff not to back off, we are going to sit at home until something is done,\" he said. \n\"Our determination is not only in one university, we are working in all public universities anybody who will try to dismiss any member risks legal action.\" \nORIGINS \nThe matter first came to a head following a strike by Makerere University staff over poor pay last year. President Museveni then summoned the representatives of the striking staff and ordered an enhancement of their salaries of only the academic staff, starting this financial year, with the highest ranked professor earning Shs 15m per month, up from Shs 2m. The increments would affect academic staff at all public universities. \nWhile the academic staff rejoiced, the matter did not go down well with the administrative staff, who argued that they were being discriminated against. \nAccording to Mahmoud Khalid, the acting chairperson of the senior administrative staff association at Gulu University, the lowest paid support staff (office attendants) earn Shs 280,000 while the highest paid (Academic registrar, University secretary and Deans of students) receive Shs 3m as net pay. \nAt Makerere, Puntsef general secretary Bruce Twesigye, said the lowest support staff (a cleaner) earns Shs 260,000 while the highest paid is the University secretary at Shs 3.6m. So, Puntsef officials asked the president to revisit his stance on the matter, last month. \nEarlier, on April 11, the workers had written to prime minister Ruhakana Rugunda, and to the speaker of parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, on April 20. In an April 18 meeting held at Kyambogo University this year, Puntsef members gave government up to July 15 to address their concerns. That date was postponed to August 8, after members were urged to petition the president first. \nThe statement indicates that the staff could go on strike by August 8, when the next semester begins. The document, dated July 22 is also copied to Education Minister Jessica Alupo and Police chief Kale Kayihura. \nAfter it is sanctioned by the government, the move would require the government to appropriate a further Shs 31bn to the payroll per year. \nComputations of money needed to enhance the salaries of non-teaching staff by universities \nUNIVERSITY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T16:51:05.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
