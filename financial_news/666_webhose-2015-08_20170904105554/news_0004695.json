It can be seen from Robin’s suit in the trailer, which resembles man’s body size. So, Robin is possibly a young man played by director Zack Snyder’s son Eli Snyder.\nEven if the rumour is true, it is still unclear whether Malone will play Batgirl or Oracle in the upcoming movie.\n“Batman v Superman” centres on the conflict between the two titular superheroes, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill). It will mark the launching of DC Cinematic Universe in which other superheroes such as Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Aquaman (Jason Momoa) join the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel.\nDirected by Zack, the movie will arrive in US theatres on March 25, 2016.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 10:03 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:21:32.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
