With approximately 270 deaths, 2014 was the first year-over-year increase this decade, the agency said. And 2015 has begun with major accidents at crossings near New York City, Los Angeles and in North Carolina. It's not yet clear when the audio and visual alerts will begin popping up. Google Maps said it sees a chance to make the maps more useful, spokeswoman Mara Harris said. The railway administration also has asked Apple, TomTom, MapQuest and Garmin to participate, agency spokesman Matthew Lehner said. In a blog post, the agency's acting administrator wrote that Google will stitch the locations of approximately 250,000 public and private crossings into its maps. \"For drivers and passengers who are driving an unfamiliar route, travelling at night, or who lose situational awareness at any given moment, receiving an additional alert about an upcoming crossing could save lives,\" acting administrator Sarah Feinberg wrote.
