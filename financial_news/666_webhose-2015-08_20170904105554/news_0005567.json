It will do little to dent our youth unemployment rate of 36% or provide opportunities for youth who account for 67% of the unemployed. \nThis policy amounts to nothing more than an ANC tinkering with an experiment that is destined to fail to the detriment of both the state and the millions of youths who so desperately seek a better life through dignified employment. \nPhumzile van Damme \nDA National Spokesperson | Deputy Shadow Minister in the Presidency South Africa \nEnergy minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson caused a stir on Tuesday when she tabled a document classified as secret at a … see more » Copyright © 2015 Democratic Alliance.
