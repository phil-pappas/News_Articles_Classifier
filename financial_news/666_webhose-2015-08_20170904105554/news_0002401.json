(AAP Image/Lukas Coch) NO ARCHIVING LUKAS COCH Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The split in the Abbott government over gay marriage has widened with the Attorney-General George Brandis slapping down calls by fellow minister Scott Morrison for a referendum and Malcolm Turnbull demanding Parliament be given a vote on the matter before the election.\nAs well, six Coalition backbenchers are now one the record as voting to cross the follow should Tony Abbott ever allow the private members bill pushed by Liberal MP Warren Entsch to be debated. This is highly unlikely.\nSenator Brandis, one of 16 Liberal frontbenchers who spoke in favour of a conscience vote during Tuesday night's marathon party room debate, said there was no reason at all to change the constitution.\nIf it was agreed to adopt gay marriage, then only the Marriage Act needed to be changed by the Parliament. A constitutional change was not required to trigger this as Mr Morrison is pushing and Mr Abbott is considering.\nMr Turnbull, who wants a conscience vote, backed Senator Brandis in slamming calls for a referendum.\nHe said parliament should be allow a conscience vote on legalising gay marriage straight away but if iyt passed, the result would be contingent on a plebiscite so people knew what they were voting for.\n\"That would at least deal with the issue one wat or another before the next election,\" he said.\nâ€‹Senator Brandis' offensive underscores beliefs by pro-gay marriage Liberals and Labor that a push by conservatives for a referendum after the next election was a ploy to delay further debate and then kill off gay marriage.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements The Australian Financial Review revealed on Thursday that Mr Abbott has been discussing a referendum with Mr Morrison for some weeks and was open to a referendum rather than a plebiscite but had made no decision.\nIt is much harder to effect change with a referendum. A plebiscite is non-binding and to pass requires only a national majority.\nA referendum is binding but to pass, requires a majority of the states as well as a national majority. Referendums rarely succeed, especially when they lack the support of the prime minister , as a gay marriage vote would.\nMr Morrison told the Financial Review that he backs a referendum to change s51(21) of the constitution to insert the words \"opposite sex\" and \"same sex\" before the word \"marriage\".\nIf passed, Mr Morrison said it would require the Marriage Act to then be amended to bring it in line with the Constitution by removing the definition of marriage as that only between a man and a woman.\nSenator Brandis scoffed at the proposal, saying using a referendum to drive a change in the Marriage Act was \"entirely unnecessary\"\nThis had been shown by the High Court decision when Senator Brandis intervened to stop the ACT allowing gay marriage two years ago.\n\"That is an unambiguous, a unanimous and a recent statement by the High Court that the marriage power as currently written is ample to provide the Parliament with the power to legislate for same-sex marriage,\" he told Sky News.\n\"There is no doubt whatsoever that an amendment to the Constitution is necessary should the Parliament proceed down this path.\"\nShadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus backed Senator Brandis.\n\"Scott Morrison is talking nonsense,\" he said.\n\"The Constitution leaves no doubt on that subject, and as the High Court helpfully made clear in its decision, marriage has changed depending on how the Commonwealth Parliament has chosen to legislate about it at different times, and it can change again.\"\nThe MPs willing to cross the floor are Mr Entsch, Dean Smith, Wyatt Roy, Teresa Gambaro, Natasha Griggs, and Ken Hogan.\n-with Primrose Riordan", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-13T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:09:37.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
