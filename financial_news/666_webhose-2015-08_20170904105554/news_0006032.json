Getty Images Share on twitter by John Stensholt English Premier League giant Manchester City has paid $2.25 million to a group of prominent Australian investors to take full ownership of A-League club Melbourne City.\nAccording to documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission last week, Manchester City now owns 100 per cent of its Melbourne club, having bought out minority owners Gerry Ryan, a BRW Rich List member and owner of caravan group Jayco, Crownbet chief executive Matthew Tripp, sports entrepreneur Bart Campbell and New Zealand businessman Michael Witt.\nThe quartet previously owned 20 per cent of Melbourne City under the terms of the deal struck in January 2013 as part of Manchester City's push to own several teams around the world.\nCampbell and his consortium, which own NRL club Melbourne Storm, had led negotiations for the $11.25 million purchase of the club formerly known as Melbourne Heart.\nManchester City has effectively bought the quartet out for as much as they put into the original deal, having had an option to buy the 20 per cent shareholding at that valuation since the purchase.\nThe Premier League club, which begins its season in England later in August, also owns a majority share of United States Major League Soccer team New York City FC and a 20 per cent stake in Japanese club Yokohama, majority owned by car company Nissan â€“ a sponsor of City's teams around the world.\nRecord breaking goals Melbourne City is pushing to sign a record 14,000 members ahead of the 2015-16 A-League season beginning in October, when the club will stream real time data and statistics from GPS tracking devices to fans during matches from its first home match onwards.\n Two other A-League clubs could also experience a change of ownership group by the first game in early October, Brisbane Roar and Newcastle Jets.\nBrisbane Roar's owners, the Indonesian business family the Bakries, are selling after running into serious financial issues. The club faces a winding up order from rugby union team Queensland Reds over unpaid rent for a training facility.\nFootball Federation Australia currently controls the Jets after stripping its former owner Nathan Tinkler of his licence in May.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-08-02T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:09:02.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
