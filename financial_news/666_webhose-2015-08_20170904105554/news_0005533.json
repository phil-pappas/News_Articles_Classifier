Share on twitter by John Davidson Acknowledging the reality that almost half of the users of its popular Galaxy Note phone never actually use the feature that gave it its name, Samsung has split the Note family in two.\nIt's announced the Note5, an update with the Note's traditional note-taking stylus designed for people interested in productivity applications, and a new line of Note-sized phones that lack the stylus, which are designed for users interested in the Note more for its huge screen than for its handwriting capabilities.\nThe new stylus-free phone, known as the Galaxy S6 edge+, has the same oversized, 5.7-inch screen as the Note5, but instead of the stylus has a curved screen that wraps around the edge of the phone, just like Samsung's S6 edge that came out earlier this year .\nThe edge+ looks to be designed to help Samsung better compete with Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, which arguably was itself based on the Note, given that the Note was the phone that popularised large screen sizes when it was first released in 2011. By releasing a huge phone without a stylus, Samsung is hoping to appeal to customers who wanted the big screen, but found the productivity focus of the Note off-putting. Similarly, by splitting off the Galaxy edge+, Samsung frees itself to focus more than ever on selling the Note as a productivity tool for executives.\nNew software lets the Note5, S6 edge+ and presumably other Samsung phones interact with your PC or Mac Such is the competition in the plus-sized phone market nowadays that Samsung appears to have brought forward the launch of the Note5 and edge+ to get the jump on Apple, which is expected to announce a new big iPhone, the iPhone 6s Plus, on September 9. Samsung usually launches its new Note phones at the IFA technology fair in Berlin, which this year will overlap with the rumoured Apple launch date.\nIn terms of inner workings, Samsung says the new edge+ has more in common with the new Note5 – in this respect the two are identical, with new 16/5 megapixel rear/front cameras, a new 8-core processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM and enhanced payments technology – but in terms of design, the new phone is simply a Galaxy S6 edge with a 5.7-inch screen rather than a 5.1-inch screen.\nUnder-used stylus Launching the two new phones here in New York, Samsung said its internal research into the usage of the Note had revealed that only 60 per cent of its buyers ever used its stylus. This is hidden in the bottom of the phone and can be pulled out and used to write on the screen, like a pen on paper or like an old-fashioned Palm Pilot personal digital assistant, one of the precursors to the modern smart phone.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

The same goes for the S6 edge+. The removal of the replaceable battery and the SD Card slot from the Galaxy S6 led to some Galaxy fans complaining they would have to stick to the Galaxy S5.\nBoth the Note5 and the S6 edge+ have the easier-to-use fingerprint-scanning technology Samsung introduced with the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge. This lets users unlock their phones and identify themselves to secure apps just by placing their finger on the phone's home button. The Note 4 requires the user to swipe her or his finger over the home button, which can prove awkward when the phone is being held in one hand.\nBoth phones also have a smaller bezel – the frame around the screen – that make the phones noticeably narrower and fractionally shorter than the Note 4, while still having the same 5.7-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel display. That resolution on this size screen works out to be 518 pixels per inch, making it one of the sharpest displays on the market, but not as sharp as the 577-pixel-per-inch display on Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S6 edge.\nSamsung officials said they had still yet to decide whether they would take advantage of that very-high-resolution display by releasing a Gear VR headset for the phones, that would use the phone as the basis of a virtual reality system.\nAnd though the mobile payments technology on the two new phones has been improved, making it compatible with far more cash registers than the payments technology in Apple's recent iPhones, that new technology doesn't directly apply in Australia, said Australian officials present at the New York launch. Payments software tailored for Australia will be launched for the new phones early in the new year, they said.\nFULL SPECS Operating System Android 5.1 (Lollipop)\nNetwork LTE Cat.9 / LTE Cat.6 * May differ by markets and mobile operators\nDimensions 154.4 x 75.8 x 6.9mm, 153g (edge+)\n153.2 x 76.1 x 7.6mm, 171g (Note5)\nProcessor Octa core (2.1GHz Quad + 1.5GHz Quad), 64 bit, 14 nm process\nMemory 4GB RAM (LPDDR4) , 32/64GB (UFS 2.0) ,\nDisplay 5.7\" Quad HD Super AMOLED 2560 x 1440 (518ppi)\nCamera Rear : 16MP OIS (F1.9) , Front : 5MP (F1.9)\nBattery 3,000mAh, Fast Charging both on wired and wireless.
