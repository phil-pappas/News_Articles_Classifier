Brendan McDermid US investors are tipping the rout in global markets is more like a repeat of the 1997 stock market correction that was triggered by the Asian financial crisis, rather than the great crash of 2008.\nUBS Wealth Management global chief investment officer Mark Haefele said investors should brace for further volatility, but in developed markets the bout of risk aversion should pass.\n\"Despite the ongoing weakness in some emerging markets, especially China, Brazil, and Russia, domestic drivers in the US and Europe have not deteriorated significantly and we expect growth to remain on track in these economically larger regions,\" Mr Haefele said in a note to clients on Monday.\nAt the end of Monday's chaotic trading , the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 588 points or 3.57 per cent to 15,871, the broader S&P 500 Index sank 3.94 per cent to 1893 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ slumped 3.98 per cent to 9789. The Dow's 1089.42-point swing from its session low to its high is the biggest one-day net point swing in the average's history.\n The Dow is also at an 18-month low and the country's major stock indexes have fallen more than 2 per cent for each of the past three days.\nIn the US, many investors have been warning that the bull market run was overdue for a correction.\nWhile some traders are bearish about the stock market, there is a palpable sense on Wall Street that the \"China made\" downturn will not badly hurt the US.\nThe US economy is growing, unemployment dropping, home building picking up and consumer spending improving.\nDavid Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates said the first US market correction in four years was \"long overdue\" and not like the \"Black market\" crash in 1989, the tech wreck in 2001 or the financial crisis of 2008.\n\"We're importing this from abroad,\" Mr Rosenberg said.\n\"The secular bull market is not over unless you think the US is going to tip into recession, and I don't think that is going to happen.\"\n\"Domestically there are still some areas that are opening up some very nice buying opportunities right now.\"\nEconomist Justin Wolfers summed up the market crash with a simple chart on Twitter.\nThe stock market plunge, in perspective.

China's market has fallen nearly 40 percent since June, after more than doubling in the past year.\nGermany's DAX fell into an official bear market and at the end of Monday was down 22 per cent from its April high.\nInvestors are swarming into safe have assets like US Treasury bonds.
