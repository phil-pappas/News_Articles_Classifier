Leasing momentum remains strong, buoyed by solid economic performance in Germany and declining vacancy rates in the Big 7 office markets; High retention ratio of 85% in Q2 2015, including the early renewal of approximately 251,000 square feet of space with Deutsche Post; Rising in-place rents with average in-place rents up 6.0% year-to-date to EUR9.39 in Q2 2015 from EUR8.86 at the end of 2014; Improving leasing spread with market rents exceeding in-place rents by 3.7% as at Q2 2015; NOI in euros increased by 3.7% in Q2 2015 compared to Q1 2015. Investment highlights $63 million increase in the value of investment properties and investments in joint ventures resulting from leasing activity and cap rate compression, reflecting strong investor demand for German office properties; Acquisition pipeline remains active with approximately $129 million of acquisitions under contract or exclusivity, subject to due diligence review, at an average cap rate of 5.8% and an expected average borrowing rate of approximately 1.9% for a 10-year term. These high quality, multi-tenant office buildings are centrally located in the German cities of Berlin, Essen and Erfurt; Continued capital recycling program during Q2 with the sale of 16 properties from the Trust's Initial Portfolio for gross proceeds of $24 million. Including 20 additional properties currently under contract, the 2015 year-to-date dispositions total approximately $103 million. Successful lease negotiations with Deutsche Post leading to renewal of majority of space subject to 2016 termination rights Proactive negotiations resulting in the retention of 84% of the gross rental income (\"GRI\") relating to the space subject to 2016 early termination rights. Direct lease negotiations with Deutsche Postbank (\"Postbank\") in eight buildings, or 26,000 square feet of subleased space, could further increase GRI retention to almost 100%. \n\"We are very pleased with the outcome of our lease negotiations with Deutsche Post. Our focus on better understanding their space requirements and proactively addressing them, was a key factor in their decision to retain the majority of the space for which they had a termination option. Of the 393,000 square feet which could have been terminated, they will retain 14 out of 16 buildings, or 342,000 square feet, accounting for the majority of their space and GRI,\" said Alexander Sannikov, Vice President, Portfolio Management of Dream Global REIT. \nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Gross leasable area (\"GLA\") (in square feet) 13,393,180 Occupancy rate - including committed (period-end) 86.1 Average in-place net rent per square foot (period-end) EUR Market rents above in-place net rents 3.7 Adjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") (3) 20,397 DRIP participation ratio (for the period) 14 Weighted average face rate of interest on debt (period-end) (1)(6) 3.06 Level of debt (net debt-to-gross book value, net of cash) (1)(3) 51 Debt - average term to maturity (years) (1)(3)(5) 4.4 151,327 (1) Reflects owned share of joint venture properties starting in Q4 2014.

The property was developed in 2001, and is one of the premiere office properties in the market. The Trust will acquire the property for $26.6 million, at a cap rate of 7.1%, using equity from its balance sheet and financing at 55% loan-to-value. We anticipate an interest rate of approximately 1.7% for ten years. This acquisition is scheduled to close in Q3 2015. \nTo view the photo of Anger 81, Erfurt associated with this release, please visit the following link: www.marketwire.com/library/20150805-anger81erfurt800.jpg . \nCapital recycling - 16 properties were disposed of during Q2 2015 at 104% of their fair value as part of the Trust's continuing capital recycling program for an aggregate sales price of $24.0 million. \nIn addition, as at June 30, 2015, 20 properties were under contract, bringing the total number of properties sold or under contract during 2015 to 46 assets, and with gross proceeds from these sales of approximately $102.5 million, representing 102% of their fair value. \nInvestment Properties - during Q2 2015, due to a combination of leasing activities and cap rate compression in Germany, the value of the investment properties increased by $41.3 million. In addition, investment in joint ventures increased by $21.8 million, reflecting the increase in the value of the Trust's share in the joint venture investment properties. \nFinancing - The lending environment in Germany remains favourable with mortgage rates near their lowest level in the Trust's history. Dream Global REIT continues to pursue opportunities to refinance its more expensive debt at attractive rates. \nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS \nOccupancy - In Q2 2015, the Trust completed over 340,000 square feet of new leases and renewals and continued disposing of non-core assets with generally lower occupancy rates. As a result of this active asset management program, the Trust's in-place and committed occupancy of the portfolio overall increased to 86.1% at the end of Q2 2015 from 86.0% at the end of Q1 2015, with in-place occupancy increasing from 85.6% at the end of Q1 to 85.8% at the end of Q2. \nDeutsche Post renewals - Deutsche Post had the right to terminate up to approximately 393,000 square feet of space in 16 properties effective June 30, 2016. As a result of proactive negotiations with the tenant, the Trust was able retain 84% of the GRI relating to this space, as summarized in the table below. \nBased on past experience, the Trust expects that Postbank will stay in most of these locations and that the overall GRI retention ratio for these properties will be close to 100%. Deutsche Post 2016 terminations 2016 renewals (1 to 5-year lease terms) 8 Total subject to 2016 termination rights 16 392,586 \nIn-place rents - In Q2 2015, in-place rents further increased to EUR9.39 from EUR8.86 at the end of 2014, largely due to market conditions and an overall improvement in the quality of the Trust's portfolio. Year-over-year, in-place rents increased by more than 7% since Q2 2014, highlighting the improved quality of the Trust's asset base and achieving rental rate growth across the portfolio. Overall, the in-place rents in the Initial Properties portfolio remain nearly 15% below market rents, which provides for further upside on renewals and new leases. \nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS \nNet Operating Income - NOI in euros increased by 3.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase largely resulted from leasing activity and the full impact of the contribution from a large acquisition in Q1, partially offset by dispositions during the quarter. \nFunds From Operations - FFO for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $22.1 million compared to $21.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. On a per unit basis, basic FFO for three months ended June 30, 2015 was $0.20/unit, compared to $0.19/unit for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase quarter over quarter is a result of improved occupancy, higher in-place rental rates and the full impact of the contribution from a large acquisition in Q1, partially offset by dispositions during the quarter. \nAdjusted Funds From Operations - AFFO for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $20.4 million compared to $19.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 2.5%. On a per unit basis, basic AFFO for three months ended June 30, 2015 was $0.18/unit, unchanged from $0.18/unit for the three months ended March 31, 2015. \n\"The operating environment in Germany continues to be very favourable for owning and operating office buildings. Vacancy rates further declined in the Big 7 office markets, unemployment remains at historic lows and investor demand for German office properties is very strong,\" said Jane Gavan, Chief Executive Officer of Dream Global REIT. \"We believe that our portfolio will continue to become more valuable with this economic backdrop.\" \nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS \nDream Global REIT's management team will be holding a conference call tomorrow, Thursday, August 6, 2015 at 2:00 p.m. (ET).
