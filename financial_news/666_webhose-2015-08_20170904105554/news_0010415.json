In this case it's downward dog to downing a beer.\n\"Love yoga, love beer? why not pair them together?\" said Amy Leiblein, from Switchback.\nSwitchback brewery hosts the Stretch and Sip classes in its new tap room. Where you can tap into your inner zen and then enjoy a pint or a flight -- all for 20 dollars.\n\"You mentally physically relax and then you get to relax with some libations afterward,\" said Heidi Rumble, a participant.\n\"I feel like it's the quintessential Vermont thing to do get some exercise then enjoy some good beer. Beer compliments a lot of situations,\" said Leiblein.\nIt's a win win for everyone. The yoga instructor gets people who might not have normally tried the practice and Switchback gets to pour into a bigger customer base than they usually have most Sunday mornings.\nDavid Higgins and his wife are celebrating their 33rd anniversary.\n\"It's relaxing and enjoyable to be around community people and sipping and stretching is a great way to do it,” said Higgins.\nAlcohol and exercise don't seem like the most obvious pairing but it's a craze happening across the country.\n\"It's a nice fun reward, it's one and there's some carbohydrates that will refuel you after your exercise,” said Sarah Quinttus, Soulshine Power Yoga.\nSwitchback is planning to host the stretch and sip events the last Sunday of every month. It's a new way of finding your inner peace that people are toasting to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T05:26:16.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
