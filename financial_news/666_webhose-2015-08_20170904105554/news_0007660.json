Operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year or any future period. \nYou should read the following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2015 and as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on April 30, 2015, and other disclosures (including the disclosures under \"Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors\") included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in U.S. dollars. \nOVERVIEW \nVIVUS is a biopharmaceutical company commercializing and developing innovative, next-generation therapies to address unmet needs in obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes and sexual health, and we have two therapies approved by the FDA: Qsymia for chronic weight management and STENDRA for erectile dysfunction, or ED. STENDRA is also approved by the European Commission, or EC, under the trade name, SPEDRA, for the treatment of ED in the EU. \nQsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended release) was approved by the FDA in July 2012, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater (obese), or 27 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol (dyslipidemia). Qsymia incorporates a proprietary formulation combining low doses of active ingredients from two previously approved drugs, phentermine and topiramate. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, Qsymia is believed to suppress appetite and increase satiety, or the feeling of being full, the two main mechanisms that impact eating behavior. In September 2012, Qsymia became available in the U.S. market through a limited number of certified home delivery networks. In July 2013, Qsymia became available in retail pharmacies through approximately 8,000 Walgreens, Costco and Duane Reade pharmacies nationwide. As of the date of this report, Qsymia is available in over 42,000 certified retail pharmacies nationwide, including all of the major pharmacy chains in the country. We intend to continue to certify and add new pharmacies to the Qsymia retail pharmacy network, including national and regional chains as well as independent pharmacies. \nWe commercialize Qsymia in the U.S. primarily through a dedicated contract sales force, supported by an internal commercial team. In the third quarter of 2015, we intend to directly hire many of the current contract sale representatives to continue promoting Qsymia to physicians and to hire additional sales representatives as necessary to fill open territories. Our efforts to expand the appropriate use of Qsymia include scientific publications, participation and presentations at medical conferences, and development and implementation of patient-directed support programs. Most recently, we have rolled out unique marketing programs to encourage targeted prescribers to gain more experience with Qsymia with their obese patient population. We are increasing our investment in digital media in order to amplify our messaging to information-seeking consumers. The digital messaging encourages those consumers most likely to take action to speak with their physicians about obesity treatment options. We believe our enhanced web-based strategies will deliver clear and compelling communications to potential patients. We have also employed a physician referral service to help patients identify prescribers in their area. \nChallenges continue within the obesity pharmacotherapy market, in particular with respect to the tendency on the part of healthcare providers to treat the co-morbid conditions of obesity rather than the obesity disease itself. In addition, there is a narrow focus on certain patient types for treatment, a historically low third-party insurance coverage, and the continued exclusion of anti-obesity medications from Medicare Part D. \nTable of Contents \nWe continue to develop efficient ways to address the obesity market. We completed a realignment of our field sales territories during April 2015, reducing the number of territories from 150 to approximately 90. A further reduction in force was implemented in July 2015, bringing the number of territories to 50. Each of these adjustments was accompanied by a parallel streamlining of corporate headquarters headcount as we have sought to right-size the organization to match the market opportunity as it currently exists. \nWe have defined and identified the healthcare provider, or HCP, audience of anti-obesity prescribers as numbering approximately 8,000 to 10,000. Of these, we believe the most highly productive writers will be more than adequately covered by the newly-configured VIVUS sales force. We are focused on maintaining a commercial presence with the important Qsymia prescribers, and we have capacity to cover new potential prescribers, who are those physicians that begin prescribing branded obesity products. We are constantly monitoring prescribing activity in the market, and we have seen new prescriptions being written by HCPs on whom we have not previously dedicated field sales resources. We believe that part of the current realignment addresses this new prescriber group, and we look forward to initiating and maintaining dialog with these HCPs. \nQsymia is approved for the treatment of obesity in the U.S. In the EU, in October 2012, we received a negative opinion from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, recommending refusal of the marketing authorization for the medicinal product QsivaTM (the intended trade name for Qsymia in the EU) due to concerns over the potential cardiovascular and central nervous system effects associated with long-term use, teratogenic potential and use by patients for whom Qsiva would not have been indicated. We requested that this opinion be re-examined by the CHMP. After re-examination of the CHMP opinion, in February 2013, the CHMP adopted a final opinion that reaffirmed the Committee's earlier negative opinion to refuse the marketing authorization for Qsiva in the EU. In May 2013, the EC issued a decision refusing the grant of marketing authorization for Qsiva in the EU. \nIn September 2013, we submitted a request to the EMA for Scientific Advice, a procedure similar to the U.S. Special Protocol Assessment process, regarding use of a pre-specified interim analysis from the CVOT known as AQCLAIM to assess the long-term treatment effect of Qsymia on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight and obese subjects with confirmed cardiovascular disease. Our request was to allow this interim analysis to support the resubmission of an application for a marketing authorization for Qsiva for treatment of obesity in accordance with the EU centralized marketing authorization procedure. We received feedback in 2014 from the EMA and the various competent authorities of the EU Member States associated with review of the AQCLAIM CVOT protocol, and we received feedback from the FDA in late 2014 regarding the amended protocol. As a part of addressing the FDA comments, we are now working with leading cardiovascular outcome trial experts in planning substantial revisions to the original design and execution of the CVOT, with the goal of reducing costs while also fulfilling the requirement of further demonstrating the long-term cardiovascular safety of Qsymia. We met recently with the FDA to provide a program update and to share our plans to modify the CVOT design. This dialog is ongoing, and we are committed to involving the FDA in reviewing alternative proposals that will satisfy the existing requirements. As one component of this clinical project, we plan to conduct and complete by 2017 a Qsymia heart rate variability study that will guide and inform the redesigned CVOT. The total cost of this study is expected to be approximately $5.0 million. \nIn addition, we are in the process of pursuing a new indication for Qsymia in obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA. We also intend to seek regulatory approval for Qsymia in other territories outside the United States and EU and, if approved, to commercialize the product through collaboration agreements with third parties. We plan to optimize spending while pursuing these potential objectives. \nOur drug STENDRA, or avanafil, is an oral phosphodiesterase type 5, or PDE5, inhibitor that we have licensed from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, or MTPC. STENDRA was approved by the FDA in April 2012 for the treatment of ED in the United States. In June 2013, the EC adopted a decision granting marketing authorization for SPEDRA (the approved trade name for avanafil in the EU) for the treatment of ED in the EU. In July 2013, we entered into an agreement with the Menarini Group, through its subsidiary Berlin Chemie AG, or Menarini, under which Menarini received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote SPEDRA for the treatment of ED in over 40 European countries, including the EU, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Menarini commenced its commercialization launch of the product in the EU in early 2014, and as of the date of this filing, \nTable of Contents \nSPEDRA is commercially available in 25 countries within the territory granted to Menarini pursuant to the license and commercialization agreement. \nIn October 2013, we entered into an agreement with Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Auxilium, under which Auxilium received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote STENDRA in the United States and Canada. On the same date, we also entered into a supply agreement with Auxilium, whereby VIVUS will supply Auxilium with STENDRA drug product for commercialization. Auxilium began commercializing STENDRA in the U.S. market in December 2013. In January 2015, Auxilium was acquired by Endo. \nIn December 2013, we entered into an agreement with Sanofi under which Sanofi received an exclusive license to commercialize and promote avanafil for therapeutic use in humans in Africa, the Middle East, Turkey, and the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, including Russia. Sanofi will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval in its territories. Sanofi intends to market avanafil under the trade name SPEDRA or STENDRA. Effective as of December 11, 2013, we also entered into a supply agreement, or the Sanofi Supply Agreement, with Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi. \nUnder the license agreements with Menarini, Endo and Sanofi, avanafil is expected to be commercialized in over 100 countries worldwide. For all three license agreements collectively, we have the potential to earn up to $461.0 million in license and milestone payments, in addition to royalty revenue. Through June 30, 2015, we have received approximately $117.5 million in license and milestone payments, plus royalties. In addition, we are currently in discussions with potential collaboration partners to market and sell STENDRA for our other territories, including Latin America, in which we do not currently have a commercial collaboration. \nOn September 18, 2014, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for STENDRA. STENDRA is now the only FDA-approved ED medication indicated to be taken as early as approximately 15 minutes before sexual activity. Additionally, on January 23, 2015, the EC adopted a commission implementing decision amending the marketing authorization for SPEDRA (avanafil). SPEDRA is now the first and only ED medication approved in the EU that is indicated to be taken as needed approximately 15 to 30 minutes before sexual activity. \nForeign regulatory approvals, including EC marketing authorization to market Qsiva in the EU, may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to receive regulatory approvals in a foreign country would prevent us from marketing our products that have failed to receive such approval in that market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to available-for-sale securities, research and development expenses, income taxes, inventories, revenues, including revenues from multiple-element arrangements, contingencies and litigation and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, information received from third parties and on various market specific and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements and in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, or our Annual Report, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2015. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the six months ended June 30, 2015, as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report. \nTable of Contents \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, net loss was $49.3 million and $64.8 million or $0.48 and $0.62 net loss per share, respectively, as compared to a net loss of $25.8 million and $41.4 million or $0.25 and $0.40 net loss per share, respectively, during the same periods in 2014. The increase in the net loss in the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the same periods in 2014 is primarily attributable to the inventory impairment charge of $29.5 million taken by the Company in the second quarter of 2015. \nWe may continue to generate losses in future periods, depending on our ability to successfully commercialize Qsymia, our commercialization partners' success in promoting STENDRA or SPEDRA, the timing of our research and development expenditures, and our continued investment in the clinical development of our research and future investigational drug candidates, primarily related to the post marketing study requirements for our approved drugs. \nThree Months Ended 2015 vs 2014 Six Months Ended 2015 vs 2014 June 30, Increase/ June 30, Increase/ (in thousands, except for percentages) 2015 2014 (Decrease) 2015 2014 (Decrease) Revenue: Net product revenue $ 14,013 $ 10,983 28 % $ 26,641 $ 20,121 32 % License and milestone revenue - 4,181 (100) % 11,574 23,544 (51) % Supply revenue 8,117 5,666 43 % 16,595 13,036 27 % Royalty revenue 855 1,051 (19) % 341 1,871 (82) % Total revenue $ 22,985 $ 21,881 5 % $ 55,151 $ 58,572 (6) % \nNet product revenue \nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015, there were approximately 152,000 Qsymia prescriptions dispensed, compared to 138,000 for the same period of 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, there were approximately 288,000 Qsymia prescriptions dispensed, compared to 259,000 for the same period of 2014. Approximately 64% of our total prescriptions for the second quarter of 2015 included either a free good or discount offer, with approximately 29,000 of those prescriptions dispensed as free goods. In comparison, for the three months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 61% of our total prescriptions included either a free good or discount offer, with approximately 31,000 of those prescriptions dispensed as free goods. \nApproximately 63% of our total prescriptions for the first six months of 2015 included either a free good or discount offer, with approximately 54,000 of those prescriptions dispensed as free goods. In comparison, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 58% of our total prescriptions included either a free good or discount offer, with approximately 55,000 of those prescriptions dispensed as free goods. \nAs of June 30, 2015, we had deferred revenue related to sales of Qsymia of $18.4 million, which represents Qsymia product shipped to wholesalers and certified retail pharmacies, but not yet dispensed to patients through prescriptions, net of prompt-payment discounts. \nLicense and milestone revenue \nFor the six months ended June 30, 2015, under the terms of the license and commercialization agreement with Menarini, we recognized $11.6 million in license and milestone revenue related to the time-to-onset claim, which was approved by the EC in January 2015, allowing SPEDRA to be the first and only erectile dysfunction medication approved in the EU that is indicated to be taken as needed approximately 15 to 30 minutes before sexual activity. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, we recognized $4.2 million and $23.5 million, respectively, in license and milestone revenue primarily due to product launches in certain EU countries. \nSupply revenue \nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $8.1 million and $16.6 million in supply revenue, compared to $5.7 million and $13.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively. \nTable of Contents \nThe increase in supply revenue for the 2015 periods as compared to the 2014 periods is due to the rollout of SPEDRA in Europe. As of June 30, 2015, SPEDRA was available at retail pharmacies in 25 countries within the Menarini territory, compared to 20 countries at June 30, 2014. To date, Sanofi has not launched the commercialization of SPEDRA in its territories. \nRoyalty revenue \nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $0.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in net royalty revenue on net sales reported by our . . .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T13:26:51.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
