But did you know it also affects your homeowner’s insurance rates?If you have a fair credit score, you could pay 32% more for homeowner’s insurance, on average, than someone with excellent credit, according to a recent study by Quadrant Information Services , commissioned by InsuranceQuote: s.com.Got poor credit? You’ll pay twice as much, on average, as that excellent-credit homeowner. When the average annual homeowners insurance premium is $952, according to online consumer research site ValuePenguin.com, that’s not pocket change.This is the second year in a row that this study was done, and the numbers are higher this year than last year. “We’re not sure if that trend will continue, but I do think it’s a sign that insurers are leaning more heavily on credit as a risk indicator,” says Laura Adams, senior insurance analyst at InsuranceQuote: s.com.That’s because credit continues to be a good indicator of whether or not a consumer will make a homeowners insurance claim. The worse your credit, the statistics show, the greater the chances that you’ll file a claim.“Insurers doing business in states that allow credit to be a rating factor for home insurance…are likely putting more emphasis on credit because it’s holding up as a valid predictor of risk,” Adams says.[caption id=\"attachment_732\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] (Photo credit: Pictures of Money)[/caption]California, Maryland and Massachusetts don’t allow insurers to use credit in the calculation of homeowner’s insurance rates. Other states, however, use credit to different extents. For instance, Montana showed the greatest average premium increase from fair credit to excellent credit at 66%, followed by Washington, D.C. (61%), Texas (55%) and Colorado (54%).The states with the smallest average premium increase from fair to excellent credit were Florida (0%), New York (9%), North Carolina (10%) and Wyoming (19%).“Many consumers don’t realize that credit plays such a big role in the rates we pay for certain types of insurance,” Adams says. “The study findings definitely show that we need to take our credit health seriously in order to pay as little as possible for home insurance.”The credit score used to calculate your homeowners insurance rates isn’t the same one you’d find on your consumer credit report. “Insurers typically use a proprietary credit-based insurance score (CBIS) to evaluate consumers using information in their credit reports,” Adams says. “This is different than a traditional credit score…so we can’t make a direct comparison between the two.”Nonetheless, the same steps you would take to boost your regular credit score will also bump up your credit-based insurance score. They include:\nPay bills on time. Payment history makes up 35% of your FICO score, so making consistent, on-time payments can make a big difference. t Charge less . Another 30% of your FICO score is made up of how much you owe, so keep your credit usage well below your available credit limits—ideally 25% or less. t Don’t close old accounts. Closing old credit cards both decreases your amount of available credit and could shorten your credit history, which makes up 15% of your FICO score. t Cool it on new credit . Don’t open new credit accounts unless you must. Every new credit account dings your score temporarily, and too many new accounts can also lower your score. You can get a free credit report annually from each of the three credit bureaus at annualcreditreport.com . Check a different bureau (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) every four months for year-round monitoring.", "external_links": ["http://www.insurancequotes.com/home/how-credit-affects-home-insurance-82415", "https://www.annualcreditreport.com/"], "published": "2015-08-28T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T14:40:00.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
