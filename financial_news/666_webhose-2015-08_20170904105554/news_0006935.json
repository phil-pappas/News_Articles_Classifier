Sentiment in the market for newly built, single-family homes rose 1 point in August to 61, the best showing since November 2005, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index showed on Monday.\"The fact the builder confidence has been in the low 60s for three straight months shows that single-family housing is making slow but steady progress,\" said NAHB Chairman Tom Woods, a homebuilder from Blue Springs, Mo. ADVERTISEMENT \"However, we continue to hear that builders face difficulties accessing land and labor,\" he said. Any number above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as more good than poor.\"Today's report is consistent with our forecast for a gradual strengthening of the single-family housing sector in 2015,\" said David Crowe, NAHB's chief economist. \"Job and economic gains should keep the market moving forward at a modest pace throughout the rest of the year.\" Two of three index components posted gains in August. The index measuring buyer traffic increased 2 points to 45 and the component gauging current sales conditions rose 1 point to 66. Meanwhile, the index for sales expectations over the next six months held steady at 70.Regionally, confidence in the West and Midwest markets each rose 3 points to 63 and 58. The South posted a 2-point gain to 63, while the Northeast was flat at 46. Past: 1 day Sharpton calls for black churches...
