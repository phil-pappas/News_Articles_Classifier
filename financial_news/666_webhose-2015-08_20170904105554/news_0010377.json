The Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 percent to 4,817.48.\nThe recent market turmoil has prompted several strategists to cut their end-of-year forecasts for indexes.\nCredit Suisse, for example, cut its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 2,100 from 2,200 on Friday.\nStrong gains over the last two days suggested that the worst might be over, but the CBOE Volatility index indicated that the market was still more volatile than usual.\nThe index - popularly known as the \"fear index\" - was up 2.3 percent at 26.70. It soared to a more than 6-year-high earlier in the week.\n\"Anytime you see heightened volatility, especially when you haven't seen volatility in a long time, your anxiety goes up,\" said Mike Binger, a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Shoreview, Minnesota.\nEight of the 10 major sectors were lower, with the utilities index's 0.9 percent fall leading the decliners. The energy index jumped 1.4 percent as oil added to gains.\nChevron's 3.4 percent gain provided the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500.\nData released on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending picked up a bit in July, further evidence of strength in the economy.\nAutodesk dropped 7.3 percent after the maker of computer-aided design software cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast.\nBig Lots was jumped 16 percent after its second-quarter profit beat expectations and the company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast.\nWhile the Dow and S&P were negative, advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,917 to 1,114. On the Nasdaq, 1,882 issues rose and 877 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 22 new lows.
