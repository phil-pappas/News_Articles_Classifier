However, none of this is an excuse for what I did,\" the rapper, real name Andre Young, told the New York Times on Friday.\nDr Dre said he has been married for 19 years and is \"working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I'm doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again.\"\n\"I apologize to the women I've hurt,\" he added. \"I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.\"\nDr Dre's representatives said he would not comment beyond the statement sent exclusively to the New York Times.\nThe newspaper said Dr Dre pleaded no contest to assault and battery charges in the incident involving Barnes and was sentenced to probation and community service, while a civil suit was settled out of court.\nBarnes wrote an essay for Gawker this week in which she rehashed details of the assault.\nThe incident was left out of the film that traced the origins of N.W.A. and its members.\nTwo other women, R&B singer and Dr Dre's former girlfriend Michel'le and musician Tairrie B, told the Times that they too had been assaulted by the rapper in the past.
