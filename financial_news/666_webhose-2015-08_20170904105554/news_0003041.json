Platts sets the price of Asia crude benchmark Dubai based on trades during the MoC process.\nThe 500,000-barrel cargo was sold to a Chinese buyer at a premium of about 60 cents a barrel above its official selling price (OSP), they said.\nThe deal could not be independently verified.\nLast week, Mitsui and P66 sold October-loading Upper Zakum at 30-40 cents a barrel above OSP.\nUpper Zakum's premium last hit a high of more than 80 cents in October last year when December-loading cargoes were traded.
