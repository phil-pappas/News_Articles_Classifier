The same would apply when using data in the United States.\nIts remaining prepaid customers, around 12 million at the end of the second quarter, could also request the change, the company said.\nAmerica Movil is currently facing a regulatory crackdown in Mexico, where it has 70 percent of the market mobile.\nSince the law was passed last year, AT&T challenged Slim by buying two Mexican wireless operators, prompting operators in both countries to start offering \"borderless\" call and data plans.\nAmerica Movil said in July it would eliminate roaming charges from Mexico to the United States for those of its 10.5 million post-pay customers who opt to pay an extra 50 pesos ($3.16) per month.\n(Reporting by Christine Murray ; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T02:26:28.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
