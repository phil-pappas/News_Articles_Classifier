Micheal Pearson, Valeant chairman and chief executive, in a statement. \n\"We applaud the efforts of the Sprout team to address this important area of unmet need and look forward to working with them to bring the benefits of Addyi to additional markets around the world.\" \nValeant shares were up 0.2 percent at $245.47 in pre-market trade on the New York Stock Exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:41:21.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
