The tariff value is revised on a fortnightly basis.\nThe change in tariff value of gold and silver has been notified by the Central Board of Excise and Customs, said an official statement issued by the Finance Ministry.\nThe government raised the tariff value of imported gold and silver marginally taking into account the rise in global prices.\nAt Singapore market, prices of gold today rose slightly to USD 116.70 per ounce, while that of silver to USD 15.34 per ounce. In the national capital too, gold was ruling at over Rs 26,200 per 10 grams and silver at Rs 36,130 per kg.\nAfter declining in June, the country’s gold imports jumped 62.2 per cent to USD 2.96 billion in July, as against USD 1.82 billion in the year-ago period, as per the government data.\nGold is the second-largest import item for India after petroleum. Higher gold import bill adversely affects the country’s current account deficit, which occurs when value of import of goods and services is more than exports.\n 17, 2015 2:32 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:16:24.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
