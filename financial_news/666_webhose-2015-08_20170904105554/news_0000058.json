Second-quarter revenue rose 3% year-over-year to C$3.41 billion while expenses heightened 1% C$3.09 billion, producing an operating profit of C$323 million, up 31.8% over operating income of C$245 million in the 2014 June quarter.\nSecond-quarter traffic increased 8.7% year-over-year to 16.85 billion RPMs on a 9.3% lift in capacity to 20.13 billion ASMs, producing a load factor of 83.7%, down 0.5 point. Yield lowered 5% to C$0.18.\nAir Canada forecasts that third-quarter system capacity will increase 9.5% to 10.5% year-over-year while full-year system ASMs are expected to grow 9% to 10%. “Approximately 55% of the 2015 forecasted capacity increase will be through the continued lower-cost growth of Air Canada rouge while approximately 38% of the capacity growth will be targeted to international markets operated by the mainline carrier,” the airline stated.\nThe Montreal-based carrier reported a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 16.2% for the 12 months ended June 30, up 5 points over 11% ROIC for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014.\nWhile Air Canada expects that its solid financial performance will continue through the second half of the year, the company is assuming “relatively low Canadian GDP growth for 2015.” It also expects that the Canadian dollar will continue to be weak, trading at C$1.30 per US dollar on average in the third quarter and at C$1.27 for the full year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T21:37:40.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
