Olivia Martin-McGuire by Lisa Murray As Akubra managing director Stephen Keir looks to expand the hat maker's business across China, he faces a dilemma.\nHe's not quite sure how to talk about the company's biggest export market.\nAbout ten years ago, Akubra was approached by a distributor in Tibet wanting to buy 50 hats.\n\"I sold him the 50 and thought I would never hear from him again,\" says Keir, walking along a small street in Shanghai near his hotel on the city's riverside Bund strip. As bystanders stop to gawk at the executive, who stands six feet eight inches tall and is wearing a grey fedora, he explains he couldn't have been more wrong.\nLast year, Akubra sold 10,000 hats in Tibet, more than in the United States or Germany.\nKeir, the fourth generation of his family to run the company, is in Shanghai to see if he can replicate this success across China.\n\"We sell 10,000 hats in Tibet, maybe we can double or triple that across China,\" he says.\nThe problem for Keir is that Tibet, along with Tiananmen Square and Taiwan, belongs to the three 'Ts' that are taboo subjects in China.\n The sensitivity surrounding Tibet was evident when spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was photographed in Adelaide wearing an Akubra just over two years ago. While it provided a boost in sales to Tibetans, Akubra's web site couldn't be accessed in China for a month.\n\"We're a conservative company,\" says Keir. \"I don't want to offend anyone.\"\nHelp on the ground Akubra is hoping to grow its market share and is looking for some help on the ground. It is one of 65 Australian companies to sign up to Export Growth China, an initiative that has been spearheaded by the NSW Chamber of Commerce to help small and medium-sized enterprises navigate the complexities of the Chinese market. Companies pay about $6000 for six months to display their goods and services to potential distributors in a showroom in Shanghai. Staff from the chamber, who are based in the show room, can set up meetings with potential buyers and offer advice.\nThe chamber's chief executive Stephen Cartwright said it was an affordable way for smaller companies to test the market and it filled a gap in terms of the support that was available.\n\"Governments, both state and federal, are focused on larger companies and how to attract investment from China to Australia,\" he said in the showroom this week.\n\"SMEs have all of the products this market is crying out for but they are worried about barriers. Some of those are real and some are myths. There is a great role for the chamber here.\"\nAkubra is joined in the show room by the likes of Ugg boots manufacturer Shearer's Ugg, the Tim Cahill-backed VitaMan, which sells natural men's skin and hair care products, and Weathertex, which is hoping China's sustainability push will translate into demand for its environmentally-friendly external timber cladding. Also taking part are Byron Bay Cookies, Norco, which already sells fresh milk but is looking to break into the ice cream market, and Key Sun, which makes natural lolly pops for kids that help with cough relief and travel sickness.\nFresh Fields, which sells Vitamin-A enriched milk powder for adults, is hoping to sign a distribution deal within a month. It is currently in talks with a hotels group and a supermarket chain and is developing products aimed at teenagers and the elderly.\nExport Growth China received some initial funding as part of the federal government's Asian Century Business Engagement Plan but that program was cut in the last budget.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:12:39.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
