The deficit rose 7.8% in June to $43.8bn from a revised $40.9bn in May and compared with analysts' expectations of a $42.8bn forecast, the Commerce Department said. \nAccording to figures released on Wednesday, exports declined 0.1% month-on-month to $188.6bn in June, while imports climbed 1.2% to $232.4bn compared with a 0.5% decline in the previous month. \nReal goods import rose 1% month-on-month from a 0.9% decline in May, leading the real good deficit to widen 4.5% month-on-month to $59.3bn. \nIn the three months to June, the trade deficit averaged $41.8bn, a 2.5% decline year-on-year. \n\"The revised trade data for May show a smaller monthly deficit, implying that net trade likely added a bit more to GDP growth in the second quarter than was initially estimated,\" analysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a note. \n\"This boosted our second quarter GDP tracking estimate very modestly, but after rounding it rose one-tenth to 3.0%.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:58:19.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
