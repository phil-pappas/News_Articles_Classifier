Peter Braig by Matthew Smith Investors who turned to responsibly invested funds on the back of recent high-profile boycotts and activist environmental campaigns have benefited from their strong performance helped by a weaker performance from the resources sector.\nThe amount of money managed by funds with a \"core\" responsible investment approach doubled over the last two years, according to the findings of a Responsible Investment Association Australasia report, released on Tuesday.\nMost core responsible investing uses negative and positive screening related to environmental, social and governance issues to exclude or include stocks. Defining characteristics of core funds also include impact investing and employment of investment themes specifically related to sustainability factors. As an example, thermal coal companies have been among those targeted most by core funds that employed negative screens.\nFunds within the core category beat both the average large-cap Australian share fund and the S&P/ASX300 over one and three years by more than 1.5 per cent and around 3 per cent respectively, according to RIAA figures.\nWhile \"core\" accounted for a small (2.4 per cent) proportion of the Australia's total $1.27 trillion pool of managed funds, the segment has doubled in size â€“ it increased around 25 per cent each year for the past two years following four years of flat-lined growth between 2008 and 2012.\nThe recent spike in interest among investors in funds that single out environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns has coincided with high-profile boycotts including the decision by $8 billion Local Government Super to stop investing in coal companies and Australian National University's dumping of coal investments last October.\nIt's these divestments, along with activist campaigns including those run by climate chance campaigning network, 350.org, which have resulted in the surge in demand for responsible investing, according to Simon O'Connor, RIAA CEO.\nIn September last year HESTA, the $29 billion super fund for health and community services, announced its plan to progressively restrict investments in thermal coal.\n In June, Norway's $US890 billion government pension fund, considered the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, said it would sell many of its investments related to coal.\nThe decisions by large superannuation and global pension funds to divest and screen companies based on ESG factors is being driven by the increasing pool of money managed by managers in the core responsible investments category, Mr O'Connor said.\n\"Super funds are looking down at the asset managers and saying, 'Why aren't we doing this'? And then they have been doing it themselves by divesting.\"\nThe largest managers of core responsible investing include AMP Capital, Investa Property Group, New Forests, Perpetual Investments and BT Investment Management.\nMr O'Connor acknowledged the change in fortunes of the resources segment as commodity prices have plummeted will work in favour of the core responsible investing funds which he said have managed to avoid some of the hardest-hit companies with environmental screens.\nHe also pointed to recent governance \"blow-ups\" including gambling company Tabcorp's so-called dirty money claims relating to alleged money laundering and financial planning abuses at investment firm IOOF that would have been avoided by core responsible investment\nO'Connor predicted there would be fewer divestment and boycott announcements such as the decision by ANU late last year which sent shockwaves through the industry.\nInstead he said superannuation funds are looking for ways to \"tilt\" their portfolios based on an assessment of exposure to ESG factors, with carbon-associated risks among the most important issues on the minds of institutional investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:30:59.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
