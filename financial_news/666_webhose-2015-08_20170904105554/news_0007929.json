Shared with permission from www.CaffeFuria.com \nIn the ongoing debate of what good coffee tastes like, we come to the issue of real espresso vs. Nespresso ; a specific type of type of espresso by way of coffee capsules or pods. Is Nespresso really better than regular espresso or is it just a clever marketing gimmick? \nNespresso is not just a brand but a technology. Nespresso machines and capsules, which make single use cups, are slightly different from traditional espresso, which is also a unique way of brewing coffee. Through a highly pressurized technique, espresso has concentrated flavors and more caffeine than your average cup of coffee. Nespresso capsules are measured at a high precision beyond what we can do via “handmade” espresso. This technology standardizes your cup of coffee, eliminating human error for the most part and giving you a predictable flavor and strength. \nUsing a machine that streamlines the process is easier, it’s less messy and saves you from having to clean up excess grinds or water spillage. The operation is typically one-push and no grinding is required. These modern conveniences are often taken for granted. The real issue is taste. \nMost Nespresso fans say that on average a cup of capsule-made coffee is close to perfect in flavor with delicious foam and very powerful tastes and aromas. The very rigid extraction system makes it nearly impossible to make a bad cup—just follow the instructions and enjoy the bliss of good espresso. \nThe only downside is in a higher price and less control over the final product. The Nespresso machine does everything for you, so if you enjoy customizing your own perfect shot than you might be frustrated working with its brewing process. \nHowever, most people would not consider themselves coffee snobs—at least not in the creative process. They want taste and the Nespresso brand is going to give it to them, no extra skills required. Traditional espresso machines are prone to human error. \nThe truth is, making good coffee is a work of art but if you’re a coffee lover and not a “fighter” in terms of managing quality control, the Nespresso brand is going to make your day easier and your life much better with a near-perfect taste and an easy operation. \nCaffeFuria.com is one of the most trusted brands in Nespresso style Italian espresso, delivering not only the process that’s important, but also the so-called classic flavors and styles of Italy—Il Classico, L’Amabile, Il Sublime, Lungo, Decaf, Hazelnut and Vanilla. They also have a sample pack in case you want to compare different flavors to pinpoint your favorite. It’s all about the subtleties and the rush that comes from .07 grams of Italian-style roasted beans with a perfect brewing process. \nBottom line verdict: If you're going for ease, perfection of taste and authentic flavor, Nespresso is the way to go!
