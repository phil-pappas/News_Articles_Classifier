Alex Ellinghausen by John Kerin Green groups effectively blocking the $16 billion Adani coal mine were engaged in \"lawfare\" that jeopardised Australia's chances of doing a free trade deal with India, Trade Minister Andrew Robb says.\nMr Robb said last week's decision by the Federal Court to set aside approval for the the Indian-backed $16 billion Adani Carmichael coal mine project was a big blow to prospects of doing a trade deal with India – a deal the country's two leaders want sealed by the end of 2015.\nThe federal court sent the approval back to Environment Minister Greg Hunt, saying he had failed to adequately consider the fate of a rare skink and an ornamental snake.\n\"It was lawfare brought by activist groups to whom the skink is simply a patsy,\" Mr Robb said.\nAndrew Robb warns lucrative trade deals are under threat. Alex Ellinghausen Mr Robb said Adani had followed the rules over seven years of pursuing the project, only to have its approval overturned on a technicality.\n\"You think that is not going to change India's appetite to get an agreement with Australia this year,\" he said.\nIn a wide-ranging speech, Mr Robb said the Trans Pacific Partnership, the world's most lucrative trade deal, depended on four big economies thrashing out differences over their car and dairy industries, and there was little more Australia could do.\nThe 12-nation, US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes Australia and most north Asian economies other than China, aims to form a grouping involving 40 per cent of the globe's GDP.\n But Mr Robb said while the TPP was still \"doable\" the US, Canada, Mexico and Japan had reached a stalemate in negotiations over the treatment of their automotive and dairy sectors.\n\"If they in the next few weeks can resolve those two issues out of thousands by the way, then I think we [ministers] could complete this in a couple of days,\" Mr Robb told the National Press Club in Canberra.\n\"But if it gets too far down the track … Canada is into an election already [and] the closer we get to a US presidential election, the [greater] the prospect of it falling over,\" Mr Robb said.\n\"We are very keen to see the TPP happen but, to be honest, putting my political hat on, we won't ultimately determine it. It will be the US, Japan, Mexico – the bigger players who will either stop it or get it across the line,\" he said.\nMr Robb also accused sections of the union movement of running a \"hugely dishonest campaign to stop the China FTA\".\n\"They want us to retreat into fear, not embrace opportunities to prosper,\" Mr Robb said.\nHe revealed the Electrical Trades Union had run robo-calls into tens of thousands of households in his electorate earlier this week.\n\"The recorded telephone message maliciously asserted the FTA that I have negotiated with China permitted unqualified electricians to invade Australia, putting the safety of Australians at great risk,\" Mr Robb said.\nMr Robb warned if the union got what it wished for by \"derailing or stopping\" the Australia-China agreement it would come at \"enormous cost to our economy\".\n\"It will stop thousands of new jobs from being created. It runs the risk of seeing China walk away from a hugely beneficial deal for Australia,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:58:07.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
