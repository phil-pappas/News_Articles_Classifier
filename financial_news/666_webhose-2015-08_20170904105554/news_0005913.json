Powers", "Powers", "Sean Nichols"], "text": "By Sean Nichols Aug 14, 2015 Just a week after publishing a new conviction buy list, Shanghai-based investment manager, BNP Partnersis reportedly close to announcing a fundamental rebalancing of client portfolios to reflect a weightier bias toward commodities and related stocks.\"We're getting close to an inflection point in commodities,\" said Gerald E. Powers, Chief Investment Officer at BNP Partners. Despite the rhetoric we're forever hearing from the Federal Reserve and Chair, Janet Yellen, it's pretty clear - to us, at any rate - that US interest rates aren't going meaningfully higher with so many mixed signals coming from the really important data. Elsewhere, it's also pretty obvious that the economic slowdown in China is proceeding at a clip unforeseen by the country's policymakers and there is almost certainly more stimulus on the way. Japan's and Europe's QE programs are running at full chat and it's just a matter of time before America follows so we think there's a better than 50:50 chance of a resurgence in the prices for raw materials as central banks renew their efforts to weaken their currencies and boost their economies,\" he explained. BNP Partners, hinted at the rebalance when it included stocks in two oil majors and a number of miners in its latest conviction buy list alongside several financial and technology sector equities.Asked which commodities he expected to benefit most from what he saw as a cyclical resumption of the commodities supercycle, Powers said, \"My personal feeling is that all commodities will appreciate once there's more liquidity sloshing around but the real push won't come until the US Federal Reserve gets back into the game with more QE\".
