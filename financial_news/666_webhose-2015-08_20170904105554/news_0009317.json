Beneath graphics based on the Apple logo was written \"Hey Siri, give us a hint.\" \nThe timing of the Apple event did not come as a surprise since the California-based company is known to host September events to announce iPhone updates. \nRumors about the coming event included the possibility of new iPhone models and news about Apple TV set-top boxes. \nIndustry trackers expect Apple to unveil new generation big-screen iPhone 6 models. \nImprovements are likely to include faster processing power and improved camera capabilities along with screens that can distinguish light touches from hard presses for more nuanced controls. \nApple could also use the event to tout milestones including how well its smart watch is selling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T21:47:09.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
