To help meet that demand, government wants 100,000 MW of new capacity from solar panels, with at least 8,000 MW from locally made cells.\nThe newspaper said the WTO dispute settlement panel, in a confidential report to New Delhi and Washington, found India violated global trade rules by imposing local content requirements for solar cells and solar modules, and also struck down incentive policies such as subsidies provided for domestic solar companies to manufacture cells and solar modules.\nThe WTO typically circulates decisions on disputes to the parties before they are made public.\n 27, 2015 9:34 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:31:07.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
