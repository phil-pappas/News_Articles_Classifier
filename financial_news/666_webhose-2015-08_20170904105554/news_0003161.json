Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Dumped Speaker Bronwyn Bishop says she intends to recontest the next election despite Prime Minister Tony Abbott declaring her political career over .\nMs Bishop was forced to resign as Speaker on Sunday after a furore over her use of travel entitlements but she has no intention of forcing a by-election by quitting politics before the next election.\nBut she indicated through a spokesman she intended to recontest her safe NSW seat of Mackellar at the 2016 election, which would see her serve 30 years in Parliament.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Abbott drew the curtain on the career of his close friend and, until the weekend, his most loyal supporter in the party room.\n\"She has made some serious mistakes, she was the one who paid the highest price. She's lost a position that she loved and it's likely her career in the Parliament is substantially at an end,\" Mr Abbott said.\nThe Prime Minster accepted the three-week scandal had hurt the government and his own personal standing.\n\"I accept whenever things like this arise there is a price to pay, the government has inevitably paid a price, and I dare say, a little personal price for me,\" Mr Abbott said.\nAbbott warned Liberal MPs have warned Mr Abbott to let them decide Mrs Bishop's replacement. As of Tuesday, Victorian Tony Smith and South Australian Andrew Southcott were the clear frontrunners.\nMr Abbott, who was in SA, said he had discussed the matter with Dr Southcott but insisted he was doing nothing to try and influence the outcome.\n\"I'm going to try an avoid, so-called captain's picks here,\" he said.\n\"In the end, this is a matter for the Liberal party room to choose a nominee for the Speakership, and Andrew I believe will be a candidate.\n\"He's a good bloke, he's been in the Parliament a long time, I certainly think he would be well qualified to do the job and let's wait and see who ultimately puts his or her hand up.\"\nIf there is more than one candidate, there will be a party-room ballot on Monday morning when Parliament resumes.\nMr Abbott has commissioned a review of the expenses system and said he wanted Mrs Bishop's situation \"to be the last travel expenses scandal involving politicians that we ever have in this country\".\nLiberals close to Mrs Bishop believe she will serve out the remainder of this term but doubt she will run again. One said it was unkind of Mr Abbott \"to throw her under a bus\".\n\"She's has been his biggest defender over a number of years,\" he said.\nMs Bishop, 72, served in the Senate from 1987 and 1994 when she entered the lower house.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-04T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:09:00.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
