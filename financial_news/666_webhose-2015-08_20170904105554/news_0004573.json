Brendan Esposito Share on twitter by John Stensholt Australian sporting fans take comfort. After the historic batting humiliation at Trent Bridge on Thursday night, the chance for instant redemption comes in the form of two opportunities to beat New Zealand in one weekend.\nBut that's probably where the comfort ends. On Saturday, the Wallabies will start as rank underdogs when they host the New Zealand All Blacks rugby union side at Sydney's ANZ Stadium. The winner will carry off the Southern Hemisphere Rugby Championship.\nAustralia has high hopes of causing an upset on home turf and getting one hand on the Bledisloe Cup, which will be decided in the return match in New Zealand next weekend.\nAustralia's prospects are better on Sunday, when the Diamonds national netball team meet their Kiwi rivals in the early stages of the Netball World Cup in Sydney. Australia, the defending champion, is favoured to win the tournament. Organisers are pretty confident, too.\nLet the games begin: Australian Diamonds captain Laura Geitz (holding the World Cup) with captains of other teams involved in the Netball World Cup. Brendan Esposito Netball World Cup chief executive Marne Fechner​ said the 17,000-seat All Phones Arena was virtually sold out.\n\"It is a great rivalry, Australia and New Zealand at World Cups traditionally. There is a strong history of games between Australia and New Zealand going to double-overtime, so the rivalry is intense. So the interest has been strong for the match, with the rugby on the same weekend, as well.\"\nBeats expectations The 10-day World Cup started on Friday, with all matches being played in Sydney. Fechner said the tournament has exceeded pre-event expectations in terms of ticket sales and corporate support.\n \"We've had really good support from our sponsors and we've tried to be innovative in the way we've set up corporate lounges and hospitality areas,\" Fechner said. The organisers recently signed Australia Post as a major sponsor, joining ANZ and Telstra on the top level of corporate supporters.\nOverall, about $6.5 million worth of tickets have been sold, while the amount of ticket and travel packages more than doubled projections. All corporate hospitality for next weekend's semi-finals and grand final have also sold out, which should ensure the event – which is costing $15 million to run – makes a bumper profit, with support from the NSW government..\n﻿ The organisers have been responsible for most of the commercial arrangements and will keep most of the revenue, including domestic broadcasting rights. Network Ten is showing Australian matches, the semi-finals and the final on free-to-air, while Fox Sports will have a channel dedicated to showing every match of the tournament and highlights packages.\nFechner said take-up of the official World Cup smartphone and tablet app, developed with Telstra, have also been strong in recent weeks.\n\"We want people coming to the games and looking at it for information, and we will have full Wi-Fi at the [adjacent] live site,\" she said.\n\"We knew when we started that the netball fans would all buy tickets straight away – they are our fanatics. But this is also about broadening the interest in the sport to a wider audience of people, including people who love coming to big events.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-08-07T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:33:54.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
