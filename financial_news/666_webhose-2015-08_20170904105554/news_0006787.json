PUBLISHED: 19:16, Tue, Aug 18, 2015 | UPDATED: 20:08, Tue, Aug 18, 2015 SUNSQUARE Sunsquare managing director Justin Seldis \nFollowing a £100,000 two-year investment, the glazing specialist is shaking up with skylight industry by being the first to gain a British Standards Institution (BSI) quality stamp. \nSunsquare’s managing director, Justin Seldis, 47, who co-owns the company with technical director James Boughton, explains: “Overhead glazing has not previously been regulated. \nThis seemed to us a possible disaster in the making, which is why we have pushed for change. \n“The British Standards Institution (BSI) kitemark for our whole product range recognises safety is paramount and sends out an important signal to potential clients about our manufacturing methods. \n“Now we have proved ourselves through rigorous tests regarding air permeability, wind loading and weather tightness, we have something that is globally recognised and a launch pad for exporting and expansion.” \nCompany turnover, which grew 28 per cent in 2014 to £5m, is forecast to rise above 30 per cent this year. \nThe remotely-controlled windows, designed and custom made at its two sites in Suffolk, start at £500. \nClients range from self-builders to architects for high-end residential, commercial and public projects including schools and hospitals. Our calculations are so tight we adjust according to postcode Sunsquare’s managing director, Justin Seldis \nA recent commission demonstrated what can now be achieved in the most awkward of places when Sunsquare installed 66 metres of roof lights in an L-shaped configuration for a building in London’s Oxford Street. \nThe skylights’ minimal elevation means they lie almost flush to the roof surface and the company’s six main products offer 140 different combinations, says Seldis. \n“We can supply different coatings and structures, whether that means bullet-proof skylights for an oligarch in Russia, walk-on ones for a subterranean swimming pool or glass that allows light but not heat for a building in the tropics. \n“Some of our windows adjust electronically according to changing conditions. Our specifications vary depending on climate so they differ from Cornwall to Devon to London. Our calculations are so tight we adjust according to postcode.” \nChanges in flat roofing materials over the past 15 years and building requirements have increased demand, he adds.

They fit in with contemporary lifestyles and need such as energy conservation. \n“Flat roof materials are more sophisticated now. You can have rubber, fibre glass, zinc, copper as well as felt. \n“Our products have to be capable of being easily lifted up several storeys. We design them with a pre-supplied, ready-to-fit section that means the contractor can complete the roof prior to the skylight arriving, saving time and money.” \nSome traditional techniques, such as applying sealants by hand, will continue, but it is Sunsquare’s commitment to advanced production processes, taking over £1 million of investment both in plant and staffing, that has been the crucial factor in its growth. \nAs well as 3-D modelling software for prototypes and testing, the company is increasingly using 3-D printing technology to make components. \nNow it plans to move its 45 staff into a new factory. \nThis will bring all its processes under one roof as it embarks on a new five-year expansion plan that includes an export drive focusing first on northern Europe and development of an easily transportable skylight range. \nThe founders, who both come from the glazing industry, have contributed almost all of the funding since start up 11 years ago, when Boughton, 37, sold everything he owned to become an entrepreneur. \nSeldis’s experience working for gaming companies taught him always to have three months ready cash to hand. \n“Everything depends on good money management when you manufacture,” he says. \n“We constantly tour the world looking for best practice and processes. \n“We could have out-sourced and had bigger profits, but we chose to build a manufacturing business in Britain, not buy ourselves luxury cars. It would be good to see more support nationally for that approach to business.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:49:03.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
