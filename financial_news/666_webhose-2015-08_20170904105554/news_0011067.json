On Thursday, the government raised its estimate of economic growth in the April-June quarter to a surprisingly strong 3.7 per cent annual pace, and other indicators -- job creation, housing, service sector growth -- have all been reasonably strong. \nBut on Wednesday the head of the Fed's New York branch, William Dudley, said the need to begin normalising US monetary policy next month after years in a crisis stance \"seems less compelling to me than just a few weeks ago\". \n\"The slowdown in China could lead... to a slower global growth rate and less demand for the US economy,\" he said. \nDudley stressed that policy decisions had to look forward, not backward. \n\"At the end of the day, we're concerned about the outlook, how is the economy going to perform in the future. It's not just how we are performing today. \n\"And there, international developments and financial market developments do have relevance because they can impinge and affect the economic outlook.\" \nFed Chair Janet Yellen will not be at Jackson Hole, but her deputy, Stanley Fischer, will be giving a keynote speech on Saturday. Whether he amplifies on Dudley's comments or not, most analysts believe Dudley's thinking is closely aligned with both Yellen's and Fischer's. \nThe theme of this year's Jackson Hole symposium, \"Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy\", hones in on why the Chinese slowdown is equally trouble for the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, both of which continue to pump billions of dollars' worth of liquidity into markets each month under quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programs. \nThe aim of central bankers in Tokyo, Frankfurt and Washington has been to get businesses and people to spend, ultimately to produce jobs and bring inflation up to around two per cent. \nBecause China represents about 15 per cent of the global economy, the slowdown is already pushing prices down everywhere, and its devaluation will just do more of that. \nThe result is that the Fed, ECB and BoJ could expect slower inflation -- with a revived threat of deflation -- and feel pressure to increase stimulus, rather than, like the Fed has intended, to move away from it. \nDudley on Wednesday said there was no thought of the Fed resuming its QE programs, shut down now for nearly a year. But some economists say that, if China's economy really stalls, that could be required. \nOn Wednesday, ECB executive board member Peter Praet said the central bank was prepared to expand QE if China's slowdown further dampens inflation. \nAnd, after Japan's economy contracted in the second quarter, BoJ chief Haruhiko Kuroda earlier this month said it was prepared to expand QE. \nThe central bankers have time, and the rebound in stock markets in Asia, Europe and the United States over the past two days suggest the immediate crisis is being contained. \nMichael Taylor, head of British investment adviser Coldwater Economics, said that with patience, the global fall in prices, especially of key commodities like oil, will turn into a pickup in global demand over the next half year -- which would take the pressure off the major central banks. \n\"I think just the uncertainty will keep the Fed on hold, even though monetary conditions are turning up, and you should expect global demand to pick up with it over the coming six months,\" he said. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Apple shipped 3.6 million watches AAP \nAccording to analysts at International Data Corp, Apple shipped enough units of its new smartwatch to nearly overtake …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T02:50:20.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
