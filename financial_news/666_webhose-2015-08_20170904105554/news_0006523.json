The latest stage of the drama sees another short-term conclusion, with Athens agreeing a bail-out deal with creditors . Its economic recovery is likely to be long and arduous, so the faux-climax of this particular episode won't be the final act. But this is not the only challenge facing the European Union right now. \nFar from it. And it is essential that we do not let the Greek debt situation knock Europe off-course from the more valuable long-term prize in store if the Prime Minister can deliver successful and meaningful EU reform. \nSo, why is EU reform important? Because it's central to ensuring a strong and globally competitive continent, with London as its financial capital and beating heart. At the centre of the EU's global competitiveness is its single market. Getting it to where it is today has undoubtedly been one of the EU's greatest achievements. \nBut it is not complete and this, in my view, should be fundamental to the reform project, at least equal to bolstering the stability of the eurozone. \nA deep and strong single market will help deliver the jobs and economic growth Europe so desperately needs, benefiting all of its 500 million citizens across all its 28 member states. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will also boost the EU's ability to trade and invest successfully on the global stage. \nReform is necessary and urgent. While Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, has warned the process may take years, I believe an ambitious timetable is needed. Juncker's instinct is right in his stated determination for the EU to be \"bigger… on big things and smaller… on small things\". The deregulation agenda his Commission has set out also strikes the right note. If Europe's citizens, and not just those in the UK, are to be convinced that the EU can really stimulate economic growth and protect living standards, a reforming zeal must be evident. The completion of the single market should form the bedrock of the vision the UK presents for a reformed EU. \nThere is a growing chorus for reform the UK is not alone in calling for it. Many other member states have produced ambitious reform proposals and are calling for change, as are business and civil society groups. TheCityUK recently presented a detailed set of 25 proposals for EU reform, all of which are practical, achievable and do not require treaty change. They represent the view of our industry and reflect those areas in which we have the expertise to comment and where we believe could help business to create jobs and drive economic growth right across the EU. \nOur proposals broadly fit into four themes: better regulation; a European agenda for jobs, growth and competitiveness; fair and equal treatment of all member states; and a strong and deep single market that is open to the world. The last is at the centre of our reform agenda, with a focus on five core principles. \nFirstly, a reaffirmed commitment to the completion of the single market. Its four freedoms of movement for people, goods, services and capital allow industries such as financial and related professional services to thrive. We want the European Commission to set out a comprehensive action plan with a clear implementation timeline which can be supported by the parliament and national governments. \nSecondly, the formation of a Single Market Council to replace the Competitiveness Council. This new council for member states' economic ministers will, we believe, bring more strategic focus to the completion of the single market and increase the EU's international competitiveness. \nThirdly, the completion of the single market in financial services. Done successfully, it would cater flexibly for new approaches in financing business, to enhance European firms' ability to invest in new opportunities, facilitate creation of new jobs, compete in the global market and deliver growth. \nFourthly, the development of a single market for capital, or a capital markets union. The full realisation of the free movement of capital, one of the founding principles of the EU, will radically improve the ability of businesses across the continent to access the finance they need to grow. It needs to be a single-market project for all 28 member states which seeks bottom-up, market-based solutions rather than a top-down focus on new powers for the authorities. In this, as with our other proposals, we aren't arguing for \"more or less Europe\" but rather a \"more thoughtful Europe\". \nLastly, the completion of the digital single market. The estimated benefits of improved digital connectivity could create an extra £250bn in growth for the EU. To achieve it we need renewed focus on appropriate data regulation that both protects consumers and allows businesses to use big data to innovate, trade freely and, ultimately, provide a better service to customers. \nThe debate I sometimes hear about why Europe cannot create another Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) or Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) misses the point. New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) regulations rarely create entrepreneurial markets but they can easily stifle them. The last thing Europe needs is to close its markets or build \"fortress Europe\". Open trade stimulates growth and creates jobs. \nUnderpinning these recommendations is a critical principle so vital it should be the foundation of every aspect of the reform process: no discrimination or difference in treatment for firms operating in eurozone or non-eurozone member states. Imposing different rules on firms operating outside the eurozone would, for instance, seriously impede London's global competitiveness and its ability to serve Europe's corporates, not to mention the role it plays as a gateway to the continent for so many international firms. \nWhat is clear is that reform of the EU cannot be seen as a \"nice to have\". It is absolutely critical. While debate continues over whether Greece's latest bail-out represents a genuine fresh start or simply kicking the can down the road, it's worth considering that successful reform could be what helps prevent similar crises in future. That's why, despite dramas like that in Greece, reform must continue. It will make the EU stronger and more outward-looking and create new jobs, boosting growth and cementing its global competitiveness. There is no time to waste. \nChris Cummings is chief executive at TheCityUK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T02:41:32.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
