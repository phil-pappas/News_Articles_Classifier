The IFO number this morning ... shows domestic demand is holding up quite well so far.\" \nGOLDMAN CUTS EQUITIES POSITION \nGoldman Sachs' strategists cut their position on equities to 'neutral' from 'overweight' due to the impact of the drop in China, though they did not expect the sell-off to cause a global recession, citing signs of economic growth in the United States and Europe. \n\"In the meantime, we recognise the shift in sentiment that is being reflected in recent price action both in equities and, via falling inflation expectations, in bonds,\" they wrote in a note.
