The company expects sale of its stake in Brooks Brothers Australia to offset trading losses from the brand. The company sold its stake in Brooks Brothers Australia, including 13 retail stores, back to the US parent company only three years into the joint venture. Oroton's 2014/2015 third quarter earnings took a $2 million hit partly due to disappointing sales and margins in the high end US apparel brand. The handbag retailer entered deals with GAP and Brooks Brothers after the end of its partnership with Polo Ralph Lauren created an earnings hole. Despite the lifted forecast, this years group's earnings had dropped by half when compared to 2014's $13.3 million. The market approved the improved forecast, improving Oroton's shares by 19 cents to $2.14.
