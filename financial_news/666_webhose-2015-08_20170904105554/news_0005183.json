Photo: Michele Mossop\nAustralia's big banks don't want to \"write a blank cheque\" to support a scheme that protects people whose financial planner won't pay compensation despite being found to have provided poor advice.\nWhile the chief executives of each of the big four banks have previously said they were sympathetic towards a last-resort compensation scheme for victims of poor advice, the Australian Bankers' Association said there were other ways to improve trust and confidence in the financial services system.\n\"We don't see the urgency of addressing that going forward,\" association chief executive Steven Munchenberg told a Senate hearing into the scrutiny of financial advice.\nFinancial Ombudsman Service chief ombudsman Shane Tregillis.\n\"We're not saying that at no point in future that this issue is off the table.\"\nAdvertisement The last-resort scheme has been suggested to compensate users of financial services products who have received a Financial Ombudsman Service or court adjudication in their favour.\nMr Munchenberg said association members were in part concerned about opening up such a scheme to retrospective claims from people for advice they had received.\nThe association and sector experts believe the scheme, if it is rolled out by the government, should be designed so that only people who have received poor financial advice after the scheme was brought in could use it.\nHe said asking big banks to pay \"compensation to the clients of people who are competitors\" would set a precedent the industry did not support.\nCommonwealth Bank, Macquarie and National Australia Bank have internal compensation schemes to pay out customers who have been determined to have suffered financial losses for poor financial advice. Those schemes were set up after high-profile scandals at each of those financial institutions.\nMr Munchenberg also said the association did not support a royal commission into poor financial advice.\nFinancial Ombudsman Service chief ombudsman Shane Tregillis told the hearing there were 188 people who were together owed $12.6 million from 33 financial services institutions that are either refusing to compensate the clients or could not because they had gone broke.\n\"They should be confident that they should be paid that compensation,\" Mr Tregillis said.\n\"We consider that it's in the interest in all financial services participants to find a solution to this problem,\" he said.\nMr Tregillis noted that a recent government-sponsored review of the financial services system, also known as the Murray Inquiry, did not recommend a scheme of last resort for victims of poor advice.\nHe said a review into establishing such a scheme had estimated the set-up cost to the government of $800,000.\nEarlier in the hearing, representatives from the Consumer Action Law Centre, Choice, and Financial Counselling Australia called on the Abbott government to put in place a levy against financial institutions to fund an industry-wide scheme of last resort to compensate clients of poor financial advice.\n\"We believe it's the missing piece of regulatory architecture,\" law centre chief executive Gerard Brody said.\n\"It is clear that the current arrangements are unsatisfactory.\"\nSenator Sam Dastyari said the real issue was what to do with people who had already fallen through the gaps.\nMr Brody said it was possible for the banks to fund retrospective claims but admitted that industry might not be on board.\nFinancial Counselling Australia's Fiona Guthrie, who is also assisting the Commonwealth Bank in administering its compensation scheme to clients, said large financial institutions would be paying for a system their clients would use but that was the \"price of doing business\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:33:50.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
