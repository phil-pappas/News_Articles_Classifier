Advertising Print This Post \nAlpari RU has reported its volumes in Russia and the Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for the month ending July 2015, which again saw a marginal decline MoM from June, according to an Alpari RU statement. \nLast month saw Alpari RU’s Russian and CIS volumes retreat slightly to $94.4 billion in June 2015 , having incurred a slight decline of less than -1.0% MoM from $95.0 billion in May 2015 – the continued weakness highlights a stagnant consolidation in its trading volumes despite a healthy bout of volatility in the financial markets. \nMoving towards the present however, volumes at Alpari RU for the month ending July 2015 again inched lower, this time by a factor of -0.8% MoM to $93.6 billion. In addition to the volumes report, during the month ending July 2015, the currency pair that saw the highest monthly turnover and usage growth at Alpari was the USDJPY, which witnessed a 20% MoM growth from June 2015. This represents a departure from June 2015, in which the EURUSD claimed this spot as the most popular tradable entity at the brokerage. \nThe volumes report during July 2015 includes a window that closed ahead of a number of convulsing market movements in August. As a result, the heightened state of volatility brought on my catalysts such as China and the lingering specter of the Fed rate hikes could help allay a stagnation in volumes at Alpari, ultimately snapping the metrics out of a tight consolidation in Q3 2015.
