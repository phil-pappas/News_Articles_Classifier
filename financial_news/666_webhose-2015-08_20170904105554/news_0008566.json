While the job market has improved steadily, inflation has remained below the central bank's 2 percent target for more than three years.\nA decade of near-zero interest rates has helped the U.S. stock market stage a spectacular bull-run since the financial crisis.\nBut fears about the health of the Chinese economy buffeted global stock markets this month and pushed prices of oil and other commodities lower.\nWall Street closed flat on Friday after a tumultuous week in which the Dow shed more than 1,000 points at one point last Monday. The market subsequently rallied, posting its biggest two-day gain since the crisis.\nAt 13:08 ET (1708 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 46.3 points, or 0.28 percent, at 16,596.71, the S&P 500 was down 6.67 points, or 0.34 percent, at 1,982.2 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 10.21 points, or 0.21 percent, at 4,818.11.\nEight of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower with the utilities index's 2.06 percent fall leading the decliners.\nCBOE Volatility index, known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\", rose about 4.2 percent to 27.14 on Monday, above its long-term average of 20. It spiked to as much as 53.29 last week.\nTwitter was up 5.1 percent at $28.21 after SunTrust Robinson raised its rating to \"buy\" from \"neutral\".\nPhillips 66 was up 3.5 percent at $79.97 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $4.48 billion stake in the oil refiner.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,525 to 1,467. On the Nasdaq, 1,443 issues rose and 1,290 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 22 new highs and 15 new lows.
