Instead, it will encourage more firms to apply for IRS clearing membership, providing \"additional liquidity to the default management process,\" according to the notice.\nRate swaps, in which parties exchange the cash flows from different types of bonds, are an integral part of the fixed-income market, amounting to $381 trillion in notional value. Investors and dealers use swaps as another way to bet for or against bonds as well as to hedge their portfolios.\nDue to their importance, regulators required dealers and investors by 2014 to book their interest rate swaps with clearinghouses or centralized counterparties like those operated by the CME and its larger rival LCH.Clearnet.\nCME, the world's largest futures exchange operator, owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange and other markets.\n(Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Christian Plumb )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T02:07:01.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
