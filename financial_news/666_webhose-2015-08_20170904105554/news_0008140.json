The widespread belief is that seniors live wholesome lives filled with tumblers of warm milk and bowls filled with tapioca soft foods while taking required minimum distributions from their diligently cultivated 401(k)s . Yet the prevailing evidence is a stark contrast showing that many are plunging into addiction. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has estimated that by 2020, the number of older people who need substance abuse treatment will increase from 1.7 million in 2003 to 4.4 million.“17% of older adults struggle with drug or alcohol issues,” said Brenda Iliff, executive director of the Hazelden treatment facility in Naples, Fla. Partly that number jump just is because Baby Boomers, the huge population cohort born between 1946 and 1964, are stampeding into their retirement years with 10,000 a day leaving the workforce. But partly too it’s because Boomers bring along their own attitudes toward drugs.“This group experimented more with drugs when they were in their 20s and 30s, and may have a higher comfort level using drugs of all kinds than their parents did,” said Judy Fenster, associate professor at the Adelphi University School of Social Work in Garden City, N.Y. What exactly are aging Boomers getting stoned on? The better question might be what aren’t they using. That’s because Iliff said she sees prescription drug abuse, especially opioids such as oxycontin, but she said Boomers also like their cocktails , beer and wine, and at least some have a fondness for street drugs such as marijuana and heroin . 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:52:24.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
