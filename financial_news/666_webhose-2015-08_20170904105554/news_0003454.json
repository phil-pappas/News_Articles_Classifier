Kenya is Uganda's biggest business partner in the region. \nAccording to President Museveni, last year bilateral trade between Uganda and Kenya was valued at $880 million, with Kenyan exports to Uganda standing at $700 million versus imports of $180 million. \nThe two countries, therefore, need each other and must avoid anything that can hurt such cordial relations.

It is such history and factors that Mr Kenyatta's speech on pulling down walls that divide our countries, touch the aspirations of many East Africans. \nThere are many opportunities that abound by seamless borders for the people of our countries. It is, therefore, critical that the people of Kenya and Uganda continue enjoying their long history of co-operation successive regional integration arrangements. \nThe issue: Integration. \nOur view: It is, therefore, critical that the people of Kenya and Uganda continue enjoying their long history of co-operation successive regional integration arrangements.
