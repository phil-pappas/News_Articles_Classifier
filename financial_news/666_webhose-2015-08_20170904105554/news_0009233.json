A report by the Urban Institute in late 2014 found that about 5 percent of Americans who have credit files are 30 days behind, or more, on at least one account. That’s one in 20 people.\nIt is not easy to have creditors or debt collection agencies calling, but it is important to know that you do have rights. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) requires debt collectors to comply with legal requirements. Here are some steps to take to make collection calls a bit less painful.\n1. Know your rights. If you are in financial circumstances where collectors start calling, do some research to learn your rights. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) maintains a website that provides a helpful overview of consumer rights . It is important to know that collectors cannot threaten or harass you, lie, or invade your privacy. They also are allowed to call only after 8 a.m. and before 9 p.m. unless you give them permission to contact you at other times. Collectors can call a debtor’s work and cell numbers, unless the individual strictly tells them they cannot. If a debtor instructs the collector to not contact him/her on a cell phone, then the collector can no longer use that number. In addition, if you hire an attorney, and are informed that you have an attorney, they must call the attorney instead of calling you.\n2. Be wary of fraud. Do not provide personal information to callers. Reportedly, some callers try to defraud consumers by trying to collect nonexistent “debts.” Never provide any personal information to callers – whether debt collectors or anyone else – and do not confirm any personal information.\n3. Ask for proof. This is especially important in this era of identity theft. If you believe you do not owe the debt a collector is calling you about, or if you believe the amount is more than you owe, you can dispute the debt in writing. You have 30 days from the first time you are informed of the debt to request debt validation. Send the request in writing, by certified mail, to prove the request has been delivered.\n4. Record conversations for backup. You may wish to protect yourself by recording collectors’ phone calls. This tactic may serve the dual purpose of ensuring the collector is on his or her best behavior legally. Do be aware that in some states, you must have the other party’s consent before recording a phone conversation. (Visit the Digital Media Law Project to determine your state’s recording rules.)\n5. Take time to strategize. You do not have to speak to debt collectors on their timelines. Debt collectors are not permitted to require you to respond immediately. You can ask the collector to call back in an hour so you can make decision about a plan of action.\n6. Maintain written records. Keep copies of all correspondence and payments. Only pay debts for which you have received written notice of the amount due and the source.\n7. Know you have a right to privacy. Debt collectors may contact your friends and family to identify your address, phone number and employer, but they can only call once, and they may not share information about your debt situation.\n8. Do not ignore collectors. It can be a good idea to talk to a collector at least once. You need to get information about the debt and how you might be able to resolve it. It is also important to ensure that you are the correct person for the collector to contact. At times, creditors do have wrong information about the debt or the debtor. After initial contact, a debt collector must send you written validation of the debt, and any action you can take to resolve it, within five days.\n9. Request that collectors cease contact – but know this does not halt collection activity. Within 30 days after you receive the validation notice, you can respond to the collection agency to explain if you disagree with the assessment. Sample letters are available at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Keep a copy of your letter and send it via certified mail. Remember, sending a letter may stop the collector from calling, but the creditor or the debt collection agency still may take action – such as suing you – to collect the debt.\n10. File a complaint if you are mistreated. If you believe a debt collector is acting unethically, you can contact your state Attorneys General office. (Find yours via the National Association of Attorneys General .) Additionally, you can file complaints with the Better Business Bureau in the city and state where the debt collection agency is located, and with the CFPB .\n11. Get help if you need it. If you are struggling with so much debt that collectors are calling, you do not have to struggle alone. A reputable consumer credit advocate or debt relief firm can help you determine a solution. A good starting point to locate a provider is through the membership of the American Fair Credit Council , which has strict membership requirements.\nYear after year, consumer protection agencies and the FTC receive high numbers of complaints from consumers about debt collectors. Many of these companies do not follow the rules. You can protect yourself by knowing your rights when it comes to debt collection.\n ", "external_links": ["http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/116862_G.jpg", "http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/debtcollection/", "http://www.americanfaircreditcouncil.org/", "http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/state-law-recording", "http://www.naag.org/", "http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre18.shtm", "http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/#debt-collection", "http://www.freedomfinancialnetwork.com/", "http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0149-debt-collection"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T03:18:46.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
