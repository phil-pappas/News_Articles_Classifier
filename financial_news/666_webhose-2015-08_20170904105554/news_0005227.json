Supporters say it's intended to force lawmakers to fully fund an education budget formula that has been shortchanged. It says people could sue the state if school funding falls short. \nThe Republican-controlled Legislature put an alternative, Initiative 42-A, on the same ballot, saying it would not allow lawsuits. \nMadison attorney Russ Latino says Initiative 42 would hurt representative government by taking the Legislature out of the budget process. \nOxford attorney Merrill Nordstrom says that's \"simply not true.\" \nInformation from: Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, http://djournal.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:06:52.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
