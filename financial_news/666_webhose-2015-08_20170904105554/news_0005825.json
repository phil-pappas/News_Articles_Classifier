Mobile banking has pervaded economy and industry. \nThe dynamism and enthusiasm shown by the region's youth in driving innovation has been a hallmark of Kenya's globally acclaimed technological advances on the African continent. Safaricom's M-Pesa, has placed Kenya as a global leader in innovation. \nEast Africa boasts of several economic strengths. The region's tourist offering is unique and it is a globally acclaimed experience the world over, from the mountain gorillas to the wildebeest migration, to Kenya's Cradle of Mankind status and to the beaches that make it the best tourist destination in sub-Saharan Africa. \nSo the region as whole has a host of opportunities for investment partnerships to promote the tourism infrastructure. \nThat said, unemployment remains the single most serious problem facing the youth across the region, constituting a major threat to the achievement of the region's long term development blueprint. \nTo address this phenomenon, there is a need to provide a framework to help young people to establish their own businesses, a concerted and joint effort among governments, public and private entities. \nFinancial institutions have all along been blamed for putting in place hurdles that have hindered the growth of startups in the country -- from demanding security before giving out loans to sending auctioneers after loan defaulters. \nNevertheless, the Kenyan financial ecosystem has undergone tremendous transformation over the years and is now in a position to smooth the way for entrepreneurs wishing to set up businesses. \nIt is in this spirit that KCB Group has pledged Ksh1 billion ($10 million) for the next five years to boost government efforts to finance startups through the Enterprise Kenya Fund. \nThe initiative, which is expected to scale up at least 100 startups, will catalyse innovation and provide young entrepreneurs with much needed financial support in their innovative journey. \nAs we take stock of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, we need to reflect on how best we can make our region a destination for entrepreneurs. The setting up of innovation centres is a step in the right direction as they seek to support new and promising enterprises through incubation programmes. \nJoshua Oigara is KCB Group CEO and chairman of the Kenya Bankers Association.
