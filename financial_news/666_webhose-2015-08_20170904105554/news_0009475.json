Individuals were also seen squaring-off their positions ahead of GDP data due later at 5.30 pm. The Sensex ended the day with losses of 109 points, while the Nifty closed lower by 31 points at 7971 points.\nSome of the heavyweights were responsible for today's losses including the likes of Reliance , Infosys and HDFC. \nNifty stocks that saw some buying interest were the likes of Sun Pharma and Cipla. GAIL and Coal India were the top gainers in trade along with NMDC. \nBanking stocks continued to see some selling pressure with State Bank of India and ICICI Bank among the losers. \nBhel continued to see relentless selling pressure and was down once again. Realty stocks also fell after reports that the sector may face one of the worst demand in recent times. \nPrestige Real Estates, DLF and Delta Corp were the big losers from the space. Meanwhile, the rupee was trading sharply lower at 66.37 to the dollar on month end demand. \nEuropean markets were seeing pretty hefty cuts of almost one per cent. \nGoodReturns.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:28:46.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
