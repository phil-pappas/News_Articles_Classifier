But the formulation was changed after inter-ministerial discussions. The ordinance was cleared by the Cabinet but never sent to the President for his assent.\nThe amendments to the law comes amidst its keenness to attract the maximum foreign investment. But foreign companies were said to be hesitant to do business in India because of the long-drawn litigations.\nAnother amendment puts a cap on the fees of an arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator will also have to spell out if there is a conflict of interest in the case he or she is taking up.\nThe move to amend the law comes amid the government’s move to promote ‘ease of doing business’ in India, which is being highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi .\nIn its report submitted last year, the Law Commission had also supported amendment to the arbitration law to help India become a favoured destination, after Singapore and London, for international arbitration.\n 05, 2015 10:26 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:12:35.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
