Because it threatened to default upon its fellow eurozone members and upon the European Central Bank. More specifically, it threatened to default upon the money it has been lent since its 2010 bail-out. It was being bailed out in 2010 and again in 2011-12 that threatened Greece’s euro membership, not its not being bailed out. Greece’s leaving the euro was never a big threat to the single currency. If anything, its departure might benefit its long-term integrity, because to make the euro secure it needs to establish a deeper political union that includes much larger annual transfers from wealthier parts of the eurozone to poorer parts. While Greece remains in the euro, voters in wealthier regions of the eurozone will be reluctant to set up such a regular transfer system, because they will see that as yet another mechanism to send money to Greece – and Greece has not made itself friends in recent years. The eurozone would have been happy to see Greece depart, if it could be persuaded to choose to go for itself. Greece wanted to stay at any cost – and understandably so. For Greeks, being a member of the euro is what defines Greece as a country like Italy or France (part of Western Europe) instead of a country like Albania or Bulgaria (part of the Balkans) or a country like Turkey or Syria (part of the eastern Mediterranean). Greeks have been prepared to suffer almost any economic pain or political humiliation to stay as part of Western Europe. Ironically, in order to be a country like Italy or France, Greece has made its sovereignty more like that of Wales or Catalonia. The Germans and various other eurozone creditors would have been happier if Greece had left the euro in 2012. But they were unwilling to force it out then, and were surprised and impressed with the way the Greeks (albeit imperfectly) stuck to the task of austerity and economic reform. By 2014, it seemed Greece might – against all the odds – drag itself through its economic reform programme and be able to return to borrowing from the financial markets. Then the Greeks gave up, with the finish line in sight, by electing the anti-austerity Syriza-led government at the start of 2015. Syriza, quite correctly, believed that the 2010 bail-out was not in Greece’s interests. It was incorrect, however, in its repeated assertions that Greece’s debts were unpayable – at least before the latest proposed bail-out. To make Greece’s debts serviceable, Athens needed to be willing to spend about 4.5pc of GDP each year servicing them. That is much less than the 8pc-12pc of GDP Italy and Belgium spent on doing the same thing in the 1990s, and no more than is required of Italy now. The problem with Greece’s debts was not that they were intrinsically unpayable. It is that they should never have been taken on in the first place – they were politically illegitimate. There should have been no first or second Greek bailouts – Greece should have turned them down (as, mercifully, the Italians turned down the bail-out they were offered in 2012). But by early 2015 we were where we were, and having accepted those bailouts, Greece could not default and still expect to remain in the eurozone. There should be no debt forgiveness for Greece, and the repeated attacks on Germany for wanting its debt repaid are absurd. Would the UK or the US not expect to be repaid debts our government was owed? Commentators attacking Germany for wanting its loans repaid also merrily expect Germany, having forgiven the loans it already made, to lend Greece billions more! Accepting responsibility for the debts of other countries is not what being in a currency union is all about. There is no way Germany should accept that. Will the Portuguese or Irish or Cypriots be expected to repay their debts if Greece is not? How would that be fair? Greece should never have been bailed out in the first place. Bailing it out yet again , for a third time, has induced huge political splits within the eurozone, setting Italy and France against Germany and the Netherlands, undermining attempts to establish it into the political and fiscal union (but not debt union) it must become over the medium term if it is to survive. It also risks driving out creditor countries. How much longer before Finland or Slovakia — or even Germany itself — seriously contemplates leaving the euro, if being in means bail-out after never-ending bail-out? I remain very doubtful this third Greek bail-out will ever happen. The IMF insists on debt relief to take part , which Germany will reject. Can the creditors agree? Will the Greeks have new elections before the bail-out vote in September? How will an anti-bail-out party do? If – as I continue to expect – there is no third Greek bail-out, the time will come for Greece to leave the euro. Since Greece should remain in the EU, that cannot mean a permanent departure (only the UK and Denmark, among EU members, are not committed to being part of the euro), without a new Treaty (which would be very troublesome and slow to enact). So Grexit should take a temporary form (at least as a legal fiction – no one expects that the Greeks would really be back in any time soon). A five-year “timeout”, as the Germans have proposed, would be best. With Grexit, the eurozone can move to deeper political and fiscal integration and away from the (illegitimate) pooling of debts we have seen in recent years. If Greece remains in, that cannot happen, and if it is bailed out yet again there is a serious risk of Finnish or even German departure – potentially destroying the euro altogether.
