U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 19 cents to $44.77. \nThe low prices come on the back of weak supply and demand fundamentals, with output from key producers like the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States near record highs just as demand growth slows. \nIn China, the world's No.2 economy and oil consumer, exports tumbled 8.3 percent in July in their biggest fall in four months, threatening the government's 7 percent economic growth target for this year, already the lowest in decades. \n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:32:05.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
