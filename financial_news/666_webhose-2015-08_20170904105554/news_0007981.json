Yet it would also find the government possibly facing lawsuits and push its borrowing costs out of reach. \nThe IMF and Washington have both pressed the creditors to accept some short-term losses to help the strategic east European nation to stand up to Russian \"aggression\" and eventually become a full member of the European Union. \nBut economists said a workable compromise would probably see investors accepting a rather severe \"haircut\". \n\"The fair value of Ukrainian bonds is closer to 46 cents per dollar, versus the current 58 cents, which would imply a 35-percent haircut, an eight-year maturity extension and a four-percent coupon reduction,\" Oxford Economics researcher Evghenia Sleptsova told AFP. \nSome said they expected the two sides to agree somewhere in the middle -- a big write-down that included \"sweeteners\" such as a promise by Kiev to pay back more should its economy perform better than expected next year. \n\"We maintain our view that Ukraine will press the creditors for a nominal haircut of at least 25 percent,\" said Kiev's ICU Group analyst Alexander Valchyshen. \nYet not everyone was as optimistic. Sleptsova of Oxford Economics said \"it may well take a (repayment) moratorium by Kiev for the compromise to be reached.\" \n\"The government may be tempted to try its luck and announce a moratorium and then soften its position if the impact on the economy turns out to be dramatic.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T23:33:07.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
