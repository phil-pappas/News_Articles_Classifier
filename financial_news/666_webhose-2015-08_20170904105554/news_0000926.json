REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nBy Lisa Twaronite \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares extended early gains on Thursday, taking heart from a late recovery on Wall Street and from efforts by China's central bank to slow the sharp descent of the yuan. \nLosses for the currency early Thursday were slight after the central bank set a midpoint that was again lower than the previous day's, but not as weak as some feared. \nStill, traders remain cautious about how low the yuan might go. Sources told Reuters some powerful voices in the government are pushing for an even deeper devaluation to help China's struggling exporters. \nThe People's Bank of China set its midpoint rate at 6.4010 per dollar prior to market open, weaker than the previous fix of 6.3306. \nThe yuan opened slightly weaker but the gap between the guidance rate and the traded rate closed sharply as the central bank moved to stem a sharp selloff that saw the currency lose around 4 percent in just two days. \nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.7 percent, after U.S. shares rebounded and two out of three main indexes end in positive territory. \nJapan's Nikkei stock index was up 0.4 percent, shrugging off downbeat capital expenditure figures. \nJapanese data released before the market open showed Japan's core machinery orders fell a greater-than-expected 7.9 percent in June, down for the first time in four months. \nThe risk-averse mood after China's moves this week had heightened the appeal of safe-haven government debt, which then pushed down U.S. Treasury yields and pressured the U.S. dollar. \nBut benchmark 10-year note prices fell from three-month highs after a lacklustre auction, with the 10-year yield at 2.162 percent in Asian trading, compared to its U.S. close of 2.130 percent. \nThe dollar also suffered as investors pared back bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve's long-awaited interest rate hike would come as early as its Sept. 16-17 meeting. \nShort-term U.S. interest rates markets indicated investors were pricing in no more than a 40 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates next month. \n\"Pressure to unwind dollar long positions is mounting and focus is on how long this trend will continue. 'China risk' has dampened hopes for a September rate hike and upcoming data could further chip away at expectations for a Fed tightening,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo. \nAgainst the yen, the dollar was about 0.1 percent higher at 124.35. The euro was steady at $1.1154 after scaling a one-month peak of $1.1215 on Wednesday, helped by the unwinding of euro-funded carry trades in the yuan and other emerging market currencies. \nIn commodities trading, spot gold was down about 0.2 percent at $1,122.20 an ounce after logging its fifth straight session of gains. \nThree-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell about 0.8 percent to $5,145.50 a tonne, moving back toward the previous session's six-year low of $5,062 a tonne. \nCrude oil futures gained overnight on lower U.S. crude stockpiles, but remained not far from six-year lows plumbed this week on fears that China's weaker currency would hit imports. U.S. crude was down about 0.1 percent at $43.28 a barrel, while Brent added about 0.2 percent to $49.75. \n(Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo; Editing by Eric Meijer and Richard Borsuk) Currency", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T06:12:32.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
