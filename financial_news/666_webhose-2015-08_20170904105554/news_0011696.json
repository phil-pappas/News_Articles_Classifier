Virgin offers direct flights from Sydney and Brisbane to Los Angeles, with domestic connections available from other cities.\n'There are bits of Australia under-served' The reality for us is with Virgin we compartmentalise our relationship with them,\" Mr Luxon said, pointing to Virgin's alliance with Air NZ on trans-Tasman routes but Delta Air Lines on trans-Pacific routes.\"We look at it and we think there are bits of Australia under-served in connecting to North America and South America.\"\nHe said Virgin would benefit from Air NZ gaining more market share in Australia because that traffic was carried via trans-Tasman routes that are part of their alliance.\nDocuments filed by Qantas and American Airlines, which are seeking to deepen their trans-Pacific partnership, show Air NZ last year had a 5.7 per cent share of traffic between Australia and the US, including Hawaii, and a 10.8 per cent share of traffic between Australia and Canada.\nQantas and American have indicated the potential for American to begin flights on the Auckland-Los Angeles route as early next year, breaking Air NZ's monopoly on flights between New Zealand and North America.\nMr Luxon said Qantas and American carriers had previously struggled with the Auckland-Los Angeles route because it did not have as much business traffic as routes between the US and Australia.\n\"You have to understand leisure not corporate,\" he said. \"We are comfortable taking on competition from any airline in the world.\"\nHe said Air NZ was examining additional new routes in North and South America. Qantas has signalled the potential to fly more routes from cities other than Sydney once it receives its new Boeing 787-9 aircraft from 2017 and chief executive Alan Joyce has mentioned Melbourne-Dallas as a possibility.", "external_links": ["http://www.traveller.com.au/qantas-boeing-7879-dreamliner-routes-what-qantas-has-planned-for-new-planes-gj3tdb"], "published": "2015-08-26T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:07:16.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
