I've never been on a cruise ship before. I've peered into them from the dock, I've read accounts of grand voyages from days gone by and I've heard my friends sing their praises ad nauseam.\nBut I've never even set foot on an ocean liner. So the invitation to join the final five days of the maiden voyage of the Norwegian vessel Viking Star, then celebrate its official launch at a ceremony on our arrival in Bergen is more than a thrilling surprise. It feels like a belated entry into the promised land (pardon the mixed metaphor).\nMy wife Aviva and I are torn between excitement and nerves as we walk down the gangplank to board at London's Greenwich wharf. Images of elegant dining rooms, cocktails by the pool and quoits on the deck compete with anxiety about rough seas, garish decor and pesky neighbours.\nWithin five seconds of entering the lobby, the nerves are fading fast. Aviva has spied a small sandwich bar where a rosette of smoked salmon glistens aboard a piece of dark rye. \"I want that, before dinner,\" she whispers as we walk up the grand staircase to the mezzanine. We have entered a world of kitsch-free luxury. It's also free of something else that can be hard on the senses: children. This is an almost adults-only vessel. While children aged 16 can share a room with a parent or responsible adult, Viking reserves the right to limit the number of under 18-year-olds on board.\nThe Explorer's Lounge is ideal for daytime viewing as well as a quiet nightcap. \"We want it to feel like a living room at home, and everything that comes with that,\" Viking Line's chief architect explains. I think he means a living room after the kids have left home. Right now, all shiny and brand new, the ship looks straight out of a decor magazine.\nWe head to our bedroom – sorry, stateroom. Each cabin has a generous verandah and is decorated with crisp white linen, plush bathrobes and impressive bathroom. While it's tempting to just order room service (available 24 hours a day), and more of that smoked salmon, I remind my wife that we're on a luxury ship, for the first and maybe only time. We're never going to see the other passengers again. Let's wear our bathrobes to the pool, just like Brad and Angelina.\nPlunge pool Out we venture to the sight of the Millennium Wheel and London skyline in the near distance. We head to the main pool, with its hot tub alongside, which sits under a retractable glass shell known as The Wintergarden. At eight metres, the pool is not that long, but it's perfect for a few laps of slow breaststroke. I make the rookie mistake of choosing freestyle and, having closed my eyes to avoid the chlorinated water, somehow contrive to let my nose hit the far wall before my hand makes contact. It cuts the skin. Next time I'll bring goggles.\n Later, I discover that the other open-air pool on the top deck, a plunge pool cantilevered over the back of the ship, invites no such folly. Its main challenge is to enjoy the infinity wall that allows the swimmer a horizontal view of the ship's gentle wake as it makes its way across the North Sea. This one, I could sit in all day.\nThe Viking Star is, as they say, small but perfectly formed. It has a capacity of just 928 passengers, 465 rooms and only seven decks. While there are plenty of other lines that are bigger and with more bling, Viking opted for intimacy: no doubt learning from its experience as a river cruising company since 1997. Viking Star is the company's first ocean liner, and will be joined by two more in 2016, and it's just the right size to enter smaller ports. It came along the Thames to Greenwich, instead of having to berth remotely.\nThe line also boasts that its average port stay is 12 hours a day compared with eight hours for its competitors. Aviva does the maths: \"That's a lot more time for shopping.\"\nAlmost on cue, we overhear a pair of American husbands waiting for their wives.\nFirst: \"Have you been on bigger ships than this?\"\nSecond: \"Oh yeah.\"\nFirst: \"My wife won't go on a bigger boat.\"\nSecond: \"After this, I don't think I will either.\"\nNext day, as the ship nudges its way along the Thames in warm afternoon sunshine, the water is so calm that when we pass a giant wind farm, every blade is completely still. Bad news for the owners but good news for yours truly, who gets seasick on the Manly ferry and is a little anxious about our journey across the North Sea.\nFighting fit In the evening, the ship enters open water and we start to sway ever so gently. Everyone else plays Scrabble and eats without missing a beat. But I feel slightly woozy at dinner, and retire to our stateroom. Would I have felt the motion on a bigger vessel? The only certainty is that no one else is even remotely concerned, including my wife, who stays in the restaurant to savour dessert. The crossing is pretty smooth and after a good night's sleep, I am fighting fit for breakfast next morning.\nSailing from London to Bergen through the North Sea is generally calm during the summer months but can be rough in winter, (as no doubt the original Vikings discovered on their regular raiding journeys from the eighth century onwards). These days you'll pass more oil rigs, not so many Vikings. We settle in for a few relaxing days at sea.\nTempting though it is, you can't eat and swim all day. The ship provides a series of lectures to add value to the itinerary. As we sit in an auditorium with seats reminiscent of a business class flight, Linda Ferreri, an American professor of art history, takes us on a Cook's tour of famous art thefts and, later, the politics of UNESCO World Heritage listings (apparently Italy has applied for protection for Neapolitan pizza – yes, pizza ! ). The next day an astronomer explains the science behind the Northern Lights. Viking takes intellectual nourishment seriously. As the art historian confided to me later on: \"You've got neurosurgeons and attorneys in the audience. The bar is pretty high.\"\nThe live entertainment mainly takes place in a late-night bar called The Torshavn (named after Viking Cruises founder, Torstein Hagen) where a resident lounge band from Hungary, the Torshavn Trio (you're getting the picture) is fronted by a chanteuse called Krisztina, who holds a nice tune but could deliver it with a touch more paprika. The ship's troupe of American singers perform a variety of polished tribute shows: we enjoy Rat Pack Revisited and a confection of opera hits. The Beatles and ABBA shows are also on offer. This is Las Vegas lite with just the right amount of kick.\nMoving from the brain and soul food to the actual food, that first smoked salmon snack on embarkation was followed through by a number of memorable meals, including a degustation with wine pairings at The Chef's Table. A lasting cruise memory is the pair of us checking our watches to see whether it's time for another feed. The dish we still talk about three months after the event came from The World Cafe, the ship's buffet: garlic prawns grilled to order. They were so good, we asked chef to cook another plateful.\nThe ship also has a culinary surprise hidden away from the three sit-down restaurants. On our first night we head up to the Explorers' Lounge at 11pm for a quiet nightcap, only to be greeted by a minor commotion. The Norwegian deli Mamsen's is open (every night from 10pm to midnight, we are told) and word has spread that its famous split pea and ham soup is available.\nWith so many calories staring us in the face, we have to exercise too. But only a bit at a time. Every morning, weather permitting, the ladies don their kit and head to the top deck for plein-air Pilates, yoga and Zumba before breakfast. I settle for the gym and a few laps around the lower deck.\nSnow grotto My wife comes back with a ruddy red face and books a Swedish deep tissue massage ($150 plus $22 service fee). Next she persuades me to try the spa, which has its own snow grotto. I roll my eyes but there's no way out. Like a chastened schoolboy, I follow her down to the spa and make my way into a luminous blue glass box (minus 10 degrees) that produces snowflakes overnight. You go into the steam room for three minutes, then hop into the grotto for 20 seconds. \"Do it six times,\" our guide tells us. I managed twice in the grotto, after which I worry my feet might stick to the ground.\nIt's a fun way to sweat but I'd prefer the owner's suite, which has a sauna built into the private balcony and a floor-to-ceiling glass wall, along with a private boardroom. It's yours for just under $4000 a night. Oh, to be a CEO.\nNext morning we wake to brilliant sunny skies and gorgeous villages as the ship navigates the narrow fjord into beautiful Bergen. There are two reasons to celebrate: we've reached dry land and will get decent internet again. The Viking Star is equipped with free Wi-Fi but it has been very slow at sea, too slow to even send an email. It's akin to dial-up, although a little Googling later informs me that this is the standard speed with ocean cruising. Perhaps that's a good thing. After all, the whole point of a cruise is to get away from it all.\nHaving arrived in port, it's time to rejoin the world of landlubbers and explore. We take a couple of shore excursions, but the real treat is the fact that our arrival is timed to coincide with Norway's National Day, which celebrates the anniversary of the constitution in 1814 declaring Norway an independent kingdom. All across the land there are street parades and Bergen is a riot of festivity as everyone dresses up in bunad or national folk costume: women in embroidered capes and skirts and men in breeches and vests march through the streets; young boys bang drums; everyone is beaming.\nOn to the grand finale: an evening concert on the dock to celebrate both the National Day and the official launch of the ship. We sit in the VIP area, close enough to see the performers' faces, and are rewarded with a glorious rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone by the celebrated Norwegian soprano Sissel Kyrkjebo. There's also a priceless set by the comedy duo Ylvis (it's worth Googling them), two brothers who've gained international fame for their song The Fox , which has them dressing up in animal onesies before lampooning local politicians. Even non-Norwegians got a good belly laugh.\nNow comes the \"christening\" moment. It could have been too cute, too stage managed. Indeed, the local media has been debating the merits of a shipping line being allowed to piggyback its christening on a day of national celebration. Yet when Viking's video on the giant screen intertwines Norway's history of seafaring exploration (Roald Amundsen, Fridtjof Nansen, etc – more Googling for you) with its own history of cruising, the connection is credible. I want to find fault, but I can't.\nThe screen goes dark, Bergen mayor Trude Drevland launches a bottle of champagne onto the ship's bow, and on cue Viking Star sounds its foghorn, then lets off a volley of spectacular fireworks. For 10 minutes the sky is a symphony of sound and light. When the last flare falls, it signals that our cruise is over. The Viking Star has been christened, the bars are packed and the air is still thick with excitement as we say farewell to our maiden cruise liner and walk to our hotel, past revellers who look ready to stay in their costumes until this time next year. What a good idea. I'm definitely available to come back and do this all over again.\nFrom my notepad: one leg of Viking Star's maiden voyage May 12: Tube from north London apartment to Greenwich wharf (about 30 minutes from King's Cross) and board Viking Star for the five-day cruise from London to Bergen. We're in stateroom 5031 on Deck 5 (second highest of four passenger decks).\nMay 13: Depart Greenwich about 7.30am. Scenic morning sailing along the Thames, followed by a day at sea.\nMay 14: Day at sea, cruise across the North Sea towards Norway.\nMay 15: Arrive in Bergen about 8am. Day tour to the island of Lysoen, the home of famous Norwegian violinist Ole Bull. In 1872, Bull bought the island and proceeded to build a summer home, inspired by eclectic architectural styles. There's also a city tour of Bergen along the way. Dinner on the ship.\nMay 16: Disembark Viking Star in the morning. Excursion to Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg's house, including a piano recital.\nMay 17: Norway's Constitution Day, all-day street parades and celebrations. Cocktails at 6pm for ship christening; followed by dinner, speeches and outdoor concert for Constitution Day from 9.30pm at the dock; then a spectacular christening ceremony and fireworks.\nThe writer was a guest of Viking Cruises.\nViking offers 15-day Into the Midnight Sun cruises from Bergen to London that take in the stunning Inside Passage and Geiranger Fjord, as well as the Lyngen Alps at Tromso. Fares start at $8949 and include a stateroom with a private verandah and king-size bed; 24-hour room service; all on-board meals, with wine, beer and soft drinks; enrichment lectures, classes, performances and cooking demonstrations; access to the spa; shore excursions in each port; and free Wi-Fi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:08:37.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
