However, the potential for lost jobs and production will certainly complicate talks, especially after both GM and Ford announced major investments in Mexico. \nA substantial portion of all the vehicles built in Mexico are exported to the United States. \nGM chief executive officer Mary Barra told reporters in June that she would not negotiate with the UAW in public and preferred to keep any discussions behind closed doors -- a policy both sides have adhered to since talks began last month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:56:16.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
