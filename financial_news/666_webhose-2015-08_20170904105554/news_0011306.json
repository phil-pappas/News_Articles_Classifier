Photo: Craig Sillitoe\nWoolworths was once regarded as the best business in the land but recently the supermarket giant has lost market share at the hands of resurgent competitors.\nSubscribe to Money’s weekly newsletter , delivered to your inbox every Wednesday The problem, as many have identified, is that Woolworths returns were too high for too long. Those super profits enticed greater competition which is now the source of its woes.\nAdvertisement There is another household name that seems eerily close to sharing this experience.\nOn the surface, Telstra appears an exemplary business. The financial metrics are stunning – consistent returns on equity above 30 per cent, twice as much as China Mobile and Singtel and three times that of Vodafone. The company's gross margins dwarf all three.\nOperating metrics are also impressive. This year, mobile accounted for more than 40 per cent of revenue and a similar share of profit. In an impressive feat, Telstra has lifted its number of mobile customers to 16.7 million and persuaded them to, on average, pay more each month.\nIts average revenue per user (ARPU) now nudges $70 while Telstra's closest competitor, Optus, has less than 10 million customers and an ARPU of under $60. Vodafone is a distant third, behind on both customer numbers and ARPU.\nThe gap in profitability between Telstra and its international peers is telling. In a truly competitive market, such a gap could not last for long. Like Woolies, Telstra has been blessed with incompetent competitors for a long time. Vodafone, like Coles for many years, has been ineffective and Optus, until now, has not competed vigorously on price.\nAs a result, Telstra has been able to capture growth as mobile data consumption rockets. Fat profits have sustained generous dividends and investments in new ventures.\nLike Woolies a few years ago, little seems capable of troubling Telstra right now.\nYet as Woolies' experience warns, outsized returns are a threat. Vodafone has been recapitalised by its global parent and is again growing its customer base. Shaken by competition, Optus has vowed to gain market share and become more aggressive on price.\nIn its results presentation this week, Telstra chief executive Andy Penn​ pledged to sacrifice margin for market share. He promised, in other words, to start a price war if needed and also pledged higher capital expenditure on network growth.\nSuper profits have done what they always do: flatter the business for a while before promoting competition.\nFor the first time in many years, Telstra is about to face real competition and those generous returns will be threatened. This is a threat similar to that posed by Coles and Aldi in recent years.\nWe'll have to wait and see if Telstra's response to the new landscape is any better but to assume current rates of return are permanent would be foolhardy.\nGaurav Sodhi is a senior analyst with Intelligent Investor Share Advisor.
