Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl The Business Council of Australia has stepped up the push to get Australia's trade agreement with China in place after the stalemate at Pacific rim trade talks at the weekend reflecting likely higher immediate gains from the China deal.\nWhile it is difficult to compare the agreements, the China and other north Asian bilateral deals will have a more immediate goods trade increase for Australia compared with the TPP, which is likely to provide longer term benefits in locking the country into a new regulatory system for future non-goods commerce.\nBCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott said the failure of the TPP reinforced the importance for Federal Parliament to ratify the China free trade deal , which she said had been attacked by an inaccurate union advertising campaign.\nHer comments follow a similar call from the National Farmers Federation for a renewed focus on the China agreement now the 12-country US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) faces questions over its future due to elections in Canada, the US and Japan potentially derailing further negotiations.\nThe TPP is a larger overall trade zone than Australia's three north Asian bilateral deals mainly reflecting the trade between the US, Japan, Canada and Mexico, but from Australia's perspective it is a smaller trading zone.\nNorth Asian trade Australia's total trade with the TPP group is about $220 billion and it is in a small deficit, while total trade with China, Japan and South Korea is almost $250 billion and it is in a substantial surplus. China contributes more than half this north Asian trade.\nA government commissioned study by the Centre for International Economics (CIE) of the three bilateral agreements with China, Japan and South Korea found that the cumulative Australian export increase to the three north Asian countries by 2035 would be 11.1 per cent.\n While it is difficult to compare studies, the only major TPP study which extends out to 2035 by Ciuriak Consulting found that Australian exports to the group of 12 would increase by only 6.7 per cent under the TPP, including the impact of the Australia-Japan trade deal.\nHowever the Ciuriak study says GDP would increase by 0.31 per cent by that time and a more optimistic study by the East West Centre forecasts Australian GDP growth of 0.5 per cent by 2025.\nThe CIE study says the GDP increase from the three Asian deals would be only 0.05-0.11 per cent by 2035 although this is not a direct comparison with the TPP studies.\nTPP arguments The TPP involves more intense eventual economic integration than the three bilateral deals. Trade Minister Andrew Robb argues that Australia would win some quick export gains under the TPP because Australia has generally low tariffs but would get some significant reductions from other countries under the TPP especially for farm exports.\nBut that depends on resolving severe logjams especially over getting more sugar access to the US and to a lesser extent, better dairy access to several countries.\nBenefits are already flowing from the trade agreements with Japan and South Korea with two tariff cuts already, which has lowered the cost of cars in particular and made Australian beef more competitive in those two countries.\nSome tariffs between Australia and China are scheduled to fall at a faster comparable rate than under the Japan and Korea agreements , which means that once it is ratified, the economic growth impact should be faster and greater.\nThe CIE study did not break down the individual impact of the three individual north Asian deals but in agreeing to the faster tariff run down for China, Australian officials judged that the overall economic benefit of the combined measures in the agreement would be higher.\nAnother meeting As TPP countries rebounded from the weekend failure to cut an expected deal, Mr Robb said a successful resolution largely depended on the US making some concessions to the broader group.\nHe told ABC radio the parties had agreed to meet again in a few weeks after talks that he said were \"pretty tension packed\" with \"a lot of anger at times\".\nJapan has warned there will be little prospect of progress if another meeting is not held by the end of this month but Mr Robb only said he was confident of meeting in a few weeks.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/tpp_trade_hype/index.html", "http://dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/Documents/economic-modelling-of-australias-north-asia-ftas.pdf", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2550935", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about"], "published": "2015-08-03T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:54:23.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
