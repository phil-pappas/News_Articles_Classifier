They dream of a farmhouse kitchen, a playroom, or two, and a garden that is a gateway to the great outdoors. \nSuch a lifestyle change often part of a residential rite of passage is becoming more commonplace. \nAs house prices continue to rise in most cities, home owners are selling up with their sights set on the UK’s ‘‘designer towns’’ identifiable by their celebrity residents and Michelin (Paris: FR0000121261 - news ) -starred restaurants despite the fact that many of these areas may already be out of reach financially. \nHouse price growth in London has been generally been outpaced by that of the South East, with properties in the region now £11,000 more expensive, on average, than a year ago. The upshot is that the sale of a London terrace may no longer fund the fairy-tale home in sought-after spots such as Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire or Esher in Surrey. \nHowever, there are alternatives worthy of your attention. Britain is full of hidden gems. Beautiful towns and villages, bursting with charm, that have been overlooked as the location for a BBC bonnet-and-bustle adaptation and have never made it on to a postcard. They offer better value for money and a sense of community. \n“House buyers are drawn to hotspots which have been flagged up as special,” says Johnny Morris, head of research at Hamptons. \n“People move in from outside and push the prices up, making places like Bath or Godalming very expensive.” But people are slowly starting to shift to “off the radar” towns, he says. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is happening all over the South. Pick a market town with a middle-class enclave and you’ll find younger buyers setting up home in the little-known neighbourhoods down the road.” \nWhen it comes to Britain’s overlooked rural gems, here are the Telegraph’s pick of the best. \n= Ashburton, Devon = \nThe high street in Ashburton \n“The entire backdrop is Dartmoor,” says local estate agent Howard Douglas. The heather-clad hills of the National Park rise up behind the town, packed with the promise of ancient wilderness, tors and rushing rivers. \n“It is similar to Totnes but less expensive, though the gap between them is closing,” adds Douglas. \nThe high street, once full of charity shops, now boasts an artisan bakery, a fish monger and antique shops. \nThe famous Ashburton Cookery School, which started more than 20 years ago, has moved to a bigger site and visiting gastronomes keep the B&Bs busy. Most of the town centre is listed, and its National Park status has kept building at bay. \nConnections: 20 miles to Exeter for the mainline to London Paddington, and eight miles to Totnes for more bohemian shops. \nAverage price: £308,607 (house) \n= St Ives (LSE: SIV.L - news ) , Cambridgeshire = \nOn the banks of the Great Ouse with a 15th-century chapel-cum-bridge, St Ives is an underrated, little town. Houses backing onto the river in the old part cost half what they would in Cambridge. However, it is outshone by its glamorous neighbours Hemingford Grey and Hemingford Abbots, two riverside sirens with sylvan footpaths, church spires and watermeadows. \nConnections: 15 miles to Cambridge or four miles to Huntingdon, both of which have a 50-minute service to London King’s Cross. \nAverage price: £237,815 (house) \n= East Molesey, Surrey = \nThis four-bedroom home is on the desirable Ember Lane and less than a mile from Hampton Court station. Guide Price: £1.15 million. Agent: Savills (01372 461900; savills.com) \nNestled between Kingston-upon-Thames and Surrey’s stockbroker belt, East Molesey is often overlooked. \nIt runs alongside a good stretch of the River Thames and is home to Hampton Court Palace. Hampton Court station is the last stop on the overground from Waterloo and the home-baked cupcakes for sale outside are the first sign that you are not in London anymore. \n“It has some wonderful roads, a little café culture around the Palace, and people sit on the lawns having picnics,” says Doug Parks of John D Wood. The village also has its own enchanted island called Ash Island, a wooded teardrop attached to the weir. \nConnections: 35 minutes to Waterloo. \nAverage price: £553,144 (house) \n= Alnwick, Northumberland = \nNorthfield House is four miles from Alnwick on a large plot. The three-bedroom home has a double garage. Guide Price: £625,000. Agent: George F White (01665 603231; georgefwhite.co.uk) \nThis unspoilt English country town lies at the heart of the Duke of Northumberland’s estate. It is big on rugby, and even bigger on farming. Muddy Land Rovers clutter the roads with Border collies panting in the back. \nThe Duke of Northumberland, meanwhile, spends six months of the year at the 14th-century Alnwick Castle (a location used in the first Harry Potter film and as Brancaster Castle in Downton Abbey (LSE: ABBY.L - news ) ). \nThe Northumberland cognoscenti have always known Alnwick is the bees’ knees but now others are discovering it too. \n“We are getting a lot of inquiries from outside,” says Karen Parker of Coast & Castle estate agents. “People who are taking money out of their pensions are buying here. You get much better value for money than you do in the southern counties.” \nThere are wool shops, delis, tea rooms and Barter Books, one of the biggest second-hand bookshops in Europe. The food market sells local produce, including lamb, cheeses and cakes. \nConnections: 35 miles to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 35 miles to Berwick-upon-Tweed, and five miles to the coast. \nAverage price: £229,739 (house) \n= Porlock, Somerset = \nLocks Cottage has three bedrooms, a thatched roof and garden. Its workshop is perfect for the creative. Guide Price: £299,950. Agent: Chanin & Thomas (01643 706666; chaninandthomas.co.uk) \nWhere Exmoor plunges dramatically into the Bristol Channel you find Porlock and Porlock Weir, with its quaint harbour and beaches. “Tourists drop by but it has an all-year-round community with football, cricket and skittles teams,” says David Lethaby of Chanin & Thomas estate agents. “People who live here love riding and walking on the moor, and they like being tucked away. We are certainly off the beaten track.” \nConnections: 30 miles to Taunton for the train to London Paddington (one hour 45 minutes) and five miles to Minehead for shopping. \nAverage price: £251,076 (house) \n• The best hotels in Somerset \n= Nailsworth, Gloucestershire = \nA four-bed in Nailsworth. Price: £549,950 \nNailsworth does not entice people like Bibury or Broadway do, or attract high-profile buyers like Kirsty Allsopp, who prefer the stone villages to the east. “It is 20 to 30 per cent less expensive than Chipping Campden,” says Annette Scarle of Murrays estate agents. \nNailsworth lies in one of the steep valleys outside Stroud, but is more affordable than the Slad Valley, made famous by Laurie Lee’s Cider with Rosie. \n“This is the working Cotswolds with a great mix of people, lots of independent shops and a lovely bakery, and the most beautiful Georgian, stone town houses,” Scarle says. \nConnections: a five-minute drive to Stroud and 10 minutes to Kemble for trains to London Paddington the quickest takes 90 minutes. It’s a 35-minute drive to Cheltenham. \nAverage price: £308,644 (house) \n• The best hotels in Gloucestershire \n= Cromer, Norfolk = \nA three-floor, town house with four to five bedrooms located by the promenade and overlooking the North Sea. Guide Price: £470,000. Agent: William H Brown (01263 513764; williamhbrown.co.uk) \nRows of brightly coloured, Victorian terrace houses overlook the North Sea in this seaside town. Residents can watch the crab boats being hauled up the beach and unloaded. \nIn addition to the striking scenery, Cromer has a Victorian pier and the Pavilion Theatre at the end hosts one of the last remaining end-of-the-pier shows, complete with dancers, comics and ventriloquists. \nOthers are only just discovering Cromer’s charms, says Gareth Thomas of William H Brown. \n“It has been a neglected destination but its time is coming again.” \nThere are excellent restaurants and a thriving cultural scene. \n“People who can’t afford Burnham Market are moving in. It is amazing. Second homers and creative types love it,” says Thomas. \nConnections: the train to Norwich takes up to 50 minutes, where you can pick up the connection to London Liverpool Street. \nAverage price: £225,265 \n• The best hotels in Norfolk \n= Brecon, Mid Wales = \nA charming five-bedroom farmhouse with a small paddock, parking and a garage in Talgarth near Brecon. Guide Price: £435,000. Agent: James Dean (01874 624 757; jamesdean4property.co.uk) \nSet at the foot of the Black Mountains, Brecon is a birdwatcher’s paradise and the perfect antidote to a fast-paced city life. “Half of our buyers are from outside the area,” says David James of James Dean estate agents. \n“They come for the escape and that tucked-away feeling. You only have to live here for a month and people know who you are. House prices are far lower than, say, Cardiff, and you can get a fabulous home for £500,000.” \nThere are still livestock, craft and farmers’ markets in the old Buttermarket, along with an artisan bakery, fish deli and hardware store. \nBrecon is full of narrow passageways and old-fashioned shops but has a cinema and a summer jazz festival. \nConnections: Hereford, Severn Bridge, Newport (NasdaqGS: NEWP - news ) and Cardiff are all about 40 miles away. Hay-on-Wye is 20 miles away if you want to attend the famous Literary Festival. Trains from Newport to London Paddington take two hours. \nAverage price: £210,532 (house)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:43:50.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
