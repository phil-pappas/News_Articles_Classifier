It found that timing was key. \n\"Firms investing for growth are rewarded during periods of improving GDP growth and rising interest rates, while firms returning cash to shareholders are rewarded when growth slows and rates decline,\" wrote Elad Pashtan, an equity strategist with Goldman Sachs, in a report on Wednesday. \nCompanies may soon be tested on the wisdom of their cash deployment, now that the Federal Reserve appears nearing its first rate hike in almost ten years. While many analysts believe the Fed will announce its first rate hike at the conclusion of its September meeting, Goldman Sachs believes that the more likely -- and appropriate -- timing for a rate hike is in December.

The move, however, has been criticized by some as being short-sighted for placing investors ahead of re-investing in a company for meaningful growth. Increasing spending in research and development and other capital expenditures has been perceived as being likely to deliver excess returns in a weak economy. \nThe tipping point, however, may be near. \n\"Higher rates will be accompanied by faster growth, suggesting that investors will be more likely to reward firms positioned to grow sales and profits alongside the improving economy,\" Pashtan writes. \"In contrast, firms without the capacity to grow sales and profitability in this environment are likely to underperform.\" \nGoldman Sachs has been monitoring firms in the S&P 500 Index that have been investing for growth. While the bank finds it's too early to buy stock in the companies that it has been monitoring, it does suggest that investors begin to pay attention to these companies. \n\"The highest capex and R&D spenders performed particularly well vs. the lowest spenders ahead of the previous three 'first' Fed rate hikes, returning an average of 4.8% during the three months prior to the start of the rate hiking cycle,\" Pashtan wrote. \nOne of Goldman's preferred measures to gauge performance ahead of a rate cycle is to look at companies' R&D and capital spending in the last 12 months, as a percentage of their current market capitalization. In Goldman's view, this statistic is highly correlated to economic and interest rate cycles. \nHere is a list of six companies that Goldman Sachs is watching: \nRoyal Caribbean Cruises In the last 12 months, Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruises has spent the equivalent of 19.8% of its market capitalization on capital expenditures and research and development. In April, the company launched its newest ship , Anthem of the Seas, just six months after launching Quantum of the Seas. The company has a fleet of 25 ships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T07:30:41.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
