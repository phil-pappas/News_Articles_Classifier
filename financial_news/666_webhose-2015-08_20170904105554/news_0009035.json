The decline persisted Thursday morning, after the Labor Department said the number of people who applied for U.S. unemployment benefits in mid-August rose for the fourth straight week. Even so, the number remains at a low level, which indicates the labor market is still improving.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.52% declined 2.1 basis points to 2.108%, the lowest point since May 29, according to Tradeweb. The yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.01% inched 0.9 basis point higher to 0.666% and the yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.67% shaved off 3.7 basis points to 2.782%, its lowest level since May 1.\nTreasury yields fall when prices rise and vice versa.\nThe yields on short-term Treasurys rose slightly because they are more sensitive to rate-hike expectations. An interest-rate hike in September is still on the table, but its market-implied probability was reduced Thursday morning to 36%, while a move in December was marked down as 66% probability, according to data from London Capital Group.\nConversely, yields on long-term Treasury maturities were pulled down by declining inflation expectations and the concerns of the ripple effects on the U.S. economy of the Chinese yuan devaluation and emerging markets’ underperformance.\n“The basic worry here is that the U.S. might soon be importing deflation,” MacDonald said.\nGovernment bond yields declined in the eurozone as well, as European stocks slid and investors sold equity in favor of safer assets, like bonds. Investors also welcomed the news that Greece received its first tranche of bailout money from the European Stability Mechanism and repaid on Thursday morning 3.4 billion euros ($3.8 billion) to the European Central Bank .\nThe yield on the benchmark German 10-year bund TMBMKDE-10Y, -5.68% declined by 5.3 basis points to 0.584%.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:07:31.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
