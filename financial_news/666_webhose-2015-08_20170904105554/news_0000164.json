The company will pay a partly-franked final distribution of 20.5 cents per security, taking the full year amount to 40 cents. Chief executive officer Scott Charlton predicted this will rise 11 per cent to 44.5 cents in 2015/16. \"We expect FY16 to continue to deliver benefits for security holders from our network positioning and operational efficiencies,\" Mr Charlton said. \"Transurban is expecting to deliver double-digit year-on-year growth in distributions again this year.\" Despite the forecast, Transurban shares had dropped 13 cents, or 1.28 per cent, to $9.99. Queensland Motorways was acquired in July 2014 and toll revenue from the renamed Transurban Queensland, which operates Brisbane's Clem Jones Tunnel, Go Between Bridge, Gateway Motorway and Logan Motorway, rose by 6.8 per cent. The firm completed the purchase of Legacy Way on June 29, four days after it opened to traffic. \"The performance of Transurban Queensland has been in line with our bid expectations and we expect to see further operational efficiencies as we continue our integration program,\" Mr Charlton said. In Sydney, traffic rose 7.7 per cent due to widening of the M5 and completion of work on the Lane Cove Tunnel. Transurban's other Sydney assets include the M2, the Cross City Tunnel, M7 and Eastern Distributor. Traffic numbers in Melbourne rose three per cent and Mr Charlton is eyeing further growth due to the CityLink Tulla Widening project, which commences construction in October. \"This project will deliver much-needed additional capacity for a critical section of the Melbourne network,\" he said. Transurban said the increase in its US holdings in the 495 and 95 Express Lanes to 100 per cent, from 77.5 per cent and 94 per cent respectively, was not reflected in this year's results. Toll revenue in North Virginia tripled after the opening of the 95 Express Lane in December helped traffic numbers more than double.
