With customer interest in digital banking rising steadily time is ripe for the banking industry to make the switch to digital. Three years ago Mashreq realised the importance of digital banking and started introducing a series of innovations in the Gulf region and the UAE. \"Mashreq has done a wonderful job by introducing innovations in branch banking and mobile banking including apps which fulfill almost all customer needs\" Farhad Irani head of retail banking group at Mashreq told Khaleej Times during an interview. \"We are very proud of what we have done with technology. Innovation is a journey you can never stop\" Irani replied to a query on what can expected from Mashreq in terms of advanced technology and digital banking. An automated teller machine (ATM) is a bank in a box. This is Mashreq's new focus of innovation he said. \"In November and December the bank will launch a new generation of ATMs which this market must has not seen before\" he said. Mashreq is among the top five banks in the UAE with 350 ATMs. Customers in the UAE market are still cash-oriented. That is why ATMs and CCDM (cash and cheque deposit machines) are important he said. Today 85 per cent of Mashreq's enquiries and transactions happen outside the branch. \"We have 3.2 million transactions per month of which 85 per cent does not happen in the branch. Roughly 15 per cent happens on mobile. We see a significant increase in it every year\" Irani added. Customers are getting more fluent with non-branch banking. They prefer mobile banking - transferring money online searching for investments online and trading in stocks online. \"Digital is enhancing customer experience. This is where the world is moving\" Irani said. \"What is happening to the branch is a very interesting question. Old fashioned bankers believe the branch is the bank. I can't say that is not true because ultimately the branch is the face feel and voice of the bank. People no longer go to a teller counter to do transactions but they go to service counters for advice account opening investment mortgage and insurance.\" As a result the bank's nature design and architecture has changed a lot. Big teller counters are no longer required but larger service areas are needed to serve customers. \"The days of large and mega branches are over. Banks need to have one mega branch in each emirate and a cluster of branches that go out to communities. A branch without a sales force advisors and a mortgage team is incomplete\" Iran added. He said a reduction in banks' branch network is not necessary but the right sizing is important. \"Changing the structure and concept of the branch is more important than reducing the number\" he added. Mashreq partnered with the Emirates Identity Authority (EIDA) in July in a first-of-its-kind service in the world he said. Mashreq has integrated EIDA cards with its bank processes allowing customers to open accounts pay utility bills carry out cash withdrawals and deposits and update personal information using the Emirates ID card. The new feature also enables customers to update their visa and passport details eliminating the need for physical visits to a branch. Earlier this year Mashreq became the first bank in Central Europe Middle East and Africa region to launch Visa Checkout a new digital payment service offered to all Mashreq credit and debit card holders that makes online purchases simpler faster and safer. Visa Checkout is a 'one-click' alternative to the traditional complex payment process which requires cardholders to provide the same type of information (name address card number) each time they make a purchase online. This year Mashreq also upgraded its Snapp App with new functionalities and new features. The mobile app takes care of all banking functions - among the most significant are mobile money transfer and cardless cash withdrawal. Other features of the app include My Money Manager and ForEx Alerts. In the beginning of the year Mashreq also launched the region's first fully automated branch - 'imashreq' - at Deira City Centre Metro station. In 2013 the bank rolled out the concept of the E Cube branch where customers could carry out their everyday banking transactions using the latest technology. If a customer wants to open an account make a utility payment or apply for a new credit card they can head to 'imashreq'. In addition the centre provides help to apply for a loan make deposits to a saving account or transfer money. Talking about the 'imashreq' concept Irani said: \"Mashreq is setting the precedent for everyday banking in the region and is already seeing its market share increasing as a result of its innovative leadership. The key drivers behind Mashreq's innovation initiatives is omni-channel convergence and is aimed at migrating our current physical and traditional distribution channels to a resilient and robust digital business model. Consistent with Dubai's vision to transform the emirate into the smartest city in the world we want to play a role in achieving that.\" -", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T13:21:02.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
