Mr Stevens said the challenge of setting a federal budget that is fair for all gets easier when there is more economic growth and therefore more tax revenue. \"The fiscal policy debate, usually framed as when will we get back to surplus? is actually about: how do we get more growth?\" He said. \"Other discussions, so often framed as about fairness that is income distribution might be better framed as: how do we grow the pie?\" Mr Stevens said that the most people understand that economic policy is about increasing economic growth on a sustained basis and that most budget measures to improve growth are only short term solutions. \"The kind of growth we want won't be delivered just by central bank adjustments to interest rates or short-term fiscal initiatives that bring forward demand from next year, only to have to give it back then,\" he said. \"A key question worth asking is: how do we generate more growth? Not temporary, flash-in-the-pan growth, but sustainable growth.\" ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/more-growth-can-solve-many-problems-rba/story-e6frfkur-1227499487546?sv=db68b8772a6bbcf042e213bc2d8942a3", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/more-growth-can-solve-many-problems-rba/story-e6frfkur-1227499487546?sv=db68b8772a6bbcf042e213bc2d8942a3", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/more-growth-can-solve-many-problems-rba/story-e6frfkur-1227499487546?sv=db68b8772a6bbcf042e213bc2d8942a3&title=More+growth+can+solve+many+problems%3A+RBA", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=More+growth+can+solve+many+problems%3A+RBA&c=RBA+governor+Glenn+Stevens+said+the+key+to+fixing+many+of+Australian+woes+lie+in+creating+faster+and+sustained+economic+growth.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/more-growth-can-solve-many-problems-rba/story-e6frfkur-1227499487546?sv=db68b8772a6bbcf042e213bc2d8942a3", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/more-growth-can-solve-many-problems-rba/story-e6frfkur-1227499487546?sv=db68b8772a6bbcf042e213bc2d8942a3&h=More+growth+can+solve+many+problems%3A+RBA", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/more-growth-can-solve-many-problems-rba/story-e6frfkur-1227499487546?sv=db68b8772a6bbcf042e213bc2d8942a3&title=More+growth+can+solve+many+problems%3A+RBA"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:40:14.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
