Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer on Monday told Bloomberg he doesn't expect the first rate hike in nine years to occur until inflation returns to the central bank's 2% target. \nHis comments pushed UK stocks higher after spending the earlier part of the day in the red on the back of weak Chinese data. \nChinese exports fell 8.3%, the biggest drop in four months and more than forecasts for a 1% decline. Imports dipped 8.1% in July, in line with market consensus. \nSeparately, Chinese inflation grew 1.6% year-on-year in July, up from 1.4% the previous month and ahead of estimates of 1.5%. However, the figure remains well below the government's target of around 3%, adding pressure to roll out more stimulus to support China's economy. \nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets , said, \"the latest data out of China at the weekend continued to point to an economy struggling to keep its feet, despite four cuts to bank reserve requirements, in the last six months, as well as benchmark lending rates which currently sit at record lows.\" Meanwhile, Greece continued to make headlines as an official from the debt-ridden country said it is hoping to conclude negotiations with its creditors by early Tuesday. \nGreek ministers, EU representatives and the International Monetary Fund resumed talks on Monday morning after extensive talks on Sunday. \n\"Efforts are being made to conclude the negotiations, the horizon is by Monday night or early Tuesday,\" a Greek official said. \nGreece needs to clinch a deal before 20 August when it owes €3.5bn to the European Central Bank. \nOil producers decline Oil producers, including Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) , headed south as Brent crude hovered just under $49 per barrel, the lowest level since January. OPEC said it has no plans for an emergency meeting to address the issue. \nPrudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) slumped a day ahead of its half-year results after announcing the appointment of Penny James as chief risk officer to replace John Foley. \nShire (Amsterdam: QB8.AS - news ) , on the other hand, was a top riser on news it is close to starting takeover negotiations with Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) , just days after the US group rejected its $31bn approach. \nCarillion (Other OTC: CIOIF - news ) gained after saying it has been selected by the UK government for a new facilities management services agreement that could earn the construction and outsourcing company up to £4.1bn. \nMeggitt (Other OTC: MEGGF - news ) was higher after agreeing to acquire the advanced composites business of Cobham (Other OTC: CBHMF - news ) for $200m in cash financed from existing resources, in a deal that is expected to be immediately earnings-enhancing. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,227.51 +0.78% FTSE 100 6,736.22 +0.26% FTSE 250 17,760.88 +0.59% FTSE 100 - Risers Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (RIO) 2,635.00p +1.84% Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 649.50p +1.80% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 967.50p +1.68% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 5,380.00p +1.51% BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (BLT) 1,209.00p +1.51% Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) (SPD) 817.50p +1.49% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 556.50p +1.46% Smiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) (SMIN) 1,206.00p +1.43% Wolseley (EUREX: WLYH.EX - news ) (WOS) 4,273.00p +1.40% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 969.00p +1.36% FTSE 100 - Fallers Prudential (Amsterdam: PD8.AS - news ) (PRU (HKSE: 2378-OL.HK - news ) ) 1,506.50p -1.44% Tesco (TSCO) 212.75p -1.41% Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) (J) (SBRY) 264.40p -1.23% G4S (Amsterdam: GF6.AS - news ) (GFS (Taiwan OTC: 6026.TWO - news ) ) 269.60p -1.03% Lloyds Banking Group (Other OTC: LLOBF - news ) (LLOY) 81.30p -1.01% Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) (STAN) 917.00p -1.01% InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) 2,592.00p -0.88% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 183.00p -0.76% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,045.00p -0.76% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,470.00p -0.74% FTSE 250 - Risers Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) (VED) 491.40p +10.01% Lonmin (LMI) 44.35p +8.44% Evraz (EVR) 95.65p +6.75% Polymetal International (Other OTC: AUCOY - news ) (POLY) 459.70p +5.78% Nostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) (NOG (Taiwan OTC: 5279.TWO - news ) ) 548.50p +5.58% Card Factory (LSE: CARD.L - news ) (CARD) 366.90p +4.44% Jimmy Choo (LSE: CHOO.L - news ) (CHOO) 181.40p +4.25% Just Eat (Other OTC: JSTLF - news ) (JE.) 414.00p +3.19% IP Group (LSE: IPO.L - news ) (IPO) 213.00p +2.90% Kier Group (LSE: KIE.L - news ) (KIE) 1,466.00p +2.45% FTSE 250 - Fallers esure Group (ESUR) 240.00p -9.60% Petrofac Ltd.
