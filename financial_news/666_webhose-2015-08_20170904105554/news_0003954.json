The move comes after a week of upheaval in the country's dairy industry during which farmers have herded cattle through supermarkets in protest at the rock-bottom prices they're being paid for the milk they produce. \nThe discount food chain has confirmed a new price of 28p per litre, which will be paid from Monday to the three dairies from which it buys milk: Arla, Muller Wiseman and Graham's Family Dairy. \nA spokesman for Aldi couldn't disclose what price the grocer had been paying before, or whether the new price was higher or lower than the existing price. \nHowever, he did say that it would \"result in a higher price being paid to farmers\". \nThe move follows discussions with the National Farmers Union and ensures that farmers receive a guaranteed ‘floor price’ for the milk they sell to the three processors, the food retailer said in a statement on Friday. \nTony Baines, head of buying for Aldi, said the grocer was commited to British farming and that the new price agreement was \"the latest example of our support for the sector\". \nHe added that the NFU would continue to discuss with Aldi its position on cheese and other dairy products. \nRob Harrison, chairman of the National Farmers Union, said: \"Aldi has shown that it supports the farming community and has developed sustainable agreements with its liquid milk suppliers, in addition to its existing strong commitments to the farmers of Britain in fresh meat and produce.\" \nBut dairy farmers won't necessarily be better off. That's because Aldi won't be able to guarantee that the difference in price filters down to the farmers. It is up to the dairies to decide how much they pay producers for the raw product. \nThe news came as Morrisons - which has been targeted by protesters over its treatment of dairy farmers - announced that it would pay dairies at least 26p a litre for processed fresh milk later this month and through the winter. \nThe supermarket chain also unveiled plans to sell an upmarket cheddar cheese, priced 34p higher than its standard cheddar, delivering the equivalent of 10p a litre back to farmers who supply the milk, the supermarket said. \nThat's despite coming under fire this week when Morrisons announced plans to introduce a \"Milk for Farmers\" range, priced at a 10p per litre premium to its standard range in a bid to \"help\" farmers. \nThe milk would be exactly the same type as the regular brand, but the extra cash would be \"passed back directly to dairy farmers\". \nMorrisons was accused of making an inadequate “token gesture” towards Britain’s struggling dairy industry while continuing to pay them “unsustainably” low prices for its regular brand. \n• Dairy Crest (LSE: DCG.L - news ) profits plunge as the milk industry's woes worsen \n• Cows herded through Asda in dairy protest \n• In Pictures: the milkman on his rounds \nCritics also slammed the retail giant for trying to absolve itself of its responsibility by passing the issue on to consumers and said if supermarkets wanted to engage in price wars over milk they should do so at the expense of their own profits, not those of farmers. \nIt has been a difficult year for dairy. Fierce competition among supermarkets and an oversupply in the global milk markets has hit farmers and processors alike. Dairy prices are expected to fall further. \nThe abolition of European milk production quotas, which took effect from April 1, 2015, is another cause for concern for many in the dairy industry. \nWhile UK production has been unconstrained by the quota system, milk production across the continent and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) is widely expected to ramp up, potentially leading to a greater volume of imports into the domestic market. \nBut some of Britain’s struggling dairy farmers are fighting back, seeking ways to sell milk directly to customers as part of an ongoing crisis over pricing. \nFarmdrop, an online service that connects local farmers with customers, has seen a 700pc increase in farmers registering to sell their milk directly to consumers since the start of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T18:41:21.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
