The situation will be worse if pragmatic measures are not put in place to support farmers to improve their soil fertility,” he stated. \nHe explained the eco-technology and biotechnology systems where management of the crop environment becomes necessary and the introduction of new varieties could serve as alternative for farmers. \nHigh quality soil is vital for increased food production while poor farming methods like mono cropping over long period deplete soil nutrients. \n“With a very good soil, you will have good crops and poor reduction. But with a very bad soil, you will have poor yields. If farmers cannot produce enough to feed themselves how can they feed the nation?” asked Dr. Issaka. \nExperts say once soil nutrients are depleted, crop yield involuntarily reduces, a situation they say confronts Ghana’s agriculture. \nDr. Nuhu and other soil scientists want practical measures to halt the trend to ensure food security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T20:35:34.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
