Slaughter cattle have already been fattened up and are ready to be killed, as opposed to feeder cattle which are kept in a feedlot in their destination country until they reach the required weight for slaughter.\nNorthern Territory Cattlemen's Association chief executive Tracey Hayes, who is in Jakarta, also supported a shift to an annualised shifting of permits because it gave some certainty to both Indonesian customers and Australian cattle producers and exporters.\nMs Hayes said it may be challenging to source the additional 50,000 head of cattle and ones that are ready for slaughter.\n\"It is difficult managing the logistics in the paddock but also for the shippers and exporters. A lot of the ships have been deployed to other jobs now,\" she said.\n\"Some of our slaughter product has been going into Vietnam. It's more difficult to source at short notice and further reinforces our position that there is merit in pursuing an annual permit allocation system.\n\"It would provide a level assurance to both Indonesia and Australia. It would enable our members to position themselves to be able to meet the demand and supply in a timely manner.\"\nAgriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce called on Jakarta last month to introduce an annual permit issuing system after it slashed import numbers for the quarter.\n\"The quarterly quota system brings a form of uncertainty. An uncertainty in price from Jakarta and supply from Australia and in any business you've got to look further down the supply chain,\" Mr Joyce said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:41:48.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
