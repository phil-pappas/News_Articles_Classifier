Dallas Kilponen Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell It's a pity Myer shareholders were few and far between on the guest list at the retailer's spring fashion launch on Thursday night.\nThe parade provided a sneak peek of the significant changes set to occur in Myer's 67 stores as new chief executive Richard Umbers and chief merchandise and marketing officer Daniel Bracken attempt to reverse a 20-year slide in sales by making Myer's offer more relevant to customers.\nRather than being a one-stop shop for fashion, accessories and homewares, Myer believes the future for department stores is in offering a curated range that better reflects the needs and aspirations of shoppers.\nHence, the spring parade featured fewer brands than in past years – 27 rather than 35 or 40 – but showcased a deeper range, mirroring Myer's new strategy in stores.\nLate last month Myer culled about 100 national and international brands and kicked off a multimillion dollar \"spring clean\" sale to clear floor space for new labels, including Aje, Jack and Jones, Daniel Avakian and Calvin Klein White Label.\n\"We've edited down the number of brands and designers so they can show in much greater depth,\" Mr Bracken said. \"Many brands are showing eight, 10 or 20 looks [rather than four or five] at a time.\"\n\"I'd rather us pack in the best brands presented well rather than a lot of brands presented in a very minimal way,\" the former Burberry executive said.\n\"If we can get the right offering and the right brands in our stores for our customers why would they want to traipse around a shopping mall.\"\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...
