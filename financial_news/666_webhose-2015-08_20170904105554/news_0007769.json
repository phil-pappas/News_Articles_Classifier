The FDA indicated that this delay was expected to be brief, measured in terms of weeks, but could not confirm specific timing. The FDA also indicated that no additional data or information is required from Alkermes at this time. \n“We are confident in the ARISTADA program and our NDA submission, and we will work closely with the FDA as they complete their review,” said Elliot Ehrich, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alkermes. “We look forward to bringing ARISTADA to market as a potential new treatment option to help address the significant unmet medical needs of patients living with schizophrenia.” \nAbout ARISTADA™ \nARISTADA is an injectable atypical antipsychotic with one-month and extended-duration formulations in development for the treatment of schizophrenia.
