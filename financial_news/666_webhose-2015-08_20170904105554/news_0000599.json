The Stoxx Europe 600 was down 0.4% in early trade, following a 1.3% gain on Wednesday, as oil and gas companies fell 1.3% before recovering a little ground. The falls were led by BP PLC, whose shares were down 3.1% and Tullow Oil PLC, off 4.4%, as the persistent decline in oil prices continued to drag them down. Mining stocks continued to be under pressure from the commodities slump. Miners in the Stoxx 600 fell 1.1% and Anglo American PLC and BHP Billiton PLC were among the bigger fallers. \nBut earnings season is also taking a toll. The biggest loser in the Stoxx Europe 600 Thursday was Danish biotechnology Novozymes A/S, which was down 12.4% after cutting its sales growth forecast. \nWeak results also weighed on Deutsche Post AG and Zurich Insurance Group, which were down 2.6% and 3.6%, respectively.

The Federal Reserve considers employment and inflation data as it makes decisions on monetary policy. \nRead our full take on the European markets today here. \n-- Christopher Whittall \nMarket Snapshot: At 8.50 a.m. GMT, FTSE 100 down 0.29%, CAC 40 down 0.12% and DAX up 0.05%.
