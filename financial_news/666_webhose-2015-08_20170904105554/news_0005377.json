Federation and Novion are in the throes of merging to create a $22 billion listed retail trust. Its main assets include Chadstone shopping centre, Emporium and The Glen in Melbourne and Chatswood Chase, Sydney.\nFederation, as the now listed stock, has seen its share price fall to $2.81, its lowest level in more than six months. Federation has underperformed the ASX A-REIT Index by 2.8 per cent since the merger was announced in February 2015.\nAdvertisement Investors said they were confused by the decision of the Federation board to remove Mr Sewell with \"immediate effect\" only weeks away from the release of the annual results on August 19.\n\"There is no clarity,\" one fund manager said, who declined to be named.\n\"Will we now see a change of strategy? It's all very confusing.\"\nFolkestone Maxim Asset Management managing director Winston Sammut said that the Federation board should have employed Mr McNaughton as an interim chief executive, while a \"transparent\" executive recruitment search was undertaken.\n\"This should have been handled in a more open process, just like what occurred at GPT when the chief executive Michael Cameron resigned and was replaced following an extensive search both internally and externally,\" Mr Sammut said.\nAnalysts at JP Morgan said minimal detail was provided as to why the change was made.\n\"This follows a similar change in the chief finance officer role â€“ Tom Honan was unexpectedly replaced by former Novion chief finance officer Richard Jamieson in June,\" the JP Morgan team said.\n\"Both decisions were a surprise to us [as well as the market], and reverses the expectation that the recently approved merged group would be led by the old Federation team. We expect these decisions, along with the associated lack of transparency, will remain a key focus for investors in the lead-up to its 2015 financial year results.\"\nThe analysts said in their view, a departure from formal disclosure documents of this magnitude, on such a material transaction, should be accompanied by a detailed explanation for the decision.\n\"We do not believe this has been provided in this instance,\" JP Morgan analysts said.\nFederation Centre chairman Peter Hay has made it clear it was a decision reflecting the \"future direction\" of the group, rather than any specific issue with Mr Sewell.\nHe said Mr Sewell left the with the \"board's blessings\".\nMorgan Stanley analysts also raised concerns about the sudden change of leadership and what it meant for future strategy of the merged group, to be called Vicinity, pending shareholder approval at the October annual general meeting.\n\"Following the changes, the chairman, CEO and CFO of Federation are now all from Novion and it will be interesting to hear at the 2015 results presentation, how this will affect the strategy of the merged entity,\" Morgan Stanley's team said.\n\"Our overweight rating is based on cost efficiencies, asset management and asset recycling, so we will be keen to gain insight on how well these strategies are progressing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:56:46.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
