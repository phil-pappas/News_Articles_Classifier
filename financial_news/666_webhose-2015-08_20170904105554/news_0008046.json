A recent survey commissioned by Skyscanner, global travel search engine, revealed that 54 per cent of Indian travellers prefer flat discounts when it comes to travel bookings. The survey which studied the booking habits and preferences of Indian travellers, highlighted that 38 per cent seek flexibility of cancellation and rescheduling of their flights, while 37 per cent hunt for packaged deals and offers.\nKavitha Gnanamurthy , senior marketing manager, Skyscanner India said, “With over 116 million internet enabled smartphones, more and more Indian travellers are moving away from traditional methods of booking to a more evolved eco-system where they complete their transaction after browsing through all the available deals and discounts available. With the advancements in technology and increase of mobile and smartphone adoption, travellers now have the flexibility to plan a trip according to their budget– all at the convenience of their fingertips. Skyscanner saves time by enabling travellers to search for flights, hotels and car hire options in one place by comparing results from over 1,000 partners– offering them the cheapest prices.”\nThe survey revealed that while 45 per cent of Indians prefer to make their travel booking on PCs, increasingly more travellers are booking through apps via their mobile and tablet devices (27 per cent), followed by mobile web (13 per cent). The same trend is reflected in Skyscanner’s data as the number of sessions recorded on mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) were 56 per cent, followed by desktops at 44 per cent. Convenience being the contributing factor to this trend, regular updates on promotional offers have also prompted the shift in how Indian travellers plan and book travel.\nWith credit card penetration at 21 million, the survey also witnessed a changing trend among Indian travellers when it comes to payment methods. According to the survey, credit cards (49 per cent) and debit cards (32 per cent) are the most preferred modes of payment by travellers. 31 per cent of Indian travellers prefer completing their transaction through internet banking, while a small percentage (five per cent) of respondents favour PayPal as a mode of payment. On the other hand, the survey highlighted the barriers which hinder Indians from completing their transaction on their mobile device, with 38 per cent of Indian travellers believe there are accompanying security issues, and 33 per cent of respondents find it inconvenient.\n 19, 2015 12:46 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:40:35.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
