Photo: Nic Walker\nAmericans aren't letting global turbulence discourage them from buying a new car or heading to the mall.\nSales at US retailers rose 0.6 per cent in July and the prior two months were revised up, Commerce Department data showed Thursday in Washington. July's gain was broad-based with 11 of 13 major categories advancing.\nDemand grew as rising employment, stronger finances and still-cheap fuel propelled consumers last month, even as the sinking stock market in China and ongoing Greek debt crisis hurt confidence. The solid start to the quarter signals household- spending gains can be sustained as events overseas continue to roil markets, which may assure the Federal Reserve that the economy can withstand an increase in interest rates.\n\"The consumer-driven recovery of the economy continues on track,\" said Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Group in New York, who correctly projected the gain in sales. \"The fundamentals are all in place for solid consumer spending. The outlook remains strong for the second half of the year.\"\nThe Standard & Poor's Consumer Discretionary Index, which includes companies such as General Motors and Home Depot that are sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy, rose 0.6 per cent at the close in New York. The S&P 500 fluctuated between gains and losses, closing down 0.1 per cent to 2083.39, as concerns over China's economy faded.\nGlobal markets have been jolted since Chinese policy makers on Tuesday unexpectedly devalued their currency, the yuan. That may further strain already unsteady consumer confidence.\nThe Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was little changed at 40.7 in the week ended August 9 compared with 40.3 in the prior period, which was the lowest level since early June, another report showed Thursday. While attitudes on the buying climate improved, views on the economy and personal finances stagnated.\nThe increase in retail sales last month matched the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Estimates ranged from gains of 0.1 per cent to 1 per cent.\nUpward revisions to retail sales figures from May and June, combined with another report that showed inventories jumped at the end of the quarter, prompted economists to boost tracking estimates of second-quarter consumer spending and gross domestic product. Economists at Morgan Stanley and Barclays now see growth exceeding 3 per cent at an annualised rate from April through June, compared with the Commerce Department's advance estimate of 2.3 per cent issued last month.\nThe third-quarter outlook was more mixed, with the gain in retail sales boosting some consumer-spending forecasts, while the June surge in stockpiling signalled future cutbacks that will hurt growth.\nSales at automobile dealers grew 1.4 per cent in July after dropping 1.5 per cent the prior month, Thursday's Commerce Department report showed.\nIndustry data from Ward's Automotive Group showed sales of cars and light trucks climbed to a 17.5 million annualised rate in July from almost 17 million the prior month. GM and Ford Motor Co, whose sales exceeded forecasts, are among the beneficiaries of rising demand for large and luxury sport utility vehicles.\nPurchases at non-store retailers, which include online merchants, were among the best performers last month. Sales rose 1.5 per cent, the biggest gain since February.\nAmazon.com held a Prime Day on July 15 to mark its 20th anniversary, featuring reduced prices on television sets, lawnmowers and other goods. The company said the promotion helped to drive orders surpassing Black Friday, an annual US sales event following the Thanksgiving Day holiday that kicks off the year-end shopping season.\nThe job market is giving consumers the wherewithal to keep spending. Payrolls grew in July by 215,000 workers following a 231,000 gain in the prior month, and the jobless rate held at a seven-year low of 5.3 per cent.\nA report Thursday from the Labor Department showed firings are hovering close to a four-decade low. While claims for jobless benefits climbed by 5000 to 274,000 in the period ended August 8, they remain close to the 255,000 reached a month ago that was the lowest since 1973.\nThe economy is improving as Fed officials debate when to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.\nSeventy-seven percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg August 7-12 said the central bank will raise its main policy rate next month. All respondents were given the opportunity to revise their forecasts following the news of China's currency devaluation.\nGrowing demand just reinforces forecasts that the world's largest economy can withstand higher borrowing costs.\n\"Mark this retail sales report as an additional factor that may tilt the Federal Reserve toward a September hike,\" Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist at Mesirow Financial Holdings Inc. in Chicago, said in a research note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:45:30.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
