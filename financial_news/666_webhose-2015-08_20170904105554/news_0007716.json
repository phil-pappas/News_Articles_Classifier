The workers followed up with an application at the Supreme Court where they argued the state-owned bank had not secured parliamentary approval before going ahead with the sale. \nThe workers are also pushing for greater involvement in negotiating the quantum of shares up for sale and the allocation of shares to the workers. \nBut the Supreme Court on Tuesday gave permission to adb to proceed after UNICOF withdrew its suit. \nLawyer for UNICOF, Charles Bawaduah, told JOY BUSINESS Wednesday, they decided to withdraw the case because it was in the best interest of the Union. \nThe Supreme Court also awarded cost of GHâ‚µ10,000 against UNICOF. \nThe workers will have to pay â‚µ5,000 to ADB and GHâ‚µ5,000 to the Attorney General’s Department also cited in the suit as defendants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:08:53.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
