Photo: Associated Press By \nGeneral Motors Co. GM -0.51 % ’s beleaguered hometown is getting a lifeline. \nThe auto maker will spend $877 million to upgrade a truck factory in Flint, Mich., amid solid demand for its Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickups. Located about an hour’s drive north of Detroit, Flint is the location of GM’s 1908 founding that has never fully recovered after being hard hit when several plants were closed in the 1980s. \nThe investment caps GM’s $5.4 billion investment plan for its U.S. factories through 2017. GM has outlined a series of investments in five states during the past few months as executives prepared to negotiate a new labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. \nA workforce of 2,800 in Flint build the heavier duty versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, profitable models that have fared well amid economic growth and low gasoline prices. GM pickup sales increased 15% over the first seven months of 2015. \nMore than $1 billion has been invested in the 68-year-old Flint factory since GM emerged from bankruptcy in 2009. The new investment is aimed at building a new body shop and making assembly-line improvements, but it won’t result in new jobs.

In recent months, for example, the company has announced a $5 billion plan to create a family of Chevrolets for emerging markets, $12 billion to remake Cadillac and $14 billion to maintain leadership in China. \nLast month, GM kicked off negotiations with the UAW ahead of a Sept. 14 expiration of the current four-year contract covering 51,000 GM hourly workers.
