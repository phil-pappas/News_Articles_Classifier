Both sources declined to be named as the matter is not yet public. \nAbu Dhabi-based firms like KBBO Group have been increasingly looking to outside markets for listings, given cumbersome local regulations and fragile investor confidence. The sole IPO since 2011 on the Abu Dhabi bourse, for leasing firm Massar Solutions, was scrapped before completing. \n\"The market and investors abroad have an appetite for good listings. The company holds attractive assets with a good track record and after the merger it will be a good equity story,\" the second source said. \nKBBO's investments range from financial services to defence and it owns stakes in healthcare provider NMC Group, remittance and foreign exchange business UAE Exchange and UAE Defence Technology Co among others. \nIn March, KBBO said it plans to invest $2 billion in key sectors of Egypt, betting on growth prospects of that economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:52:17.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
