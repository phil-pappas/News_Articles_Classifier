Core revenue for the first half of 2015 was more than double the same period last year, demonstrating the power of our digital distribution platform and the efficacy of our sales efforts.\" \nSteve Schildwachter, rVue's Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, added, \"We continue to work with existing media sales organizations and strategic partners to add digital place-based media to their portfolio of products, thereby extending our sales reach while controlling and optimizing our sales dollars. Through a diversity of sales channels, we are expanding our pipeline of qualified opportunities that includes both new and existing clients to drive exponential top-line growth.\" \"We've also made great strides with our technology platform during the quarter, continuing our commitment to continual upgrades on a regular basis,\" continued Pacchini. \"While we are disappointed by the recent departure of our former Chief of Technology Officer, we're excited to have David Esser join us as the acting CTO. David brings a wealth of technology and start up experience, which will undoubtedly enhance and accelerate the advancement of the rVue platform. \n\"David and I have been in discussions for nearly 18 months and looking for the right time to bring him and InstantSys on board. That time is now.\" \nInstantSys also provides rVue with a bench of experts and support... technology specialists needed to continue our progress without adding significant fixed costs. \nDavid added: \"rVue has a strong team of uniquely qualified technology experts who have been with the company from the early days, as well as a robust technology foundation. The InstantSys team and I are excited to work with the team in further enhancing the platform and extending rVue's lead. The digital place based media category shares the characteristics of early internet/mobile banner and video ad offerings, with few standards, decentralized buying processes, and initially limited attention as a media category, but as the industry matures it also shares the same tremendous upside potential. It's clear that digital place based media will take its place alongside TV, print, and internet/mobile as a major category of advertising spend. I look forward to helping rVue realize that potential.\" \nConference Call Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. ET, today, August 13, 2015. \nDetails are as follows:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T23:16:22.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
