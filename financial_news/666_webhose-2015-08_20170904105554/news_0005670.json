AP Share on twitter by Philip Baker A feature of the sharemarket's latest correction has been the lack of panic normally associated with a 10 per cent fall in stocks from their most recent peak.\nFor sure, the $16 billion in capital raisings announced by ANZ, National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth Bank prompted some investors to throw out a few top-quality stocks to help pay for it all, and the move by the Chinese central bank to devalue the yuan was a surprise.\nBut by and large the capital raisings were well flagged and investors knew they were coming.\nFour of the five stocks that drove the correction were the major banks, while the fifth was BHP Billiton.\nMaybe everyone is getting used to these sorts of sell-offs, 10 per cent or more, that do happen every few years.\nCuffelinks' Ashley Owen, who is also the joint chief executive of Philo Capital Advisers, says there have been 39 of them over the past 70 years.\nAnd on his numbers they normally extend further than the original and key 10 per cent level.\nIndeed, since 1946 there have been only five corrections, including this current one, where the losses were kept at close to 10 per cent.\n Normally the selling goes deeper.\nMother of them all For example, there was a 22 per cent decline in 2011, a 15 per cent tumble in the middle of 2010 and the mother of them all, the 54 per cent sell-off that finally stopped in March 2009.\nOther notable sell-offs include March 2003, when stocks fell 22 per cent, and a 16 per cent correction that took place in 2001.\nHowever, including the most recent one, the past few dips have been kept to close to 10 per cent, including the 2013 sell-off, when the taper tantrum took place, and May 2012, when investors fretted over the break-up of the euro.\nThe two other corrections that didn't extend much beyond 10 per cent, Owen says, were in March to April 2000, when tech stocks tanked yet shares in Australia fell 10.8 per cent, and in late 1982, when there was a 10.9 per cent sell-off.\nOf course, this latest correction has come as the overall bull market has been dubbed the third-largest on record.\nOn the surface it seems the bull is not ready to roll over just yet, because despite the sharemarket's latest correction it has done nothing to make shares much cheaper.\nDespite the latest set of lacklustre earnings from corporate Australia, the forward price earnings ratio of the sharemarket is still hovering at about 15.4 times, Citi's equity strategist Tony Brennan says.\nAlthough investors are only halfway through the current profit season, and only 20 per cent of companies that the broker covers have delivered results, it does represent close to 40 per cent of the market's cap and so it does give investors some clear messages.\nAll been disappointing And it's fair to say it has all been disappointing.\nSo for earnings per share growth for 2015 has been cut by one and a half percentage points, while the same amount has been cut from growth forecasts for 2016.\nCiti has noted that there have been significant earnings for about a third of the stocks, while none have been significantly upgraded.\nAnd that has been a trend of the past few years, as interest rates remain low, which allows the sharemarket to rise as the forward PE ratio expands.\nBut as Citi points out, \"over the past few years a period of inconsistent and largely negligible EPS growth, largely because of collapsing resource sector earnings, has occurred alongside a rising market PE driving strong returns, but how much longer can this continue?\"\nAMP Capital points out that if past reporting seasons are any guide all the good news normally comes at the early stage, implying the news from here won't be any better.\nSo far about 51 per cent of companies have delivered results that were better than expected, while 61 per cent said their profits were higher than a year ago. At the same time in February 60 per cent of companies had reported better results and 76 per cent announced higher profits.\nOn the plus side dividends are on the rise, with 68 per cent of companies raising them and only 8 per cent of companies game enough to report they will be reducing them.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-cba-returns-to-trade-20150816-gj0fsz.html"], "published": "2015-08-17T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:13:35.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
