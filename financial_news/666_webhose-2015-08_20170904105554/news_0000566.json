Matilda Parker and Christiana Pailey have both been indicted for allegedly awarding over US$800,000 contract to a bogus company to dredge the National Port Authority (NPA). \"The Family Dollar Insurance Company has US$750,000 re-assurance surety and has met every requirement to operate as an insurance company in Liberia\" said Gbormoi. \nRegrettably, the Family Dollar Insurance Company representative told the court that it has lost its original tax clearance receipt but noted that the company pays its taxes at the end of every month and is issued a tax clearance at the end of every 90 days. Gbormoi told the court that in order for an insurance company to be licensed by the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) the requirement is to have US$ 400,000.00 cash and US$350,000.00 in property value which the Family Dollar Insurance Company has met. \nAmid the defense lawyers stance of having the surety to secure the bond of the two NPA officials, prosecution lawyers continued with their request for the court to set the bond aside indicating that the Family Dollar Insurance Company registered in 2014 did not have the asset to file a US$1.2m bail bond on behalf of the two defendants without any shown evidence to the court. \nMontserrado County Attorney Daku Mulbah at Tuesday's hearing told the court the money Family Dollar Insurance claimed to have is not an asset but rather it was money used to attain an insurance company status. \"You claimed to have US$750,000.00 re-assurance surety but nothing to show to the court as an asset. If you claimed to have that money, that could have been reflected in your bank statement but there is nothing to show\" said Cllr. Daku Mulbah. \nThe prosecution lead lawyer claimed the law provides that for criminal appearance bond of such, the Family Dollar Insurance Company has the limitation of US$525,000.00 but the company exceeded far beyond the amount to offer a US$1.2m bond. His argument was rebutted by the lead lawyer of the defense Cllr. Federick Cherue that the re-assurance surety in the amount of US$750,000.00 claimed by the company was an asset of economic value. \"This amount of US$750,000.00 of re-assurance surety of Family Dollar Insurance Company is of economic value, therefore it is an asset\" said Cllr. Cherue. \nBoth Parker and Paelay facing three counts charges of economic sabotage, theft of property and criminal conspiracy came under attack last week when state prosecutors called on the court to set aside the bond and re-arrest the defendants because the insurance company that file the bond on their behalf did not have the asset, a claim that the defense counsels has ruled out.
