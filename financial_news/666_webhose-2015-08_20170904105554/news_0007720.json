As explained by Dumisani Mahlinza from the TFR Facility Support Unit, €2.6 million (of a total of €32 million) could be allocated to Mozambique through the TFR mechanism. In order to be eligible, projects must be worth at least €250,000. \nSupport mechanisms range from trade defense instruments (anti- dumping measures) to trade related adjustments (to mitigate the impact of the EPA) and competition policy. Paul Kalenga, a TFR technical adviser, explained the technical services that the TFR can provide in the fields of customs cooperation, trade facilitation and industrial development. \nHe reminded the audience that the main goal of the TFR was to increase member states' exports. The EU is an important commercial partner for Mozambique; in 2013, it was its main export partner (36.6 percent of exports) and its fourth import partner (11.4 percent of imports). \nFor now, the TFR implementation has been delayed. The first call for applications (of which there will be two per year) for eligible projects is planned for September or October.
