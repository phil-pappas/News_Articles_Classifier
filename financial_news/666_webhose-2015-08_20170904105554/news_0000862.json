There is a proposal to give special package,” Minister of State for Planning Rao Inderjit Singh had told the Lok Sabha while replying to a question by Bihar MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav.\nNitish Kumar has been pitching for special category status for Bihar for a long time and BJP had supported his demand when it was in alliance with him.\nA special category status will render the backward state a host of financial incentives which, Kumar has argued, was necessary to turn around Bihar economically.\nIn Bihar on July 25 to kick off his party’s campaign, Modi had promised to give it a package “bigger” than Rs 50,000 crore which he had announced earlier. Modi has said he would make an announcement at an appropriate time.\nFirst Published on August 02, 2015 11:46 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T10:16:30.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
