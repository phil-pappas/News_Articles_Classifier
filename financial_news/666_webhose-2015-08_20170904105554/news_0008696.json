That placed it just outside the top 10 biggest mines in Chile, which produces around a third of the world's copper.\nAny labor action would be a fresh headache for state-run Codelco, which owns the remaining 49 percent stake in El Abra. Codelco has just resolved a three-week dispute with contractor workers across its operations, which cost some 17,000 tonnes in lost output.\n(Reporting by Rosalba O'Brien in Santiago, additional reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Richard Chang )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T21:11:51.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
