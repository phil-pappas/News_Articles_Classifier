Income from VAT rose 3.3pc to £10.5bn and corporation tax increased grew 5.2pc to £6.9bn. \nMany companies pay their first corporation tax instalment on 2015 profits in July, while self-assessment liabilities are also due, usually making July the second highest month for receipts during the year. \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's fiscal watchdog, expects the government to borrow £69.5bn this year to plug the gap between receipts and expenditure. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has borrowed £24bn this financial year, down £7.3bn - or almost 25pc - compared with a year ago. \n\"This is a bigger drop than the 21pc the OBR expects to see for the year as a whole. If this trend persists over the remaining eight months of the fiscal year, this year’s deficit would be £67bn, about £2bn lower than the OBR forecast in the Summer Budget,\" said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics. \nGeorge Osborne , the Chancellor, said Friday's borrowing figures reflected Britain's \"well established\" recovery. \"Tax revenues are up and we have more than halved the deficit,\" he said. \nBritain's debt mountain stood at £1.505 trillion in July, or 80.8pc of gross domestic product (GDP). The OBR expects Britain's debt share to fall slightly this year to 80.3pc of GDP as the government brings forward a number of asset sales, including its stake in RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) . \n\"With debt over 80pc of GDP the job is not done,\" said Mr Osborne. \"That is why we continue to work through our long term economic plan to achieve a budget surplus and secure a better economic future for working people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:00:55.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
