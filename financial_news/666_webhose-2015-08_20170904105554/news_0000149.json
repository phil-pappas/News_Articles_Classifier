It speaks to a very defensive game. Diamond Trust Bank has now overtaken Barclays in terms of loan book size,\" said Aly Khan Satchu, an independent trader and analyst. \nDiamond Trust, which also has operations in Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi, grew its first-half pretax profit by 14 percent after its net interest income grew by a similar margin. \nIn contrast, Barclays Kenya's net interest income grew 4 percent, though its non-interest income rose 12 percent, buoyed by new products such as insurance. \nShares in Barclays Kenya edged down 1 percent to trade at 14.70 shillings. \nKenya is Barclays Plc's second largest market in Africa, behind South Africa. \n($1=101.5000 Kenyan shillings) (Writing by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:31:46.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
