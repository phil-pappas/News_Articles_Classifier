Getty Images Share on twitter by John Stensholt Essendon coach James Hird has stepped down after being asked to resign by the club's board, led by president and business identity Paul Little.\nHird has been at the the centre of the drugs saga that has engulfed the club for almost three seasons and leaves the club after a series of heavy losses that has the club in a lowly 15th position on the ladder.\nEssendon players still have the possibility of heavy suspensions hanging over them after the club's controversial conditioning regime of 2012 saw them investigated for the alleged use of performance enhancing drugs.\nThe matter, for which Hird served an unprecedented 12-month suspension throughout most of 2014 for bringing the game into disrepute, is still subject to a World Anti-Doping Agency appeal in November.\nJames Hird has resigned as Essendon coach to give the club a bit of space and to try and take some of the media pressure off the players. Hird said Mr Little had told him last week that \"the club would never be truly clear of the [drugs] saga while I was coach and he was president\".\nHe tendered his resignation on Monday night; it was unanimously accepted by the Essendon board, according to Mr Little. The chairman said he would not step down until the WADA appeal was concluded.\n\"I believe it is vital to provide stability to the club â€¦ and steer the club through the final stages of the WADA appeal,\" Mr Little said. \"That way I can provide the next president of the Essendon football club clear air to take the club forward.\"\nAllow players privacy Hird said he hoped his move would take the spotlight off Essendon and allow the players some privacy from the media spotlight. \"I just felt the club needed space. There was a question mark there and these players have to be allowed to play. Its not just about me resigning, but the industry has to give them space. Whatever happens it is not their fault and the industry should give them a break.\"\nEssendon was subject to a joint investigation by the AFL and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority in 2013 regarding the conditioning regime, which included heavy use of injections into the players and sanctioned by Hird, and resulted in the club missing the finals that year, being fined $2 million and the coach's suspension.\nThe terms of the suspension, including a contract extension for Hird and an overseas study trip, were brokered with the assistance of investment banker and Australian Sports Commission chairman John Wylie.\nHird was replaced temporarily by former Essendon premiership teammate Mark Thompson in 2014 before resuming his coaching role this year. Essendon players were cleared by an AFL tribunal before WADA appealed the decision.\nA former champion and two-time premiership winning player, Hird was appointed Essendon coach in 2011 and the team made the finals in his first year. But many players succumbed to injury in 2012, when the conditioning regime under sports scientist Stephen Dank was at its peak.\nHird will be replaced as coach by his assistant Matthew Egan.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-08-18T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:05:41.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
