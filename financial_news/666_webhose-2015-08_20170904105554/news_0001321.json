Photo: Louie Douvis\nThe banks are holding a rare stock clearance sale, but buyers beware.\nSubscribe to Money’s weekly newsletter , delivered to your inbox every Wednesday They're selling more shares to build up their capital and brownie points with the regulator as protection against whatever the next financial crisis might be.\nAdvertisement Technically, the big four are in a bear market, having plunged 20 per cent from their peak around April.\nThis is dragging the rest of the market down with them as funds sell stocks so they can buy the lower-priced new issues.\nEven worse for DIY funds, the banks are also slowing the increases in their dividends to a crawl.\nCBA made a record $9.1 billion in the year to June 30 but lifted its final dividend by just 1.8 per cent to $2.22 a share, not a patch on last year's 9 per cent rise or even the more recent interim payout's 8.2 per cent.\nSo how come the banks are posting record profits yet need more money?\nDividends drain capital. And those profits come from lending what strictly speaking they don't have. It's been estimated that every dollar they own is lent 15 times over.\nThe banks are the most heavily borrowed businesses around that are still solvent.\nSince they've been lending funny money for a property boom it's just as well nobody looked too closely.\nExcept the banking regulator, that is. It's even more spooked by property prices than first-home buyers and so is insisting the banks set aside more capital for every dollar they lend. This would make them less vulnerable to the whims of global financial markets which supply half their funds.\nBut it comes at a cost. While stronger balance sheets will make them safer and more attractive to foreign investors, they become less profitable as a result.\nThe extra capital they have to hold is invested in boring things such as government bonds or at the Reserve Bank earning a pittance compared with what could be made by lending it.\nAt the same time, dividends have to be spread more thinly over more shares. Respected banking analyst CLSA's Brian Johnson sums up the maths brutally: \"keeping a payout ratio of 75 per cent on more shares equals less dividends per share\".\nThe banks would do anything to avoid cutting them – instead passing the burden on to borrowers and savers wherever they can – but there's no escaping the fact that dividends can't keep growing.\nMind you, the banks are generous to a fault with their payouts. After taking the 30 per cent franking credit into account, one of the big four – NAB – is yielding almost 9 per cent, three times what it would pay on a term deposit.\nAnyway, there's life after the banks for dividend seekers. BHP and Rio Tinto's yields, for example, are higher than any of them except NAB.\nStill, those who bought knocked-down bank shares five years ago have more than doubled their money and are earning an annual return more like 20 per cent without lifting a finger.\nNo wonder they became the backbone of so many DIY super funds which presumably will be loathe to sell. Rather, the higher yields after last week's price falls means that as long-term investors they'll probably stock up.\nBut the smart money moved on some time ago. Fund managers hold proportionately fewer bank shares in their portfolios than they typically have. Some reportedly gave ANZ's placement a miss which a year ago they would have snapped up.\nWhile the oldest and biggest listed investment company, AFIC, is hanging on to its bank stocks \"we're not particularly interested in lifting our exposure,\" managing director Ross Barker says. \"If the capital raisings are attractive in terms of price perhaps we'll take some up and sell them later on. We won't pass up value if it's on the table.\"\nValue on the table would be buying the $71.50 new CBA shares when they're trading at, say, $80.\nAt least nobody says the banks are a sell.\n\"This is definitely a good time for long-term investors but patience is required because there'll be some damage to earnings and dividends per share,\" says Andrew Doherty, a director with AssureInvest which, like most funds, is \"underweight\" the banks.\n\"We're considering increasing our holdings as the banks are sold off because of the capital raisings,\" he says.\nThe banks owed their spectacular profit and price run to record low interest rates. These kept bad debts at bay.\nThey had over-estimated the damage the GFC would do to borrowers – if anything it helped them, as it turned out – so have been writing back into profits bad debts that didn't happen.\nNor did they ever pass on all the official rate cuts either, except to savers and then some.\nEven so, their profits are drifting. CBA's performance deteriorated in the first half of this year, confirming the lacklustre quarterly trading updates by ANZ and NAB.\nLending could be even more sluggish this year due to the regulatory cap on investor residential loans. But their funding costs are still falling and while they've hit the bottom of the cycle for bad debt provisioning, it would take a surge in unemployment for it to rise and even then would take some time to be felt.\nBarclays Bank estimates household debt is at a record 130 per cent of GDP ... an explanation for the banks' profitability but also a warning.\n@moneyPOTTS", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@moneyPOTTS", "https://membercentre.fairfax.com.au/NewsletterSubscription.aspx"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:41:20.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
