Domino Postiglione by Ben Smythe A transition to retirement income pension (TRIP) is often referred to as some mysterious strategy that will change your life. The actual mechanics are quite straight forward but the analysis of whether it will change your life will require some investigation. In a lot of cases there will be clear benefits but your specific personal circumstances will actually decide whether you should be entering this world of untold riches or staying put.\nFirstly how does a TRIP work for members of self-managed super funds? Quite simply by electing to start a TRIP once you reach your preservation age, while you are still working, you will start to receive an income stream from your SMSF. Your existing account balance in your SMSF will simply become a pension account. There is no need to establish a new SMSF, and any future contributions will be added to a new accumulation fund for you in the same SMSF.\nThe minimum income you are required to receive each year is 4 per cent of the balance of your pension account, and the maximum income stream you can receive is 10 per cent of the balance of your pension account. These limits are strictly adhered to, and failure to meet them is not something that would be recommended.\nSo what do you do with this extra income? At the same time you start your TRIP, you simply instruct your employer to reduce the amount you receive as salary, and instead salary sacrifice this amount in to your SMSF. In working out the salary sacrifice amount, the maximum you can salary sacrifice is $35,000 a year, which includes any employer contributions such as the compulsory 9.5 per cent employer contribution. It is not advisable to go over the $35,000 limit unless there are clear benefits based on your particular circumstances.\nIn the ideal world, your reduced take home salary, with the new salary sacrifice arrangement in place, is actually not reduced at all because the pension from the TRIP simply replaces it.\nThe main benefit of this switch is to do with tax. Firstly by reducing your take home salary you are reducing your assessable income (which is taxed at your marginal tax rate), and hence the tax payable on your salary. Instead, the salary sacrifice amount is taxed at 15 per cent when contributed to your SMSF. In other words, if your marginal tax rate is greater than 15 per cent then you are in front.\nSalary sacrifice Secondly, by switching to a TRIP, and converting your SMSF member account to a pension account, tax on any income your pension account earns, including capital gains, will be reduced to zero.\n Your age will determine whether you pay tax on the income stream from your pension account. If you are over age 60 at the time of the income stream payment, then you will pay no tax on the income stream. If you are younger than 60, you will pay tax at your marginal tax rate, but with a 15 per cent offset.\nIn what circumstances would you not consider a TRIP? This will be very much driven by your specific personal circumstances. For example, what happens if you are already maximising your $35,000 concessional contributions each year with salary sacrifice. In this situation there are no additional tax savings from switching to a TRIP, with respect to tax on your salary.\nThe only real benefit in this circumstance will be the tax-free income earned by your pension account in your SMSF. However, you would need to make sure this is properly measured so you are adequately compensated for the additional tax you will be paying on the SMSF income stream, assuming you are under age 60.\nThe same principle applies if you are on a low income. There is no benefit switching income taxed at an average rate of 15 per cent to salary sacrifice which is taxed at 15 per cent.\nFinally, some funds also charge additional administration and documentation fees to switch to the TRIP and maintain a separate pension account. These additional costs need to be factored in as well.\nIn a lot of cases, implementing a TRIP can mean a significantly higher retirement balance, so it is something everyone should investigate. The key as always is to assess the costs and benefits as they relate to your circumstances, and don't be swayed by the smart marketing which tells you \"it's a no-brainer\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:59:44.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
