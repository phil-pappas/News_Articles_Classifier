Josh Robenstone by Vesna Poljak and Max Mason SEEK's chief executive is taking a stand against short-termism among investors unhappy with his plans to spend aggressively to build a global online job search giant.\nAndrew Bassat said he wants shareholders to look beyond \"next week's profit\" and trust the company, which he founded with his brother Paul in 1997, to invest wisely over the next five years.\nWith fewer Australian companies investing in growth, investors are showing no tolerance for slowing profits. SEEK shares were down by 10 per cent at one stage following its result presentation on Wednesday , joining other high-profile companies whose share prices have plunged this month on weaker outlooks or an earnings misses.\nSEEK operates web sites globally including in Brazil, Mexico and China, and is investing in early stage opportunities within Africa, India and Bangladesh.\n\"We're trying to be explicit about who we are,\" Mr Bassat told The Australian Financial Review . \"Fair to say that some shareholders are going to hate that because they care more about next week's profit than anything else.\n\"If we take a five-year view, we think we're opening revenue streams. If we didn't invest anything at all, we'd just keep going backwards and keep being disrupted, so there is an element of defensiveness to some of our investment.\"\nMr Bassat emphasised that there was a pay-off for SEEK if it seeded its plans now. \"Some of it is purely opportunistic but overall we think the investment is 80 per cent opportunistic, rather than defensive.\"\nHealth company CSL endured a similar reaction after it signalled higher investment in research and development.\n Last week, CSL chief executive Paul Perreault committed to interrupting a decade of double-digit profit growth for just the second time to invest in his manufacturing and sales force and two new drugs treating haemophilia due in 2017 . The stock fell as much as 6 per cent in response.\nThe added tension of the Australian sharemarket falling into correction, down 10 per cent from its peak, and the presence of short-sellers has raised the stakes for companies.\nHorizons too short QV Equities fund manager Simon Conn, said the violent share price responses suggest that investment horizons are too short and short-sellers are playing too great a role.\n\"We are seeing supposedly in this period of continuous disclosure wild share price movements pre- and post-results,\" he said. \"​You will see this gaming going on, particularly in a market and an economy which is so low growth. It is a pretty tough grind out there.\"\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia believes that company's internal rate of return hurdles are too high for the environment of low interest rates.\nMr Bassat is the first business leader this time around to lash out in response to a mindset of short-termism that has been simmering away for years, exacerbated by an environment of low returns seeking yield.\nTim Samway, Hyperion Asset Management's managing director, said he was confident in SEEK's long-term future. \"We'd agree with [Mr Bassat's] comments. We'd rather they spend the money building a long-term revenue stream,\" he said.\nHyperion holds more than 8 per cent of SEEK. \"We'd rather they spend the money investing in the long term but we understand that a lot of investors are short-term investors and are simply looking at the next six months to one year and have sold this news,\" Mr Samway said.\nFounded with Matthew Rockman, SEEK has been a market darling since listing in 2005. Now as a more mature business, it is looking to new markets to keep driving growth. Casino mogul James Packer was an early investor.\n\"We really feel we've got a great platform in Asia to do some exciting things going forward,\" Mr Bassat said.\nMr Conn said that the investing environment was more \"nervous\" after the correction, listed companies were becoming more mature, \"and what I do find is the market is responding to short term news pieces and extrapolating it forever\".\nTime to seed plans now When it came down to the trade-off between investment and returning capital, Mr Conn favoured both: \"Obviously, we like them paying dividends but it's a balance.\"\nPart of the resistance to significant investment by Australian companies has come from the billions in losses racked up by mining companies when they expanded exploration and production at the top of the commodity cycle, leaving projects uneconomic when the boom unwound. The big, diversified miners are now considered yield plays in the same vein as industrials stocks yet the drivers of their earnings – commodity prices – are as cyclical as ever.\nIt has led respected Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Young to declare that BHP Billiton is \"ex-growth\" and is being restricted by its progressive dividend. That is, BHP's pledge to at least match if not grow its payout to shareholders.\nSEEK still managed to deliver another record profit, with full-year underlying net profit, which is excluding significant items, rising 6 per cent to $189.8 million. Revenue jumped 20 per cent to $858.4 million. Consensus had been for net profit of $188.9 million, according to Bloomberg, with revenue at $854.6 million.\nThe online jobs and education portal is forecasting underlying profit to improve to $200 million in the 2016 financial year, which revenue expected to be up between 15 per cent and 18 per cent.\nRevenue in SEEK learning slipped 4.1 per cent to $81 million compared with the previous financial year.\nRevenue increased across SEEK's international operations, which had a particularly impressive spike in what will be a vital future market, China. This financial year, Chinese online jobs business Zhaopin, which SEEK controls, will become the number one employment website in the China. Revenue from its China assets jumped 31.3 per cent to $252.8 million in the 2015 financial year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:02:56.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
