The June readings had shown some signs that it was stabilising. \nEconomists say persistent weakness in China's imports point to a weak domestic economy. Meanwhile, erratic global demand and a relatively strong yuan have weighed on exports. \n(Reporting by Gerry Shih and Winni Zhou; Editing by Mark Bendeich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T05:54:02.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
