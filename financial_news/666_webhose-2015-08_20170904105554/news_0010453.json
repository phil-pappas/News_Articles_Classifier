On Thursday morning, the yuan traded as low as 6.4162 per dollar.\n“The global reaction was bigger than expected,” said a senior economist at the cabinet’s think-tank.\n“The global economy is very fragile  competitive currency devaluations could in turn affect China’s own economy – undermine its exports and investment.”\nIndeed, when cutting interest rates and bank reserve requirements on Tuesday, the PBOC said currency fluctuations had caused a shortfall in liquidity.\nThat was seen as a signal that capital outflows had accelerated since the devaluation as market investors feared China would drive the yuan lower.\nAn influential economist at a top government think-tank said policymakers may have underestimated the global impact from the yuan devaluation, which happened when jitters about China’s slowdown had intensified due to a stock market plunge.\n“You chose the timing as the economy weakened and the stock market plunged, sending out a wrong signal to foreign countries that you want to spur the economy through devaluation and leading to competitive devaluations,” said the economist, who last month discussed policy issues with Premier Li Keqiang.\n“This put us on the defensive; it looks like China is the trigger.”\nPremier Li was Quote: d by state television as saying on Tuesday that there was no basis for continued depreciation.\nChina ran down its foreign exchange reserves by $340 billion from mid-2014 to the end of July, which some economists see as a proxy measure of outflows. No data is available yet, but analysts think the pace quickened after the devaluation.\nThe PBOC will count on its war chest of FX reserves – still the world’s largest at $3.65 trillion – to defend the yuan from selling pressure as foreign investors flee the country and domestic investors convert yuan into dollars.\nThe PBOC did not respond to faxed questions from Reuters about its yuan policy.\nOVERVALUED\nChina tightly manages its currency, allowing it to trade within a 2-percentage point band above or below a daily target set by the central bank.\nOn its own, the Aug. 11 devaluation, achieved by the PBOC setting its daily reference point nearly 2 percent lower against the dollar than the previous day, did not look like a massive move, and came with technical changes to make the exchange rate more market-determined.\nBut it stoked concerns about just how weak the Chinese economy really was and, coming days after poor trade data, sparked fears it was to prop up the struggling export sector.\nCountries including Vietnam and Kazakhstan followed suit with currency depreciations of their own, and the spillover fears roiled first markets in emerging economies and then major economies.\n“The yuan is seriously overvalued from the trade perspective and it’s appropriate to let it depreciate,” said a researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top economic planning agency.\n“But the global impact is bigger than domestic impact.”\nThe NDRC economist expects that after a period of stability to restore calm the yuan would weaken further, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates. But he believes the central bank will prop up the currency for now.\n“The economy still faces big downward pressure. The 6.5 level should be an important bottom line.”\nREFORM STILL ON AGENDA\nCao Yuanzheng, chief economist at Bank of China, estimates that the yuan would have to weaken by at least 10 percent to have a meaningful impact on exports. And China’s status as the world’s largest trading nation – it overtook the United States in 2013 – means it needs to be aware of its influence.\n“The renminbi is becoming an ‘anchor’ currency now. It’s stability will have a big impact on other currencies,” he said.\nWhile the PBOC still wants to free up the currency further, in part to enable the yuan to be used by the International Monetary Funds for its Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) unit of account, policy insiders say it understands the need for stability now.\n“The central bank hopes to push market reforms, but they also worry that there may be sharp volatility and big pressure on the yuan in the short term,” said an economist at a top government think-tank.\n“If the yuan falls further, other currencies may fall more sharply.”\n 27, 2015 10:35 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:18:38.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
