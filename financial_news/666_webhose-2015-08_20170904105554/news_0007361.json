If the property market was hot this time last year, the best adjectives property watchers could use to describe the market this time around is mild and uneven.\nEven in the prized Sydney market, which boasts stronger economic activity relative to the rest of the country and where property demand remains strong in key inner-city suburbs, year-on-year median price growth rates have halved from the almost 14 per cent on average levels they reached during the booming December 2013 quarter period.\nGrowth rates in Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart have remained between 3 per cent and 5 per cent in the past 12 months and Canberra has been lower.\nBut that doesn't mean savvy vendors and investors won't be able to track down opportunities that stand out above the rest (see interactive below). With state by state growth rates on average reaching a plateau over the past year, some suburbs still managed year-on-year gains in median house prices sales of more than 30 per cent.\nSuburbs in Victoria around Melbourne, including East Hawthorn, in NSW in Sydney's inner-west, the upper north shore and south-west, and in Darwin's Parap and Nightcliff, all rose well above the national average thanks to idiosyncratic demand within those regions.\nAround Melbourne, the pockets of growth in the past year could be attributed to some ethnic group-driven demand, says Australian Property Monitor's (APM) chief economist, Andrew Wilson. APM is part of Fairfax Media – which owns Smart Investor – and compiled the exclusive Best Suburbs data over the following pages.\nIn addition to East Hawthorn, middle ring suburbs in Melbourne's east, including North Balwyn and Glen Waverley, have benefited from demand generated by the strong activity of Australian-Chinese buyers who have pushed up prices to peak levels compared with other suburbs in the region, Wilson says. This theme is likely to continue to be factored into expected growth rates in the year ahead, according to Wilson.\nGlen Waverley and North Balwyn are both expected to continue to show strong median price growth potential in the year ahead, according to the APM data.\n Pockets of activity Meanwhile, pockets of buyer activity in the mid to upper ($1.5 million to $2 million) price range in Sydney are driving strong growth rates, with Kensington in the east, Artarmon and Epping in the north and Birchgrove in the city's inner-west all continuing to show strong activity which is driving decent price growth, Wilson says.\nMuch of the demand in this mid to upper end in Sydney is being driven predominantly by owner-occupiers, rather than investors, bringing forward buying decisions with a view to making the most of the low interest rate environment, Wilson explains.\nTrading and price growth at the very high end in Sydney has slowed and will continue to remain low over the next year, Wilson predicts. He says after some prestige properties sold towards the end of last year and in early 2014, uncertainty in the equities markets will likely keep Sydney's most expensive properties in the hands of their current owners for the time being.\nSouth Australia's capital, Adelaide, is also showing positive growth in the mid to upper homes price range between $500,000 and $700,000. The beachside suburb of Glenelg North and Fullarton, in the capital's metro east, as well as the leafy suburb of Norwood have all shown strong growth characteristics in the last year, according to the data.\nSome of the less convincing demand trends in the country include Brisbane and Perth, according to APM.\nThere was an expectation 12 months ago that Brisbane and its inner-city suburbs would catch up to the growth rates in Sydney and Melbourne but Queensland's capital reached a plateau in line with the rest of the country average, Wilson points out.\nThere were no Brisbane suburbs with above 30 per cent year-on-year median house price growth. The inner-city suburb of New Farm saw among the strongest activity and growth rates in the state over the past year, with Miami on the Gold Coast also proving to be a strong performer from a relatively low base.\nHowever the suburbs that were expected to shoulder Brisbane house prices into line with the gains experienced in other metro areas have failed to perform. Sought-after inner-city locations including Hamilton, Kangaroo Point and East Brisbane registered conservative growth, and it is expected to plateau again in the year ahead.\nMeanwhile, with unemployment remaining persistently high in Western Australia, the slowdown in the resources state will continue to put pressure on prices in Perth and surrounding suburbs.\n\"Perth grew consistently for two years [and] was the earliest of the capitals into the growth phase,\" Wilson says. \"That market ran out of steam at the start of this year and has been flat since.\"\nLooking forward, Wilson cautions the potential effect that new apartment construction might have on the inner-city apartment markets in Brisbane and Melbourne, with some experts also harbouring similar fears for Sydney.\nRunning out of steam? December 2013 saw the peak of the pricing growth across all capital cities, according to Wilson. Since then all markets have generally tracked backwards, with Sydney remaining the most resilient, he says.\nWilson predicts Sydney's year-on-year median house prices will grow in the 5 per cent to 7 per cent range on average for the next 12 months. He expects other capital city growth rates to be roughly in line with inflation between 3 per cent and 5 per cent over the next 12 months.\nIn the near future, Wilson expects growth rates above these levels will need to be driven by more fundamental economic factors such as improving job security, reducing unemployment and improving consumer confidence.\nWith the effects of the lower interest rate stimulus yet to kick the broader economy into gear, Wilson expects budget suburbs to fare the worst in terms of potential growth over the next 12 months.\nSuburbs including Woodridge in Brisbane's south, North St Mary's in Sydney's greater west and Cockatoo in Melbourne's outer east have among the lowest median house prices in the respective cities.\nGenerally, Wilson says, the positive effects of the interest rates stimulus have already played out. The interest rate effect gave buyers more buying capacity in some cases to the tune of 20 per cent of the asking price of the home.\n\"The average repayment for the average loan dropped by 20 per cent – that meant there was a potential for 20 per cent upside in the growth in house prices.\"\nHowever because interest rates have remained flat for an extended period, the demand that flowed through into record clearance rates in Sydney has already worked its way through the system.\n\"Our wages aren't increasing enough for us to keep increasing house prices at the levels they've been pushed up over the past 12 months,\" Wilson says. \"That's why [growth rates] will remain around the inflation rate for the next 12 months [in most cities].\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:14:49.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
