Why put a floor? If you can sell below that, it is good. That is under investigation,” Chawla told PTI in an interview.\nBy way of resale price maintenance practices, which is quite common in consumer goods and some other sectors, a manufacturer and distributor decide that the former’s product would not be sold at a price below a certain threshold level.\nThis is the latest in a series of cases being probed by CCI with regard to the fast-growing online retail space.\nRecently, the Commission rejected allegations of unfair business practices against five online retailers — Flipkart , Snapdeal , Amazon , Jabong and Myntra.\nThe complaints were filed against Flipkart India Pvt Ltd, Jasper Infotech Pvt Ltd, Xerion Retail Pvt Ltd, Amazon Seller Services Pvt Ltd and Vector E-commerce Pvt Ltd.\nJasper runs Snapdeal.Com, Xerion owns Jabong.Com, while Vector is the company behind Myntra.Com. Myntra has been acquired by Flipkart.Com.\n 12, 2015 6:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T08:40:27.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
