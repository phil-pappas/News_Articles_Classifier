But there are new issues that could negatively impact the coming results.\nHere’s what to expect:\nEarnings: Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect, on average, Macy’s M, +0.72% to report earnings per share of 76 cents, down from 80 cents a share in the same period a year ago, but up from 56 cents in the sequential first quarter.\nEstimize, which uses crowdsourcing to gather earnings estimates from hedge fund executives, brokerages and analysts, points to an even higher EPS of 78 cents. Sterne Agee, in a report released on Thursday, is predicting 73 cents.\nMacy’s affirmed in May its full-year EPS outlook in the range of $4.70 to $4.80, which is above the FactSet consensus of $4.64.\nRevenue: The FactSet consensus is for sales of $6.23 billion, down slightly from $6.27 billion a year ago. Estimize’s consensus estimate is a touch higher, at $6.26 billion.\nIn May, Macy’s said it expected full-year sales growth of 1%. Based on the $28.11 billion in sales reported in the previous fiscal year, the sales growth outlook implies 2015 sales of $28.39 billion, which is above the FactSet consensus of $28.28 billion.\nSame-store sales for the quarter are expected to be down 0.2% from a year ago, which would mark the second straight quarter of declines, and third quarter of declines in the past four quarters.\nStock reaction: Shares of Macy’s have gained nearly 4% since the company reported first-quarter results, while the S&P 500 index is little changed. Meanwhile, it has lost nearly 7% since it closed at a record $72.80 July 16.\nOn July 15, the stock had soared 7.9% after Jeff Smith, chief executive of the hedge fund Starboard Value, said at the Delivering Alpha investment conference that t he retailer was worth more than $125 a share . That would imply an 84% gain from current levels.\nWhat to watch for: During last quarter’s earnings announcement , Macy’s Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said the company fell short because of severe weather and the slowdown in West Coast ports. But he predicted that certain categories, such as dresses and “active categories,” and the companies new Plenti loyalty program, would show positive results in the future.\nSterne Agee is pessimistic about the second quarter, citing a number of factors including a decrease in tourism sales; lower handbag sales, which the firm calls the “Kors effect” referring to the Michael Kors handbags KORS, +3.31% ; “disruptions from the company’s marketing/merchandising reorganization”; and changing consumer trends away from items the retailer is known for, such as furniture and accessories.\nThere has been a push for the company to monetize its real estate holdings. Activist investors and analysts at Sterne Agee agree that Macy’s will likely move forward with some sort of real estate move. But the firm thinks whatever move Macy’s makes won’t be a big one.

Most analysts are more optimistic, as the average rating of analysts surveyed by FactSet is the equivalent of overweight, while the average stock price target is $70.95, or about 4.7% above current levels.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/BT-CO-20150715-713518"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T15:52:52.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
