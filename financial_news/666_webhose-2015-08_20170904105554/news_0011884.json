That’s because real estate tends to be a life raft for investors seeking safety amid volatility when equity markets are expected to turn south .\n“Real estate is Americans’ preferred investment for money that they won’t need for at least 10 years and that hasn’t changed,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst with New York-based Bankrate.com. “Nervous investors always look to real estate rather than shy away from it in times of volatility.”\nBut a repeat of the 2009 real estate crash that followed the 2008 rout of the equities market is more unlikely this time. Here’s why you shouldn’t be panicking if you’re looking to buy or sell a home:\nInterest rates should stay low\nWith the latest bout of equities volatility, the likelihood of a Federal Reserve rate increase fades, according to Kevin Finkel, senior vice president of Resource America Inc. REXI, -0.70% , a real-estate investment trust in Philadelphia. “Clearly the risk of higher rates is diminishing right now, and that could bode well for real estate,” he said.\nWhile the refinancing boom has slowed, that’s only because the majority of Americans who could refinance to a fixed rate have already done so, so the impact of “rate-shock” when short-term ARMs readjust will be minor compared with what happened in 2008-2009, when many Americans could no longer afford their new housing payments and defaulted.\nCurrently, despite an increase in bank repossessions rising to the highest levels in more than two years, the percentage of loans in foreclosure nationally are just 2.1%, the lowest level since 2007, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. They reached a peak of 4.6% in 2011 at the height of the real estate bust.\n“The recent rise in bank repossessions represents banks flushing out old distress rather than new distress being pushed into the pipeline,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president of Irvine, Calif.- based RealtyTrac, a real-estate research company.\nThere’s less risk of a new mortgage bubble\nUnlike the 2009 mortgage meltdown, when so-called liar loans and exploding ARMs flooded the market, the subsequent pullback in credit may have been overly tight, but it does mean in 2015 there are fewer real estate bubbles waiting to pop. While it’s true there are markets that have seen incredibly inflated real-estate values such as San Francisco and New York, it’s not fueled by unsustainably loose credit standards.\n“The changes that have taken place over the past five to seven years have built a more stable foundation” in the mortgage industry, said Michael McPartland, a managing director and head of investment finance for North America at Citigroup’s C, -0.91% private bank. “There just aren’t a lot of the exotic products like interest-only [loans] and super-high loan-to-value [mortgages],” he said. “If things slow down, there will be a contraction, but not a pop.”\nMcPartland says it may be harder for borrowers to afford a 20% down payment and monthly interest payments that are principal and interest, instead of just interest-only, but the flip side is increased home equity (the national average is 30% equity), so home buyers are less likely to leave the keys on the counter and walk away if things go bad. Foreclosure starts in July of just over 45,000 were the lowest level since November 2005, nearly a 10-year low , according to RealtyTrac.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T02:36:37.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
