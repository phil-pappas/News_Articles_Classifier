The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery. \nThe news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices. \n\"I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,\" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on Pakistan's roads. \nHaji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down. \n\"The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,\" Shahzad told AFP. \n- Renewed confidence - \nGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistan's booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year. \nInvestor (Stockholm: INVE-A.ST - news ) confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took power in 2013, with Karachi's share market among the world's top 10 performers in the past year. \nThe country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. \nCar (HKSE: 0699-OL.HK - news ) sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities. Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association. \nBaber Kaleem Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to tap into the lower to mid-range market. \n\"Pakistani automakers haven't really had much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic business practices,\" Khan told AFP. \n\"But given VW's impressive small-range of vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start working to the top.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T09:58:12.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
