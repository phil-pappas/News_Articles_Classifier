Photo: Louie Douvis\nThe surprise improvement in Australia's labour market this year could reflect a \"general shift\" in the bargaining power of labour, a Reserve Bank official has said.\nIt could explain why wages have been growing at their slowest pace in 17 years, and this has helped the non-mining labour market recalibrate in a sluggish economy.\nRBA assistant governor Christopher Kent said on Friday that Australia's unemployment rate was likely to remain where it was for another 18 months – just above 6 per cent – before starting to fall in 2017.\nHe said labour market conditions were better than expected, given the economy was growing more slowly than forecast.\nAdvertisement But this could be a consequence of historically slow wages growth, a reflection, in part, of a shift in bargaining power from workers to employers.\n\"The behaviour of wages during the current episode has been comparable to the experience around the 1990s recession,\" Mr Kent said.\n\"It may be that there has been some general shift in the bargaining power of labour. Also, those industries most exposed to the declines in commodity prices and mining investment have a high share of individual contracts.\"\nHis comments came as Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris defended the commission's low-key draft report on reforming the workplace relations system.\nSpeaking at a Committee for Economic Development of Australia event on Friday, Mr Harris said the regulation of the workplace relations system should be judged for its ability to offset \"excess market power\" held by employers or unions.\nBut Mr Harris pointed to declining unionisation as something that required attention to prevent too much power shifting to employers in the future.\nBureau of Statistics figures this week showed wages have recorded their slowest rate of growth in the history of the data series, which started in 1998.\nEconomists have identified this \"wage restraint\" as one of the main reasons why the unemployment rate has not risen sharply despite a large slowdown in the resources sector.\nMr Kent said despite the slight increase in unemployment, the demand for labour had picked up recently, despite only moderate growth in GDP, and this was consistent with the rise in consumption growth, strong dwelling investment, and a boost in net services exports.\n\"It is also apparent in improvements in survey measures of business conditions, vacancies and employment in the services sectors,\" he said.\nHe told an audience in Brisbane that if wages growth had not been so restrained during the past year, it was likely that employment would have been lower and the unemployment rate higher than we have seen.\n\"So even though low wage growth works to constrain the growth of incomes for those who are employed, it also supports incomes by encouraging more employment than otherwise,\" Mr Kent said.\nThe national unemployment rate increased slightly in July to 6.3 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:50:20.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
