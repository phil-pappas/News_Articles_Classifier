Share on twitter by Will Willitts Macquarie Wealth Management has a 'neutral' rating on Newcrest Mining (NCM) and a $12.50 target price.\n\"NCM's FY15 earnings result was strong. Revenue beat our estimate by 3%, which translated to an 11% stronger Ebitda of A$1,7bn. The quantum of the revenue and Ebitda beat rolled through to underlying earnings, which at A$515m was 23% higher than we had expected.\n\"Incorporating the lower copper production guidance for FY16 has translated to a 32% cut to our earnings forecasts, although we note that around 30% of the cut reflects higher depreciation rates. Rolling forward the higher depreciation charges and changes to our grade profiles has translated to 17% and 23% cuts to our FY17 and FY18 earnings, respectively. We cut our price target by 4% to $12.50 to reflect the weaker earnings outlook.\"\nGoldman Sachs has a 'buy' rating on James Hardie (JHX) and a $19.20 target price.\n\"JHX reported 1Q16 NPAT (pre-asbestos) of US$63.5mn, up 26.7% on the pcp, and 8.7% lower than our estimate (GSe US$69.5mn). In the key US & Europe Fibre cement segment, 1Q16 EBIT was 31.6% on pcp to US$89.5mn (GSe US$97.2mn) with EBIT margins up 540bps to 26.6% (GSe 26.8%), although volumes up 4% were weaker than we expected (+9.3%).\n\"Our 12-mTP (still based on 5% discount to our DCF valuation) increases by 3.3% to A$19.20, in line with our DCF (based on Ke of 11.4% and perpetuity growth rate of 2.1%), which increases on the back of a deferment of the next new US plant which we now believe will not be needed until FY19 (previously FY18) due to slightly lower volume growth assumptions,\" the investment bank said.\nMacquarie Wealth Management has an 'outperform' rating on Aurizon Holdings (AZJ) and a $5.60 target price.\nThe broker noted that at its profit announcement, the train operator's 'overall EBIT was $970m (MRE $973m) and NPAT $604m (MRE $609m). One-off positives offset restructuring costs.\n \"AZJ has answered investors demand for a more generous capital management policy. A lift to 100% payout will reflect little in the form of additional investment opportunities. In the current environment the payout is likely to be at the upper end of the range as both network and above rail demonstrate maturity.\n\"AZJ is reaping the value from the assets. Top-line growth is limited, but for the next 2 years cost reductions should ensure earnings growth and ultimately dividend growth. Balance sheet retains flexibility with both network and above rail undergeared, thus opportunities like ARTC can be pursued,\" the broker said.\n​ Goldman Sachs has a 'neutral' rating on Automotive Holdings (AHE) and a $3.92 target price.\n\"EBIT rose 18% to A$175mn (5% above GS), while lower interest and tax charges were offset by higher minorities, resulting in NPAT (pre-NRIs) rising 20% to A$94mn (also 5% above GS). EPS rose 6% to A30.7¢ (GS: A29.2¢) given equity dilution from acquisitions.\n\"In assuming Auto margins decline to 3.6% and Refrigerated sales are flat in FY16, our EPS forecasts are cut 5-7%pa.\n\"We retain our Neutral rating, viewing the stock's valuation as relatively full. While we see upside potential in Logistics margins, the poor organic performance in recent years warrants caution.\"\nBroker Watch: Elders, South32, Peet, Sims Metal Management\nBroker Watch: News Corp, Metals X, Sirtex Medical, Mirvac\nBroker Watch: Commonwealth Bank, CSL, OZ Minerals, K2 Asset Management\nBroker Watch: National Australia Bank, REA Group, Sirius Resources, Beach Energy\nBroker Watch: Rio Tinto, Whitehaven Coal, Ten Network, Commonwealth Bank\nBroker Watch: Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Downer EDI, Slater and Gordon, ANZ\nBroker Watch: JB Hi-Fi, Skilled Group, OFX, Shine Corporate\nBroker Watch: AVJennings, Western Areas, Westpac Banking, G8 Education\nBroker Watch: DUET, Brambles, Medusa Mining, Computershare, Suncorp\nBroker Watch: Virgin Holdings, NRW, Vocus Communications, carsales.com\nBroker Watch: Brambles, Tassal, NextDC, Elders\nBroker Watch: Sandfire Resources, Dacian Gold, Senex Energy, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\nBroker Watch: Iluka Resources, Saracen Minerals, Northern Star, Corporate Travel\nBroker Watch: Navitas, OrotonGroup, Elysium Resources, insurance\nBroker Watch: Evolution Mining, Steadfast Group, Sims Metal, Energy Developments\nBroker Watch: Austbrokers, Fortescue Metals Group, Carnavale Resources, Valence Industries\nBroker Watch: Macquarie Group, BHP Billiton, South32, resources sector\nBroker Watch: Western Areas, Oil Search, Telstra, Evolution Mining\nBroker Watch: Saracen Minerals, Austal, Sonic Healthcare, Arrium\nBroker Watch: Decmil, Paladin Energy, Regis Resources, Universal Coal\nBroker Watch: Macquarie Group, Beadell Resources, Ramelius, Whitehaven Coal\nBroker Watch: Primary Health Care, Challenger, Mount Gibson Iron, Perpetual\nBroker Watch: BHP Billiton, Sedgman, Newcrest Mining, APA Group\nBroker Watch: Rio Tinto, Horizon Oil, Greencross, SEEK\nBroker Watch: CSR, Aristocrat Leisure, Northern Star\nBroker Watch: Iron ore majors, Aurelia Metals, Alcoa, Gryphon Minerals\nBroker Watch: Gold stocks, insurance sector, Incitec Pivot\nBroker Watch: Crown Resorts, Aurelia Metals, Orica, Amcor\nBroker Watch: Asciano, BlueScope Steel, James Hardie, Cue Energy\nBroker Watch: Energy sector picks, REA, PacBrands, Treasury Wine\nBroker Watch: James Hardie, Brambles, Recall Holdings, GPT Group\nBroker Watch: Air New Zealand, Scentre, Aurizon, Transurban Group\nBroker Watch: Wesfarmers, Myer, Sandfire Resources, Sydney Airport\nBroker Watch: Brambles, Arrium, Tabcorp, Monadelphous Group\nBroker Watch: Origin Energy, Flight Centre, iSelect, Dexus Property Group\nBroker Watch: Fletcher Building, IAG, BT Investment Management, CSR\nBroker Watch: Woolworths, CSL Ltd, Metcash, Scentre Group\nBroker Watch: Sydney Airport, Resmed, Challenger Financial, Arrium\nBroker Watch: TFS Corporation, Western Areas, NAB, Spark Infrastructure Group\nBroker Watch: Primary Health Care, Metcash, Ten Network, Sonic Healthcare\nBroker Watch: Cover-More, SCA Property Group, Telstra, Boral\nBroker Watch: Federation Centres, Rio Tinto, CBA, Alexium International\nBroker Watch: Goodman Group, QBE, Adelaide Brighton, Seven Group Holdings\nBroker Watch: Eclipx, Independence, Alumina, ANZ Banking\nBroker Watch: ERA, Mirvac, Qube, DUET\nBroker Watch: QBE, Goodman, Seven, TPG\nBroker Watch: Greencross, Qantas, South32, Woolworths\nBroker Watch: Mesoblast, APA Group, Recall, Iluka\nBroker Watch: AGL, AWE, Qube, Nine\nBroker Watch: Metcash, Fleetwood, Otto Energy, McPherson's\nBroker Watch: BHP, Newcrest, Yowie, REA\nBroker Watch: Virtus Health, CSL, Spotless, Crown\nBroker Watch: Slater & Gordon, UGL, Flight Centre, Sirtex\nBroker Watch: Ardent, BWP Trust, Domino's, DUET\nBroker Watch: AGL, ALS, Ramsay, DuluxGroup\nBroker Watch: Woodside, Adelaide Brighton, Programmed, Brambles\nBroker Watch: BHP Billiton, WorleyParsons, Telstra, St Barbara\nBroker Watch: Ramsay Health Care, WOW, Dulux, Spark ​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/WillWillAFR"], "published": "2015-08-19T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:05:48.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
