There is a strong whiff of corruption in that; crooked so-and-sos must be lining their pockets. \nAllowing other players to bring about competition and consequently an efficient pre-paid electricity system that will benefit consumers and the power utility, as well as boost its severely depleted coffers, appears a no-brainer. \nPowertel's failure is made all the more embarrassing considering that there was a bidding process involving various companies reportedly well-equipped to become aggregators, which was cancelled under foggy circumstances. \nThe muddle over the smart metering exercise is another indictment of the pre-paid electricity roll-out; another instance of suspiciously corrupt considerations taking precedence over sheer common sense. \nLast year we had then Energy minister Dzikamai Mavhaire ordering the tender for 300 000 smart meters against advice by Zesa officials that only 60 000 smart meters were needed. \nThat the tender was cancelled soon after Mavhaire was kicked out of office shows the extent to which graft and politics are trumping logical business decisions. \nZesa's apology to consumers, who feel taken for granted, that the pre-paid electricity vending system failure was caused by \"middle-ware system malfunction\" whatever that is is scant consolation. \nElectricity is a basic domestic and industrial requirement; It is at the centre of the country's economic revival efforts. \nThus the dog's breakfast that the pre-paid electricity token system is proving to be compromises national aspirations.
