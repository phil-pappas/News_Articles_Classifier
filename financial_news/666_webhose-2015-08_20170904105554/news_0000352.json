Daniel Acker Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Warren Buffett's biggest ever bet, a $US32.5 billion cash bid for aviation parts manufacturer Precision Castparts, demonstrates how his huge investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is becoming increasingly reliant on big acquisitions to try to materially boost profits.\nBerkshire, generating $US194 billion in annual revenue, is in effect buying growth to move the dial on its bottom line.\nOrganic growth or smaller purchases for Berkshire are unlikely to offer the same growth potential for the $US540 billion portfolio manager.\nBuffett's appetite for big deals has become more voracious in recent years, as he seeks to deploy a big stockpile of cash swelling on Berkshire's balance sheet.\nThe buyout trend is in stark contrast to the single Massachusetts textile mill Buffett took over in 1965 when Berkshire was founded.\nThe takeover of the leading supplier to world's aerospace industry, announced on Monday, was worth $US37.2 billion, including debt.\nPortland-based Precision generates annual revenue of $US10 billion and profit of about $US1.5 billion.\nEarlier this year, Berkshire pumped $US12 billion into the merger of food giants Kraft and Heinz.\n Berkshire five years ago closed a mammoth $US26 billion deal for a controlling stake in Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operator of the US's second-biggest rail network.\nIn between, Berkshire shelled out billions for electricity distributor NV Energy and chemical company Lubrizol.\nValuation dilemma Buffett has been cautious on the broader US stock market for some time, admitting at Berkshire's annual meeting in May that stocks appeared fully valued. He has never been a big fan of investing in bonds.\nPrecision Castparts might be an exception to the valuation dilemma, though the price tag of 18 times forecast earnings does not appear super cheap.\nPrecision's share price had fallen about 21 per cent over the previous 12 months until Buffett put a rocket under the stock on Monday. Precision shares jumped 19 per cent to about $US231.\nStill, the $US235 per share offer from Berkshire, unanimously approved by Precision's board of directors, was below the company's 12-month high.\nBuffett turns 85 this month, but when he sniffs a deal, age does not slow him down. Buffet revealed that investment manager Todd Combs presented him the Precision takeover idea for the first time just five weeks ago. Berkshire already owned three per cent of the company, which generates 70 per cent of its revenue comes from aviation.\nCombs was one of two lieutenants hired by Berkshire a few years ago to deploy the conglomerate's gigantic cash pile sourced from its insurance operations.\nBefore the $US32.5 billion acquisition, Berkshire was hoarding a $US66.6 billion cash pile as of June 30.\nBuffett has lamented the ultra-low interest rate environment and perhaps feels some of the cash can generate a better return elsewhere.\n\"Berkshire's huge snowball of cash is constantly melting under the heat of low interest rates and low but constant inflation,\" says James Harris, a financial analyst and Berkshire shareholder.\n\"Perhaps earning a 5 per cent return [on Precision], compounding, is better than earning nearly nothing on the cash hoard.\"\nBuffett likes to retain $US20 billion to $US30 billion on hand for a rainy day and the Oracle of Omaha signalled he won't be making any large acquisitions in the foreseeable future. He disclosed the firm was conducting due diligence on a couple of potential smaller acquisitions that were likely to be concluded by around year end.\nThe Berkshire-Precision deal is the eighth largest M&A deal in the US this year.\nThe takeover puts the US on track for a record breaking year in mergers and acquisitions, with announced transactions topping $US1.47 trillion so far, according to Dealogic. Buffett has certainly been knee deep in the takeover action.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:10:57.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
