But regulatory filings said Geronimo Energy could not secure financing to construct the project. \nPSC Chairwoman Julie Fedorchak and Commissioner Brian Kalk said the transfer of ownership will save ratepayers about $97 million over the life of the project. \n\"It cuts out the middleman,\" Kalk said. \nThe project covers some 21,000 acres in Stutsman County, or about 33 square miles, Geronimo Energy has said. The company has leased land from about 60 landowners in the county, and those leases are still in effect with the transfer to Xcel, the PSC said. \nKalk said the wind farm would be the first \"asset\" in North Dakota to be owned by Xcel, which has done business in the state for more than a century. \nDave Sederquist, Xcel's regulatory affairs manager, said construction would start this month and the project will be completed by the end of next year. Minnesota regulators approved the transfer earlier in the summer, he said. \nThe wind farm will provide about $850,000 in annual tax revenue for Stutsman County and will create an estimated 200 construction jobs and up to 10 permanent jobs in North Dakota, the company said. \nXcel said the project will create about 200 construction jobs and about 10 permanent jobs for operations and maintenance. The company said the wind farm will generate about $850,000 annually in tax revenue to local governments. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T01:23:56.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
