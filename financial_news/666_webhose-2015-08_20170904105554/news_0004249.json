It has 14 power assets which could be worth up to 18 billion ringgit ($4.73 billion), sources told Reuters in June. \nNajib said the government has a plan to reduce 1MDB's debt, but needs six months. \n\"We have a programme to reduce the debts of 1MDB, and the programme is viable. We have to give it time. I would say we need about six months,\" he was quoted as saying at an event on Saturday. \nTenaga, Malaysia's national power firm, said last month that it had submitted an indicative non-binding proposal to acquire the five domestic and eight international power assets of 1MDB's power firm Edra Global. \nMalaysian police raided 1MDB's office in July, following a report that claimed investigators looking into the firm found nearly $700 million had been transferred to the prime minister's bank account. \nNajib has denied taking any money for personal gain and said the corruption allegations are part of a campaign to force him out of office. \n(Reporting by Praveen Menon; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T13:54:27.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
