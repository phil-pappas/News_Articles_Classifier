The parties have complied with the necessary shareholder agreements, including management agreements and we are now finalising the toll processing agreements,\" Nyabadza said. \nHe said the project would be carried out in two phases with Schweppes providing working capital of US$2,2 million. Nyabadza said the working capital would cater for the tomato seed outlay and engagement of technical staff, among other costs. \"The project will commence under a phased roll out programme. The first phase will be in Norton in Zvimba district,\" he said. \"The second phase will be in Matabeleland South.\" \nHe said the project would produce tomato paste. Around 70% of the produce will be for the export market while the remainder will cater for the domestic market. \nNyabadza said farmers within the radius of the two plants would benefit as they will be contracted to grow, on an annual basis, a specific variety of tomatoes -- the target being to process 100 tonnes daily at the Norton plant. \nHe said it means farmers will grow a specific variety of tomatoes with a market-led approach unlike the current situation where farmers just grow any kind of tomatoes without targeting a specific market segment. \nNyabadza said seed varieties would be provided to farmers to ensure the quality of the product is not compromised. He said the project will create between 300-400 permanent jobs while downstream activities are expected to create between 4 000-5 000 jobs. \nHe said the planting of tomatoes by farmers will commence immediately as the authority and Schweppes thrashed out the final details of their agreement. This, he added, will ensure the processing of tomatoes will begin in November this year. \nNyabadza said they had already engaged staff at the authority to identify potential farmers for training. \nSchweppes Zimbabwe MD Charles Msipa told businessdigest this week that negotiations with Arda \"have progressed very well\" and expected to conclude the talks soon. \nMachinery that is still to be used includes electric motors, storage tanks, piping material, steamers, mixers, among various farming implements like tractors, harvesters and sorting machines.
