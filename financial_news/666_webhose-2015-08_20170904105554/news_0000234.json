On a consolidated basis, gross revenues increased 15.9% to $104.8 million (compared to $90.3 million for the same period in 2014) driven by strong growth at its core high-growth business units. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $16.4 million (from $16.0 million in the same period last year). The strong performance from Research, Valuation and Advisory (\"RVA\") Data Solutions and Property Tax significantly contributed to earnings growth during the quarter. However, the continuing impact from lower oil prices resulted in Geomatics' Adjusted EBITDA to decline by $1.8 million year-over-year. For the six month period year to date, gross revenues increased 14.8% to $203.2 million (from $177.0 million last year) and Adjusted EBITDA declined by 7.5% to $28.6 million (from $30.9 million). In the second quarter of 2015, adjusted basic earnings per share (\"Adjusted Basic EPS\") were $0.28, consistent with the same period in 2014. \nHighlights Maintained double-digit revenue growth for the 7 th consecutive quarter. High-growth business units, RVA, ARGUS Software (\"ARGUS\") and Property Tax, collectively had 13.0% organic topline growth. Sustained strong growth in recurring revenues from global asset and investment management (\"GAIM\") businesses, which increased by 53.1% year-over-year. Returned $5.0 million to shareholders through quarterly declared dividends of $0.15 per common share. Strengthened overall offerings with four tuck-in acquisitions. \n\"I am very pleased with the performance of our high-growth business units, RVA, ARGUS and Property Tax, which collectively experienced a 29% increase in revenues in the second quarter from a year ago,\" said Robert Courteau, Chief Executive Officer at Altus Group. \"These results reflect the value of our growth investments which position us well for global expansion of our commercial real estate data analytics and software solutions.\" \nSummary of Operating and Financial Performance : Gross Revenues (1) RVA Data Solutions recurring revenues exclude Voyanta's implementation services revenues and other miscellaneous revenues. Adjusted EBITDA Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, In thousands of dollars (7.5 %) \n*All dollar figures are in Canadian dollars and all percentage and dollar changes are in comparison to the second quarter of 2014. \nRVA delivered double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter driven by both organic and acquisitive growth predominately in its Data Solutions segment. RVA's Data Solutions increased 75.7% year-over-year to $13.8 million, of which 40.8% of the growth was organic from the addition of new clients and assets to its Appraisal Management data platform in the US and Europe. In addition, the 2014 acquisitions of RealNet Canada Inc. (\"RealNet\") and Voyanta Limited (\"Voyanta\") contributed to 34.9% of the revenue growth in Data Solutions. Revenues from RVA's Valuations and Advisory Services segment declined by 15.5%, resulting from a stand-still on a right of way project in Canada, completion of a significant and non-recurring economic consulting project in the Middle East, and a reduction in infrastructure and land services work in Canada. Growth in Adjusted EBITDA was offset by lower revenues from Valuations and Advisory Services and by the investments in Data Solutions, which included funding the early growth phase of Voyanta, new hires in Europe for Appraisal Management, and enhancements to the Appraisal Management data platform to enable integration between DataBridge, Voyanta and National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (\"NCREIF\") data. \nIn the second quarter, ARGUS delivered double-digit growth across all of its reporting categories with a solid increase in its recurring revenues. License sales were up 27.3% year-over-year to $5.2 million, benefitting from strong sales of ARGUS Enterprise (\"AE\"), its flagship commercial real estate asset management and investment platform. Maintenance and Subscription revenues increased by 27.1% to $7.8 million, supported by high renewal rates, an increased AE user base, a price increase on DCF maintenance contracts, and an overall increase in subscription contracts. Additionally, revenues from Services were up by 60.3% to $2.7 million, reflecting an enhanced operational focus on the sale of services to AE customers. Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly in the second quarter as investments continued in new product development and expansion of the sales team and operational capacity to support future growth. Strengthening of the exchange rate against the Canadian Dollar improved ARGUS' revenues by 10.2% and Adjusted EBITDA by 11.2%. \nDuring the quarter, ARGUS launched version 10.6 of AE, which includes a number of beneficial enhancements that improve the user experience, including improved productivity features for users accustomed to ARGUS DCF 15, new reporting capabilities, and an enhanced sensitivity module. These enhancements are expected to attract new users and drive additional conversions to AE. During the quarter ARGUS also advanced the beta version of ARGUS Express, a SaaS-based web application that enables users to perform a high-level investment analysis tailored to the specific needs of a user. \nIn the second quarter, the global Property Tax business unit delivered strong revenue growth, with a 39.5% year-over-year increase in North America, and a 34.9% year-over-year increase in the UK. The strong performance in North America was primarily driven by the 2014 acquisition of the SC&H State and Local Tax (\"SC&H SALT\") business in the US (which contributed 34.4% of the growth in North America) and increased settlement of contingency assignments in Canada, while higher activity levels in occupied ratings contributed to increased revenues in the UK. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA benefitted from a 16.0% increase in earnings from North America and a 129.2% increase in earnings from the UK. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA in North America resulted from higher revenues in Canada, as well as acquisitive growth from SC&H SALT, however continued organic investments in the US and the National Tax platform partially offset these gains. In the UK, Adjusted EBITDA improved on increased revenues. \nThe Cost Consulting and Project Management (\"Cost\") business unit delivered consistent performance in the second quarter, both in North America and in Asia Pacific. Adjusted EBITDA decreased, impacted by higher compensation costs in North America and Asia Pacific. \nAt Geomatics, financial performance continued to be impacted by seasonality and the anticipated challenges associated with the slowdown in capital spending in its core Western Canadian market. Financial results were affected by both reduced activity in the oil and gas sector and overall fee reductions. In response to some of these challenges, the business unit continued to diversify beyond the oil and gas sector and with its various cost cutting initiatives. \nIn the second quarter, on a consolidated basis, favourable exchange rates against the Canadian Dollar benefitted revenues by 3.1% and Adjusted EBITDA by 6.4%. Acquisitions contributed 10.9% to gross revenues and 4.6% to Adjusted EBITDA. \nThe Company made approximately $3.0 million in growth investments in the second quarter. These investments are aimed at growing future revenues, including a significant portion of high-margin, recurring revenue streams from Data Solutions and software offerings. \nIn the second quarter, corporate costs were $7.1 million, compared to $7.4 million in the same period in 2014. The decrease in corporate costs was due to lower consulting and professional fees. For the six month period, corporate costs were $12.3 million, compared to $13.2 million for the same period in 2014. \nUnder IFRS accounting, profit (loss) for the second quarter was $2.7 million or $0.08 per share basic and diluted, compared to $(0.7) million or $(0.02) per share basic and diluted in the same period in 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, profit (loss) was $3.4 million and $0.11 per share basic and $0.10 per share diluted, as compared to $4.2 million and $0.15 per share basic and $0.14 per share diluted in the same period in 2014. \nDuring the quarter, the Company amended its bank credit facility, further strengthening its financial flexibility. The amendments include a five year extension, an increased maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio from 2.75:1 to 3.00:1, lower bank margins and additional borrowing flexibility. At the end of the second quarter, Altus Group's balance sheet remained strong, giving the Company the financial flexibility to pursue its growth strategy. The Company's bank debt was $134.5 million, representing a funded debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.98 times. \nIn recent months, the Company completed four tuck-in acquisitions that strengthened its service offerings. The acquisition of Maxwell Brown Group Surveyors Limited (\"Maxwell Brown\") strengthened the Property Tax business unit's market share and regional scale in the UK market and enhanced its UK tax offering with complementary service lines in support of current growth initiatives. Further, the acquisitions of Hoffer Wilkinson & Associates Ltd. (\"HWA\"), MPC Intelligence Inc. (\"MPC\") and Integris Real Estate Counsellors (\"Integris\"), all strengthened RVA's Canadian offerings and enhanced expertise with specialized professionals.
