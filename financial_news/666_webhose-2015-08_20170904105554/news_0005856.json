Standing in the kitchen, looking embarrassed, he asked if I minded not standing directly beneath the light. I soon saw why: whenever anyone used the bathroom directly above, a stream of water came pouring from the light fitting, onto the floor. He’d complained to his landlord repeatedly, with no luck, and the council had such a backlog, they weren’t able to help.\nMost people would accept that his appalling living situation was due to a lack of regulation of the housing market, combined with a housing crisis that severely limits his housing options due to uncontrolled rents and competition for any house going. Environmental health offices in councils are desperately struggling to sort out problems, while at the same time working with a smaller budget after government cuts. At the same time, many people in poor housing are justifiably afraid of reporting unscrupulous landlords for fear of revenge evictions .\nBut there remains a school of thought that believes the opposite is true, that what renters desperately need is less regulation, and – in one case – that actually what Britain needs is more slums. “Britain has a sore lack of proper slums. Government regulations designed to clamp down on cowboy landlords restrict people’s ability to choose the kind of accommodation in which they want to live,” wrote Theo Clifford for the Adam Smith Institute’s blog . Aside from the confusion between what people want, and what people are forced to accept as accommodation due to poverty, it’s a reminder of the lack of empathy some people still feel for those in housing need.\nCouncil housing was hailed as a success for the most part, for freeing people from appalling living situations that had become commonplace for the very poorest. The political will came from a social acceptance that slums were a stain on a modern society, and all adults and children deserved shelter that was able to let them flourish and thrive, rather than grow up with rickets and whooping cough.\nIf you ask most people where they’d like to live, almost nobody is going to prefer to share a bathroom with neighbours, or to live in a bedroom far smaller than legal planning regulations stipulate. The reason people live in “beds in sheds”, dangerous housing or shabbily converted rooms that masquerade as a studio flat, is because of desperation and the dire state of the rental market – not because it suits their lifestyle.\nDeregulation benefits no one but those looking to make a profit from housing, and certainly not tenants. No one would choose a flat with dangerous wiring and no room for their children to play if there were another option. But this call for a lower standard of housing for the poorest reminds us that arguments about rights to shelter are not won yet. There will always remain people who have no sympathy for the homeless, the single mother with a threat of eviction, or no heating or running water.\nArguments about benefits rumble on as austerity continues: people on the right often argue that the social safety net is either much abused or a relic that encourages dependency, despite evidence to the contrary. People still have to fight to convince people that shelter is a human right, and that housing of a good standard should be within the reach of everyone, whether they’re poor, disabled or destitute.\nArguing that landlords should be able to abdicate responsibility when providing homes, renting out sheds, electrical firetraps and damp, mouldy wrecks with impunity shows a wilfully naive understanding of the economics and mechanisms of the housing crisis. But it also shows that the argument for social housing and everyone’s right to a good home is far from won, and still in jeopardy.\nSign up for your free Guardian Housing network newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Friday.
