At the same time, rivals that allow their currencies to float more freely, like Russia, have seen their currencies depreciate, making their goods more competitive on the global market.\nExports of goods and services make up 40% of Kazakhstan’s gross domestic product, and its economy has already suffered from falling commodity prices. It’s particularly reliant on the export of crude oil, iron ore and industrial metals.\nRussia and China are the two largest buyers of the countries imports. Kazakh companies have been struggling to compete against Russian firms that have a clear currency advantage. Now, they also will find it harder to compete against Chinese firms.\nGulf states like Saudi Arabia are also vulnerable because of the drop in oil prices, but they typically have much larger foreign-exchange reserves that can allow them to hold out for much longer, Shearing said.\nOf course, the future path of commodity prices is a big unknown. For example, crude-oil futures for September delivery trading on the Nymex US:CLU5 hit a fresh six-and-half year low Wednesday.\nA recovery in commodities could alleviate some — but not all — of the pressure on these economies.\nBut as long as crude-oil prices remain under siege, more countries may decide that the cost of managing their currency rates now outweighs the benefits.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:36:21.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
