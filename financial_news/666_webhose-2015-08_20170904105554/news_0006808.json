That's an average of $630 per family for school-age kids and $899 for families with college-bound students. \nWhile the back-to-school drill can be stressful for parents, including some money lessons is worthwhile, experts said. \n\"You don't want to overwhelm your kid, so you have to be sensitive to who your kid is and what they're going to be taking on,\" said Annette Economides. \"But if they can handle learning a new system, and you can handle implementing it, it's a great time.\" \nPart of the reason it works is because kids care about school shopping, said Patricia A. Seaman, a spokeswoman for the National Endowment for Financial Education.

Despite a high-profile focus on financial literacy in the U.S., teens generally are not excelling when it comes to money knowledge. \nHere are some ideas for schooling your kids about money through shopping. Budgeting. A spending plan is fundamental for using money wisely, so the process doesn't start with a trip to the mall, but with a conversation. Take inventory of what they need, typically school supplies and clothing. \"Work with your child to make a list of everything he or she wants and needs for school and how much it costs,\" Seaman said. But mom and dad should have veto power over purchases. Needs vs. wants. The difference between needs and wants may be the most important lesson of all for kids. It's time to talk about how wanting things is natural, but that some people define themselves by what they buy -- and how keeping up with the Joneses is a race they cannot win. \nFor upgrades beyond the functional choices and their budgeted amounts, require the child to contribute their own money. On average, teens this year will contribute $33.27, and preteens will spend $17.57, according to the retail federation. Comparison shopping. Looking up prices online before heading to the mall will give you and your child an idea of the price range for that item. Incorporating secondhand stores into the shopping process is a great lesson too -- especially for clothes or sporting equipment. It makes you think about the extreme markup for new items. \nTrade-offs. Shopping on a budget allows older children to experience the concept of opportunity costs, or trade-offs -- how buying one item limits their ability to buy others. It's the \"money doesn't grow on trees\" lesson. Introduce scenarios in which children must choose between competing spending priorities. \"Do you want the $100 sneakers or a moderately priced pair and an extra pair of jeans?\" Seeking value. \"The cheapest isn't always the best buy, and price isn't always the best indicator of quality,\" Seaman said. Examine merchandise with your child and talk about how well it's made and how long it's likely to last. \nSingle-item lessons. With a younger child, you might teach a money lesson on a single back-to-school purchase, like shoes, instead of the whole shopping event, Steve Economides said. Set a budget and help them do the comparison shopping. \nOverspending. \"Don't bail out your kids if they overspend; instead, take them back to the store to return the items that blew the budget,\" Seaman said. You could even introduce the concept of credit, borrowing money from you but paying it back with interest: \"You can have this fancy binder, but it will cost you $7 instead of $5 when you pay me back,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T11:45:08.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
