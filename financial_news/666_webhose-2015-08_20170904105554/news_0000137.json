The Center for American Progress, the United States Student Organization, Veterans for Educational Success and five other groups protested the role of credit union service organizations (CUSO) in partnering with for-profit colleges, particularly ITT Tech, in a July 30 letter to the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the federal credit union regulator. \nThe letter noted that ITT Tech has spent more on marketing and executive compensation than on classroom instruction. Overall, 20% of students who left ITT Tech end up defaulting on their student loans . In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed fraud charges against ITT Educational Services, its CEO Kevin Modany and its CEO Daniel Fitzpatrick. \n\"We are deeply disturbed about the role of credit unions and credit union service organizations (CUSO) that partnered with for-profit colleges to offer predatory student loans,\" the letter stated. \"In particular, ITT Educational Services, the controversial for-profit college chain allegedly developed a scheme to issue high-cost private student loans to its students through a CUSO.\" CUSOs are corporate entities in which federally chartered credit unions own a minority stake.
