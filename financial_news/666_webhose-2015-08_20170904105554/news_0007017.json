Near-term support is at 1.1064, the 23.6% Fibonacci expansion, with a break below that on a daily closing basis exposing the 38.2% level at 1.0972. Alternatively, a turn above the 14.6% expansion at 1.1121 clears the way for a challenge of the 61.8% Fib retracement at 1. 1195. Prices are wedged too closely between near-term support and resistance levels to justify taking a trade in line with our long-term outlook from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will continue to stand aside until a more attractive opportunity presents itself.
