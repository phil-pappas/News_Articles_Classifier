In the preceding 20 years, the average growth rate of this measure of earnings was 4.4 per cent, a pace the economy could sustain while the RBA hit the middle of its two to three per cent target for consumer price inflation and profits increased their share of national income. Wages grew in real terms - that is, over and above consumer price rises - by an average of 1.7 per cent a year over the two decades from 1993 to 2013. But slower wages growth trimmed real wage growth to just 0.2 per cent in the past year, following a fall of 0.8 per cent the year before - a fall of 0.6 per cent over the two years combined. Real wages have fallen over a two-year period before, but not for a while, and it's certainly not normal. The most recent time was when the GST was introduced in 2000, pushing prices up faster than wages. Before that, you have to go back to the recession of the early 1990s, when rising unemployment slowed wages growth and price inflation still had a good head of steam. So it's no wonder that consumer confidence is struggling. The latest monthly reading from the Westpac Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment, published on Tuesday, showed confidence had picked up strongly in the August survey. But, ever after the surprisingly big rise, confidence was still well below the average for the past 40 years, a period that includes two severe recessions, several slowdowns that might best be called near-recessions, and various share market crashes and financial crises. So a confidence reading below the average for that stretch means consumers are really not feeling good about things. And when the real purchasing power of the wage earned by the average worker is not even keeping up with prices, you can't really blame them.
