It’s an ‘inspired-by’ album, it’s inspired by ‘Straight Outta Compton’.”\nHe also revealed why he never released his long-awaited album Detox.\n“It just wasn’t good,” he said, adding, “I don’t think I did a good enough job, and I couldn’t do that to my fans, and I couldn’t do that to myself, to be perfectly honest with you. I just wasn’t feeling it.”\nDre’s last solo effort was “2001”.\n 04, 2015 8:17 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:33:38.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
