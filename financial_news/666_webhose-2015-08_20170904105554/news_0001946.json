You must demonstrate innovation, leadership and be a good initiator at making a difference,' she said. \nThe Managing Director of Access Bank, Mr Dolapo Ogundimu, speaking on the bank's objective for the forum said: 'This forum is one of the many benefits we are giving women and their families under our 'W' initiative. \n'Since we also believe in the ideals of excellence, we are facilitating opportunities for young ones to apply to American Ivy League schools, where they can nurture their talents and match others anywhere in the world. \n'The impact on the family, the economy and industry is enormous and that is why we want to encourage these discussions.' \nEncouraging the participants to take advantage of the various flexible current and saving options of the Bank, the Group Head for Personal Banking, Mr Stephen Abban, reiterated the Bank's commitment to support financial empowerment of customers. \nAccess Bank's Women Banking initiative is part of the Bank's overall strategy to promote gender equality, ensure social and economic welfare and play a catalyst role in helping women with families meet their aspirations. \nThe 'W' gives women an 'All-in-One lifestyle Banking Solutions' where multiple products and components are packaged together into one solution to deliver the most appealing bundle of banking solutions to women either as a young professional, a homebuilder or an entrepreneur. \nMany women across Ghana are currently benefiting from the unique initiative, which seeks to inspire, connect and empower women through the various stages of their lives. \nLast month, more than 30 Women in SME's received financial empowerment training during a two-day workshop facilitated by the IFC. \nOther women are also receiving various forms of support including mentoring, financial planning and opportunities to participate in specialised networking events and programmes. \nAdjudged winner of the 'Bank of the Year' award at the 13th Ghana Banking Awards, Access Bank Ghana has demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainable business practices driving profitable, sustainable growth that is also environmentally responsible and socially relevant. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T00:11:35.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
