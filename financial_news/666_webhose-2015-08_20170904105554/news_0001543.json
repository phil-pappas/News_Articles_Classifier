Consequently, the hybrids have lost value. Elders' wholly-owned subsidiary, Elders Finance, will buy back around $30 million of hybrids at up to $80 each - a premium to the closing price of $74.30 on August 13. The purchase of the hybrids will be funded from current year earnings. \"This offer provides additional liquidity in what is a relatively illiquid security and provides an opportunity for holders who wish to sell to do so on a first-come, first-served basis,\" Elders chief executive Mark Allison said. Mr Allison said Elders would have preferred to acquire the hybrids through an off-market offer but was prohibited from doing so under the Corporations Act. Shares in Elders were 25 cents, or 6.63 per cent, higher at $4.02 at 1110 AEST.
