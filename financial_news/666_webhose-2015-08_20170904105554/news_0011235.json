Photo: Brock Perks\nListed vet and pet group Greencross has appointed its finance chief, Martin Nicholas, as its new chief executive after the resignation of boss Jeffrey David.\nMr Nicholas, who is stepping up from the chief financial officer role, will replace Mr David \"effectively immediately\" at the nation's biggest owner of veterinary clinics.\nGreencross's shares fell as the market open and were down more than 10 per cent at $6.30 about 10:20am AEDT.\nGreencross chairman Stuart James said that following the merger and integration of the Mammoth Pet and City Farmers businesses into Greencross, Mr David decided to step down.\nAdvertisement \"In these circumstances, and with our succession plan in place, the board considers this an appropriate time to make such a change as the company embarks on its next phase of growth,\" Mr James said.\nMr Nicholas, a former executive with Unilever and education business Study Group International, will be paid total fixed remuneration of $780,000 a year.\n\"I am delighted to be accepting this role at such an exciting time for our company,\" Mr Nicholas said.\n\"Jeff David has established a strong platform for Greencross to execute its strategy of consolidating the fragmented veterinary services and expanding the reach of our pet goods stores and services.\"\nMr David came into the Greencross group when Greencross acquired Mammoth, the owner of Petbarn and Animates, in a push into the pet care retail sector.\nHe said he had achieved his goals since becoming chief executive following the Mammoth deal in January 2014.\nEarlier this month Greencross, which owns more than 115 vet clinics and 175 retail stores, reported a return to profit of $19.1 million on revenue of $644 million.\nThe change in leadership comes as rival National Veterinary Care has emerged as the second-biggest player in Australian vet services after its $30 million listing two weeks ago.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/retail/national-vet-care-no-dog-in-first-day-of-trading-20150814-gizc7t"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T04:57:12.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
