Berg 08/04/15 - 9:18 AM EDT NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Angela Nuttle, a corporate talent expert at Corporate Talent Institute, attributes much of her success to her husband's personality mix. \"My personality is extroverted, big picture creative, with one speed-go fast,\" she says, but her husband is more one for analysis paralysis -- overthinking things. \"My husband is an introverted, analytical in the weeds kind of guy who is ultra conservative,\" Nuttle says. \"I consult with him before I put any type of program or workshop out, because he catches the nuances that I might not even think about. He looks over my contracts for details I might have missed, and he has even reviewed my first book since I am a first-time published author.\" When highly successful professionals attribute their success to their spouses, or when celebrities thank their spouses at awards ceremonies, it may not be as gratuitous as it sometimes sounds. According to new research out of Washington University in St. Louis, conscientiousness in one spouse will boost the career of the other spouse. “For both male and female participants, partner conscientiousness predicted future job satisfaction, income and likelihood of promotion, even after accounting for participants’ conscientiousness,\" the authors wrote . \"These associations occurred, because more conscientious partners perform more household tasks, exhibit more pragmatic behaviors that their spouses are likely to emulate and promote a more satisfying home life, enabling their spouses to focus more on work.”According to this research, marrying a conscientious spouse may be a good investment in your career. Furthermore, being a conscientious spouse may further boost your household income. \n“People with spouses higher in conscientiousness earn at least $4,000 more, and that number increases the more conscientious their spouse is,” Brittany C. Solomon, a graduate student and lead investigator of the study told TheStreet .
