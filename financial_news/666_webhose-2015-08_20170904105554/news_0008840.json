The true rate of expansion \"is probably something closer to 4.5 per cent, or less,\" Buiter said.\nLi has repeatedly pledged to avoid stimulus similar to the one following the global financial crisis in 2008 that led to a surge in debt for local governments and corporations.\nData accuracy\n Some economists and investors have long questioned the accuracy of China's official growth data. When Li was party secretary of Liaoning province in 2007, he said that figures for gross domestic product were \"man-made\" and therefore unreliable, according to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010. The median estimate of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month put China's first-half GDP growth rate at 6.3 per cent, compared with the official figure of 7 per cent.\n\"They will respond, but they will respond too late to avoid a recession, which is likely to drag the global economy with it down to a global growth rate below 2 per cent -- which is in my definition a global recession,\" said Buiter, a former external member of the Bank of England.\nThe global economy will expand by 3 per cent this year, while China's is forecast to grow 6.9 per cent, the slowest pace in a quarter century, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe boom and bust in the Shanghai Composite Index, which more than doubled in about a year before a selloff erased $7 trillion in market value in two months, is raising questions about \"the competence of the Chinese authorities as managers of the macro economy,\" Buiter said.\nThe authorities first cheered the stock market rally \"because quite a few of the local pundits believed that this was a great [way of deleveraging, or reducing debt] without paying for the corporate sector to have a stock market bubble,\" he said. That was followed by \"panic and incompetent reaction\" to the sharemarket turmoil, Buiter added in reference to China's unprecedented government intervention to support share prices.\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8217620/Citigroups-Willem-Buiter-an-economist-worth-listening-to.html", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-28/economist-who-coined-grexit-now-says-greece-will-stay-in-euro"], "published": "2015-08-28T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:41:29.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
