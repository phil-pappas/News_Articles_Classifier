It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also posted its worst weekly decline since August 2011. \nThe euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index fell 3.2 percent. Germany's DAX dropped 3 percent, with the DAX nearly 20 percent below record highs reached in April. \nInvestors across the world were alarmed at the latest Chinese data. The Caixin/Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) manufacturing index showed activity in China's factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in almost 6-1/2 years in August, heightening fears of a slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy. \nVopak was one of the worst-performing stocks in Europe, slumping 15 percent after the Dutch oil and chemicals storage company forecast lower earnings in the second half of the year and warned of tough conditions in Asia. \nThe Athens stock market also fell 2.5 percent after Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras resigned before a likely new election in September. \n\"A lot of the good news in Europe had been priced in already, so it doesn't take too much of a global growth scare, along with renewed questions about Greece, to create difficult headwinds for European equities,\" said Chris Faulkner-MacDonagh, multi-asset strategist at Standard Life Investments. \nTsipras, leader of the leftist Syriza party, is hoping to strengthen his hold on power in the election, after seven months in office in which he fought Greece's creditors for a better bailout deal but had to cave in. \n\"Regarding Greece, we are not that concerned at the moment, as Syriza is still by far the most popular party. It indicates that Syriza could get enough votes to get an absolute majority,\" said Antoine Deix, European equity and derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) . \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Kit Rees and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Clelia Oziel)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T10:03:31.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
