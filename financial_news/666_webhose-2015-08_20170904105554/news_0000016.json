Monday's hearing came as the major stakeholders in a tunnel project — the governors of New Jersey and New York, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the federal Department of Transportation — grapple with how to pay for it. \nIt is a steep challenge. Gardner told lawmakers that it would cost Amtrak $1 billion per year just to keep its Northeast corridor infrastructure in a state of good repair, and would cost another $4 billion per year to complete its backlog of projects on the 457-mile corridor, a span that includes numerous century-old bridges and a 142-year-old tunnel. \nAmtrak gets about $1.4 billion annually in federal funding, he said, of which about $300 million is used for Northeast corridor needs. \nIn the wake of the delays in July, federal Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx sent a letter to Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and Andrew Cuomo of New York urging them to meet with him within two weeks to put together a strategy for building new crossings under the river. \nChristie and Cuomo then separately sent letters urging the government to come up with more money for the current project, called Gateway. Cuomo's letter made reference to the government's alleged offer to provide funding in the form of a loan that the states would have to pay back. The Port Authority also sent a letter to Foxx urging a bigger financial commitment. \n\"It's a little like a poker game. Who's going to show their cards first, who's going to put their money on the table?\" Port Authority chairman John Degnan said last week. \"I think clearly that has to be the federal government, and that will serve as an inducement for the states.\" \nSeveral years ago, the government pledged $3 billion for a tunnel project initially estimated to cost about $9 billion, with the rest of the cost borne by New Jersey and the Port Authority. Christie pulled the plug on that project in 2010, citing concerns that his state would be forced to pay for billions in cost overruns. \nThink your friends should see this?
