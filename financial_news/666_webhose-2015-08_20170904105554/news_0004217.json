Accreditation of the company's field operation and station in Junin, Argentina, means customers can now apply for field trial permits at CONABIA (National Commission of Biotechnology). \n\"SGS is pleased to build on its GM trials capabilities in the region, and provide this new field site in Junin, to operate concurrently with our many sites in Brazil,\" said Renan Gravena, Regional Business Development Manager. \"We look forward to further supporting the development of new traits and events in GM-crops in South America.\" \nSGS operates all field trials according to Argentina's national requirements, as set down by CONABIA, and the industry's Excellence Through Stewardship initiative. SGS GM Crop Field Trial Services \nSGS provides services related to GM-crop field trials in many countries in North and South America, as well as Asia. The company's extensive experience in bio-safety and agronomics, as well as the nutritional equivalence studies required for GM crops in their development phase, have been replicated internally in order to establish a robust quality operation in Argentina. \nGM field trial permits must be applied for in good time, as the approval process can take up to four months. Trial permits for the main cropping period at SGS's site in Junin should be placed with CONABIA between January and May. Once CONABIA has approved a trial permit (including details of the selected farm land and GM material) SGS is ready to start the trial.
