Karl Hilzinger by Richard Wakelin There have been plenty of squeals over the past fortnight as the major banks, at the behest of Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, raised interest rates for property investors by around 25 basis points. Some parties complained that investors had been targeted. Other groups moaned about how unfair it was that the increases were being applied to current investors, not just new ones. And with the rage needing an outlet, there was a collective rounding on the banks who were predicted to make bigger profits.\nIt was all rather self-serving and unedifying. Property investors have enjoyed a remarkable period of generational lows for interest rates. One that will not remain indefinitely. The move to raise rates was delivered with plenty of guidance from regulators that investor growth must slow to avoid trouble later on. Yet some participants' sense of entitlement is so ingrained that even a small and well-explained tweak up in rates causes apoplexy.\nI'm bemused that some commentators feel rates should only be raised for new investors. First off, if you don't want the bank to change your interest rate, get a fixed mortgage. Otherwise, accept that your rate can rise as well as fall.\nSecond, the attitude reveals a complacency about where the risks lie in our property sector. It is not just about discouraging new marginal borrowers and second-rate investments. It also has to be about drawing capital away from second-rate investments and marginal borrowers, regardless of when they transacted. That's the only sustainable policy.\nThirdly, it's downright regressive to make new borrowers pay more than existing ones.\nBad judgment One of the biggest risks in a property market sitting atop strong sustained capital growth is a loss of discernment. Good judgment is put to one side and every property looks like a winner. A rising tide lifts all boats, and all that. It is a time when we see the brazen spruikers and con artists emerge, pushing up prices for junk assets. It only takes a mild softening in the wider market for the value of these peripheral properties to collapse, causing financial havoc for many families.\nI'm not uncomfortable that rates are now higher for investors than for home buyers. Traditionally, it was always the case that investors paid more than home owners because, all things being equal, an investor is the higher risk. If you're in financial trouble you'll make more of an effort to hang on to the family home than your investment property. The banks know this and price the risk accordingly.\n My one beef with the recent debate is the over-simplification of the likely outcomes from APRA's policy directions. The result will be more nuanced – and welcome – than the suggestion that all investors will be hit equally and all home owners are untouched. On the ground, it won't be a one-size-fits-all application of policy. Banks still need to lend but scarcer capital means they'll want to lend it on the best assets.\nFurthermore, by making the big banks hold more capital, APRA has improved the competitive position of non-bank lenders. These dynamics will allow those with high-quality assets to resist much of the rate rises – if they're willing to push back on their bank or switch lenders.\nSimilarly, the banks will be watching and possibly anticipating the flow through effects of APRA's policy on other elements of the broader property market. For instance, if values for units in an investor-marketed apartment block fall because potential investors can't borrow cheaply, the banks are also going to be wary about lending to anyone – even a prospective home-buyer – in that block. Being a home-buyer won't be enough to nullify the risk that prices will continue to fall.\nSo congratulations to the regulators. What on the surface looks like a blunt instrument is an overdue reminder to property participants that investment is not riskless and to focus on high-quality assets only.\nRichard Wakelin is a director of Wakelin Property Advisory, wakelin.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:27:38.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
