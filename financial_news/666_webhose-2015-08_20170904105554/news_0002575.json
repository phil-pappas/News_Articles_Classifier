Intraday momentum has broken to its highest levels since early June with an ascending median-line formation off last week’s lows keeping long-scalps in focus while above the ML / last week’s highs at 7366. A breach above highlighted resistance would suggest a larger-scale reversal may be underway with such a scenario targeting subsequent objectives at 7468/74 & 7532/40. Bottom line: we’ll be looking to buy pullbacks / resistance triggers while above the ML with a break below the weekly opening range low needed to shift the focus back to the short-side targeting key support at 7177 & 7130/35. A quarter of the daily Average True Range yields profit targets of 22-25pips per scalp. Caution is warranted heading into Key Australian & U.S. event risk this week with employment data likely to fuel added volatility in Aussie & Dollar crosses.
