The Redmond, Washington-based company has captured just 3 percent of the smartphone market in the United States and globally, according to recent estimates. \nMicrosoft last month posted a record quarterly loss as it took a $7.5 billion charge on its handset business, which it bought from Nokia last year. \nInterDigital's Chief Executive Officer William Merritt said in a statement that the decision was disappointing but would have limited impact \"given the decline of the Nokia mobile device business under Microsoft’s control and its limited market position.\" \nA Microsoft spokesperson said the company was \"grateful the Commission stopped InterDigital from trying to block our products.\" \nInterDigital stock was down 3 percent after hours on Friday. \nThe two companies are at odds over how much InterDigital should be able to charge to license its patents, which are considered essential to cellphone technology. \nWilmington, Delaware-based InterDigital first accused Nokia in 2007 of infringing its technology for optimising a cellphone's power to connect to a network. \nIn April, the U.S. trade judge ruled that Microsoft used InterDigital's patents, considered standard in the industry, but refused to pay for a license to them. An import ban would have affected any Microsoft phone using 3G cellular technology, including its Lumia smartphones. \nAfter reviewing that ruling, the commission said on Friday that Microsoft did not violate the patents, but it did not address the issue of fair licensing for essential patents. \nEarlier this month, Microsoft sued InterDigital in Delaware federal court, claiming InterDigital violated U.S. antitrust law by breaking promises to offer licenses on reasonable terms. \nCompanies frequently sue both at the ITC, which has the authority to block the import of products that infringe a U.S. patent, and in district court to win monetary damages. \nThe case at the ITC is No. 337-613. \n(Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T03:30:30.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
