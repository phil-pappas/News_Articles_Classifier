In 2013, just 2pc of rebar was imported from China, while today 39pc of 308,000 tonnes required by UK construction comes from the country. \nNow UK Steel, industry trade body the British Association of Reinforcement and steel unions have warned of the dangers that imported steel could pose. \nRoy Rickhuss, general secretary of steelworkers’ union Community, said: “I am very concerned that UK construction workers’ safety is being put at risk by imports. There needs to be clarity throughout the supply chain about the levels of added alloys. \n“Given that there are tens of thousands of tonnes of Chinese imports at UK ports or in the supply chain, clarity is desperately needed to avoid unnecessary risks.” \nGareth Stace, director of UK Steel , said: “The danger is from the regulations because people may not know what the steel they are using contains. If they do they can use different types of welding to compensate. \n“We are currently asking the British Standards Institute (BSI (BSE: BSILTD.BO - news ) ) to make a simple amendment to regulations, which would ensure that consumers of rebar know what they are buying.” \nConstruction companies are now being urged to only use steel whose provenance can be traced, under the Charter for Sustainable British Steel campaign. \nAccording to UK Steel, Britain produces about 12m tonnes of steel a year, but Chinese mills have an annual overcapacity of 250m tonnes and dumping the surplus abroad. \nThe news comes just weeks after Tata said it would cut up to 720 jobs at its steel works in Rotherham, South Yorkshire , because it could not compete with cheap imports from China. \nKarl Koehler, chief executive of the company’s European operations, said “cripplingly” high energy costs in Britain and the strong pound meant Tata could not compete on price in the face of cheap imports from China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:27:32.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
