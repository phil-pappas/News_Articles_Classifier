We are excited to join forces with VATBox ' s excellent team in building the category leader in the VAT recovery market . \" \nIsaac Saft , CEO of VATBox, added: \" Indirect tax is a massive and significant expense for every global company. For decades, the VAT recovery market was controlled by manual service providers that offered inefficient, risky, non-visible and limited services, thereby forcing companies to leave billions of euros of VAT on the table , and leaving themselves open to significant risk. In today ' s complex indirect tax environment, executives expect to control, forecast and optimize financial processes with technology , which s urprisingly, ha s not evolved since incept , and governance was unheard of . As the first and only tech player in this market, we provide fully secure and easy-to-use solutions that maximize VAT recovery, while adding an essential compliance and governance layer that had not been available before. We are very excited to partner with Viola Private Equity as we continue to disrupt this accelerating market. \" \nVisit VATBox at http://www.vatbox.com or follow us on twitter @VATBox . \nViola Private Equity is a member of the Viola Group, Israel's premier technology-focused Private Equity group with over $2B under management.
