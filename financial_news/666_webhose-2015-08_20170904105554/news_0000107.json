Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Smith AMP Capital has engaged investment bank Goldman Sachs to advise the company on options relating to its underperforming listed China A-shares fund as the deadline for further activist pressure on AMP loomed.\nGoldman Sachs has begun to review the AMP Capital fund, which has been targeted by LIM Advisors, the $2.7 billion Hong Kong hedge fund founded by well-known deep-value investor, George Long.\nLIM, a 13 per cent share holder in the AMP Capital Growth fund, put the investment firm on notice in July when it threatened to force a meeting of unit holders if AMP Capital failed to come up with a reasonable plan to address its underperforming share price by August 31.\nShares in the AMP Capital China Growth fund have been trading at or around a 20 per cent discount to the value of its net tangible assets (NTA) since the fund listed late in 2006.\nIn recent weeks, as volatility within the Chinese sharemarket has increased, the discount gap between the AMP Capital fund's share price and its NTA has continued to widen.\nAt the end of July, AMP Capital China Fund was trading at a 30.6 per cent discount to NTA, according to the ASX's most recent listed funds report.\nClose or restructure options for fund During a visit to Australia on Wednesday Mr Long said closing the fund or restructuring the fund to make it more share-holder friendly could be among the options AMP and its advisers are likely to consider.\n \"Either they can wrap it up or they can make it open-ended. We've seen cases when a closed-end fund opened and they found a lot more demand,\" Mr Long said.\nOther ways to improve the fund could include \"modernising\" the fund by broadening its investing mandate and shrinking its size through share buybacks, LIM's portfolio manager and director, Nick Paris, said.\nMr Paris outlined the demands to AMP Capital's former chief executive Stephen Dunne during a face-to-face meeting in July.\nLIM has said it would propose a \"discount target\" and allow the fund to come up with its own method to reduce the trading discount.\nThe discount target scenario could hold AMP Capital to a reduction of the share price to NAV discount by 10 per cent within six months.\nThe last time LIM was involved in a shareholder activist situation was at the end of 2012 when LIM put pressure on the board of the Singapore exchange-listed Macquarie International Infrastructure Fund, which ultimately led to that fund being wound up.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Matt_JS"], "published": "2015-08-12T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:05:02.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
