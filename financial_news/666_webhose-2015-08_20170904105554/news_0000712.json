The NFU said farmers in the livestock and dairy sectors were \"facing financial devastation\".\nBritain's supermarkets have been engaged in a vicious price war in recent years, as the success of discount chains Aldi and Lidl has prompted the more established names in the sector to slash prices for certain basic produce.\nThe NFU said retailers Tesco, M&S, Waitrose, Sainsbury's and Co-op paid farmers a price based on the cost of production, but others -- including Morrisons, Asda, Aldi and Lidl -- did not.\nThe fall in milk prices has had global ramifications, with producers from New Zealand to Ireland struggling in the new economic environment. Agriculture, fishing and forestry together account for 0.6 percent of UK GDP.
