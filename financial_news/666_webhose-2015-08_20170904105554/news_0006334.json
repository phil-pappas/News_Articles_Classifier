Among the big decliners in the group, pipeline company TransCanada Corp lost 1.5 percent to C$50.09 and major producer Suncor Energy Inc fell 1 percent to C$36.48.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 6.68 points, or 0.05 percent, at 14,461.76 by 11:00 a.m (1500 GMT).\nThe index has bounced back up since breaking below 14,000 in late July, but remains one of the worst performing global indexes so far this year, hurt by slumping oil prices and worries about slowing economic growth and stock market turmoil in China.\n\"China's hurting all these commodities and if there's more of a flare up there it will be reflected in our market because it's so heavily commodity-weighted,\" said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities.\nHalf of the index's 10 main groups were in negative territory, although both the consumer discretionary and consumer staples groups gained more than 1 percent.\nAuto parts maker Magna International Inc rose 2.5 percent to C$72.83 and convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard gained 2 percent to C$59.51.\nDecliners outnumbered advancing stocks by 140 to 101, for a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the downside.\nKinsey said he is focused on upcoming quarterly results from a range of companies including Magna, telecom companies BCE Inc and Telus Corp, insurer Sun Life Financial Inc , energy company Canadian Natural Resources and retailer Canadian Tire Corp.\n\"What we look for is forward guidance toward the next quarter and the balance of the year,\" he said. \"A lot of the companies are a little reluctant now to give that now because everything is so volatile.\"\n($1=$1.31 Canadian) (Editing by Peter Galloway)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:51:19.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
