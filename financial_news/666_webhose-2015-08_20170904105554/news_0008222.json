The format of the call will be opening remarks and analysis by Jose followed by a financial review from George. These discussions will be followed by a Q&A period and we expect the call to last for about 60 minutes. We have a lot of important things to talk about today, so let's go ahead. Jose? \n\nJose Mas, MasTec Inc - CEO [3] \n\nThank you, Marc. Good morning and welcome to MasTec's 2015 second-quarter call. Today I will be reviewing our second-quarter results, as well as providing my outlook for the markets we serve. Before getting started, I'd like to make some general comments around where the Company stands today. There is no question that we have had our challenges since early in 2014. As a reminder, in 2014 our business was dramatically impacted by two major factors: a slowdown in our wireless business; and decreasing oil prices, which have had a negative impact on our oil and gas segment. \nIn 2015, these issues, coupled with the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar, extraordinary weather with rain and flooding impacting us across multiple geographies, and the audit committee investigation which required an enormous amount of time and effort from Senior Management as well as segment management, have resulted in performance that was well below our expectations. We are disappointed with our results and, quite frankly, I expect more from myself and I expect more from our team. We recognize we have had multiple issues over the last few quarters. However, I am very confident that over the coming quarters you will begin to see the opportunities we have in front of us develop, and we are confident in our ability to execute at a high level as we have demonstrated over a long period of time. \nNow some second-quarter highlights. Revenue for the quarter was $1.067 billion. EBITDA was $71 million. Earnings per share were $0.10. And cash flow from operations was $48 million. Our results for the quarter were negatively impacted predominantly by our electrical transmission business. Revenues in this segment were down $39 million year over year and EBITDA was a negative $21 million, or a $41 million swing from last year's second quarter. While our oil and gas business was also impacted by adverse weather, revenue was up 13%, EBITDA was up 14%, and margins were up slightly. As we look beyond 2015, we believe the outlook is very strong. We expect considerable revenue growth and associated margins, primarily driven by a very active oil and gas market where we expect record revenues, a growing and robust fiber-to-the-home market driven by gigabit deployment and an improving wireless market with multiple carriers spending increasing levels of CapEx. \nNow I'd like to cover some industry specifics. Our communication revenue for the quarter was $469 million versus $528 million last year. The drop in revenues, as expected, came from our wireless business. Margins in this segment were also impacted by weather, and we expect margins to improve for the back half of 2015 versus the second quarter and approximate first-half levels. Our current expectations are that communication margins will be a little lower for the year than we expected, due to lower revenue levels in our wireless business. We still, however, expect to see over 100 basis point improvement in margins from last year's levels in communication. This, despite an almost 35% expected organic decline in our wireless business. As volume returns in wireless, we are in a good position to leverage our resources and geographic presence, which we think will have a very positive effect on overall communication margins in 2016. \nIn our install-to-the-home market, as has been expected, AT&T recently closed on the acquisition of DIRECTV. We look forward to working with our customer to maximize the value of the acquisition and we feel we have good opportunities to maintain or grow our business. We are beginning to see increased activity again relative to the AT&T Digital Life product. And as we announced last quarter, we are providing expert for Sprint's Direct to You initiative which continues to ramp to new cities across the country weekly. Wireline revenues for the quarter were up over 20% year over year and we continue to see strong demand in everything from electric distribution to fiber roll-out and expansion. We expect gigabit revenues will continue to ramp and expect considerable growth as we begin to ramp construction activity based on current backlog. \nOur wireless business, as expected, was down year over year. However, as we have previously said, we were in a very different position going into 2015 than what we faced in 2014. As you may recall, we entered 2014 expecting significant wireless growth with the award of a contract in late 2013. We aggressively ramped our resources and the revenues didn't materialize. We struggled from a margin perspective in this business in 2014 due to having to adjust resources during the year. We started 2015 right-sizing this business and margins are significantly better for the first half of 2015 compared to 2014. And we expect margins in the second half of 2015 to outpace last year's margins as well. \nMargins improved despite roughly a 40% negative organic growth in the quarter and revenue softness from our primary customers. For example, one customer where volume had been growing nicely, has slowed its roll-out while they determine their optimum architecture. As these decisions get finalized, the industry and MasTec should see an uptick in activity. We expect increased levels of wireless spend in 2016 and combined with our scale and geographic presence, we expect a return to solid revenue growth in 2016. Revenue in our electrical transmission business was $78 million versus $117 million in last year's second quarter. The transmission group's performance in the second quarter was negatively impacted due to extreme weather conditions, right of way access, material escalation and estimates of future cost. \nOne large transmission project required demobbing and remobbing after several weeks due to the right of way being completely flooded. Foundations and equipment were under water. This project substantially finishes in late September. Another large project had weather impacts causing revenue and margin fade due to the effect of increased material and labor to deal with construction weather-related challenges. Future project estimated costs were taken to account for these potential construction conditions. While neither of these projects will finish in a loss position, we significantly increased the cost to complete for both which caused a large loss for the quarter. \nThis segment was also greatly impacted by the audit committee investigation, requiring an enormous time of energy throughout the entire organization from Senior Management to project staff. While we expect their performance to improve, our guidance assumes a roughly breakeven EBITDA performance for the balance of the year. We are seeing a very competitive environment with a number of jobs being pushed out into 2016. Despite this, bidding activity is robust and we believe the business will get back to a normalized state. \nMoving to our power generation industrial segment revenue was $103 million for the second quarter versus $95 million in the prior year. EBITDA margins improved to nearly 8%, almost doubling last year's performance. The bidding environment for 2016 is strong and we expect continued improved performance from this segment. Our oil and gas pipeline segment had revenues of $411 million for the second quarter compared to revenues of $365 million in last year's second quarter. EBITDA margin for this segment was 10.1%, up from 6.6% sequentially. For 2015, this segment is being negatively impacted by Canadian dollar decline, a challenged Canadian CapEx environment and depressed commodity prices. However, the outlook for 2016 and beyond continues to improve. \nDuring the second quarter, MasTec closed on its joint venture with Grupo Carso and Energy Transfer. Under these ventures our consortium will build, own and operate 337 miles of 42-inch pipelines in the US, providing transportation services for CFE, the Mexican electric company. Subsequent to quarter end, MasTec signed a construction agreement with the consortium to build the pipeline. That contract will be included in our backlog totals next quarter. In addition, MasTec has been awarded, and is in final stages of contract negotiations on, other US pipeline projects exceeding $1 billion in value which we expect to add to backlog over the balance of 2015, with the majority of that work to be completed in 2016. We also remain very active as it relates to opportunities in Mexico. We expect Mexico to offer us excellent opportunities related to pipeline construction in-country and expect to have active projects in 2016. \nTo recap, 2015 is a challenging year for us. We understand we've had significant issues over several quarters. However, I want to reiterate the confidence we have in our business. We believe our growth in 2016 will be driven primarily by our oil and gas, wireline and wireless markets. Again, with current negotiation and bidding, we expect our oil and gas business to have a record year in 2016. We expect continued growth of our gigabit business and the related opportunities, and we expect demand for our wireless business to grow in 2016 as carriers ramp CapEx levels. I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Pita, for our financial review. \n\nGeorge Pita, MasTec Inc - CFO [4] \n\nThank you, Jose, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I'd like to thank our MasTec staff members as well as our external auditors, BEO and various other advisors/observers that have been through a very difficult time in the last six months. \nAs previously disclosed in our recent SEC filings, the process established in reserve by audit committee included a detailed review of percentage of completion accounting at our electrical transmission segment, as well as a detailed review of selected accounting judgments, estimates and entries over a multi-year period across the balance of the Company's segments, in order to assess the reliability of our previously issued financial statements. This has been exhaustive, time-consuming and detailed process for our Company, as well as a huge distraction from the operations and management of our business, particularly in our electrical transmission segment. The integrity of our corporate governance and financial reporting continues to be of paramount importance to us and we are working to improve our control processes to correct the issues that gave rise to the previously reported interim 2014 adjustments. \nWhile we are disappointed the interim adjustments were necessary, we are pleased that as we initially indicated in February when our 2014 10-K filing was delayed, completion of the process and external audit did not negatively or materially impact our previously disclosed unaudited annual 2014 results. We are now current with all our reporting requirements. While we have indicated that the audit committee investigation is ongoing with respect to underlying causes of the identified interim adjustments, we expect this process will be much less disruptive to our operations. And we look forward to refocusing and re-energizing our efforts to position ourselves to take advantage of the various growth opportunities we believe our markets afford us and improve our operating results on a go forward basis. \nToday I'll cover second-quarter financial results and the headwinds experienced during the quarter, third-quarter and full-year guidance updates, along with our cash flow, liquidity and capital structure. As in our previous calls, when we discuss our financial results and guidance, we will be discussing non-GAAP continuing operations adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Full reconciliations from GAAP results to adjusted results are included in our Form 10-Q and press release tables. Consistent with prior quarters, continuing operations adjusted results exclude acquisition integration costs related to the WesTower acquisition. We incurred approximately $8 million of acquisition integration costs during the second quarter and the process is now substantially complete. \nJust as a reminder, these costs were primarily composed of lease and equipment exit costs, employee duplication and separation, and other one-time training efforts to implement our systems and processes. We are also excluding audit committee investigation-related costs which totaled approximately $7.5 million during the second quarter, for a cumulative total of $10.5 million on a year-to-date basis. We expect to incur an additional $5 million during the balance of 2015, with the great majority of this cost expected in the third quarter. \nLastly, in calculation of adjusted net income and fully diluted earnings per share, we are excluding approximately $2.8 million in one-time income tax expense recorded during the second quarter to reflect the cumulative revaluation of deferred tax liabilities due to a tax law change in the Alberta, Canada province that was enacted in June of 2015. The aggregate impact of these charges reduced our GAAP fully diluted earnings by approximately $0.14 per share. With the WesTower integration now substantially completed, the substantial progress made to date on the audit committee related matters and the one-time nature of the Alberta tax law impact, we expect a significant decrease in the amount of these charges in future quarters. \nBefore I get into detailed remarks, here are some headlines for the quarter. Second-quarter results were well below expectations. While adverse weather impacted multiple segments, the headline for the quarter was a significant shortfall in our electrical transmission segment. Total Company second-quarter 2015 EBITDA was $37 million below last year's levels. And in our electrical transmission segment, individually we had a $41 million decrease from last year. Despite the impact of adverse weather, we had sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin performance in our oil and gas segment and in our power generation segment, with power generation reporting its highest EBITDA margin in several years at 7.8% of revenue. \nWe continued strong cash flow from operations performance, generating $48 million in the second quarter cash flow, with year-to-date 2015 cash flow from operations of approximately $166 million, compared to $55 million during the first half of 2014. This represents a $111 million year-over-year improvement despite reduced first-half 2015 GAAP earnings. We also completed our previously announced $100 million share repurchase program during the second quarter, and during 2015 have repurchased 5.2 million shares. \nAnd as Jose previously indicated, during the quarter we finalized our agreements to invest in two joint ventures that will design, build, own and operate pipelines that will transport natural gas in Texas to the Mexican border. We expect construction to commence through a MasTec service line on these pipelines in either late 2015 or early 2016. It should be noted that while we finalized the investment agreements in the joint ventures, the construction contracts for our service line were not signed until the third quarter of 2015 and, thus, these projects are not in our second-quarter 2015 backlog reported in yesterday's filing. We invested approximately $6 million in the second quarter as initial equity contributions for these joint ventures and expect to invest approximately an additional $78 million in equity contributions for these joint ventures over the next 12 to 24 months. \nIn summary, it was obviously a difficult quarter with results well below our original expectations. As Jose mentioned, we had extraordinary rain and flooding in major work areas in the entire second half of the quarter. Remember, our large Texas operations and pipeline, as well as our install-to-home and fiber deployment operations, were all impacted. It is also important to note that while Texas flooding received most of the news coverage, we had flooding as far north as Wisconsin and Indiana, which impacted several of our electrical transmission projects as well. Lastly, the audit committee process caused significant disruption to our Management's focus on operations and marketing, with the electrical transmission group being the most affected. \nNow let me cover some details regarding second-quarter results. Second-quarter 2015 continuing operations adjusted diluted earnings were $0.10 per share compared to $0.42 per share for the same period last year. As I mentioned earlier, we had significant shortfall in earnings at our electrical transmission segment which impacted our year-over-year results by approximately $0.34 per share. Second quarter 2015 revenue was $1.067 billion, a 3.7% decrease compared to the same period last year. We had good top-line growth in our oil and gas and power generation segments despite the impact of adverse weather, with oil and gas increasing by 12.5% and power generation increasing by 9%. These top-line increases were offset by a 33% decrease in our electrical transmission segment and an 11% decrease in our communications segment. The decrease in second quarter 2015 communications segment revenue as previously indicated, is primarily driven by reduced levels of wireless project activity. While we expect demand for wireless services to markedly increase in 2016, we anticipate that second half 2015 wireless segment revenues will approximate or slightly decline compared to first-half 2015 levels. \nAs we indicated in our release a few weeks ago, we expect that electrical transmission segment results during the second half of 2015 will continue to show weakness when compared to the same period last year, as the segment works to replenish its backlog and normalize its operations. Our current guidance for 2015 anticipates that second-half 2015 electrical transmission segment revenues will approximate first-half 2015 levels, and that EBITDA levels will improve when compared to the first half of 2015 and approach a breakeven level. Our top 10 customers for the second quarter of 2015 as a percentage of revenue were AT&T with 17%, DIRECTV was 12%, Momentum Midstream was 9%, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Plains All-American Pipeline, Duke Energy and Wisconsin Energy were 3% each, and Energy Transfer, Sprint and CNRL were each at 2% of total revenue. Individual construction projects comprised 55% of our second-quarter revenue, with master service agreements comprising 45%. And this mix is generally in line with recent trends. \nAt quarter end our 18 month backlog from continuing operations was approximately $4.1 billion compared to $3.9 billion last year and $4.2 billion at the end of last quarter. As mentioned earlier, we have several large awards not in backlog yet, and we expect significant growth in our oil and gas backlog during the balance of 2015 as we look forward to a strong 2016 for this segment. As we have said for a long time, backlog numbers can be lumpy and bounce around some, and we do not believe that 90-day swings in backlog are necessarily indicative of the longer-term trends in our overall business. Please keep in mind that our backlog amounts can fluctuate just due to the timing of when contracts get signed. We do not count contracts signed after quarter end in our reported backlog and we do not count verbal assurances. Also, please note that our backlog numbers are only for 18 months into the future. That means that some significant and longer-duration projects may not be fully reflected in backlog. \nLastly, our longer-term master service agreement work is reflected in backlog only at its 18-month value, even if the MSA contract runs beyond the 18-month period. Second-quarter 2015 continuing operations adjusted EBITDA was $71 million compared to $108 million last year. On a rate basis, second quarter continuing operations adjusted EBITDA was 6.7% compared to 9.8% last year, a 310 basis point decrease, with 250 basis points of this decline due to losses at our electrical transmission segment. Regarding other areas of the income statement, second-quarter 2015 depreciation and amortization expense was in line with our expectation, at 4% of revenue compared to 3.3% last year. This reflects the impact of the Pacer and WesTower acquisitions completed during 2014. \nSecond-quarter 2015 GAAP general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue, was 6.5% compared to 4.9% in the second quarter of 2014. On a dollar basis, second-quarter 2015 GAAP general and administrative expense increased approximately $15 million over last year, with virtually all of this increase due to WesTower integration costs and audit committee investigation-related costs incurred during the quarter. Interest expense during the second quarter of 2015 was flat compared to last year at $12.9 million, and this level includes approximately $800,000 of costs incurred during the quarter for consent solicitation agent fees to extend financial reporting deadlines for our senior notes. As I mentioned earlier, we are now current with all reporting requirements. \nSecond-quarter 2015 GAAP provision for income taxes was $1.4 million and this includes $2.8 million of a provision recorded during the quarter to reflect the impact of a tax law change in Alberta, Canada. Excluding the impact of this item, we expect our tax rate for FY15 to approximate 44.5%. And our rate expectation for the 2015 year has increased due to lower levels of overall income as well as lower levels of foreign earnings, which are typically taxed at lower statutory rates than US operations. And finally, second-quarter 2015 continuing operations adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.10 compared to $0.42 last year. And continuing operations diluted loss per share was $0.05 compared to continuing operations diluted income per share of $0.39 last year. \nNow let me talk about cash flow liquidity and our capital structure. On a year-to-date basis we generated $166 million in cash flow from operations compared to $55 million last year, a $111 million increase despite lower earnings levels. Our second-quarter 2015 accounts receivable days sales outstanding, or DSOs, were 86 days compared to 92 days for the second quarter of 2014, a six-day decrease. As we have previously indicated, we expect that DSOs should normally range in the mid to high 80s. We continue to anticipate strong full-year 2015 cash flow from operations when compared against last year. \nRegarding our spending on capital equipment, second-quarter 2015 cash CapEx, net of disposals, was $26 million. We added approximately $14 million in capital leases and other financed equipment purchases for a total CapEx spend, net of disposals, of $40 million. Year-to-date we have incurred $44 million of cash CapEx, net of disposals, and added $27 million in capital leases and other financed equipment purchases, for a total CapEx spend, net of disposals, of $71 million. We have moderated our planned CapEx spend in the second half of 2015 and now estimate that we will spend approximately $70 million in cash CapEx, with an additional $40 million to $50 million in financed CapEx, for a total CapEx of $110 million to $120 million for the year. \nLiquidity at June 30, calculated as cash plus availability on our senior revolving credit facility, was $473 million compared to $572 million at the end of the first quarter. Despite lower levels of expected 2015 earnings, our capital structure and liquidity are strong, thus affording us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities. That said, we recognize that given lower expected 2015 earnings performance, leverage levels will be slightly higher than historical levels. We believe that leverage levels will significantly improve with the combination of improved 2016 earnings and continued strong cash flow from operations. \nMoving on to our 2015 full-year guidance, we are now projecting annual revenue of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, with continuing operations adjusted EBITDA of $325 million to $340 million and continuing operations adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.83. Our 2015 full-year guidance includes the impact of our first-half results, as well as the negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share from a higher than expected 2015 income tax rate, which is now assumed at 44.5%. Our estimate for the full year share count for diluted earnings per share is about 81 million shares and 80.5 million shares for Q3 and Q4. These estimates reflect the repurchase of over 5 million shares during the first half of 2015. We currently estimate third-quarter 2015 revenue will range between $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion from continuing operations. Continuing operations adjusted EBITDA will range between $100 million to $108 million. And continuing operations adjusted diluted earnings per share will range between $0.31 to $0.37 per share. \nIf you do the math, you will note that our revenue guidance assumes that second-half 2015 revenue levels will increase between 3% to 8% over first-half 2015 levels and this is due to the expected seasonality of our business. This guidance also assumes second-half 2015 revenue will decrease in the mid double-digit range versus second-half 2014 levels. This is due to lower expected levels of Canadian oil and gas revenues, which is the result of combined decreased demand and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, as well as expected revenue declines during the second half of 2015 versus last year in electric transmission and wireless services. \nOur guidance also assumes improved second-half 2015 EBITDA when compared to first-half results. This is expected due to the seasonality of our oil and gas business, as well as the non-recurrence of $16 million in first-quarter 2015 Canadian wind farm project losses and improved electrical transmission segment results when compared to the first-half performance. In summary, we've had a challenging first-half start to 2015, particularly in Q2. But we believe that the 2016 outlook is strong and that we are well positioned to capitalize on various growth opportunities across the markets we serve in the US, Canada and Mexico. \nThat concludes my remarks and now I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.
