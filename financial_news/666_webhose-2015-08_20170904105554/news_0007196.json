Photo: Rob Carew by Simon Evans The \"stick\" vacuum cleaner is sweeping all before it in Australia's $1.3 billion vacuum cleaner market and now represents 25 per cent of all sales across the industry, with the chief executive of retailer Godfreys, Tom Krulis, saying it will continue to claw away share from the traditional pull-along models with a long cord.\n\"There's a seismic shift in behaviour,\" Mr Krulis says.\nGodfreys is the market leader in Australia with 212 stores and plans to open a further 10 in 2015-2016 and Mr Krulis says the impact of the \"stick\" models has been enormous in an overall market where one million vacuum cleaners of all types are sold each year. Stick vacuum cleaner sales represented just 16 per cent of total sales across the market just one year ago and that has now jumped to 25 per cent.\nGodfreys' main product in the stick vacuum cleaner market is Hoover, but Mr Krulis acknowledges that the technological advances made by rival Dyson has been integral to the rise of the stick models, which have been embraced by people living in apartments, and by older people who may have down-sized into a smaller house after their children have left home.\nHe says Dyson has been the \"Apple\" of the vacuum cleaner industry, up-ending traditional technologies. Mr Krulis says 10 years ago just about every model sold in Australia was a \"pull-along\" model. He says the advent of better technology and more powerful batteries means the trend is likely to accelerate.\nShift in strategy Godfreys, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in December 2014 in a float where the issue price was $2.75, announced a full-year net profit after tax of $12.9 million for 2014-2015, but its revenue of $182.6 million was slightly below the prospectus forecast of $185 million. Mr Krulis said there had been a deliberate strategy of shifting to higher-margin products in the mid-range of the vacuum cleaner sector, but he says overall the retail sector is \"patchy\".\nMr Krulis says Godfreys is fortunate it is in a sector where consumers buy vacuum cleaners if they break down, and it isn't really a discretionary purchase. \"We think we're in a category that is reasonably stable,\" he says.\n Godfreys will pay a 12.8¢ final dividend and a special dividend of 2.6¢ on October 9. Godfreys shares are currently sitting around the $3.10 mark.\nAlso on the homemaker front, Beacon Lighting, which listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in April, 2014 with an issue price of 66¢ and has delivered handsome gains to investors who took up stock in the float with the share price now well above $2, delivered a strong increase in profits.\nBeacon Lighting increased sales by 19.3 per cent to $179.3 million in 2014-2015 and net profit after tax was up by 44 per cent to $16.9 million.\nBeacon's company-owned stores generated comparable-store sales growth of 10.4 per cent as a range of new product lines which hit the mark with home renovators. An expansion of the overall store network to 91 stores from 85 in the previous year also helped the firm produce record sales and profits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:51:14.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
