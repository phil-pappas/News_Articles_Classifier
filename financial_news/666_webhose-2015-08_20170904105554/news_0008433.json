Construction is under way at two new sites in Sydney and Melbourne, which will bring the national tally to 63 stores.\nThe new outlet scheduled to open in October at Penrith in Sydney’s western suburbs has been identified as a “strategic and high potential location”.\nAnother new store is scheduled to open in Cranbourne North, on Melbourne’s south-eastern fringe, in November.\nConstruction of a new Penrith Masters store is under way at the old Sinclair Ford and Westbus Depot on Mulgoa Rd.

Source: News Corp Australia\nIt’s business as usual for the thousands of staff members at Masters outlets around the country, with hopes that a new strategic approach could stem the flow of losses, estimated at an average $75,000 a week per store.\n“As recently as its market update in June, Woolworths confirmed its commitment to Masters,” a spokeswoman told news.com.au.\n“As per the strategy, we are rolling our new format stores with new ranges. We have also refocused our new store openings to strategic and high potential locations.”\nChairman Ralph Waters said in June that the overhauled store design being trialled across 20 per cent of Masters outlets was showing good results.\n“While it is still early days, we are very pleased with the performance of these stores,” Mr Waters said in a shareholder update.\nAn investor strategy meeting in May heard that the company had “scaled down” its rollout plan for the coming years and would “focus primarily on high-potential locations”, and those already under construction or subject to a binding lease.\nInvestors were told that the move into the $45 billion home improvement industry was sound and that “Masters will be a long-term profit contributor” to Woolworths.\nMasters Rouse Hill, in Sydney’s west, had its grand opening in April.

Source: News Corp Australia\nOutspoken retail analyst David Errington criticised Woolworths back in 2011 for its decision to move into the highly competitive hardware space, predicting that Masters would be an annual loss maker.\nThe Merrill Lynch analyst warned in a report: “We are concerned with Woolworths’ entry into the hardware market … particularly as it starts [from scratch] against well established and powerful competitors.”\nBut Masters’ expansion has pushed on at lightning speed, earning its self-proclaimed title of\nAustralia’s “fastest-growing home improvement offer”.\nAn outlet in Northmead, in Sydney’s west, had its grand opening on August 15, while stores opened in Coffs Harbour and Albion Park, on the north and south coasts of NSW, in recent weeks.\nWestern Australia’s Lansdale got a Masters store last month, and outlets were opened in Queensland’s Everton Park and Bundall, plus Sydney’s Marsden Park, in May and June.\nNew outlets also opened this year at Adelaide Airport, Lismore on the NSW north coast, Mandurah, Western Australia, and Sydney’s Rouse Hill.\nIndependent retail analyst Peter Ryan recently told news.com.au that Woolworths was robust enough to sustain big losses from Masters, but faced a big challenge in convincing the market its long-term strategy was sound.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/woolies-under-siege-in-hardware-wars-with-masters-losing-whopping-700-million/story-fnkgdftz-1227493455474?sv=ce0fb6d9d4777fc1228c754b6873c1d&title=Woolies%26%238217%3B+%24700+million+money+pit", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/woolies-under-siege-in-hardware-wars-with-masters-losing-whopping-700-million/story-fnkgdftz-1227493455474?sv=ce0fb6d9d4777fc1228c754b6873c1d", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/woolies-under-siege-in-hardware-wars-with-masters-losing-whopping-700-million/story-fnkgdftz-1227493455474?sv=ce0fb6d9d4777fc1228c754b6873c1d&title=Woolies%26%238217%3B+%24700+million+money+pit", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/losses-blow-out-at-woolworths-masters-hardware-joint-venture/story-fn91v9q3-1227490866485", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/woolies-under-siege-in-hardware-wars-with-masters-losing-whopping-700-million/story-fnkgdftz-1227493455474?sv=ce0fb6d9d4777fc1228c754b6873c1d&h=Woolies%26%238217%3B+%24700+million+money+pit", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/woolies-under-siege-in-hardware-wars-with-masters-losing-whopping-700-million/story-fnkgdftz-1227493455474?sv=ce0fb6d9d4777fc1228c754b6873c1d", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Woolies%26%238217%3B+%24700+million+money+pit&c=HARDWARE+chain+Masters+is+soldiering+on+despite+pressure+on+Woolworths+to+dump+the+loss-making+venture%2C+which+is+getting+crushed+by+Bunnings.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/woolies-under-siege-in-hardware-wars-with-masters-losing-whopping-700-million/story-fnkgdftz-1227493455474?sv=ce0fb6d9d4777fc1228c754b6873c1d"], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T02:12:40.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
