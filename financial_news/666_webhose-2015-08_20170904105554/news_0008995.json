Mr Carney noted the “ongoing domestic strength” of the UK market in his address, adding that the decision as to when to start the process of raising rates would still take place “around the turn of this year”. \n\"In the UK, consumer confidence is at its highest level in over a decade and retail sales have been growing at well above past average rates,\" he said. \"Firms’ investment intensions are robust. And inflation expectations remain consistent with our 2pc target.\" \nMr Carney gave strong indications that interest rates would rise by early 2016 in July of this year. Higher interest rates will provide long-awaited relief to savers, who have seen their returns shrink in the wake of the financial crisis but will increase the pressure on borrowers, who will have to pay more for their mortgages and credit card bills. The increase in interest rates could also hit the housing market. \nEarlier this month, Mr Carney hinted that global headwinds would not stand in the way of rate rises , saying: “Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) time we're in front of you there will be lots of uncertainty, some of which we won't have predicted, but that's not a justification for permanent stasis.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T21:26:56.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
