Source: Supplied\nThe luxury home on a 603sq m block sold under the hammer for $681,000 on August 22.\nA crowd of about 70 people turned up on the sunny winter’s day to watch six bidders compete for the home, said Harcourts Epping agent Justin Sciola.\n“A young family from Mill Park snapped up the home at a price that was pretty much on the vendor’s money,” Mr Sciola said.\nchristine.desilva@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Facetime buyer swoops ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sydney-investor-knocks-out-melburnian-bidders-after-viewing-property-on-facetime/story-fndban6l-1227499206731?sv=b494d57c412392b1e255aea12b07752b", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sydney-investor-knocks-out-melburnian-bidders-after-viewing-property-on-facetime/story-fndban6l-1227499206731?sv=b494d57c412392b1e255aea12b07752b&title=Facetime+buyer+swoops", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Facetime+buyer+swoops&c=MELBOURNE+bidders+are+being+priced+out+by+property+investors+from+Sydney%2C+like+the+Chinese+man+who+swooped+on+a+house+he%26%238217%3Bd+only+seen+on+FaceTime.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sydney-investor-knocks-out-melburnian-bidders-after-viewing-property-on-facetime/story-fndban6l-1227499206731?sv=b494d57c412392b1e255aea12b07752b", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sydney-investor-knocks-out-melburnian-bidders-after-viewing-property-on-facetime/story-fndban6l-1227499206731?sv=b494d57c412392b1e255aea12b07752b", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sydney-investor-knocks-out-melburnian-bidders-after-viewing-property-on-facetime/story-fndban6l-1227499206731?sv=b494d57c412392b1e255aea12b07752b&title=Facetime+buyer+swoops", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/realestate/sydney-investor-secures-south-morang-home/story-fnqsbpzr-1227498579457", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sydney-investor-knocks-out-melburnian-bidders-after-viewing-property-on-facetime/story-fndban6l-1227499206731?sv=b494d57c412392b1e255aea12b07752b&h=Facetime+buyer+swoops"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:36:04.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
