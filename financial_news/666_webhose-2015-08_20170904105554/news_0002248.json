The report also observed that India continued to “stand out” among its emerging market peers due to commodity deflation and improved external balances.\n 05, 2015 8:18 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:17:39.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
