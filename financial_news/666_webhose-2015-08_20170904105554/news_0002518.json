We were making good progress on that. That one is close to conclusion I think.\"\nHe said the parties had agreed to meet again in a few weeks after talks that he said were \"pretty tension packed\" with \"a lot of anger at times\".\n\"We have agreed within a few weeks to reconvene, we don't like to put a date on it. I am confident in a few weeks we will reconvene and it's a question of how much leg work is done in the interim.\"\nChina FTA stalled by 'mischievous' campaign Business Council chief executive Jennifer Westacott said Monday the failure of the TPP reinforced the importance for federal parliament to ratify the China free trade deal, which she said has been attacked by a \"mischievous and inaccurate advertising campaign by the unions\".\n\"This is a huge opportunity for Australia, and it is essential it gets passed in the Senate with the safeguards the government has included, and with appropriate transparency and resourcing for compliance and enforcement,\" Ms Westacott said in a statement.\n\"It is vital that public debate around the agreement is well informed and not driven by a mischievous and inaccurate advertising campaign by the unions.\n\"Every week which goes by without this agreement being finalised is a week our competitors will take advantage of.\"\nThe BCA encouraged the government to continue its efforts for a deal on the TPP.\n\"It is important to keep up the momentum for an agreement so the goodwill can be turned into an outcome that benefits all.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:56:58.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
