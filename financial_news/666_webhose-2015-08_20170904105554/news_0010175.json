Make it a milestone, not a millstone By Nick Watkins | Telegraph – 19 minutes ago 0.0001 0.0000 \nComment: The hidden costs of getting on the housing ladder can wreck your finances. Nick Watkins explains how to avoid being caught out \nFor many people, buying their first home is a major financial goal. There are a variety of helpful schemes to make this an option financially. However, it is important that first-time buyers think about the full cost of buying and running a home from the outset so that they can avoid financial difficulty in years to come. \nWe recently took a look at the effect of buying a home on people’s finances. We discovered that it can have a really positive impact on their ability to manage and make the most of their money. This is because it both empowers them to feel that their financial goals can be met and promotes a strong sense of responsibility. \nDespite this, buying a home can be a financial millstone too. Three quarters of recent first-time buyers overstretched themselves to make their purchase, finding that the cost of owning a home was more than expected. As a result, one in five first-time buyers suffered financial difficulties because they seriously underestimated the additional costs involved, such as solicitors' fees or furnishing costs. \nIn addition, half of first-time buyers said they simply could not afford a £500 increase in monthly mortgage repayments if and when interest rates rose. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is important for potential home owners to think realistically about the amount of money needed to buy and move into a new home to ensure that there is enough available to cover all the additional costs, such as insurance, removals, furnishings and repairs. Our research also highlighted that the majority of people could be putting themselves in a much better financial position by saving or protecting themselves should the unexpected happen. \nIt’s a sad fact that 1.3 million people suffer a serious accident or illness and 1.2 million are made redundant every year. These factors should be considered when making a long-term investment such as buying a home. It is also worth thinking about whether they have enough saved to cover the basic mortgage payment should the worst should happen. \nSo what’s the solution? \nTo make sure that our financial milestones don’t become millstones, it is important to consider the full cost of buying a home, beyond the immediately obvious upfront payments. Here are three basic steps that could help you plan ahead and ensure that buying is an achievement and milestone you can enjoy. \n1. Find out how much you can afford. Get a clear picture of where your money goes each month to see what’s left after you’ve covered essential payments and general livings costs. This will give you an idea of how much you can afford in monthly mortgage repayments. Remember to factor in a little extra each month for those unexpected household costs. Be realistic in what you can do without each month as the lifestyle changes you make now might need to last as long as your mortgage. The Money Advice Service's Quick Cash Finder and budget planner could help. \n2. Set savings goals. Setting yourself short and long-term goals to build up your savings will provide you with enough for your deposit as well as a financial buffer should the unexpected happen. Make sure you also save enough to cover additional costs such as solicitors' fees, the survey, removal costs, furnishing, insurance and, of course, stamp duty. Take a look at the Money Advice Service's website for more information about considering the full cost of buying your home. \n3. Make sure you’re getting the best deal. Before making that important final decision, take a step back and ensure that your mortgage is right for you. Research the different types of mortgage available and choose one that best suits your needs. You can read more about different mortgage options on the Money Advice Service website. It is also worth considering the different fees and costs associated with taking out a mortgage. Look at the full cost of the mortgage as well as the repayments when you are making comparisons to make sure you are getting the best deal. \nNick Watkins is head of consumer insight for the Money Advice Service", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:20:06.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
