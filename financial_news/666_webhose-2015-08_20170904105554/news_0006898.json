Assets and trading volumes are fairly low, and partly for that reason the costs are fairly high.The best-established tax-exempt exchange-traded fund, iShares National AMT-Free Muni ( MUB ), has only $5 billion. It will cost you $411 to put away $10,000 in this fund for a decade.Short-term (and low-yielding) munis can be had at SPDR Nuveen Barclays Short-Term Municipal ( SHM ) and at Market Vectors Short Municipal ( SMB ).If you have a lot of money to put into tax-exempt bonds for a long time your best bet at the moment is to open an account at Vanguard and buy one of its open-end funds. For smaller sums the ETFs may be a convenient place to park money in a non-Vanguard brokerage account.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 IBME iShares iBonds Sep 2016 AMT-Free Muni Bd 133 0.18 329 SHM SPDR Nuveen Barclays ST Muni Bd 2,673 0.2 329 IBMF iShares iBonds Sep 2017 AMT-Free Muni Bd 159 0.18 332 SMB Market Vectors Short Municipal 264 0.2 341 IBMH iShares iBonds Sep 2019 AMT-Free Muni Bd 64 0.18 350 IBMD iShares iBonds Sep 2015 AMT-Free Muni Bd 89 0.18 351 IBMG iShares iBonds Sep 2018 AMT-Free Muni Bd 89 0.18 362 CXA SPDR Nuveen Barclays CA Muni Bd 88 0.2 368 TFI SPDR Nuveen Barclays Municipal Bond 1,342 0.23 380 ITM Market Vectors Intermediate Muni 1,126 0.24 396 MUB iShares National AMT-Free Muni Bond 5,110 0.25 411 SUB iShares ST National AMT-Free Muni Bnd 937 0.25 414 PVI PowerShares VRDO Tax-Free Weekly 86 0.25 420 CMF iShares Cali AMT-Free Muni Bond 395 0.25 429 MLN Market Vectors Long Municipal 102 0.24 433 NYF iShares New York AMT-Free Muni Bond 182 0.25 448 PZA PowerShares National AMT-Free MuniBd 857 0.28 465 PWZ PowerShares Calif AMT-Free Muni Bd 102 0.28 469 SMMU Pimco Short Term Municipal Bond Actv 58 0.35 577 HYD Market Vectors High-Yield Municipal 1,512 0.35 580 MUNI Pimco Intermediate Municipal Bd Actv 229 0.35 595 SHYD Market Vectors Short Hi-Yld Muni 105 0.35 670 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
