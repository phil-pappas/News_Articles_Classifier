It's a tough time to bring on your tier one projects.\" \nOrigin's APLNG project is set to begin production in weeks. \nDespite the large amount of Australian LNG coming on line in the coming years, chief executive Grant King says the extra supply will be soaked up by global demand. \n\"In respect of aggregate supply and demand it looks to us like it's in balance because there's plenty of supply to meet that demand and maybe a bit in excess,\" he told AAP. \n\"A lot of LNG that's produced today is sold into contracts that were put in place to underwrite those plans.\" \nMr King added that the company was comfortable with plans to reduce the nation's greenhouse emissions by at least 26 per cent by 2030, and believes an increased renewable energy target is likely. \nORIGIN SINKS INTO THE RED \n* Net loss of $658m, down from $530m profit \n* Revenue down 5 pct to $13.8b \n* Dividend unchanged at 25 cents @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Origin to cut jobs after falling to a loss AAP \nOrigin Energy will cut around 800 jobs and has flagged further weak earnings growth after falling oil prices contributed â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T13:08:52.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
