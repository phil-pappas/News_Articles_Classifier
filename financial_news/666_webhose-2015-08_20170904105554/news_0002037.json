While visiting my daughter in Australia I logged into my bank account and discovered that no payment had been taken. I immediately stopped using my credit card. \nOn my return to Britain I went into the local post office and paid by cheque the full amount it was demanding including a £24 fee for late payment. I complained about the situation and the Post Office gave compensation. \n• 'My bank account switch left bills unpaid' \n• 'Santander isn't acknowledging payments made from other Santander accounts why?' \nUnder the impression that the matter had been sorted out, I again used my Post Office credit card. The direct debit did not work this time either. Valerie Singleton, Devon \nThis time a £12 late payment charge with interest featured on your statement. Then the Post Office said TSB had refused to make the credit card payment. Ridiculously at one stage it told you your bank did not exist, even though it had managed to pay the goodwill sum directly into the account. \nThe Post Office told me it had liaised with TSB and between the systems there had been an error that was now rectified. As a new gesture of goodwill it sent £175. \nWhen I spoke to TSB, it turned out that the direct debit was still not in place. It knew nothing of the issue and robustly said it had never rejected the request for payment. The problem had come about because the Post Office's systems had not recognised the sort code. \nEventually the Post Office admitted that the sort code required by the Post Office to collect the direct debit payment from TSB had not been loaded on to its processing system. It has been now. \nThe Post Office would come out of this with less egg on its face if it had fully acknowledged what had happened first time around. \nYou won’t be using your Post Office card any more. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T10:54:09.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
