Guardian U.S. editorial staffers joined The NewsGuild-CWA. Before that, no digital media sites had been unionized. \nThe Associated Press, The New York Times and other newspaper staffers have union representation. \nThe Writers Guild of America, East is part of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the United States. It represents writers in movies, TV, cable, digital media and broadcast news. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that Guardian U.S. staffers joined the NewsGuild-CWA, not the Writer's Guild of America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T22:35:43.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
