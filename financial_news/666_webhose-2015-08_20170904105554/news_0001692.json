Rob Gunstone/File Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Prime Minister Tony Abbott has confirmed Australia is in discussions with its allies over our forces taking part in airstrikes in Syria, but said no formal request has been made.\nMr Abbott was questioned on the matter after Liberal MP Dan Tehan called for Australia to launch airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, a push Labor has labelled as an \"extraordinary\" attempt by the government to run foreign policy from the backbench.\nMr Abbott said while no formal decision has been taken to assist the US-led effort to bomb ISIS in Syria, some discussions were going on with Australia's allies at official levels.\n\"I'm not going to pre-empt any decision. But, yes, the matter has been raised.\n\"Obviously there have been some approaches made at various levels but no formal request has come, no formal decision has been taken, so I stress we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.\nThe Prime Minister said the threat from ISIS was just as bad \"on either side\" of the border.\n\"While the legality is different, whether these air strikes are taking place in Syria or Iraq, the morality is the same. The death cult is just as evil,\" Mr Abbott said.\nMr Tehan, a Coalition backbencher, has said expanded Australian involvement into Syria was needed to defeat ISIS or Daesh.\n \"The time has come for Australia to join the military coalition seeking to destroy Daesh in Syria. We are acting in Iraq against Daesh, with our Hornets launching air strikes on a regular basis. We should be doing the same in Syria,\" he said in an opinion piece.\nHe said the humanitarian crisis in the nation called for Australia to seriously consider crossing the border into Syria from our current involvement in Iraq.\n\"It is time we realised that border is an arbitrary border...we do have to start stepping up the campaign in Syria\" he said, adding it is time we start \"flying our hornets over Syria and where we can, carry out attacks against IS\".\n'Extraordinary' Labor has hit back, with foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, saying the government was floating serious foreign policy moves with the public via a backbencher, without briefing parliament.\n\"It is extraordinary to be sending a backbencher out to run up the flagpole, a decision as serious as this - that we'd send Australian armed personnel into harm's way in one of the most dangerous places on earth,\" she said.\nA spokesman for Mr Tehan said he had not spoken to Prime Minister Tony Abbott before airing his new position, and it was a \"personal view that he felt very strongly about\".\nMs Plibersek said the Australian government's role in Syria should primarily be humanitarian, considering the current situation.\n\"As the Prime Minister himself has said, there is no clear legal basis for Australian involvement in Syria,\" she said.\nWhile the Iraqi government supports Australia's efforts in striking ISIS, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has condemned US air strikes in Syria.\nMs Plibersek also hinted these statements undermined recent bipartisanship over national security.\n\"Labor has been very supportive of the Government in a bipartisan fashion, taking humanitarian action in Iraq.\n\"If they want to make a case that that's changed, they should certainly offer a briefing to the Opposition. But more importantly, they should explain to the Australian people through the Parliament why they've changed their view,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-13T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:01:44.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
