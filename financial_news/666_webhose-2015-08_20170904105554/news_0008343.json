The unit shut on Aug. 8 after a leak in a heat exchanger, and early reports suggested it could remain offline for one or two months. \nThe plant is able to temporarily repair equipment, so that it would not have to wait for replacement parts to arrive, ENT said. \nPeople familiar with the 413,500 bpd refinery also told Reuters that inspections had not revealed extensive damage to the equipment, likely allowing the unit to resume operations in less than a month. One of the people said it was possible the plant could attempt to restart at the weekend. \nA BP spokesperson declined to comment on restart plans. \nThe unexpected outage and threat of prolonged repairs sent tremors through global oil markets, causing a spike in regional gasoline pump rates, depressing Canadian cash crude prices and threatening to add to a glut of oil expected to accumulate in Cushing, Oklahoma, weighing on U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . oil prices. \nTalk that the plant might not be shut as long as feared helped narrow the Brent/WTI spread (WTCLc1-LCOc1) by more than 50 cents a barrel on Thursday. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) narrowed a further 20 cents in after-hours trading following the ENT report. \nProduction at the plant has fallen to about 165,000 bpd with the unit offline, according to people familiar with the plant.
