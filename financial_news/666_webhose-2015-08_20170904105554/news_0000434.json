Jim Rice Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Nearly 10 per cent of rental property investors own three or more properties, and nearly 18,000 own six or more, the latest statistics reveal, and the number is rising.\nThe 2013 tax statistics show 16 per cent of taxpayers, or nearly two million people, own investment properties; about 110,379 taxpayers own more than three properties; about 18,000 own more than six properties; 40,283 own four properties; and 16,600 owned five.\n\"The number of people with more than one property would be a lot higher now than the 2012-13 financial year,\" Housing Industry Association's senior economist, Shane Garrett said.\n\"There are simply more people in the country now and and the property market has since become more favourable.\"\n\"Dwelling prices have accelerated in key markets, rental price growth has been consistently higher than inflation since 2013 so mortgage costs have improved.\"\nImpact of low rates On Wednesday, the chairman of a parliamentary inquiry into the housing market, Coalition MP John Alexander, warned that low interest rates had created a growing class of uber-landlords with huge property portfolios who risk big losses if the market turns or rates rise.\n\"There were investors with $30 million housing portfolios with 60 properties would have to find $600,000 to cover their losses with loan rates moving from 4 to 6 per cent,\" Mr Alexander said.\n The HIA also said in the year to May 2015, the value of investor lending in NSW totalled $65.8 billion. That compared with $44.93 billion in lending to owner-occupiers (excluding refinancing) over the same period.\nThe value of owner-occupier home loans was $144.1 billion, compared with $146.9 billion for investor loans.\n\"This is the first time I can remember investors out-borrowing owner-occupiers on a national level,\" Mr Garrett said.\n\"But it is important to bear in mind that investor participation in the market has the effect of boosting new housing supply, and alleviating shortages of accommodation in Sydney's tight rental market.\"\nMr Garrett said the rental property demand would not slow as population growth continued and economic growth fired up in light of the lower Australian dollar.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-08-06T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:11:17.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
