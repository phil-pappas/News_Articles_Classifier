Louie Douvis by Will Glasgow First an update on Slater and Gordon managing director Andrew Grech 's mansion in the lovely Melbourne suburb of Kew .\nIt seems Grech is not dithering around with this. We're told the expressions of interest campaign to sell the \" Masterpiece of Victorian Grandeur \" ends on September 9 â€“ that is, in three weeks, two weeks after the listed law firm releases its financial results (after a four-day delay to better accommodate Greg Medcraft 's ASIC).\nThe five-bedroom stunner which sits on 1800 square metres of Paul Bangay -landscaped gardens is expected to sell for north of $10 million. Family reasons are the stated cause for the sale, according to the property's agent.\nThe listing follows a notable shrinkage of Grech's fortune. He shelled out about $11 million for Slater and Gordon shares earlier in the year when they were trading north of $6. Shares in the firm closed on Monday at $3.14.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.domain.com.au/for-sale/25-barry-street-kew-vic-3101-2012186947?sp=0"], "published": "2015-08-17T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:08:50.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
