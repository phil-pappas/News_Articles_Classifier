Look for better dollar buyers on a move toward 123.20 yen,\" Chandler said in a note. \nThe euro edged down about 0.1 percent to $1.0959. \nAs a spate of solid U.S. economic data has heightened expectations that the U.S. central bank is poised for a hike, speculators increased bullish bets on the greenback to their highest since early June, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. \nThe value of the dollar's net long position climbed to $32.77 billion in the week ended Aug. 4, from $29.79 billion the previous week. \nThe Swiss franc, meanwhile, was flat from late North American levels, with the dollar buying 0.9833 franc. On Friday, the dollar rose as high as $0.9885, its loftiest peaks since late March.
