So we are now looking at the banks through consolidated supervision which will govern the banks supervision and also sharing information on how they are operating where ever they are operating from,\" she said. \nThe deputy governor said the RBZ is also instituting constant risk-based supervision with banks to assess their strength. She said a consolidated supervisory framework, where bank subsidiaries are monitored to determine their viability, has been developed. \nDhliwayo added that amendments to the Banking Act will enhance corporate governance as most banks fail due to poor management and non-performing insider loans. \n\"Corporate governance is one of the areas that we want to enhance.

Most interbank loans are for maturities of one week or less; the majority being overnight. \nThe absence of an interbank market had resulted in the market being segmented with some banks having huge surpluses while others have experienced acute liquidity challenges.
