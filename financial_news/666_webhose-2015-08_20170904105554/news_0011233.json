David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd A highlight of the National Reform Summit for the big end of town was the strong arguments put forward by former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson in favour of cutting the corporate tax rate.\nParkinson said Australia should pull out the \"mud map\" for tax reform prepared by his predecessor and now National Australia Bank director Ken Henry.\nHe said Henry's report is as valid today as it was when it was published. Unfortunately it was butchered by the Rudd Labor government in May 2010.\nIt is worth repeating Henry's top-line recommendations for building a tax and transfer system for the 21st century.\nHe said revenue raising should be concentrated on four robust and efficient broad-based taxes: personal income, assessed on a more comprehensive basis; business income, designed to support economic growth; rents on natural resources and land; and private consumption.\nThe Henry review recommended cutting the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent over the short to medium term.\nAchieving that objective will require a consensus agreement which must involve the backing of the ACTU led by Dave Oliver and the Australian Council of Social Services led by Cassandra Goldie.\nThe tax reform principles agreed before the discussion started on Wednesday included the following statement: \"A competitive corporate tax system is one of many elements of the broader commercial environment that is essential to attracting investment and growing the economy.\"\n Advantages of lower corporate taxes Parkinson made the insightful point that lower corporate tax rates actually increase jobs and help lift economic growth.\nHowever, achieving agreement on any changes to the tax system, whether it is raising the GST or cutting corporate taxes, will require a much more detailed set of data, according to Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive Ian Narev.\nHe made the pitch for federal Treasury to reveal the details of the modelling of new tax system so that it can be shared with all. This would allow all participants in the discussion to understand which segments of society would require additional financial support as part of creating a fairer and more sustainable system.\nHis ideas were captured in the action plan for further discussion which said that there is a need to \"subject tax reform to rigorous quantitative analysis of the efficiency and distributional impacts.\nAlso, the action plan said there was a need for greater access to and transparency of tax modelling assumptions and that tax reform should focus on the tax system as a whole.\nWednesday's National Reform Summit was convened by The Australian Financial Review's editor-in-chief, Michael Stutchbury, and the editor-in-chief of The Australian, Chris Mitchell. They will now have to fight over the copy of them drawn together by David Rowe .\nWoolworths chair Based on all the noises coming out of the Woolworths headquarters at Bella Vista, Gordon Cairns will replace Ralph Waters as chairman . This is arguably the toughest chairman's gig in Australia. While it carries the typical remuneration for a top 10 company chair of about $720,000 a year, it also carries the weight of expectation of about 420,000 retail shareholders and a group of frustrated institutional investors\nWoolworths fits the description of a \"blue-chip\" stock with its reliable dividends, strong cash flows, conservative balance sheet and significant market power. But its performance in recent years has been disappointing. Its total return has been below the S&P/ASX 200 annual returns every year for the past five years.\nIf, as expected Cairns, is parachuted in as the chairman it will send a strong signal to the market that the company is open to a significant shake-up. The other candidate was existing director and former National Australia Bank deputy CEO Michael Ullmer.\nCairns probably edged out Ullmer for two reasons. He has a depth of experience in the fast-moving consumer goods market through his time running Lion Nathan in Australia and he can fill the role of a change agent because he brings a fresh set of eyes.\nIt would not be a surprise to see the Woolies board go down the same road as Santos under new executive chairman Peter Coates who ordered a strategic review of all assets. The two assets under the spotlight at Woolies are the Masters Home Improvement chain and the Big W discount department store. Masters, a joint venture with US retailer Lowe's, has absorbed $3 billion in capital and is expected to have lost $200 million in 2015.\nBig W has been struggling while its main competitor Kmart has been soaring. Big W's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) have halved from $200 million to $100 million in the past two years while Kmart's have risen 25 per cent to $432 million. Private equity has expressed strong interest in buying Big W and there is bound to be creative ways to resolve the Masters problem.\nIf Woolworths freed itself of the distractions of those two companies its earnings would soar and its share price could rise to $60, according to David Errington, retail analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He says that the Woolworths food and liquor business has powerful earning capacity because it turns over its inventory in 18 days for cash but takes 40 days to pay its suppliers.\nThe Woolworths cash machine would be even more powerful with the double whammy of increased sales in food and liquor and putting an end to the cash bleed in Masters and Big W.\nErrington has been a strong critic of the Masters strategy for several years because of the shareholder value that has been destroyed. He has written that squeezing higher margins out of food and liquor to prop up Masters and Big W was a mistake.\nErrington's core argument in his research is that Woolies should reassert its dominance over the Wesfarmers-owned Coles . It is easy to forget that despite its woes the Woolies food, liquor and petrol business had EBIT last year of $3.37 billion compared to Coles EBIT in the year June this year of $1.78 billion. After ordering a strategic review, the next task facing the Cairns-led board of directors will be to find the CEO capable of executing the strategy.\nThe other conglomerate Conglomerates are meant to protect shareholders against cyclical downturns in distinctly separate industries by providing a diversity of non-correlated earnings streams. That's how it works at Wesfarmers. While its industrial businesses struggled in the year to June with profit down 26.8 per cent, retailing and home improvement businesses were motoring with profit increases ranging from 18 per cent to 4.7 per cent.\nAustralia's other conglomerate, the Stokes family's Seven Group Holdings, has unfortunately found itself with cyclical downturns in all three of its main businesses: industrial services (WesTrac and Coates Hire), media (Seven West Media), and energy (Nexus Energy, Beach and Drillsearch).\nChief executive Ryan Stokes is doing the best he can with the cards he has been dealt but shareholders are probably looking at two to three years of lacklustre results.\nConsensus forecasts from Capital IQ have Seven Group's earnings per share going backwards over the next three years.\nOne positive upside is that the company's 40Â¢-a-share fully franked annual dividend looks to be baked into the business model. That gives a relatively high yield of 8.5 per cent at Wednesday's close of $4.67.\nThe jewel in the crown at Seven Group is WesTrac, the Caterpillar business with operations in Australia and China. It is not making as many product sales as during the boom times but its maintenance business rose 13 per cent in the year to June.\nOne shareholder expressed concern at the rise in net debt to $1.34 billion but chief financial officer Richard Richards says debt is negligible if you net off the $1 billion investment portfolio. Richards told Chanticleer the company has no covenant issues. It recently refinanced $2.5 billion of facilities across the group. Seven Group's gearing ratio rose from 25.4 per cent to 32.4per cent in the year to June.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-08-26T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:06:59.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
