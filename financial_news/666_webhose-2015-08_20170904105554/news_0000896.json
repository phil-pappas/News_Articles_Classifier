A search for new central London premises is expected to begin almost immediately. \nPearson’s decision not to sell the building with the newspaper sparked speculation that it intended to cash in by selling separately to a property developer. The site, overlooking Southwark Bridge, would be expected to fetch hundreds of millions of pounds. \nBut Southwark Council said it would oppose any move to take advantage of the strong international demand for high-end residential property in central London. \nLabour councillor Mark Williams, responsible for regeneration, said: “There is huge demand for office space in Southwark, particularly in the north of the borough along the river. \n“The FT are in a substantial office building in an area where our policy is to retain and expand office space and employment. Any application for this site would need to retain or increase this space in addition to any other uses. \n“We did have initial discussions along these lines with the FT a few years ago, but nothing was formalised and no planning application was submitted.” \nPearson explored moving the FT three years ago and was seeking a partner to develop flats. \nThe newspaper moved to its current building in 1987 from Bracken House on Cannon Street, which Pearson sold to the Japanese bank Ohbayashi for £143m. The company declined to comment on its plans for the FT building. \nThe issue of foreign investors snapping up London developments off-plan and often leaving them unoccupied has climbed the political agenda. David Cameron said last week the capital was “not a place to stash your dodgy cash”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T22:59:37.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
