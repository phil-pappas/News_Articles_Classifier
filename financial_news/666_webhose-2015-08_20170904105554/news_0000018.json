In Shanghai, China Railway Construction soared 9.49 percent to 18.34 yuan while China Railway Erju also climbed 8.31 percent to 17.07 yuan. \n\"State-owned enterprise mergers are an investment theme that's quite certain and there are signs that the move will speed up,\" Li Jingyuan, a general manager at Shanghai Zhaoyi Asset Management, told Bloomberg News. \n- Disappointing trade data - \nThe gains came after trade data showing China's exports plunged 8.3 percent from a year earlier, while imports dropped 8.1 percent, added to concerns over the health of Asia's largest economy. \nBeijing on Sunday said inflation rose 1.6 percent in July, well below the government's annual target of three percent, while producer prices declined to their lowest level since late 2009. \nThe news will likely hit commodities and particularly base metals, analysts said, which plumbed to multi-year lows last week over signs demand is waning in massive importer China. \nHigher rates tend to push up the US currency, which in turn makes dollar-priced commodities less attractive to international investors and so dents prices. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) fetched $1,094.70, slightly higher than $1,089.64 late Friday and above last week's nadir of $1,072.34 -- its lowest level since February 2010. \nBut oil prices continued their decline, coming under pressure after reports of a rise in US rigs added to concerns of a supply glut, both globally and particularly in the world's top crude consumer. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in September fell to $43.76 a barrel from $43.87 in New York Friday. Brent North Sea crude for September traded at $48.50 a barrel, down from $48.61. \nIn currency markets, the dollar pushed higher after news the US added 215,000 jobs in July and unemployment held steady at a seven-year fuelled predictions the Federal Reserve could raise rates as early as September. \nThe greenback ticked up to 124.40 yen from 124.22 yen in New York on Friday. The euro edged higher to $1.0972 and 136.48 yen, from $1.0962 and 136.16 yen. \n\"Expectations around an upcoming move on rates from the Federal Reserve have picked up somewhat, with the implied probability now sitting at 54 percent,\" said Chris Weston at IG Markets. \nIn individual stocks, US-listed Chinese Internet giant Alibaba is to pay 28.3 billion yuan ($4.6 billion) for a nearly 20 percent stake in consumer electronics retailer Suning, the two companies said in a statement Monday. \nIn Tokyo, shares in Japan Display jumped 13.6 percent to 426 yen after the smartphone screen-maker reported upbeat earnings when markets closed Friday. \nIn other markets: \n-- Manila closed flat, adding 1.83 points to 7,534.35 \nUniversal Robina Corp. led gainers, rising 3.10 percent to 196.50 pesos, while top-traded Philippine Long Distance Telephone ended 1.96 percent down at 2,702.00 pesos. \n-- Taipei rose 0.29 percent, or 24.55 points, to 8,466.84. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co shed 3.01 percent to Tw$129.0 while Fubon Financial Holding gained 2.11 percent to Tw$58.2. \n-- In Wellington, the NZX (Other OTC: NZSTF - news ) -50 was flat, edging down 3.64 points to 5,865.02. \nContact Energy (NZSE: CEN.NZ - news ) rose 0.78 percent to NZ$5.19 while Auckland International Airport was down 3.05 percent at NZ$5.245", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:42:12.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
