They opened down a further 2 percent on Thursday before stabilising. \n\"2016 will be a year of change,\" the comany's new chief executive, Chris Weston, told reporters. \n\"The market environment that Aggreko faces has changed significantly in recent years and the company needs to adapt to the new landscape and maximise the opportunities available.\" \nAggreko has been hit in its North American business by the lower oil price, which has resulted in declining activity and less equipment being hired by oil companies both onshore in the shale oil industry and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. \nElsewhere, the company said security challenges in Yemen meant it could not operate all of its generators and equipment, while in Bangladesh the terms of a temporary power supply contract extension were not as favourable as it had hoped. \nIt has now reorganised into two units - Power Solutions (Frankfurt: 1PS.F - news ) and Rental Solutions - and identified 80 million pounds of cost savings that will be found by 2017, which will be reinvested. \nWeston, previously a top exectutive at Centrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) who took the helm at Aggreko in January, said the cost savings would come from improvements in areas like procurement and he expected demand from its divisions like power projects to help offset the uncertainty in oil and gas markets. \n\"There is a gap between the demand for the power and the supply for power and that really plays to our sweet spot .. We expect that gap to continue growing at about 6 percent per annum for the next five years,\" he said. \nAggreko expects full-year profit before tax to come in at between 250 million pounds and 270 million pounds at current exchange rates, compared with 289 million pounds a year earlier. \nAnalysts had been expecting pre-tax profit of 294 million pounds for the full-year 2016, according to Reuters data. \nThe company, which employs around 8,300 people in 100 countries, said the organisational changes would result in around 600 job losses globally. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Aggreko, which have lost more than a fifth of their value this year, were down 0.84 percent at 1177 pence by 0934 GMT \n\"The strategy suggests a better growth and returns profile but in the near to medium term it is likely to get worse due to difficult end-markets and actions taken by Aggreko to drive efficiencies,\" said Jefferies analysts in a note.
