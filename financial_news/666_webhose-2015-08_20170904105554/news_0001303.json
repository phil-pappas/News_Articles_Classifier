Economists don't expect things to change anytime soon. According to the Federal Reserve, the average American has credit card debt of $US15,607 and mortgage debt of $US153,500. At the same time, most wages have been stagnant or rising only slightly. Critics say the interest pawn shops charge - as much as 25 per cent in Georgia for the first three months - only adds to the users' budgetary woes. The average loan nationally is for about $US150, and the pawned item - which is used as collateral - is picked up in about 30 days, said Emmett Murphy, a spokesman for the National Pawnbrokers Association. About 85 per cent of customers pick up their \"collateral\" items. Typically, a pawnbroker is required to hold an item for at least 30 days before it can released, but that depends on the state, Murphy said. But most pawnbrokers would rather hold on to the item for the loan than sell it, because some collateral - such as artwork or clothing - may have more sentimental than commercial value, so it is hard to sell. \"If you continue to go over an extended period of time\" with a pawnbroker loan, \"it's very unlikely you'll dig yourself out of whatever hole you're in,\" said economist Tim Mescon. \"You have to break the cycle.\" That may be a challenge for some in Georgia, with one of - if not the - highest unemployment rate. Georgia pawnbrokers say they've seen business jump anywhere from 10 to 20 per cent over the past few years. \"To be honest with you, the business is recession-proof,\" said Howard Rappaport, a manager at the Happy Hocker. He said business was always strongest during a recession, but that levels at the pawn store have remained strong despite the improved economy. One driver to pawn stores at the recession's height was the explosion in gold prices. Jewellery is the item pawned most often, and the jump in the value of gold gave those in need of funds more purchase power. Gold prices peaked in 2011 but have since fallen. Reality TV also has driven foot traffic. Shows such as Pawn Stars and Hardcore Pawn have taken the stigma out of the industry and broadened the appeal to consumers who would have never come in before, but now drop in regularly looking for an experience similar to what they see on TV, the operators said. Store operators have responded. The jewellery cases at Dynasty and nearby Big Deal Pawn are polished with care to best accentuate the diamond encrusted watches and rings that sit beneath. An eye-catching display of guitars lines the walls of Dynasty while the sales floor at Big Deal features drum sets and flat screen TVs, with guns neatly placed in racks behind the counter. Levinson said he has employed a GIA diamond specialist to authenticate his products. While lending has remained strong, fewer people are shopping for jewellery and laptop bargains. Nationally, the pawn retail business was down 25 per cent because consumers remain frugal, Murphy said.
