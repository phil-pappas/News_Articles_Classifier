Hong Kong rose 3.10 percent by late afternoon. \nEurope's main stock exchanges jumped at the open, with London, Frankfurt and Paris all surging more than 2.5 percent in opening trade. \n- 'Concerned about the outlook' - \nAsian shares had ended the day mixed on Wednesday after a volatile session that saw Shanghai veer wildly between losses and gains as dealers weighed news that China's central bank had cut its key rates and freed up cash for banks. \nThe measures -- the second such combo move in two months -- are not only aimed at boosting cash flow in China, but also at reviving confidence that Beijing can steer the economy away from a hard landing and keep global growth on course. \nOn Thursday, the central bank also cut the yuan to a four-year low against the US dollar after a shock devaluation on August 11 compounded fears growth is undershooting expectations. \nShanghai stocks have been on a roller-coaster ride after a debt-fuelled, year-long rally collapsed in June, prompting Beijing to unleash unprecedented measures to shore up the market -- including buying up shares. \nWhile the slump in Shanghai may have a limited impact on the broader economy it reflects investors' views that the sky-high valuations of quoted companies are not justified. \nThe turmoil in Shanghai has affected global markets to the point where William Dudley, the head of the New York branch of the Fed, on Wednesday said it had weakened the argument for a September US rate rise. \n\"The slowdown in China could lead... to a slower global growth rate and less demand for the US economy,\" he said. \n\"We're concerned about the outlook, how is the economy going to perform in the future.\" \n- 'Feeling of relief' - \nWhile signs the US economy is strong are a plus for world growth, a rate hike would likely strengthen the greenback and so make trade in dollar-priced products, from food to oil, more expensive for international buyers. \nThe problem is particularly severe for emerging market countries that produce commodities, such as Russia or Brazil, whose currencies fall along with demand for their products, making it harder to service their dollar-denominated debt. \n\"The consensus now is that a September rate hike probably won't happen,\" Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management, told Bloomberg News. \n\"This means we get to keep the excessive liquidity that's been supporting markets for a little longer, so there's a feeling of relief.\" \nIn Tokyo currency trading, the dollar bought 120.28 yen up from 119.98 yen in New York. \nThe euro was stronger at 136.17 from 135.72 yen. The 19-nation euro fetched $1.1321, up from $1.1312 in US trade. \nOil also climbed after a US energy report showed a dip in crude inventories but barely any decline in production, despite a steep drop in world prices. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate was trading at $39.68, compared to to $38.60, while Brent crude was at $44.28, from $43.14.
