Now we can really start putting the strategy in place. We move from 15 employees last week to 400,\" Mr Steenackers said.\nAdvertisement The float, which raised almost $30 million, was oversubscribed three times as investors backed the company to emulate the success of bigger rival Greencross.\nGreencross listed in 2007 with a market value of about $30 million and is worth $800 million now.\nGreencross disappointed the market with an earnings downgrade earlier in 2015 but after a solid full-year result this week the stock bounced 14 per cent in a day.\n\"Greencross and NVC have a different model,\" Mr Steenackers, a former general manager of Greencross, said.\n\"We are focusing on professional services and a big portion of revenue for them is retail. I think there is space for both players.\"\nThe $30 million raised in the IPO will fund the acquisition of NVC's first 35 clinics. NVC has already settled 30 of those transactions and expects to close the remaining five by Wednesday next week.\nMr Steenackers said he was focused on integrating the businesses just acquired and driving organic growth through increasing the skills of staff.\nA core plank of NVC's strategy is to offer regular training opportunities for its vets and nurses in areas like pathology, surgery, and dental.\nThis should allow difficult procedures to stay in-house rather than being referred to non-NVC specialists and will allow nurses to take on bigger roles, freeing up the vets to do more complex tasks.\nMr Steenackers said NVC aimed to acquire one new clinic every two months in its first year and might increase that rate in 2016.\nFollowing the listing NVC is the second-biggest player in the Australian vet sector.\nMore than 60 per cent of the nation's households own a pet. The veterinary services industry in Australia is estimated to be worth $2.6 billion a year, while the pet industry is worth about $8 billion a year.\nThe float was underwritten by Shaw Stockbroking and Wilston HTM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:45:06.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
