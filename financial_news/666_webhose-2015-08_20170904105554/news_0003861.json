Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston First State Super has set aside $500 million for lending to commercial property but its chief investment officer Richard Brandweiner says the dominance of Australian banks means most of that will be lent overseas.\nFirst State Super, a major property owner in its own right with a portfolio of about $3 billion across all sectors, had been lending for property plays globally since 2008 but only started lending in Australia late last year.\nIt has been a challenging investment task for the superfund that represents 750,000 NSW public sector employees and Victorian healthcare workers.\n\"We are looking for new opportunities where we can find them, but ultimately, the Australian commercial real estate market is heavily dominated by the banks and even today there is not a lot of opportunity, so to identify opportunities in this space does mean you need to identify complexity,\" Mr Brandweiner said.\nOne of First State's latest deals involves lending to a fund manager to buy an office tower in Brisbane that is more than 90 per cent empty. First State declined to identify the fund manager because of client confidentiality but The Australian Financial Review knows it to be Forza Capital's $20 million purchase of the 13-storey, 420 George Street building .\nFirst State Super provided a three-year loan with a loan to value ratio of about 55 per cent.\nHigh risk \"That was reasonably conservative,\" Mr Brandweiner says, \"but there was quite a bit of risk associated with leasing that particular asset.\"\n \"It was slightly more complex and risky and the borrower was not able to source bank finance and that was an example of where we could get attractive rates of return and understand the risk and get it all at a decent tenor.\"\nWhilst declining to name clients First State Super also agreed to on some funding for Cromwell Property Group's bid for Morgan Stanley's Investa .\n\"For us to take the illiquidity associated with any type of debt investment we really need a return that is going to justify our ability to hold those investments on an illiquid basis, so it does mean we are pushed towards loans that are higher risk in nature. The key is getting our heads around that risk and making sure the return justifies that risk.\"\nSuch risk and complexity are where lenders such as First State Super need to be an expert. Super funds cannot leverage like the big banks so their cost of capital is a lot higher and therefore, they need a higher return hurdle to make it worthwhile lending.\n\"I think there will be more opportunities and we have tried to ensure that we have the ability to take them when they come. Nevertheless, it's a heavily bank-dominated market and I don't see that changing in the near future.\"\nAustralian expansion First State Super deliberately expanded lending into Australia last year with its mandated debt advisers Quadrant in order broaden the opportunities. Mr Brandweiner is open to lending anywhere along the capital structure but thinks the sweet spot is mezzanine or the jargon term \"stretched senior\" which is basically pushing the parameters of senior debt. It will look at loan to value ratios of up to 75 per cent.\nHe notes high-quality borrowers, such as the REITS and big private developers, are seeing the cost of funding at very low levels and that \"you would have to think at some point it would put pressure on the banks to start raising rates\".\n\"It's a wonderful time to be a borrower,\" he said.\nBut the record low cost of funding and the flood of money in quantitative easing programs has pushed yields down globally, forcing investors up the risk curve in their hunt for yield.\nDemand for property has put pressure on prices.\n\"This is the biggest issue facing a long-term investor – to what extent are valuations unsustainable?\"\nHe views the recent Morgan Stanley sale of Investa on a 5.5 per cent normalised capitalisation rate as \"not low in real terms given the low bond yields\".\n\"If interest rates and inflation stay low then that deal may not appear to be an expensive purchase.\"\n'Walking a tightrope' Mr Brandweiner likened the issue of knowing when to invest and when to sell, as \"walking a tight rope\".\nFirst State Super has just sold its newly developed 155 Clarence Street office building in Sydney for $140 million with a very low yield to the giant, open-ended German fund, Union Investment. It was a deal the fund could not turn down.\nFinally, ​Mr Brandweiner said the big picture was about \"universal ownership\". He said while looking for an appropriate return was the core fiduciary duty, it was important to be mindful of investment decisions that affected the longer term environment for which the super fund's members would retire into.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-08-12T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T16:00:04.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
