Most recently, the Tesora DBaaS Platform Enterprise Edition added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 6. \nToday, Tesora is the number one contributor to OpenStack Trove and ranks among the top 20 companies contributing to OpenStack overall as measured by Stackalytics , alongside Red Hat and other Tesora partners. This reflects the transformation of Tesora's development team to focus on the OpenStack DBaaS project. \n\"We are pleased to have an open source pioneer like Red Hat as an investor and partner,\" said Ken Rugg, founder and CEO of Tesora. \"We look forward to collaborating more closely with Red Hat to provide customers with databases on demand on OpenStack clouds.\" \n\"Red Hat's participation in Tesora's latest financing round expands on the technical and go-to-market collaboration between our companies,\" said Radhesh Balakrishnan, general manager, OpenStack, Red Hat. \"Community-powered innovation like OpenStack Trove and companies like Tesora driving this innovation forward are essential components to accelerate the adoption of OpenStack as the platform of choice for cloud infrastructure.\" \nIn addition to the investment from Red Hat , the world's leading provider of open source solutions, existing investors including LaunchCapital also participated. In June, Tesora announced investors in the initial phase of the funding round. Funds will be used to further scale Tesora sales, marketing and product development efforts. The closing of the most recent financing round brings Tesora's total financing to $14.5 million. \nAbout OpenStack Trove OpenStack Trove database as a service is transforming the way databases are provisioned and managed, to make database capacity that can be consumed on-demand. Trove lets administrators and DevOps manage multiple instances of different database management systems (DBMS), both relational and NoSQL, using a common infrastructure. This makes it much easier and faster to select and operate a database - while retaining all its capabilities - in a secure private or public cloud. The result is that routine tasks like provisioning, and managing regular administrative tasks like clustering, replication, backup and restore are handled in a simple, unified way. \nAbout Tesora \nTesora brings more than 200 years of cumulative database technology experience to the OpenStack community, helping organizations get the most from their OpenStack investment by making it easy to deliver database capacity on demand. The company is the leading contributor to the OpenStack Trove project and developer of Tesora DBaaS Platform Enterprise Edition, the first commercially-available product based on Trove.
