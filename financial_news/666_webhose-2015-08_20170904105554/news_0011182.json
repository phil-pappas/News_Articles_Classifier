A check for $5,812.64 was donated to the non-profit which is one of a few agencies in North Texas that provides \"play therapy\" for abused children. Children First provides a range of counseling services for children, adolescents and adults that have been victims of abuse.\nActs of kindness, such as this, is part of Texas Trust's 'people helping people' culture. Instead of taking a day off for a floating holiday employees donated their wages for the day to the charity. The idea originated by an employee who then rallied support from the executive team and colleagues.\n\"This is just one example of the charitable hearts of our employees,\" said Jim Minge, president of Texas Trust Credit Union . \"I am so grateful to work with people that are always looking for ways to help our community.\"\nAbout Texas Trust Credit Union\nTexas Trust, one of the largest credit unions in North Texas and the 17st largest in Texas, provides financial services that enable members to build brighter financial futures.
