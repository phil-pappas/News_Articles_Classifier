Photo: Arsineh Houspian\nLion, the nation's biggest beer company with brands including Tooheys, XXXX and James Boag, has had a 7.5 per cent slide in profits as an industry-wide drop in mainstream beer sales accelerated.\nThe company, owned by Japanese giant Kirin, also found the going tough for its dairy business as its profit slumped to $389 million for the six months to the end of March.\nKirin took full ownership of the group in late 2009 in a buyout which valued the company at $6 billion.\nLion operated a large dairy and drinks business selling brands including Dairy Farmers, Farmers Union and specialty cheeses such as Mersey Valley and South Cape.\nThose dairy business also had declining sales volumes of 19.4 per cent, largely because of the loss of some home brand milk contracts last year.\nLion chief executive Stuart Irvine said even though some consumer confidence surveys showed an improvement in sentiment, the firm had not seen any translation into higher retail spending.\nDrop in sales 'intensified' He also said the total beer market drop \"intensified\" during the six months to the end of March. Lion had about 48 per cent of Australia's total beer market.\nThe slowdown in mainstream beer consumption was a real concern for both Kirin and global conglomerate SABMiller, which paid $12 billion to buy the Foster's beer business in 2011 to take ownership of brands such as Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught.\nOfficial figures in May from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the amount of beer being drunk by Australians was at a 68-year low.\nAbout 50 years ago beer comprised 75 per cent of the alcohol market but it had shrunk to 41 per cent as drinkers switched to wine, spirits and cider, became more health conscious, and changed their habits because of drink-driving laws which meant less full-strength beer was drunk in pubs.\nMr Irvine also blamed a fall off in the amount of new products in Lion's beer business in its first half for some of the sales decline and said the pipeline of new products was stronger in the six months ended September 30, 2015, which would help the group meet its target of generating overall growth in profits for the full financial year.\nTotal sales revenue across Lion's beer, dairy and drinks business fell by 6 per cent to $2.51 billion in the six months ended March 31. Lion's volumes in beer, spirits and wine in Australia slipped by 2.8 per cent.\nLion produced solid growth from its portfolio of craft beers including Little Creatures Pale Ale. The broader craft beer market was growing at more than 20 per cent a year.\nIn March this year, Lion sold its low-margin, everyday cheese business to Canadian-owned Warrnambool Cheese & Butter for $137.5 million and had tilted its business toward higher value dairy products such as flavoured milk and yoghurt.\nMr Irvine said the dairy and drinks division was running to plan in the first year of a three-year turnaround designed to lift profits.\nMr Irvine said Lion's Dare iced coffee was now outselling Coca-Cola in the convenience channel in Australia.\nLion had a small premium wine business, with its Petaluma and Croser brands gaining market share during the six months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:15:29.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
