The company also slashed its profit guidance for its powerhouse cable networks unit. \nTime Warner reported robust earnings Wednesday, but it was still not enough to weather ESPN's warning bells. Scripps also beat Wall Street estimates, and were then beaten down in trading. When it was all said and done, the S&P Media index fell more than 6%. \nThe selloff threw into relief investors' simmering anxieties about traditional media's future profitability as ad dollars flow online to companies like Facebook ( FB ) and Google 's ( GOOGL ) YouTube, while cord-cutters leave cable TV altogether for streaming services like Netflix ( NFLX ) .

Discovery Communications, which has expanded its foreign sports TV acquisitions in the hunt for profits, was hurt by a strong dollar and said it was likely to halt its buyback. \n\"Across the board, you're seeing media companies scare investors,\" BTIG Reseach analyst Rich Greenfield told CNBC . \nThis week feels like a tipping point in the perception of old media companies. They're still profitable, but just how profitable will they be in the coming years when more people abandon linear TV and cable bundles for standalone online streaming and mobile video? \n21st Century Fox, though it topped estimates, posted a 4% decline in broadcast revenue due to lower ratings. Programming costs at Fox are tied largely to live sports -- an issue piling up at ESPN and Time Warner's TNT -- and caused operating income to decline 22% in the segment. \nTV viewership, especially among the youngest viewers advertiser desire most, is down. Way down, Nielsen estimates. And those viewers use Netflix to consume video , according to a recent survey. \n\"Netflix is stealing away audience from them,\" Mediamorph chairman Shahid Khan said in a phone interview. \"It's not directly a competition [with linear TV], but it's a competition for eyeballs.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:46:25.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
