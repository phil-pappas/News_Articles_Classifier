But his remuneration bonanza comes at a time when the institution’s 800,000 mum and dad shareholders are set to share in the bonanza.\nThe bank upped its dividend last week to $4.20 per share for the year, meaning it will pay out about $6.8 billion to its 800,000 shareholders.\nCBA launches $5b raising, posts $9b profit 2:14 Play video\nThe Commonwealth Bank has announced a $5bn capital raising as it unveiled a record $9.14bn profit.\nSky News 12 Aug 2015 Business The bank’s annual report, published today, reveals Mr Narev was rewarded for the year to June with a base wage of $2.6 million and benefits including short-term cash incentives of $1.6 million and deferred short-term incentives of $1.6 million.\nThe bank was left red-faced last week after a disastrous computer glitch saw it double-charge some accounts on the same day it announced the record profit.\nShares in the nation’s biggest bank start trading again today after going into a halt last week as the lender revealed a $5 billion capital raising — the second biggest in the nation’s history.\nShares are down 1.4 per cent — or just over $1.10.\nThe cash, which is to bolster its cash buffers to meet regulator demands in case of another financial crisis, will be raised by giving existing shareholders the chance to buy a bigger stake in the bank.\nOriginally published as Bank chief’s eye-watering salary ", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/cba-chief-ian-narev-is-paid-twice-as-much-in-a-week-as-most-australians-get-in-a-year/story-fni0dcne-1227486815552", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/cba-chief-ian-narev-is-paid-twice-as-much-in-a-week-as-most-australians-get-in-a-year/story-fnkjidjt-1227486971443?sv=f451a7b6b8e94abb3dedee3510943f4f&title=Bank+chief%26%238217%3Bs+eye-watering+salary", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/R1aTR5djp3Wxl7OuBRlnhfPSse6sDnBX/promo263613081&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/cba-chief-ian-narev-is-paid-twice-as-much-in-a-week-as-most-australians-get-in-a-year/story-fnkjidjt-1227486971443?sv=f451a7b6b8e94abb3dedee3510943f4f", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/cba-chief-ian-narev-is-paid-twice-as-much-in-a-week-as-most-australians-get-in-a-year/story-fnkjidjt-1227486971443?sv=f451a7b6b8e94abb3dedee3510943f4f&title=Bank+chief%26%238217%3Bs+eye-watering+salary", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/cba-chief-ian-narev-is-paid-twice-as-much-in-a-week-as-most-australians-get-in-a-year/story-fnkjidjt-1227486971443?sv=f451a7b6b8e94abb3dedee3510943f4f&h=Bank+chief%26%238217%3Bs+eye-watering+salary", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/cba-chief-ian-narev-is-paid-twice-as-much-in-a-week-as-most-australians-get-in-a-year/story-fnkjidjt-1227486971443?sv=f451a7b6b8e94abb3dedee3510943f4f", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Bank+chief%26%238217%3Bs+eye-watering+salary&c=THIS+bank+boss+makes+double+the+average+Australian%26%238217%3Bs+annual+salary+every+week.+And+he%26%238217%3Bs+not+even+the+country%26%238217%3Bs+highest-paid+banker.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/cba-chief-ian-narev-is-paid-twice-as-much-in-a-week-as-most-australians-get-in-a-year/story-fnkjidjt-1227486971443?sv=f451a7b6b8e94abb3dedee3510943f4f"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T22:42:39.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
