The plans call for the second reactor to be restarted in October. \nThe Sendai No. 1 reactor is scheduled to start generating power Friday and reach full capacity next month. \nAll of Japan's nearly 50 workable reactors have been offline for repairs or safety checks. Abe's government wants as many of them as possible to be put online to sustain the nation's economy, which now relies on imported energy. \nDespite the push by the government and utilities for nuclear restarts, a majority of Japanese are opposed to a return to nuclear energy. Residents near the Sendai plant are also wary of the restarts, citing potential dangers from active volcanos in the region. \nOpponents of the restarts and nuclear experts are also concerned that evacuation plans, in case of a disaster, may not work well. \nExperts also are concerned about possible glitches in a mothballed reactor that has not been used for more than four years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T08:27:48.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
