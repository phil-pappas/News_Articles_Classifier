Central Bureau of Investigation Special Judge O.P. Saini issued fresh summons to Krishnan, Augustus Ralph Marshall and two accused firms, Maxis Communications Berhad of Malaysia and Astro All Asia Networks, for December 7. The order came after the probe agency informed it that Malaysian authorities were not cooperating in the service of summons against the accused in the case. The CBI said the Indian High Commission and ministry of home affairs have tried thrice to get the summons served to Krishnan, Marshall and accused firms but did not get any positive response from them and requested the court to issue fresh summons to the accused. Former communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran and authorised representative of accused firm Chennai-based Sun Direct TV were present in the court during the hearing. The court also listed the bail application of Maran brothers and their application challenging the jurisdiction of the special 2G court to try the Aircel-Maxis deal case in which they have been summoned as accused along with others for the same date. The agency has alleged that Dayanidhi Maran used his influence to help Krishnan buy Aircel by coercing its owner Sivasankaran to part with his stake. It was alleged by Sivasankaran that Dayanidhi Maran favoured the Maxis Group in the takeover of his company. In return, he further alleged, the company made investments through Astro Network in a company stated to be owned by the Maran family.
