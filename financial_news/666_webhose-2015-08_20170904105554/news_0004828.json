Is this amongst the basis for Congress Party’s opposition to the GST? I hope the Congress party either clarifies its position or confirms Mani’s view,” he said on a Facebook post.\nConsidering Aiyar was the leading dissenter on behalf of his party, Jaitley said he has no reason to doubt that the Congress leader represents the views of his party.\nHe also took a dig at Aiyar, saying “UPA’s two eminent Finance Ministers were not struck by the wisdom that Mani Shankar Aiyar possesses”.\nJaitley had earlier said the points of dissent raised by Congress now on the tax reform legislation did not find favour with either of the two UPA Finance Ministers – P Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee.\nHe had also said that Congress may be upset with the government for “political reasons”, but it must “accept and seriously introspect” that negativism and its “obstructionist tendencies” would hurt the country and the economy.\n 05, 2015 11:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:16:41.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
