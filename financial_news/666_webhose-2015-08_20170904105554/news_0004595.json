By its simplest definition, it refers to a group of three men holding power.\nIn Twitter’s case, this powerful team could be Twitter’s ticket to recovery, what it needs to inject confidence back into the company after management set such a low bar on the company’s earnings conference call with analysts last week, according to Peck.\n“It is difficult to think of a more likely scenario,” he said.\nHis scenario puts co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey as a sort-of Twitter figurehead by maintaining his CEO role at Square, the payments company he founded in 2009, and picking up the additional role of CEO at Twitter. Twitter’s head of revenue, Adam Bain, would be promoted to chief operating officer, serving as Dorsey’s right-hand man running day-to-day operations, but not actually taking over CEO responsibilities due to a lack of experience at the helm. Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Evan Williams, would take on additional leadership roles on the board, potentially replacing Dorsey as chairman.\nTwitter has been mute on the CEO search so far, and declined to provide an update on last week’s earnings conference call. Recode’s Kara Swisher recently reported that Twitter was underwhelmed by a list of potential candidates produced by its executive search firm, Spencer Stuart, and had shifted its focus to internal candidates.\nShares of Twitter set an all-time low of $29.27 on Monday. They have pulled back about 20% since the company’s quarterly earnings report, and Peck says one of the biggest culprits has been the CEO search.\n“We think investors are questioning the current state of the CEO search and assessing the rumored parameters, wondering if Twitter is looking for a difficult-to-find CEO candidate,” he said.\nA thorough search is paramount, he said, but equally so is speed, particularly at this juncture in the company’s history and after last week’s departure of two key executives, including its head of growth, Christian Oestlien.\nRecap: Twitter stock soars, then dives after earnings\n“Without a permanent CEO in place with a clear vision and strategy, we continue to worry about a sustained ‘brain drain’ of talent (as seen so far), as well as a middle management obstruction of decisions,” Peck said in a note.\nHistory teaches us that lengthy absences of corporate leaders can weigh on company shares, morale and credibility, according to Mark Jaffe, president of executive search firm Wyatt & Jaffe. This is something that plagued Yahoo Inc. YHOO, +0.70% in 2011 before it settled on Marissa Mayer—its fifth CEO in four years -- and has long troubled Sears Holdings SHLD, +1.49% through its multiyear turnaround. Shares of Sears are down 44% over the last 12 months.\nBut Jaffe still cautions clients against too-quickly jumping back into bed with former executives -- in this case, the rehiring of Dorsey as permanent CEO. Dorsey served as CEO in the company’s early days as a startup, but was replaced by Williams, and shifted to the chairman role, after just a year.\n“It’s like saying ‘the new car died so we’re going to go back to the one we traded in before,’” Jaffe said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://recode.net/2015/07/28/adam-bain-is-soooo-nice-jack-dorseys-hamlet-act-and-other-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-twitter-ceo-search/"], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:15:10.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
