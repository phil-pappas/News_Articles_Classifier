It does still, however, employ nearly 270,000 people in 72 countries. \nStuart Gulliver, HSBC's boss, who took the helm in 2011 praised the performance of its Asian operations; \"strong revenue performance across our Asia businesses helped drive increased profits and Global Banking and Markets had a good six months\". \nHSBC is currently toying with the idea of relocating its headquarters away from the UK. The fact that its Asia business is continuing to perform strongly will add further clout to the argument for it to relocate back to Hong Kong. \nThe group expect to announce a decision by the end of the year, and stress that any change would take two years to execute. \nOn the investor call in June HSBC revealed that it expected 80% of its profit before tax in the future to come from Asia as it looks to focus on Gunagdong region of China, which it views as a new 'silk road': \"we think there is an opportunity to create another Hong Kong in Guangdong”, it said. \nToday's results also revealed a provision of just over $1.1bn (£0.7m) as regulatory settlements continue to haunt the bank. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in the bank have fallen over 8% in the last 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T09:20:00.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
