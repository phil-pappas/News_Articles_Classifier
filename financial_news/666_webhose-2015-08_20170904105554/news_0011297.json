With immediate effect, guests can book and travel throughout the combined networks of both the airlines, and enjoy convenient flight connections between India and South Africa, over Jet Airways’ Abu Dhabi gateway. Through the codeshare arrangement, Jet Airways places its marketing code on South African Airways’ flights from Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg and beyond to Cape Town and Durban. In turn, South African Airways is placing its marketing code on Jet Airways’ services between Abu Dhabi and Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.\nRaj Sivakumar , chief commercial officer, Jet Airways said, “We are delighted to expand our codeshare with South African Airways, enabling guests to enjoy seamless connectivity to several destinations in India and South Africa via Abu Dhabi. This enhanced partnership is a further demonstration of Jet Airways’ strong network that offers an unmatched connectivity between India and the rest of the world. We are confident that our partnership with South African Airways will further stimulate business and tourism between India and South Africa.”\nSylvain Bosc , chief commercial officer, SAA said, “This partnership enforces the historic commercial, political and cultural cooperation between South Africa and India, following the termination of SAA’s direct flights between South Africa and India. There is substantial potential for trade growth between our two countries and our planned partnership aims to facilitate that growth. The codeshare agreement will effectively enhance flight choices for customers, whether originating in India or Africa, thus truly bringing the world to Africa and taking Africa to the world.”\n 26, 2015 5:56 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T01:05:54.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
