The need to provide for inevitable occurrences such as death or disability and the need to provide for future expenses such as a child's education, health, income protection for the family, as well as planning for retirement do not reduce with a reduction in the growth rate of the economy. On the contrary, the importance of these needs is highlighted during difficult times,' he said. \nHe therefore urged the sales teams to take advantage of opportunities to assist clients plan adequately for their financial wellness through the companies' various wellness solutions. \nGras Savoye Limited was also awarded the Best Broker for the year while All Risk Consultancy Limited placed second. \nVarious awards were presented to back-office and support employees, who excelled in the past year. \nPeter Quarcoo of the Koforidua office emerged the Overall Best Retail Sales person for the year while the Life Corporate team of Emma Ocansey and Vida Bervell won the corporate award. \nOther winners were Daniel Doe, Best Zonal Manager and Seth Sorgah, Best Branch Manager. \nJames Baiden-Amissah, Rita Zongbil and Daniel Sackey were adjudged best workers for Life, Health and Pensions operations respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T11:32:41.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
