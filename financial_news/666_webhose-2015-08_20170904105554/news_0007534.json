He received an invitation to address the Liberal Party fundraiser twice, documents show. Anna Kucera by Ewin Hannan Lucille Keen Dyson Heydon received an invitation to a Liberal Party event twice, increasing pressure on the former High Court judge as he considers a union push to have him removed from heading the Royal Commission Into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.\nAs Justice Heydon said on Friday he would rule on the union application on Tuesday, new documents given to unions show he was sent an invitation –with a Liberal Party logo for the Sir Garfield Barwick address – on a second occasion last week.\nThe second invitation, which was attached to an email, was not initially provided to unions when Justice Heydon released correspondence between himself and the organiser of the address, Gregory Burton, on Monday. It was provided to lawyers for the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union on Thursday and to ACTU lawyers on Friday.\nCounsel for the ACTU, Robert Newlinds, SC, said the emergence of the attachment showed Justice Heydon received the invitation twice. The day after receiving the second invitation, Justice Heydon's assistant wrote to Mr Burton, saying \"if there was any possibility that the event could be described as a Liberal Party event he will be unable to give the address, at least whilst he is in the position of royal commissioner\".\nJustice Heydon was initially sent an invitation in June but he said he did not read the attachment containing the invitation. During the hearing on Friday, he did not offer any comment on the second invitation.\n'No explanation' Outside the commission, ACTU secretary Dave Oliver said the unions were told they were given all documents.\n\"We now know if this matter was heard on Monday, which was the original desire of this commission to do, it would've been done without having the full documentation before us,\" Mr Oliver said.\n \"We now know he has received [the invitation] twice. We have no explanation on why the second invitation has been ignored. It may be an oversight on one occasion, but now we have no explanation for the second occasion.\"\nMr Oliver said he had a different view from Labor leader Bill Shorten who said on Thursday he would not object to the commission continuing under a new commissioner should Justice Heydon step aside. Mr Shorten maintained the commission was a politically-motivated witch-hunt.\nMr Oliver said the commission should be closed down. ''We are now calling on Tony Abbott to shut this farce down,\" he said.\nUnions have asked Justice Heydon to recuse himself and resign his commission on the grounds that he was unable to afford any union, or any person associated with any union, procedural fairness as a result of his apprehended bias.\nUnions said the legal test means a judge would be disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to resolving the question the judge is required to decide.\nMr Newlinds told Justice Heydon that a hypothetical observer would be \"horrified\" that the commission had tried to bring on the case on Monday while saying all documents had been provided when they had not.\n\"You've got to be confident when you tell someone that they've got all the documents and you were wrong when you told me that and there's no explanation for how that could have happened,\" he said.\n'Disquiet' possible Mr Newlinds said Justice Heydon's conduct was enough to cause disquiet in a lay observer that he might be partisan against the Labor Party.\nThe ACTU submission says it was not possible for the fair-minded lay observer to rule out a sense that Justice Heydon \"might have a persuasion towards the Liberal Party and thereby might harbour a prejudice to the Labor Party\".\nMr Newlinds said if the commission's recommendations were to be used to change the law \"it has to have credibility, it has to be unimpeachable and it can't be allowed to happen that people can just walk around after reform and say 'don't worry about that report, that was old Mr Heydon and he was biased' \".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T09:01:50.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
