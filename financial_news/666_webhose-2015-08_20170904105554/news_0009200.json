Michael Carter, jointly liable to pay the $148.2 million.\nDeutsche Bank AG, Murdock's main bank, was held not liable because it did not knowingly participate in activity that led to Murdock's own liability.\nDole declined immediate comment on behalf the company, Murdock and Carter. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment. Stuart Grant, a lawyer for the objecting shareholders, was not immediately available for comment.\nWhile most large U.S. corporate mergers are challenged in court, Thursday's decision is among the largest in a class action lawsuit claiming that the selling company accepted too low a price.\nDole went private after shareholders narrowly approved an agreement under which Murdock paid $13.50 per share for the 60 percent of the Westlake Village, California-based company that he did not already own.\nDole had floated its shares in an initial public offering four years earlier, also under Murdock's leadership. Laster said the $148.2 million was equal to about $2.74 per share.\nForbes magazine on Thursday said Murdock is worth $3.4 billion.\nThe cases are In re: Dole Food Co Inc Stockholder Litigation and In re: Appraisal of Dole Food Co Inc, Delaware Chancery Court, Nos. 8703, 9079.
