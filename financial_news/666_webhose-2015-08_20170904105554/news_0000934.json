Other disputes in relation to royalties remain to be resolved.\nJustice James Edelman ruled in the Federal Court on Friday that the Chinese company's right to use the port terminal remains intact, which underpins Citic's export program.\nMineralogy has also been permanently restrained from acting on termination notices - allegations Citic was in breach of contractual obligations - which it has issued to Citic.\nRights and risk Mr Palmer originally sold Citic 2 billion tonnes of unearthed magnetite for $US415 million plus royalties, while retaining the underlying tenement rights. Observers have noted that this allowed him to outsource the risk of the project (construction blowouts, delays etc), while retaining control over the underlying minerals.\nThe trial, heard in Perth in June, was concerned with who has the right to access and operate key infrastructure at the Pilbara project, which is built on mineral rights controlled by Mineralogy and massive infrastructure investment from Citic.\nMr Palmer's legal team unsuccessfully argued that any rights Citic had to operate the export facility were derived from Mineralogy, which holds the mining leases.\n Justice Edelman ruled on Friday that the termination notices sent by Mineralogy to Citic \"did not allege any genuine breach\".\n\"The termination notices were issued as a lever for future commercial negotiations and they were not issued in good faith,\" Justice Edelman said.\nRoyalties The long running disharmony between the parties results, in part, from a dispute over royalty payments.\nMr Palmer previously won a ruling forcing Citic to pay the so-called \"royalty A\" on partly processed ore.\nBut Citic is able to export ore to China without immediately compensating Mineralogy for the \"royalty B\" payment until the courts work out how to calculate it in separate proceedings.\nThe royalty contract is in dispute because the ore price originally used to calculate the figure no longer applies.\nDespite the court win, the Sino Iron project has proven problematic for the Chinese-owned company, which has suffered massive delays and cost blow-outs.\nThis is partly because Citic's original cost forecasts relied on it bringing in Chinese labour to construct the project. This didn't – and according to Australian law, couldn't – occur.\nThe Federal Court trial attracted the attention of the West Australian government. A government representative told the court that the government had an interest in ensuring the project was \"executed\", as a state agreement.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/barrett_ink", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/111791755610985370077"], "published": "2015-08-14T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:15:02.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
