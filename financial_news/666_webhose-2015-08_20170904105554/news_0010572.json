Anyone who’s seen his band, Foals, in concert will recognize this state of affairs. “Total Life Forever,” the title of the British indie band’s second album (2010), has proved an accurate summation of the intensity they bring to stage and sound room.\nThe five-piece group’s fourth album, “What Went Down,” comes out Aug. 28. Mr. Philippakis is, he admits, overwhelmed by a certain sense of helplessness ahead of the launch.\n“There’s that old cliché about it being your child, but it’s true. You try to dress it, keep it fed, make sure it’s respectable—and then you send it out into the world,” the 29-year-old lead singer says. “And that’s where we are, at that terrifying juncture. It’s also exciting and exhilarating, because even though you may try not to, you expect this reciprocal energy to come back at you.”\nMore on Music Radkey: A Band of Brothers Proving They’re More Than a Rock Anomaly Gregg Allman Plans His Solo Future Amy Helm Talks About Her Debut Solo Album Jason Isbell Lightens Up—A Little When Foals first hit the scene in 2008, the band’s confessional, existential songs were regarded by some critics as overly cerebral and their music—its expansive sonic landscapes influenced by bands such as Pink Floyd and Radiohead—was dismissively filed under “math rock.” A niche subgenre whose leading lights include American bands Slint, Shellac and Battles, math rock’s shifting time signatures, taut rhythms and earsplitting amplification appeal more to the head than the heart.\nTwo years later, however, the band’s second effort, “Total Life Forever,” was nominated for the Mercury Prize, which recognizes Britain’s best album of the year. Their third album, “Holy Fire,” also received a nomination. Mr. Philippakis’s apocalyptic, self-lacerating lyrics, and live shows that have the atmosphere of a revivalist meeting have made the band one of British rock’s most compelling propositions.\nENLARGE Foals’ new album, 'What Went Down,' balances infectious pop melody with complex experimentalism. Recorded in St.-Rémy-de-Provence, France, where almost 130 years ago Vincent van Gogh was hospitalized after slicing off his ear, “What Went Down” seems to take its cue from the artist’s life. Pastoral beauty coexists with psychological torment on its 10 tracks.\nOn songs such as “Birch Tree” and “London Thunder,” crashing percussion and squalling guitars give way to moments of intense stillness. The songs balance infectious pop melody with complex experimentalism and lyrics that address issues such as mortality, fidelity, love and loss.\n“I’m sure the isolation of the studio led to a focus that created the sonic intensity you hear,” says Ben Durling, A&R manager at Warner Bros. Records, the band’s label. “Plus they’re incredibly close-knit as a band. Yannis has tremendous drive and creative motivation. The band trusts his judgment implicitly.” Formed a decade ago in Oxford, the band includes Jimmy Smith, Edwin Congreave, Walter Gervers and Jack Bevan.\nFor Mr. Philippakis, the overriding aim was to realize the vision he had in his head for the album. “In the past, the lyrics have always been at the mercy of the instruments. And often, what that’s made me feel is that I’ve never quite honored what I’d intended to say,” he says. “This is the first time I’ve felt like the lyrics haven’t been tethered to that.”\n‘ I’m sure the isolation of the studio led to a focus that created the sonic intensity you hear ’\n—Ben Durling, A&R manager at Warner Bros. Records In “Albatross,” which Mr. Philippakis says is “the clearest distillation of me,” the music matches the lyrics for brute force as the singer details his exasperation with himself. “You’ve got a pile of broken wishbones under your bed,” he sings. “You’ve got a hungry green-eyed monster that you keep fed.” This song isn’t cerebral: it’s visceral. When, on “A Knife in the Ocean,” that anger is turned outward, he exclaims: “When I come to walk the line, the fire it comes, but I’ll be just fine.”\nIn the pub, Mr. Philippakis has the look of someone ready to do battle again. “The picture I had in my head was of this huge, foreboding mass,” he says of the period when the band began writing the new album. “My task was to wrestle that into shape. I think, with this record, that we’ve proved we were up for that fight.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KA807_2FOALS_12S_20150827102326.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KA807_2FOALS_8S_20150827102326.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-27T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:16:38.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
