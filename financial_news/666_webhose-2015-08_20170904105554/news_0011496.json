According to the researchers the suggestion that sexual side effects appear early in the first six months of therapy and then return to baseline is inaccurate.\n“The mechanism of dysfunction is likely multifactorial, related both to the direct decrease in 5a-DHT and direct influence on central and peripheral nerves,” said Traish.\nIn addition to sexual side effects, there has been some investigation into whether 5a-RIs can be used for prostate cancer chemo-prevention, but the researchers found the data to be inconclusive.\nThey also believe the potential for cardiovascular side effects of therapy to warrant further investigation.\n“Inhibition of 5a-R activity may potentiate insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, vascular disease and osteoporosis, but studies have not been definitive,” said Traish.\n“The investigation into psychiatric side effects of 5a-RIs has been limited, but some case series describe increased depression and anxiety symptoms among patients on the medication,” he added.\nThe findings were published in the journal Endocrine Reviews and Metabolic Disorders.\n 26, 2015 2:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T01:13:55.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
