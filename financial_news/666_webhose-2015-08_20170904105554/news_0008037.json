It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has indicated that a further $400m can be trimmed from costs in the next 12 months after already saving $392m in 2014. \nIts strong position in high-grade copper production should also allow the company to rebound faster than many of its rivals. Although copper prices have been hammered this year it remains one of the most valuable assets long term for miners due to expected changes in China’s economy that will require more sophisticated raw materials in the future. \nAlthough copper prices have fallen to a six-year low below $5,000 per ton many analysts expect it to be the first base metal to recover. \n• Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Glencore tumble as commodities rout hits \nThe company’s share price is worrying but some analysts blame the recent sell off in Glencore stock on investors pricing a potential downgrade of high-yield debt, which Mr Glasenberg will strive to avoid at all costs. \nCertainly, the view within the company is that he has more than enough levers that he can still pull to reduce its net debt pool below $29.5bn and also contend with the prospect of higher financing costs which could follow an increase in US interest rates. \nDespite the concerns over the company’s share price and its debt position, Mr Glasenberg is probably right to hold his long-term bet on China’s economy continuing raw material needs. \nGlencore’s balance sheet has enough flexibility to cope with the current downturn. And, while the current downturn in commodties prices will undoubtedly claim its victims, there is no reason to think that Glencore or Mr Glasenberg will be among them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T21:28:07.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
