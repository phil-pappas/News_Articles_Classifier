An all-cash bid would be very attractive to SIR shareholders and the value of both companies [SIR/IGO] have reduced since the initial bid.\"\nNickel has been one of the worst performing commodities of 2015, with prices sliding by 29 per cent since January 1.\nThe equation is even worse on a 15 month time-frame, during which nickel prices have halved to the current price around $US10,625 a tonne.\nFalls in all commodities have taken their toll on Glencore's finances, and there were reports earlier this week that activist shareholder Harris Associates had bought more than 1 per cent of Glencore shares.\nBy Tuesday morning Harris Associates stake was revealed to be 4.5 per cent, making it the fourth largest shareholder in Glencore.\nBut chief investment officer for Harris Associates David Herro said the investment was designed to secure long-term value while prices were low, rather than being an \"activist\" play.\nGlencore will announce full year profit results on Wednesday.\nSirius shares were 8 cents lower at $2.61 on Tuesday while Independence shares were 10 cents lower at $3.16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T09:49:40.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
