The Nasdaq composite dropped 19.76 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,506.49.\nDisappointment in Wall Street was not reflected by investors in Europe, where markets recovered almost all their losses from Monday. Germany's DAX jumped 4.3 percent, while the CAC-40 in France rose 3.9 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 2.6 percent.\nThe initial global rally came on news that Beijing had cut borrowing costs. Hours after China's Shanghai stock index slumped to close 7.6 percent lower — adding to Monday's 8.5 percent loss and taking the benchmark to its lowest level since Dec. 15 — the central bank swung into action.\nChina cut its interest rates for fifth time in nine months in a renewed effort to shore up economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. The central bank said the benchmark rate for a one-year loan will be cut by 0.25 percentage points to 4.6 percent and the one-year rate for deposits will fall by a similar margin to 1.75 percent.\nThe bank also increased the amount of money available for lending by reducing the minimum reserves banks are required to hold by 0.5 percentage points.\nThe move came as Beijing appeared to be abandoning a strategy of having a state-owned company buy shares to stem the market slide. There have been no signs of large-scale purchases by the China Securities Finance Corp. during the past week.\n“The fear is that the Chinese economy is slowing at an alarming pace and that the domestic policy makers have fallen well behind the curve,” said an analyst at Credit Agricole CIB in a report.\nTokyo's Nikkei 225 earlier closed down 4 percent after sliding 4.6 percent Monday.\nBut other markets in Asia posted modest recoveries. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose or 0.7 percent, while Sydney's S&P ASX 200 gained 2.7 percent; Seoul's Kospi index and Singapore's Straits Times index also rose.\nWall Street had a stomach-churning day Monday, when the Dow plunged more than 1,000 points at one point before finishing down 588.40 points, or 3.6 percent, at 15,871.35. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 77.68 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,893.21, and is now in “correction” territory, Wall Street jargon for a drop of at least 10 percent from a recent peak. The last market correction was nearly four years ago.\nAn initial rally Tuesday turned in the afternoon amid lingering concerns over that the slowdown in China could hobble global growth despite the Chinese central bank move.\n(It's) just investor confusion,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. \"They are trying to figure out what the slowdown in China means to the global economy,\" he said.\nAl Jazeera and wire services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T23:59:48.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
