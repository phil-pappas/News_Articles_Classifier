They all have the same content,\" said Tonje Bakang, one of Afrostream's co-founders, who was born in France to Cameroonian parents. \nHe argues that success will come from taking a different approach to the big players like Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) and Amazon. \nCompetition, however, is already fierce. \nNigeria's iRokoTV, which is well-established across the continent, pioneered the sector in 2010 before being followed by other subscription services such as Kenya's BuniTV and South Africa's Africa Magic Go. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's good news -- the more players there are, the quicker the market will establish itself,\" said Bakang, adding that he ultimately wants to fund his own productions \"in the style of HBO\". \nAfrostream has already attracted 2,000 subscribers ahead of its launch in September. It has focused its marketing on Senegal and Ivory Coast, and their French-speaking diaspora in Europe, but has big plans for expansion. \n\"Although the European market remains important for us with 15 million African descendants and 10 million more fans of 'afro' culture, we know that the real market is in Africa, where there's a middle class of 300 million people,\" said Bakang. \nAfrostream got support from French telecom giant Orange (Taiwan OTC: 4554.TWO - news ) and is currently raising cash at the renowned San Francisco start-up hub, Y Combinator. \n- Reliance on Nollywood - \nWith elegant, easy-to-use websites and the latest video-playing technology, these new services have nothing to envy in comparison with their Western competitors. \nBut they still face a number of challenges, not least of which is their heavy reliance on Nollywood, which means they may struggle to meet the varied tastes of 54 African countries. \n\"Nigeria might have a real film and TV industry, but it's far from the case everywhere,\" said Jean-Michel Huet, an emerging markets specialist at consultancy Bearing Point. \nAnd while the number of smartphones in Africa is set to double in the next two years to more than 350 million subscribers, the rarity of high-speed Internet access remains a brake on the spread of VOD services. Punching credit card details into a website, meantime, is not yet the norm in many parts of the continent. \nThere is also the threat that the big hitters could muscle in at any time. \nNetflix aims to be available everywhere in the world by 2016, and France's Canalplay has made Africa a strategic priority. \n\"With a budget of $5 billion for acquiring rights, Netflix can say: 'I will set aside $100 million for African films' if they see that the market works,\" said Lechevallier. \n\"And then the new platforms won't be able to compete.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T08:58:48.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
