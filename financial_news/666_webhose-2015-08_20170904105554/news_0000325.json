Mr Perreault said the investment was \"extremely consistent with the commercialisation strategy.\"\n\"[The development of the new drugs] has been an effort that has been going on for a number of years and to see them now coming to fruition and to have both of these products in front of the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] for approval is extremely exciting,\" Mr Perreault told reporters after the company's full-year results on Wednesday.\nTo prepare for the launch of recombinant factor 9 in the second half of 2015-16 and recombinant factor 8 after that, CSL recently began building its new $US500 million plant in Switzerland. Recombinant factor 9 reduces the numbers of times haemophilia B sufferers have to inject themselves with the therapy from two to three times a week to weekly or fortnightly.\nThe company also recently worked on a new facility in Melbourne to manufacture albumin, which is used to treat burns and trauma victims.\n\"There is major investment in our facilities going on all across the world,\" Mr Perreault said of CSL's plants in Australia, Germany, Switzerland and the United States.\n\"We will see a significant lift in fixed asset depreciation as our new manufacturing facilities have come on line to support the increases in demand of our new and existing products,\" Mr Perreault said.\n\"These investments represent about 2 per cent of our profit growth that we're reinvesting in the business.\"\n The increased investment will limit net profit growth to about 5 per cent on a constant currency basis over 2015-16, excluding any costs or benefits from the $47 billion company's recent acquisition of Novartis' influenza vaccine business.\nInvestors initially dumped shares in CSL in response to the slowing profit growth. The stock fell as much as 6 per cent in the opening minutes of trade on Wednesday, although the stock soon recovered to trade about 1.4 per cent lower to $93.75.\nCSL shares pierced the $100 mark last week, prompting some investors to wonder whether the biotechnology giant would embark on a stock split like it did in 2007. Mr Perreault said although the board would consider a split, it was not a priority.\nSplits are seen as a way to entice more retail shareholders, but Mr Perreault said CSL's share register showed that it was not too expensive for mum and dad investors.\n\"As CSL has continued to grow the share price we have increased retail shareholders,\" he said. \"It hasn't stopped anybody from buying. We went from 90,000 to 120,000 retail shareholders over the past couple of years.\"\nCurrency fluctuations and one-off costs linked to its influenza vaccine expansion limited its profit growth to 5.5 per cent, with the measure hitting $US1.38 billion ($1.9 billion), but falling short of market expectations of $US1.41 billion.\nAdding back in $US22 million of one-off costs because of the purchase of Novartis' flu business and working in constant currency, net profit rose 10 per cent, which was in line with guidance.\nSales for the blood plasma product and vaccine maker in the 12 months ended June 30 rose 2.3 per cent to $US5.5 billion, from the year-earlier $US5.33 billion. The average estimate among analysts was for sales of $US5.79 billion, according to Bloomberg.\nThe blood plasma business CSL Behring reported 7 per cent sales growth in constant currency terms to $US5.0 billion. Within that business the immunoglobulin division delivered almost half of those sales, with revenue of $US2.3 billion.\nSales of albumin rose 12 per cent to $US754 million, boosted by China where CSL has expanded outside of the biggest cities.\nThe haemophilia division reported lacklustre growth of 3 per cent to $US1.0 billion, although that was an improvement on the 4 per cent in sales in the prior year.\nMr Perreault said CSL would guide the market \"over the next couple of months\" on what impact the flu business would have in 2015-16.\n\"We will have some sales, but it also means we have a lot more expenses,\" he said.\nThe acquired influenza vaccine division from Novartis will combine with CSL's bioCSL division to create Sequris, which will be the second largest player in the $US4 billion market.\n\"As you might expect from CSL we have aspirations for leadership in this sector,\" he said.\nFor the full wrap of today's earnings, visit the AFR reporting season blog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:10:37.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
