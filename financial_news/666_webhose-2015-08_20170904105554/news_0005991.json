If anything it kind of proves the case: … it’s not paying out when you don’t need it to,” said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, a U.K. online platform for trading physical gold and silver. \nGold prices shed nearly 6% by the end of last month after the precious metal tumbled to a five-and-a-half-year low at $1,077.40 a troy ounce on July 24. \nBut searches for ‘buy gold’ have jumped almost 30% since June, according to Google Trends data, and are approaching levels not seen since April 2013. \nThe U.S. Mint reported a jump in gold coin purchases. It sold 170,000 ounces of American Eagle gold coins in July, the largest volume for a single month since April 2013. \nBullionVault said July 24 was its heaviest day’s trading since October 2014, and one of its best days ever for opening new accounts. \nThis wave of gold-buying by retail investors runs counter to the broader trend, in which many other types of investors are rushing to jettison their gold investments. \nThe largest gold Exchange-Traded Fund, SPDR, saw outflows of $263 million in the week to August 3. Analysts said this is a different phenomenon: ETF investors are looking for financial returns and not physical investments, and are quicker to ditch their holdings when the price tanks.
