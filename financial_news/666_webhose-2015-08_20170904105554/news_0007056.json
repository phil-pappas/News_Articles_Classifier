(Submitted photo) Top Projects: LPM Apartments By: Elizabeth Millard August 13, 2015 7:04 am 0 \nAddress : 1369 Spruce Place, Minneapolis \nProject cost : $86.3 million \nProject size : 36-story, 354-unit tower with retail space \nOwner : Magellan Development Group LLC \nContractor : Adolfson & Peterson Construction; McHugh Construction \nArchitect : Loewenberg Associates \nEngineers : Magnusson Klemencic Associates \nEditor’s note: This is the 12th installment in Finance & Commerce’s Top Projects Series of 2014. Previous installments are available here . \nAlthough the LPM Apartments tower offers considerable space in its rental units and on its amenities floor, that doesn’t mean there was much room during construction. \nLocated in the Loring Park area of Minneapolis, the building came up to property lines on every side, which means there was no room for staging, storage of construction materials, or parking for construction personnel. \n“Logistically, this one was a nightmare,” said Tim Clark of St. Louis Park-based Adolfson & Peterson Construction. “Thankfully, we had very patient and cooperative neighbors surrounding the project. Without that, we would have had a lot of problems.” \nThe site also offered challenges in terms of foundation options, he said. Since the project was in a residential area — despite being on the edge of downtown — the construction team didn’t want to use noisy, earth-rumbling pilings, so they opted for numerous caissons instead. The result was a strong foundation that could be installed relatively quietly and quickly. \nIn fact, everything seemed to be put in place quickly, Clark recalled. \n“It was amazing how fast this project went up,” he said. “Once we got our systems in place, we were adding a new floor every three days.” \nThe project broke ground in October 2012, and the first occupants started moving in almost exactly two years later, he said. \nIn addition to construction speed, Clark also appreciates the extensive amenities of the building, which he feels set the project apart. The 41,000-square-foot amenity space includes a fully outfitted fitness center, lap pool, game room, resident lounge and business center. There’s even a dog play room with washing stations. \nEvery apartment has large glass windows for exterior views of the downtown area, including glass-paneled balconies, he said. \n“The building is pretty spectacular, which explains why we had people moving in while we were still finishing construction,” he said. “That was another minor challenge, but everyone, from the project team to the new residents, was excited about how the building took shape.
