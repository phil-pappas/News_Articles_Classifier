It runs Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) as a public monopoly for importing crude oil for the domestic market; and it is also responsible for setting of petroleum prices. \nUnder deregulation Government involvement would cease except to ensure a level playing field is created for stakeholders to efficiently and effectively undertake their activities under the deregulated market environment. \nUnder deregulated regime the private sector would participate in the importation of petroleum product and crude oil for processing at TOR at a fee; and also in the provision of privately owned and operated energy infrastructure and services in the petroleum downstream sector. \nGovernment would no longer be directly involved in the determination of petroleum prices; \nA petroleum priced determination mechanism (a prescribed pricing formula) would be used to determine the ex-refinery price of petroleum products based on import parity benchmark. \nThe OMCs/Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers operating margin would be managed in the initial phase of the programme and thereafter they would set their own margins and ex-pump prices for effective competition among themselves. \nParliament would continue to determine the petroleum taxes and levies by the issuance of an Act of Parliament. \nThe deregulation of the petroleum downstream sector is essentially government decision which was approved by the Parliament of Ghana as part of the 2004 budget. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:08:27.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
