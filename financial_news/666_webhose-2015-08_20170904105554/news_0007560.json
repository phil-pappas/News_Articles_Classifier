On the list are a few surprises, with North Carolina holding four of the 10 spots. According to a study done by Bankrate, a consumer financial services company, 20-year old drivers pay between 39%-49% more than 25-year old drivers. Add to that the often expensive parking permits most universities require and bringing a car to college can be an intimidating prospect for a student and their family. The Zebra conducted an analysis to determine the colleges where having a car on campus is less of a financial burden.\nTo find these results, The Zebra started with a list of the top 100 U.S. colleges by population. Using the corresponding zip codes of each college town, they determined the average cost of an insurance premium based on the profiles of a male and female, between the ages of 18-21, driving a 2009 Honda Civic DX. The current gas price of each town was then calculated at a rate of 10,000 miles a year to determine an annual average, and the price of each university’s basic student parking permits was taken into account.\nThe annual costs of the 10 most affordable colleges for student drivers, listed from 1-10:\n1. East Carolina University, Greenville, NC\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $1,547\n2. North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $1,579\n3. Iowa State University, Ames, IA\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $1,789\n4. University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $1,790\n5. James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $1,878\n6. University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $1,908\n7. University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $1,934\n8. University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $2,092\n9. Penn State University, State College, PA\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $2,131\n10. California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA\nAnnual Cost of Bringing Your Car to School: $2,297\nThe Zebra’s analysis also identified the top 10 most expensive colleges to bring a car to campus. The results ranked from one to 10 (with one being the most expensive) were New York University, University Of Delaware, Western Michigan University, Florida International University, Temple University, University Of Michigan, Central Michigan University, Michigan State University, Grand Valley State University, and University Of South Florida.\nFor more information on the study, visit: https://Quote: d.thezebra.com/1908/most-car-friendly-colleges/\nAbout The Zebra\nThe Zebra is a licensed digital insurance agency boasting the most comprehensive real-time car insurance comparison platform in the country.
