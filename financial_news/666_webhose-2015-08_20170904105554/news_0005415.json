You have the good and the bad but as a public sector banker, I would look at it as a beginning of the reform,\" she added.\n\nOn the government's decision to appoint two private sector executives as new heads of state-run Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank, Ananthasubramanian said, \"It is an experiment. From a routine, there is a kind of a disturbance happening, but let us see if the disturbance is for good.\"\n\n\"Nobody has said it is successful or not successful. Time will tell, maybe it is kind of an experiment and we have to wait and see,\" she added.\n\nStating that public sector banks do not have a culture of sales and service, she said, \"Every public sector bank has to transform itself. It's a transformation process where they need to change and become a sales and service organisation.\"\n\nOn the issue of setting up of a Bank Board Bureau (BBB) by the government, the PNB CEO said, \"We need to have professionals running the board and it will make a difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T18:05:42.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
