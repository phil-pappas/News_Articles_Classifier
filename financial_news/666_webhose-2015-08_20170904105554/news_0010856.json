Louie Douvis Share on twitter by James Thomson Kerry Stokes has been rightly lauded for his impeccable business timing over his remarkable career.\nHe picked the right time to get into the media in the late 1970s, and then picked the right time to at least partly cash out when debt-fuelled private equity firms were throwing silly amounts of cash in 2007.\nSimilarly, it was way back in 1989 when Stokes got into the mining sector via his heavy equipment business WesTrac, which now owns the right to distribute Caterpillar heavy equipment in Western Australia and parts of China. This was way before the China boom was a twinkle in anyone's eye and when it came, Stokes was perfectly positioned.\nBut Wednesday's results from Seven Group suggest the timing of the business cycle no longer runs in the company's favour. And the bad news for new chief executive, Kerry's son, Ryan, is that it's not likely to improve quickly.\nSeven Group's full-year results. The company swung to a full-year net loss of $359.1 million from the year-earlier profit of $262.5 million, mainly because of non-cash impairments. Underlying profit fell 19 per cent to $204.3 million in the year which ended on June 30 from the prior $253.2 million.\nThat, of course, is not a huge surprise, given what we know about the companies two major segments – mining and media.\nSeven Group's contribution from its media assets, held in the separate vehicle Seven West Media, fell sharply. SWM has written close to $2 billion off the value of its television licences, and naturally some of this flowed through to the Seven Group result.\nAdvertising fall The write-downs, and the deterioration of advertising sales in both television and newspapers, pushed the media business to a statutory loss of $290.4 million, a big swing from last year's $60.9 million profit.\nThe results from the WesTrac division were not exactly pretty either.\nWesTrac China posted a statutory loss of $214.1 million, compared with last year's profit of $19.6 million, and took $237.6 million of impairments.\nWesTrac Australia statutory earnings fell to $161.3 million from the $198.2 million the year earlier. The end of the mining construction boom weighed on equipment sales (down 42 per cent, or more than $500 million in the year), although parts and maintenance revenue rose 13 per cent as miners tried to get more out of older machines.\nAt least WesTrac Australia was in the black. Five of the group's six key segments – WesTrac China, industrial businesses AllightSykes and Coates Hire, the media division, and the energy division – all reported statutory losses.\nClearly, the picture is better on an underlying basis, which strips out significant items including restructuring costs, losses and gains of the sale of investments and more than $908 million worth of impairments.\nBut these items do underline the tough trading conditions Seven Group is operating in.\nThis was rammed home by the younger Stoke's outlook statement – underlying earnings are set to fall 10 per cent in 2016, and could fall further if trading conditions deteriorate.\nAgain, this is not a shock and investors seemed actually pleased that the outlook wasn't worse – Seven Group shares rose as much as 4 per cent in early trade.\nNot a pretty picture But it's not a pretty picture.\nThe mining boom is over, and there are few expansion projects on the book. The focus on cost cutting in the sector will keep parts and maintenance revenue growing strongly, but this cannot offset equipment sales.\nIn China, the hoped-for shift to a consumption-led economy from one that is led by construction, will weigh heavily on growth.\nIn the media, Seven remains top dog in the world of TV, but finding growth given the current state of the domestic economy will obviously be difficult.\nStokes is clearly working hard to make cuts to suit conditions. He's slashing headcount in some businesses, restructuring where possible and lifting sales efforts. It's going to be hard, grinding work for the most part.\nThe best hope for a bit of old-fashioned Stokes family investment magic might be in the company's energy business.\nStokes, who took over the top job on July 1, is bullish, and he sees Seven as well placed for the coming boom in demand for gas on Australia's east coast. But the business remains in its infancy, and shareholders won't see major benefits until the oil price lifts.\nThere is also much speculation about whether Seven will look to use its stakes in listed oil and gas minnows Beach Energy and DrillSearch to drive more consolidation in the sector.\nStokes continues to push the rationale of the pair coming together, but with the oil price and share prices in the sector still dropping, Seven will want to get the timing of any move on the pair just right.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-08-26T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:08:55.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
