The SEC sometimes lets the Omaha, Nebraska-based company delay disclosures of new stakes so Buffett can build them quietly, rather than have investors piggyback on him before he finishes. \nFriday's filing suggests that only a small percentage of the $3.09 billion of stock that Berkshire bought in the quarter went to companies it already owned. \nBerkshire held 8.51 million shares of Charter worth $1.46 billion on June 30, up from 5.98 million shares on March 31. \nIt also confirmed its purchase of 20 million shares, or 8.7 percent, of paint maker Axalta Coating Systems Ltd from controlling shareholder Carlyle Group LP. \nBerkshire reported lower stakes in conglomerate Chicago Bridge & Iron Co, media company Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc, which sells braking and suspension systems for commercial vehicles. \nIt swapped most of what was once a much larger Phillips 66 stake for a chemicals business in February 2014. \nFriday's filing did not disclose who made which Berkshire investments. Smaller investments are often made by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may eventually succeed Buffett as chief investment officers. \nCombs invested in Precision Castparts before Berkshire said on Monday it would buy the aerospace parts maker. The transaction valued that company at $32.3 billion. \nOther prominent investors such as Jana Partners and Davis Selected advisers bought Precision Castparts during the quarter. \nWells Fargo & Co remained Berkshire's biggest stock holding. \nKraft Heinz Co became Berkshire's second-biggest holding last month, when H.J. Heinz Co bought Kraft Foods Group Inc. That transformed Berkshire's 52.5 percent stake in Heinz into a 26.9 percent stake in Kraft Heinz. \nBerkshire owns more than 80 businesses, including the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance. Buffett, who turns 85 on Aug. 30 has run Berkshire for 50 years. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler; editing by James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T01:03:21.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
