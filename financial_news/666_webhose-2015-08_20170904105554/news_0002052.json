UGE also will launch service on Dec. 9 at the Kalamazoo airport in Michigan in conjunction with new United Express flights there.\nEnvoy in May decided it would only perform ground services for flights scheduled by its parent company, and it will begin transitioning work to UGE in September, a source familiar with Envoy's business said.\nUnited's move comes six months after it reached a union deal to outsource some 1,150 positions at 16 airports across the country. It had said furloughs or layoffs could result if affected workers declined offers to transfer to other airports.\nUnited spokesman Charles Hobart declined to say if the launch of UGE was related to the airline's earlier outsourcing plan. However, he said furloughed and former United employees could apply to work for UGE.\nThe shuffle has helped lower costs significantly at the second-biggest U.S. airline by capacity. Then-Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said on an investor call last month that United saved $350 million in non-fuel costs so far this year, and was on track to reach $1 billion in annual non-fuel cost savings by the end of 2016, a year before initial expectations.\nHobart said UGE \"will provide cost-effective operations at traditionally outsourced locations.\"\nThe airline will continue to rely on third parties for ground-handling where it makes financial and logistical sense, he said.\nRivals Delta Air Lines Inc and American launched similar services years ago. American formed AMR Services Corporation in 1983 and sold that business in 1999. Delta still owns subsidiary DAL Global Services.\nAviation industry consultant Robert Mann said the move could help United address conflicts of interest inherent in outsourcing, in which a third party might offer privileged service to its parent company or largest customer rather than United Express.\nThe ground-handling business, he added, \"can be very profitable, but you have to run it efficiently and somewhat ruthlessly.\" (Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Chris Reese )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:05:23.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
