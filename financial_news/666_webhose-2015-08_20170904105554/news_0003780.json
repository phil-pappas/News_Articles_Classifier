Borrowing cheaply and delivering stable rental income will generate profits, while the value of the property portfolio increases all of which Derwent is currently doing. \nThe company let a record 323,000 sq ft of space in the first half, more than triple the 90,000 sq ft let in the same period last year. Rental income increased by 5pc during the first half to £67m. But rising property values outpaced rents and the portfolio yield was compressed to 4.6pc, from 5pc at the same stage last year. \nThe property group took advantage of record low interest rates to refinance its debt pile. Net debt fell by £137m to £876m at the end of June and the average maturity of its debt was increased slightly to 7.4 years. The loan-to-value ratio which is a key measure of risk in property investment fell to 18.6pc, from 24pc at June last year. \n= Developing returns = \nChief executive Mr Burns said that he remained confident of the London market and increased the rental growth targets to between 8pc and 10pc, from between 6pc and 8pc. \nThe company has plenty of room to grow the portfolio as it embarks on a phase of significant new building. \nThe largest project, the White Collar Factory, with 293,000 sq ft of new offices, is located at London’s “silicon roundabout” where a cluster of technology start-ups is based and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. The property is already 24pc pre-let ahead of completion. \n= Property cycles = \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Derwent London have enjoyed a strong year so far and easily beat the wider FTSE 250 which is up just 9pc over the same period. \nThe performance follows a stellar five-year period during which the shares have more than tripled in value from lows of about £8 in early 2009. \nThe shares now trade on an eye-watering forecast price earnings ratio of 58 times, falling to 51 times next year, and offer a prospective dividend yield of 1.2pc. \nDerwent is in a strong position, but Questor would argue that property moves in cycles and would be wary about getting in at the top of this one.
