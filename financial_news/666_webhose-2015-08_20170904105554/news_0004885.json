Jesse Marlow by Duncan Hughes Westpac is slashing lending to self-managed super funds for residential investment properties amid growing concern that many buyers have paid too much and might not be able to service the debt because of falling rents.\nThe bank has cut maximum loan-to-value ratios, which is the proportion of borrowing compared to the value of the property, from 80 to 70 per cent and tightened other lending criteria.\nWestpac has been setting the pace among the big banks for tightening lending policy and pricing, with others, such as AMP Bank, temporarily stopping lending to new property investors.\nAndrew Fawell, director of the Beller Group, a diversified real estate group, said: \"The banks opened the floodgates to investment property buyers and now they are trying to wind back.\"\nChris Foster-Ramsay, managing director of Capital Home Loans, added: \"Doors are being shut on SMSF lending for the immediate future. Clearly, someone can foresee a problem.\"\nThe move comes as some investment apartment buyers say their off-the-plan properties are being valued up to 20 per cent less than the purchase price when they come to settle the lending arrangements on completion of the building.\nThis means lenders will loan significantly less than was anticipated when the deposit was paid and the investor must make up the difference or forfeit the deposit.\nRental returns are lower Other buyers are saying that advertised rental returns, which are needed to repay the mortgage, are about 20 per cent less than what they were told by agents at the time of sale.\nScott Thornton, 52, a computer programmer, said he had lost most of his life savings of more than $200,000 on two investment properties that were intended to bring financial security.\nMr Thornton, who has been wheelchair-bound for more than 30 years after a motorcycle accident, said: \"There are a lot of people in the same predicament. I got caught up in a terrible web.\"\nHe sold his first apartment in 2013 for $450,000 – a loss of more than $150,000 – after just two years because he could not find a tenant to pay the rent needed to maintain payments. The apartment block in fashionable Toorak Road, Camberwell, had several structural faults, such as leaking water, which made it difficult to attract long-term tenants.\nHe was then forced to sell the second off-the-plan apartment in trendy South Melbourne because of similar issues and additional financial pressure caused by a divorce.\nMortgage brokers estimate there are 90,000 apartments being built in Australia that have been sold off the plan but not settled yet.\nThe buyers of about 20 per cent of these have paid a deposit of just 10 per cent of the full purchase price, analysis shows.\nBorrowing has increased Super fund borrowing has increased by 18 times in the past five years, from less than $500 million to more than $9 billion, the Australian Taxation Office says.\nThe recent financial system inquiry warned that current growth rates could create a systemic risk in the future, even though total borrowing was small compared to the overall economy.\nMr Fawell said the value of off-the-plan apartments was being squeezed by over-supply, rising costs, the difference between the valuation and sale price, lower loan-to-value funding and difficulty in achieving promised rental returns.\nIf the property is bought through a super scheme, which have strictly enforced caps on annual contributions, the investor could be forced to sell other super assets to raise money. This could lead to \"fire sales\", super specialists say.\nCrunch time for off-the-plan buyers happens when they go to settle their purchase on completion of construction, which is long after the 90-day pre-approval given by the banks at the time of purchase.\nRevaluations for funding are routinely coming in at less than the purchase price, which means the buyer has to fund the difference or risk forfeiting their deposit, mortgage brokers say.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:09:48.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
