We are in the middle of the summer slow-down, but don’t let that prevent you from looking for bargain-priced stocks. In a general sense, most of us would agree that the market has been volatile. However, the major stock indexes are not trading at very large discounts to their 52-week highs. The Standard & Poor 500 is only trading about 2% lower than its 52-week high. The same goes for the Russell 3000. Even the more concentrated and oft-Quote: d Dow Jones 30 is only about 5% off its 52-week high.Given these stats, most investors either think there are no bargains out there right now, or that any stock trading at a deep discount must be priced that way for a reason. Not true on both accounts!The markets are known to overreact to both good and bad news. This is particularly true when there is general uncertainty. Currently, there is much debate about interest rate hikes, China’s currency devaluation, and other macro events that keep most market pundits busy trying to read the stock tea leaves. Most recently oil prices have entered into the daily discussion too, as traders are concerned about a developing supply/demand imbalance.In the midst of these concerns, I forge ahead with traditional analysis of companies and their stock valuations. I love playing the contrarian and finding companies that have sound businesses, strong balance sheets, but may have missed an earnings target or two. This usually results in a sharp price selloff and that’s where the fun starts.Stocks trading at deep discounts to recent valuations sometimes could be good bets and excellent contrarian plays. I own the three stocks highlighted below. Perhaps there’s room in your portfolio for them also. United Rental Equipment (URI) Trading at around an 80% discount to its 52-week high, URI is an equipment rental company that is deeply exposed to nonresidential construction trends. Think big earth moving equipment and tools that construction companies rent for medium periods. Recently United Rental cut its outlook on rental pricing, but that doesn’t bother me too much.I think the resulting stock sell-off is creating a buying situation. Management should complete about $200 million additional stock buybacks by year end, while it approved another buyback for $1 billion within 18 months of start. That’s $1.2 billion of buybacks to be completed in less than two years, which is almost 20% of the company’s market capitalization. Current P/E is only 8.2X’s. Must Read: 5 Dividend Stocks With Goliath Potential Hertz (HTZ) This car and truck rental business had a rough ride over the past several years. For some time HTZ had not released approved financial statements, and was involved in an SEC investigation. After clearing that hurdle and closing the investigation, Hertz released official financial results and also announced a huge $1 billion stock buyback program. On top of that, it intends to spin off its equipment rental business, which could free up cash for a number of uses. In spite of the resolutions, the stock is trading at almost 70% less than its 52-week high. Current P/E is 23X’s, but earnings are projected to grow over 50% next year. Canadian Pacific (CP) This company also looks cheap: it’s trading at a 40% discount to its 52-week high. CP’s railcar network announced downward earnings guidance due to a decline in cargo shipments, but I think the stock has overreacted to the news. Excellent management and overall leadership will drive Canadian Pacific to even better operating efficiencies than it presently exhibits. The current pullback is an opportunity to build a long term position is a very well-run company.In my portfolio of twenty stocks, these three are the stocks trading at the deepest discounts to their 52-week highs. These top three stocks have the potential to recover over the next year or two, providing insightful, patient and stalwart investors potentially attractive returns.", "external_links": ["http://forbesmags.com/slp/TaperB.asp?k=Goliath_FDC"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:42:26.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
