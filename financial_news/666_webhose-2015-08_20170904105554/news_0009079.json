Lemna Incorporation of Minneapolis, USA, was selected in 2003 out of four US firms which submitted proposals, to undertake the feasibility study and preliminary design of the project. \n'To move the project into works implementation phase, there is the need for an update of the Lemna Report which was completed in 2005. The African Development Bank has agreed to finance the update of the feasibility and Environmental studies,' he said. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T19:16:47.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
