Reuters by Matthew Stevens The BHP Billiton board's decision to lift its shareholder payout in the face of accumulating scepticism over balance sheet capacity to afford its progressive dividend policy has very effectively affirmed Andrew Mackenzie's promise that investors can bank on the global Australian as an annuity investment.\nBut that does not end the challenge Mackenzie faces in selling the new BHP to its long investors.\nMackenzie has consistently warned that growth is no longer the prime directive at BHP. But, just as his guarantee on sustaining or growing dividends was forgotten as commodities markets went into meltdown last October, so his guidance on BHP's approach to growth appears to have been discounted by a market wedded to past paradigms.\nThe difficulty some might have in adjusting their expectations was fully anticipated Mackenzie and his management team. He kept telling anyone who would listen that they should track him, not trust him.\nWell, the message is now getting through. Mackenzie and his board are unconcerned that production will fall across three of BHP's four pillars through the current financial year. They are sanguine, too, about an outlook for sub-5 per cent growth in production over the coming three years as the business redirects growth capital to shareholders first and balance sheet recovery second.\nAt the peak of the cycle BHP was routinely throwing better than $US15 billion annually at growth projects. Last year it pumped $US11 billion at growth and exploration. This year that will fall to no more than $US8.5 billion ($11.8 billion) and drift further again in FY17 to $US7 billion.\nMackenzie was pushed consistently on capital priorities and the growth outlook through Tuesday's London-based profit briefing. And each push earned the same response.\n\"We think about it a bit differently to the way you are thinking about at the moment,\" he said at one point. \"Beyond the $US2 billion that we must do [spend] to sustain our business, we would regard capital as coming to some extent after the dividend.\" In other words, growth now sits secondary to servicing the shareholders.\n Some will argue that board and management have forgotten the industry's long history or simply chosen to ignore its existential lessons: resources companies need to invest consistently through the economic cycles to ensure they capture most value at the peaks and remain resilient and opportunistic through the troughs.\nAs one sagacious long owner suggested after digesting Tuesday's results pack , \"BHP fell behind in the 1990s and it took a long time to catch up\".\nIndeed, catching up required a merger at famously disadvantageous terms with Billiton in the deal that provided cash flow enough to meet BHP dividend commitments and thoroughly refreshed its management capacity.\nFor his part Mackenzie is not saying these truths no longer hold. What he is saying is that there are presently more efficient, capital-light ways of skinning the growth cat than following age-old paths.\nIn a unique strategy that seems perfectly suited to these suddenly brutal times, Mackenzie has engineered cost savings and productivity gains worth $US6.8 billion in underlying EBIT over just two years while reducing BHP to a more digestible, simple beast through the repacking of the Billiton assets into a demerger called South32.\nThe way Mackenzie sees it, that leaves management free to harvest BHP's fleet of tier one, world class assets in a way never before attempted in the resources sector. This is more than a cost cutting mission. Mackenzie wants to introduce high-end manufacturing disciplines to resource extraction.\nFor example, BHP's expensive mobile mining fleet is currently available for work 80 per cent of the available 8760 hours in a year. Mackenzie wants that increased to something in the 90s. BHP's infrastructure utilisation generally ranges under 60 per cent. It should be in the 70s.\nPatently, great availability and utilisation has to mean more production for effectively the same capital cost. Certainly that potential sits at the very core of the Mackenzie way. His bet – and it remains very much his to win or lose right now – is that growth does not necessarily require great pools of new capital deployment. Rather it can come from embedding new approaches that maximise returns from BHP's existing estate.\nTo hear Mackenzie tell his story is to be convinced, at very least, that this potential is very real. But to read headlines like \"Growth goes walkabout\" on reports by BHP's most acute investment analysts says only that BHP's boss and his team have a hard-sell ahead of them yet before this wisdom becomes accepted.\nCoals no more to Newcastle\nIf there has ever been a more absurd expression of gesture politics than the City of Newcastle's decision to join the carbon disinvestment queue then we have not yet heard it.\nI mean, here we have a council that needs only to look out the window to identify the well-spring of its local economy, which is a working harbour that hosts the world's most voluminous coal export facility.\nAnd yet five Labor and two Green councillors, who form a majority on the city's council, have decided that Australian coal's most active host city should no longer invest either fossil fuel companies or the big four domestic banks that support them.\nPlainly the Newcastle Seven's embrace of irony is inspired by the likes of Norway, which is disinvesting from fossil fuels while oil production secures its national welfare, and the Rockefeller family, which is actively disinvesting wealth born of forebear John D's creation, Standard Oil.\nAnd, just for the record, if coal is dying as a fuel and an investment class, then no one has told the customers of Newcastle's Port Waratah coal terminal. Data that will be released on Thursday records annual demand for Hunter Valley coal with shipments out of Newcastle rising by 3.1 per cent to 160 million tonnes.\nThe subtly shifting sands of Newcastle's customer base are pretty much the coal market in microcosm. Thermal coal shipments to regional power generators rose 5.6 per cent to 144 million tonnes while metcoal exports to steel mills in China, Japan, Taiwan and Korea fell by 16 per cent.\nOverall, Japan remains the biggest buyer of NSW coals, accounting for 40 per cent of the state's exports, and while Chinese demand for both thermal and coking coals slipped over the year, it remained the state's second most important customer. But increased Korean demand left it a close third in the customer rankings with Taiwan next.\nIndicatively, the bolter this year was India. Shipments more than doubled to 9 million tonnes with the majority of that demand growth coming, surprisingly perhaps, in metcoal rather than the thermal products that are the target of growth projects floated by Adani and GVK.\nThe message then for the Newcastle Seven: Tell them they are dreaming.\nWhat's APA's is still AGL's\nDoubtless former AGL boss Andrew Fraser is a good guy and one who would make a welcome addition to most boards.\nBut Fraser's invitation to join the board of acquisitive pipeline operator APA is unwelcome if only because it reinforces a view that the shadow of AGL looms too large over a business that was floated away from the family 15 years ago.\nAGL has been chaired since 2007 by legendary former AGL chief executive Len Bleasel and there is speculation that Fraser will likely eventually replace him. The idea that the APA boardroom is something of a retirement home for former AGL executive is further reinforced by a study of its NED ranks. John Fletcher was a former direct report to Bleasel at AGL while Patricia McKenzie served as the energy company's corporate counsel.\nSurely, after 15 years of commercial freedom, the time has come to broaden the APA gene pool just a little bit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:10:35.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
