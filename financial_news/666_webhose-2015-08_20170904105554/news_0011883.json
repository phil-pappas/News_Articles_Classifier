Twitter, Instagram, blogs and review websites are also being used to defame people, generating more work for lawyers.\n\"I expect that as a result of these types of cases, we will continue to receive more enquiries,\" Mr Zimet said.\nThe number of NSW District Court actions concerning social media doubled from 31 in 2013 to 61 in 2014.\nVictorian Supreme Court figures showed of the 39 defamation cases heard last year, four related to website publications such as blogs and two concerned Facebook posts.\nOne case that has been blamed for fuelling cases generally, particularly by unrepresented litigants, was a $105,000 award received last year by a NSW school teacher who was defamed by a student on Twitter and Facebook.\nA West Australian woman was ordered to pay her former husband $12,500 after she posted damaging allegations on Facebook.\n Recently, Treasurer Joe Hockey was awarded $200,000 in damages for a Sydney Morning Herald advertising poster and two tweets from The Age . One tweet had a link to the full article and headline that were found not to be defamatory.\nMinter Ellison partner Peter Bartlett said the Hockey case revealed how Australian courts were struggling to deal with novel issues arising from social media, unlike places such as Britain that were more progressive.\nShort-lived Mr Bartlett said the Hockey case contrasted the recent dismissal of a British Twitter case which found a tweet with a link should be read together and that most people would follow it. The British court noted the short-lived nature of a tweet.\nA British test that restricts plaintiffs claims to publications that cause serious harm could go far to prevent trivial claims in Australia, he said.\nOther problems with current laws in Australia included that the one-year limitation period on claims was essentially redundant in a social media sphere because every time an article, tweet or Facebook post was accessed, it was a defined as a new publication.\nProfessor Andrew Kenyon of the University of Melbourne said any changes would be difficult to achieve given it would require the agreement of the states and territories, in an environment of lacklustre political will.\nBut it was necessary to examine how electronic and social media publications should be interpreted by the law.\n\"Defamation is about free speech and reputation, the effect on reputation does not fit the traditional legal test,\" Mr Kenyon said.\n\"What reputation is and how it gets developed today is different from a decade ago and if reputation works differently, defamation law should now as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T13:05:16.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
