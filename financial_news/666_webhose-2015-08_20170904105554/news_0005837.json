The undergrowth has been cleared away in the course of this meeting in a manner that I would say is streets ahead of any of the other ministerial meetings.\"\nTrade minister Andrew Robb said there had been progress of the sugar issue – which is crucial to support for the TPP from The Nationals within the federal government – and dairy, but an agreement couldn't be concluded.\nMr Robb sought to play down the idea that the countries were completely deadlocked over trade-offs saying they realised that they would all benefit from lowering costs across the whole region across a wide range of industries. He blamed the US, Canada, Japan and Mexico.\nThe talks continued for longer than planned into Saturday morning Australian time but then closed with the ministers unable to say when they would next meet in a sign that they have no clear plan for how to now proceed.\nThese talks after five years of negotiations had been presented as the last chance to get a deal in time to pass the US Congress this year, before the 2016 presidential elections take center stage.\n Mr Froman said that trade officials would engage intensively over the \"coming period\" bilaterally, in small groups and as a combined group depending on the issue. \"We will work over time to resolve these issues,\" he said.\nThe brief statement issued after the meeting said: \"Ministers and negotiators leave Hawaii committed to build on the momentum of this meeting by staying in close contact as negotiators continue their intensive engagement to find common ground.\n\"Negotiators will also continue to work to formalise the achievements that have been made this week.\n\"In this last stage of negotiations, we are more confident than ever that TPP is within reach and will support jobs and economic growth.\n\"The progress made this week reflects our longstanding commitment to deliver an ambitious, comprehensive and high-standard TPP agreement that will support jobs and economic growth across the Asia Pacific region.\"\nFurther hindering a deal beyond market access for dairy and sugar, a four-way fight emerged between the US, Japan, Mexico and Canada over rules of origination for vehicles, a trade negotiator in Hawaii said.\n.\nAnti-free trade activists cheered the talks failing to reach a resolution. \"The failure of TPP ministers to reach agreement in what was supposed to be the final round of negotiations vindicates the deep concerns of community groups that the TPP is secretly trading away issues like access to affordable medicines and governments' right to regulate without being sued by foreign corporations,\" said Dr Patricia Ranald, Coordinator of the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network.\n\"We are pleased that governments failed to reach agreement on key sticking points about extension of monopolies and corporate rights which should not even be on the table in so-called free trade negotiations.\"\n.American business is concerned that the failure to seal the TPP is putting the US at a disadvantage in Asia, where several other free trade agreements have been signed in the last 12 months.\n\"A web of trade agreements has spread across the region, providing advantages for participating nations while the U.S. is often stuck on the outside, looking in,\" said US Chamber of Commerce executive vice president and international affairs head Myron Brilliant.\n\"We urge the negotiators to continue pressing forward toward the goal of a truly comprehensive agreement that will drive economic growth and job creation at home and among our partners.\"\nMr Groser rejected suggestions NZ was considering leaving the talks saying \"the essence of negotiations is to find the sweet spot.\"\nCanadian trade minister Ed Fast said Canada would continue to be at the table although many observers say the imminent election in Canada - which the conservative government may lose will now become a major impediment to further progress.\nAll the member countries will meet at Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group ministerial meetings in the lead up to the APEC leaders summit in November but by then the US presidential election campaigning may have overtaken the trade talks.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/tpp_trade_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-01T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T16:06:16.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
