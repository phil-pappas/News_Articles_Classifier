Andy Dean by Duncan Hughes A spike in the number of houses and apartments for sale in Melbourne and Sydney could signal concerns among sellers that prices are nearing their peak, according to market specialists.\nNew listings of apartments and houses in Sydney are 24 per cent higher than the same time last year and 19 per cent higher in Melbourne, driven by sellers trying to capitalise on strong demand rather than wait for spring, the traditional peak sales time.\nSales in both markets remain strong but there is growing nervousness about the impact of rising rates charged by banks. Clearance rates in Sydney and Melbourne have been slipping in recent weeks, although are historically high.\n\"The market might not be as strong in a few months' time and there will be more stock to compete with as spring numbers rise,\" said Tim Lawless head of research for CoreLogic RP Data, about the surge in property listings. \"Whether this new stock will be absorbed as fast as it has over the past years is the million dollar question,\" he said.\n\"There is a bit of nervousness building up,\" said Andrew Fawell​, director of the Beller Group, a diversified property company in residential, industrial and mainland Chinese markets.\nThe Reserve Bank, in the Statement on Monetary Policy released Friday, wrote that while \"large price increases\" had been recorded for detached houses in Sydney and Melbourne, the growth in apartment prices had been \"noticeably slower\" and the markets were \"subdued\" outside Sydney and Melbourne with some price declines.\n﻿ The RBA also noted that rents inflation was easing as supply and vacancy increased across the nation.\nMortgage brokers expect banks to keep tightening lending to investors through higher interest rates and tougher credit assessments of applicants' capacity to pay off their loans. They have cut expected property yields for rental apartments from about 5 per cent to 3 per cent.\n Mortgage brokers estimate about 90,000 apartments being constructed have been sold off the plan but are not yet settled. The purchasers of about 20 per cent of these, or 18,000, have paid a deposit of just 10 per cent of the full purchase price, according to analysis of investor statistics from CoreLogic.\nMore than 40 per cent of off-the-plan apartments are worth less when they are paid off than when the buyer agreed the borrowing conditions and finalised the price with a developer, according to Greville Pabst​, chief executive of WBP Property Group.\nMr Pabst said off-the-plan buyers are facing a \"double whammy\" of apartment prices having fallen by an average of 20 per cent and banks demanding higher deposits.\n\"Measures taken by APRA [the banking regulator] are having an impact but it is too early to say how much of an impact,\" he said.\nHousing in the $700,000 to $1.5 million range in Melbourne and Sydney is \"resilient\" but pressure could be growing on sellers wanting $3 million to $6 million, according to real estate agents.\nHouse listings in the Perth and Darwin, which are reeling from over-supply and weak demand following the collapse of the resources boom, are up 22 and 17 per cent respectively.\nValues and rents are falling, time on the market is increasing and vendor discounting rates are softening in both cities, according to analysis by RP Data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:34:27.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
