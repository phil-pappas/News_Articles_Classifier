This should serve as an encouragement for potential e-commerce companies to start re-aligning their business strategy for the future,' he said. \nMr Hesse said e-Commerce had the potential to expand the economy by creating jobs in courier, shipping, the IT services industry and expressed the hope that the youth would seize the opportunity and run with it. \nHe assured the public of continuous effort to ensure the security of all transactions and said they had implemented a cardholder authentication system to ensure protection from fraud and also reduce the incidences of chargeback for online merchants. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T19:23:11.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
