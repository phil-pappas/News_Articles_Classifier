Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl When Westpac Banking Corp was pressured to provide financial education programs in Fiji, it found that linking up with aid experts allowed it to build financial literacy schemes that have now given it more customers.\nRio Tinto found working with a government aid program in a developing country could help achieve regulatory changes a mining company could not achieve by itself.\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop has drawn on the experience of these two companies to call on more businesses working in developing countries to find ways to partner with Australia's aid program.\nOn Monday, she finally revealed the financial bottom line in her plan to shift some of the distribution of Australia's aid budget directly to businesses operating in poorer countries as part of a new policy of economic diplomacy.\nPerformers from a financial literacy education campaign in PNG. The government is seeking the first expressions of interest from business to do joint ventures with combined social and financial returns in which the government will provide matching grants of $100,000 to $500,000.\nJoint proposals The proposals are meant to be jointly submitted by businesses and an aid-oriented institution, which would most likely implement the project.\nThe change in delivering aid reflects Ms Bishop's view that private investment and trade does more to increase growth in poor countries than aid, but it also coincides with a 30 per cent cut in Australia's aid spending.\n Ms Bishop describes the government contribution as \"catalytic funding\" rather than traditional aid, saying she doesn't expect business to embark on projects that don't have a normal prospect of being profitable.\nThe pin-up companies in this shift are Carnival Australia, which has struck an agreement to purchase some cruise ship supplies in Vanuatu, and Westpac and the ANZ Banking Group, which have run financial literacy programs that have extended their customer bases.\nWestpac Pacific general manager Greg Pawson said the bank sought aid sector expertise when the Reserve Bank of Fiji required a literacy program. But he said that given 80 per cent of Pacific people were unbanked: \"We knew we had to broaden our reach.\"\n'Honest broker' Rio Tinto managing director Phil Edmands said working with the Australian aid program could help a resources company launch a new mining venture in a developing country more smoothly because the aid program could be an \"honest broker\" in achieving regulatory changes that could help the host country attract investment.\n\"The Australian government can bring in expertise so that a development project can get off on the right foot. You need an enabling environment,\" he said.\nIn other measures to encourage businesses on the ground in the region to join aid projects, the government is contributing $1 million to the Global Reporting Initiative, which helps businesses measure the effect of work in developing countries. It will give $350,000 to a United Nations program that encourages businesses to play a greater role in meeting sustainable development goals in regional countries.\nAustralia's peak aid group welcomed the government shift in policy but released a study showing two-thirds of Australian aid organisations already partnered with the private sector and of those organisations that do not now partner, more than half intend to in the future.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl", "http://www.acfid.asn.au/media/media-releases/partnerships-that-deliver-australian-aid-organisations-and-the-private-sector", "http://dfat.gov.au/news/news/Pages/engaging-the-private-sector-in-aid-and-development.aspx"], "published": "2015-08-31T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:56:27.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
