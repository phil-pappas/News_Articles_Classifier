Now get ready for Steve Jobs the opera By AP | Telegraph â€“ 4 hours ago 17.04 +0.42 \nThe Revolution of Steve Jobs will focus on how the Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) co-founder faced his own mortality \nSince his death in 2011, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs has been the subject of documentaries, books, a film and even a graphic novel. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the technology pioneer will be the focus of an upcoming opera. \nIn front of the Sangre de Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico, the Santa Fe Opera announced Wednesday that its latest commission will be based on the man who helped revolutionize personal computers, the music business and brought the world the iPhone. \n\"The Revolution of Steve Jobs\" will premiere during the company's 2017 season and will be written by composer Mason Bates and librettist Mark Campbell. According to the opera company, the production will examine Jobs facing his own mortality and circles back to the events and people in his past that shaped and inspired him. \nThe move comes as New Mexico in recent years has worked to honor its connections to technology innovators like Jobs and Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) founder Bill Gates. For example, a Route 66 motor lodge in Albuquerque where Bill Gates and Paul Allen lived while launching Microsoft is being redeveloped into apartments as part of a neighborhood revival project. \nJobs operated from his garage in Los Altos, California, and with partner Steve Wozniak released the compact Apple II at the time Albuquerque was a technology hub. \nHe was fired from Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news ) in 1985 in a board coup but came back 11 years later. During his second stint at the firm, he introduced the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone. \nThat journey is the perfect story for an opera, general director Charles MacKay said. \"We are delighted to take this journey into the life and legacy of a distinctly American figure through the creative genius of Mason Bates and Mark Campbell.\" \nBates said the story of Jobs is a great intersection of creativity, innovation and human communication. His relationship with those who helped him along that journey also will help tell the story in the opera, Bates said. \n\"Each character will have (his or her) own music,\" Bates said. \"When they collide, that's when it gets interesting.\" \nThis will be the first opera produced by Bates, who has gained national attention during the past decade by fusing traditional symphonic resources with electronic sounds. Armed with a laptop computer, he often performs in the presentation of his compositions. \nCampbell has authored 15 librettos since the mid-1990s, including the opera \"Silent Night\". \nThe 56-year-old Jobs died in 2011 after a long fight with cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T07:50:14.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
