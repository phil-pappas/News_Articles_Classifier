At the end of that same period, there were 3,739 breweries operating in the U.S. That's an increase of 699 breweries since the same time last year and doesn't count the 1,755 breweries currently in the planning stages. That translates to an estimated 115,469 full-time and part-time jobs in the craft beer industry. \nThat's a not insubstantial portion of 49,576 brewery jobs, 131,307 distribution jobs and 383,190 beer supplier positions -- hop growers, maltsters, brewing equipment fabricators and the like -- that the Beer Institute and National Beer Wholesalers Association lobbying groups say the beer industry will fill this year. Overall, those groups say the beer industry contributes about $253 billion in economic output -- roughly 1.5% of the nation's GDP -- and accounts for $48.5 billion in tax revenue.
