The 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped Friday, then hovered around the current rate for the rest of the week. \n\"Mortgage rates plummeted last Friday to their lowest level since May after U.S. data showed very weak wage growth in Q2,\" said Erin Lantz, vice president of mortgages at Zillow. \"Looking ahead, since wage growth will be an important consideration in future interest rate hikes, markets will look to this Friday's jobs report for hints about wage trends.\" \nZillow's real-time mortgage rates are based on thousands of custom mortgage quotes submitted daily to anonymous borrowers on the Zillow Mortgages site and reflect the most recent changes in the market. These are not marketing rates, or a weekly survey. \nThe rate for a 15-year fixed home loan is currently 2.92 percent, while the rate for a 5-1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is 2.72 percent. \nPurchase Mortgage Application Activity \nZillow predicts tomorrow's seasonally adjusted Mortgage Bankers Association Weekly Application Index will show purchase loan activity increased by 1 percent from the week prior. Zillow combines loan requests made on Zillow Mortgages last week with the previous week's Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) Weekly Application Index to predict the MBA's Weekly Application Index for purchase loans, which will be released tomorrow.
