It was estimated by the audit office at 17.9 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) at the end of June 2013.\nThe debt ratio of local governments will be set at 86 percent, Xinhua said.\nOutstanding local government debt stood at 15.4 trillion yuan as of the end of 2014, the agency said.\nLocal governments will be allowed to increase their outstanding debt by 600 billion yuan during the rest of this year.\nThe Ministry of Finance has allowed local governments to swap 1 trillion yuan of maturing, high-interest local debt for new municipal bonds to reduce interest costs, but demand for such bonds has been weak.
