Photo: Rob Homer\nAdani's $16.5 billion Carmichael coal mine should eventually \"get moving\" despite hurdles in obtaining environmental approvals, the chief executive of the project's key contractor, Downer EDI, has forecast.\nThe Federal Court's decision on Wednesday to set aside environmental approvals for the massive coal project in Queensland's Galilee Basin to fix \"technical matters\" was disappointing, said Downer CEO Grant Fenn.\n\"But we are still hopeful that the Carmichael coal project will eventually get moving,\" Mr Fenn said.\n\"It's really important for Queensland, it's really important for Australia, both the federal government and the Queensland government are going to work very hard to try and get this thing going despite a very concerted effort from Green groups to stop it.\nAdvertisement \"I suspect the governments will be successful, I just hope the financiers continue to and Adani continues to back the project.\"\nEnvironmental groups have claimed the court victory will stop the Carmichael mine from going ahead while the Commonwealth Bank confirmed on Wednesday it was no longer working for Adani as a financial adviser.\nAdani faces speculation it will abandon its plans for the mine, given the plummeting coal price and difficulties in raising finance.\nDowner has more than $2 billion of potential work dependent on the success of the Carmichael project, having received letters of award from Adani in December for a five-year mining services contract .\nIt received additional letters of award in July from Adani to build a $420 million coal handling and preparation plant in a joint venture with POSCO Engineering and Construction Australia, as well as a sole $260 million contract to operate and maintain the plant.\nDowner has not yet signed binding contracts with Adani because it is waiting for the company to receive the necessary project approvals and financing.\nDowner has been making internal preparations for the contracts in the hope that the mine will go ahead.\n\"Should the mine kick off, all of what we've done will be very valuable,\" Mr Fenn said.\nIf the mine is scrapped, the cost of preparatory work would be \"immaterial\" to Downer, he added.\nDowner's stock slid almost 10 per cent on Thursday morning after the contractor warned 2016 profits would be lower than expected due to the \"high degree of uncertainty\" in construction and mining.\nAt 12:15pm AEST, Downer's shares were trading down 8.9 per cent at $4.17. The shares have plunged 20 per cent since touching a 52-week high of $5.19 on June 1.", "external_links": ["http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20141219/pdf/42vlrlr37gf02c.pdf", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150730/pdf/4304ktk51rmmr3.pdf", "http://www.afr.com/news/politics/adanis-16b-carmichael-mine-approval-hit-by-error-20150805-girulp", "http://www.afr.com/business/downer-edi-warns-of-difficult-2016-outlook-and-lower-profits-20150804-girhf7"], "published": "2015-08-06T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T12:00:44.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
