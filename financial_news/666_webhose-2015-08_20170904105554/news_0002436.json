The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute found that cars and light trucks purchased in 2014 got an average of 25.4 miles to the gallon. That's still less than halfway to the EPA and Department of Transportation's goal that it set back in 2012, but it beats the roughly 19 miles per gallon that the Department of Transportation measured for the same pool of vehicles in 1995. It's also closing in on double the average mileage of the light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 1980. \nGive crossovers a whole lot of thanks for that. Automakers sold more than 2.5 million of them in the U.S. through July -- with a big assist from fuel prices that are down an average of 90 cents per gallon from this time a year ago. That makes crossovers the single largest class of vehicle ahead of midsize cars (2.1 million sold through July), small cars (1.9 million) pickups (1.4 million) and all non-crossover SUVs combined (970,000).
