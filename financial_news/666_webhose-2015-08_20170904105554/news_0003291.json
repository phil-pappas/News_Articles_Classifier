Upward revisions to the previous two months and a gain in average hourly earnings also were viewed positively by markets.\nFollowing the jobs report, the swaps market was pricing in a 52 percent chance of a September rate hike, up from 47 percent before the data's release.\nChristopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX in New York, said, however, that \"given low headline inflation readings and a lack of break-neck speed in the labor market, the first hike in September (or October or December for that matter) is likely to be an isolated event.\"\nIn late trading, the dollar index was down 0.2 percent at 97.650. It earlier rose as high 98.334, its highest level since April 23.\nThe dollar touched two-month peaks against the yen, rising above 125 yen, but was last down 0.5 percent at 124.13 yen .\nThe euro, meanwhile, was up 0.4 percent at $1.0966.\nAgainst the Swiss franc, the dollar last traded up 0.2 percent at 0.9829 franc. It earlier rose to its highest level since March 20.
