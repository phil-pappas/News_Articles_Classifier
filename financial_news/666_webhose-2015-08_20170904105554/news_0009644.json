They included a family with five small children from Afghanistan who had fled three months ago, and others from Pakistan saying they had fled the Taliban. \nAnother 200 traveled on to Munich where police went through the process of registering them in a hall at the main train station. Passers-by spontaneously handed out water and candy to the new arrivals, dpa reported. \nIt was not immediately clear where these migrants would be taken, but typically refugees are put into temporary housing until they can apply for asylum, including in former military barracks, container villages that have been built, and even tents. \nEarlier, the state government in Bavaria, which has all of Germany's border crossings with Austria, said it also had launched special traffic checks on highways near the border. \nDespite the apparent easing of restrictions, the Hungarian government maintained its tough stance. \n\"People at Budapest's Keleti railway station demanding to be allowed free passage are demanding something which is not possible under European legislation,\" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said. \nAll three countries are part of the EU's Schengen zone of passport-free travel, where under normal circumstances vehicles are rarely inspected at the border anymore. \nAustria's increased controls \"prove that no European country is going to allow illegal migrants, including refugees, to reach its territory without control,\" the Hungarian government said. \nAbout 160,000 migrants have been detained already this year in Hungary, more than triple the figure recorded in all of 2014. Many apply for asylum but quickly leave the financially-strapped European Union nation for richer EU countries like Germany and Austria before their requests are decided. \nIn Vienna, senior police official Konrad Kogler told reporters that since Austria began the increased checks Sunday they have resulted in the arrests of five human traffickers and the interception of 200 migrants. \nHungary is building a 4-meter (13-foot) high fence on its southern border with Serbia to try to stem the flow of migrants coming across the Balkans. Hungarian lawmakers this week plan to discuss proposals allowing the government to deploy troops to the border and measures increasing penalties for illegal migrants and human traffickers. \nAustrian police say the 71 migrants likely suffocated in a truck with Hungarian license plates that was abandoned last week in Austria on the Budapest-Vienna highway. Five suspected traffickers have been detained in the case and Hungary is stepping up its arrests of smugglers. \nHelmut Marban, an Austrian police spokesman in Burgenland province where the truck was discovered, said another 12 Syrian travel documents had been found on the truck with Hungarian license plates, along with 10 cellphones. Forty autopsies had been carried out so far and results were to be tentatively announced Friday. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:19:10.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
