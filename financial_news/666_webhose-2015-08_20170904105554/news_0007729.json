This will help them meet employee expectations and reduce attrition,” TimesJobs.com Chief Operating Officer Vivek Madhukar opined.\nThe survey further found that when it comes to compensation and benefits expectations, all the three generations of the workforce — Baby Boomers (57 per cent), Gen X (37 per cent) and Gen Y (41 per cent) — want more in-hand salary in their monthly pay packages but their preferences for other benefits differ.\nBaby Boomers are those born between 1944 and 1964, Gen X are those born between 1965 and 1980 and Gen Y comprises people born between the mid-80s and mid-90s.\nWhile 24 per cent Baby Boomers prefer post-retirement benefits, only 10 per cent prefer medical or health insurance benefits, it added.\nAmongst Gen X, 29 per cent prefer other benefits or perks (mostly flexible work options). A significant number of them (20 per cent) also preferred post-retirement benefits.\nContrary to popular perception, 22 per cent of Gen Y opted for post-retirement benefits over other benefits or perks, the survey said.\n 18, 2015 9:26 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:51:25.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
