It is a wonderful retreat from the desert heat, with many restaurants, historic sites and shops. Denise Meridith View all 13 photos \n“Historic hotel” is often a euphemism for a 50-year-old relic with a shared bathroom and no AC. But the small town of Prescott, Arizona , 100 miles north of Phoenix, is a treasure trove for people with an appreciation for quality remembrances of the old West. Prescott 's uniqueness is that it combines the old with all the amenities of a modern, international tourist location. Prescott is an excellent summer retreat for visitors to Arizona or Phoenicians looking for a cool staycation. \nThe Vendome Hotel , which was built in 1917, is conveniently located near the square and Whiskey Row. It has the atmosphere of a luxury bed-and-breakfast with individually-decorated rooms, modern bathrooms, and free breakfast and Wi-Fi. \nPrescott is a foodie’s place to die for. The selection of great restaurants runs the gamut from Indian to hot dogs. There are many outside patios allowing you to enjoy the fresh, cool air and people watch. Prescott can satisfy any tourist’s interests from New Englanders relishing lobster rolls to New Yorkers laughing at the site of candy cigarettes they use to buy as kids. Whisky Row, of course, can quench anyone’s thirst. \nAll the streets and stores are immaculate. Most of the souvenirs are cowboy-related, as they should be; but one can also find Buddhist artifacts. Prescott’s economy has recovered, and the employees all seem happy to be there. \nThe most enjoyable asset of Prescott is the people. The Vendome’s best feature is Barbie Jacobsen, the delightful front desk clerk/concierge/bartender/everything else. She has been there four years and countless hours, and can tell you anything you need to know about the town, the hotel or the ghosts that inhabit the second floor. \nJerry Liebman, a Bronx refugee of 15 years, who plays honky-tonk piano at The Palace on weekends, says “I wish I had discovered this place even sooner. You can make new friends right on the street.” Indeed, everyone, whether it is Bill and Ken at the Visitors Center or Bill, a 20-year resident, who immigrated from New Jersey, is anxious to help tourists find what they are looking for, or what they did not even know they needed. There are even street entertainers, from hip-hop to country, like you would find in a big city. \nScottsdale’s summer pool parties are fun. But if you want a fun, friendly, relaxing, and tummy-satisfying long weekend, head north to Prescott, Arizona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T19:16:30.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
