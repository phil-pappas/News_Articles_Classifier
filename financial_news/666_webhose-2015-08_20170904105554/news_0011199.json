The group has reduced its global workforce by 8400 people over the past two years as demand for its engineering services has waned.\nWorleyParsons CEO Andrew Wood says conditions in minerals and metals remain 'depressed'. Photo: Darrian Traynor\nA smaller workforce allowed the company to respond to changing market conditions more quickly, Mr Wood said. \"If the oil price falls further, or stays lower for longer, we do expect activity levels to fall.\"\nAdvertisement Statutory net profits were hurt by a $198.6 million write-down on goodwill after WorleyParsons lowered the carrying values of some assets, as well as booking charges for redundancy costs, office closures and the settlement of a dispute with ExxonMobil over an offshore drilling platform designed in Russia.\n﻿ But WorleyParsons' shares, which have been trading at 10-year lows, rose 48¢, or 6.3 per cent, to $8.13 after revenues in the group's core hydrocarbons business fell only 1 per cent despite large spending cuts from its oil and gas customers.\nAnalysts said the company, which has been restructured over the past 18 months, appeared to be in a better position to handle the resources slump than it was a year ago.\nWorleyParsons' new Advisian consultancy business, which contributed earnings of $14.1 million, was performing well and now employed 3000 people, Mr Wood said. \"I see no reason why it can't get somewhere near the same size as the rest of the business.\"\nStill, investors remain concerned about the outlook for future earnings.\nWorleyParsons did not give any financial forecasts for 2016 and underlying profits, which exclude the goodwill impairment and charges, fell 25 per cent to $198.6 million.\nWorleyParsons also halved its final dividend. It will pay a 22¢ final dividend, down from a 51¢ payout last year.\nEarnings before interest and tax (EBIT) dropped in all of WorleyParsons' core businesses, with hydrocarbons down 8 per cent at $475 million; minerals metals and chemicals falling 59 per cent to $44 million; and infrastructure falling 56 per cent to $39 million.\nThe sudden cancellation of Canada's Kami iron ore project last year was the key cause of the sharp fall in income in minerals and metals division because WorleyParsons was given no warning, Mr Wood said.\nProfit margins slid in all three divisions, with hydrocarbons margins running at 8.9 per cent compared with 9.6 per cent a year earlier; minerals, metals and chemicals margins at 4.9 per cent compared with 10.1 per cent a year earlier; and infrastructure margins at 1.7 per cent compared with 4.2 per cent a year earlier.", "external_links": ["http://www.aspecthuntley.com.au/docserver/01654743.pdf?fileid=01654743&datedir=20150826&edt=MjAxNS0wOC0yNisxMDowNjoxMSsxNDQwMCs2MjM4NytGYWlyZmF4IDEgREFQK3JlZGlyZWN0Ky9pbWFnZXNpZ25hbC9lcnJvcnBhZ2VzL1BERlRpbWVvdXQuaHRtbCsvaW1hZ2VzaWduYWwvZXJyb3JwYWdlcy9wZGZkZWxheWVkLmpzcA==", "http://www.aspecthuntley.com.au/docserver/01654677.pdf?fileid=01654677&datedir=20150826&edt=MjAxNS0wOC0yNiswOTozMjozMisxNDQwMCs2MjM4NytGYWlyZmF4IDEgREFQK3JlZGlyZWN0Ky9pbWFnZXNpZ25hbC9lcnJvcnBhZ2VzL1BERlRpbWVvdXQuaHRtbCsvaW1hZ2VzaWduYWwvZXJyb3JwYWdlcy9wZGZkZWxheWVkLmpzcA=="], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:31:23.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
