Since its launch in 2013, more companies are using team collaboration tool Slack (including the newsroom at MarketWatch).\nThe service is mostly a series of chat rooms, private groups and direct messages, but it also integrates with third-party services and supports community-built integrations.\nSome of the integrations are clever takes on making work more efficient. The New York Times uses an intelligent bot on Slack to help decide which stories to post on social media. Another command called “/remind me to” allows Slack users to set reminders for themselves.\nBut some of the integrations are downright wacky.\nFrom automating lunch delivery to letting you know whether the toilet is in use or not, here are some of the most creative and wacky ways companies are using Slack.\nGetty Images Slide 2 of 7 Getting on-demand ice cream\nNeed to have an impromptu ice cream party for your team? A service called @large integrates with Slack as a personal assistant.\nThe Slackbot delivers users whatever they request (whether it’s a handyman, plane tickets, a resupply of snacks or even an order of ice cream) to @large on Slack. All the payment and delivery information is submitted upon sign-up, so users simply ask @large to bring what they need, and it will arrive as soon as possible.\nCan you open your office door using @SlackHQ ?

Twitter user @vibhu tweeted this “toilet bot” found in the house bathroom.\nThe stall has a door sensor and radio transmitter, which sends alerts to a channel on Slack called #toilet-bot that gives users notifications whenever the toilet becomes busy or available.\nSprig Slide 5 of 7 Personalized food delivery\nIntelligent software builder site Skipflag created a Foodbot that takes each employee’s individual lunch order through Slack, to be delivered by food-delivery startup Sprig .\nThe Foodbot on Slack sends each team member a direct message with the day’s Sprig menu. Each employee has 20 minutes to enter their selection, and the bot takes the responses and automatically places an order with Sprig.\nPanic/Slack Slide 6 of 7 Changing the color of the company sign\nOS X and iOS app maker Panic Inc. constructed its first company sign that never stays the same color.\nColor-customizable LEDs allow anyone to go to Panic Sign’s webpage to choose custom colors for the sign at that moment.
