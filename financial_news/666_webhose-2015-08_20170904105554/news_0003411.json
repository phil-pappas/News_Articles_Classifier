Standard Chartered was up 2 percent after a volatile morning, slightly lower than before it released results in mid-morning trade. \nThe Asia-focused bank fell sharply before rising as much as 6.5 percent as investors digested the update. The bank halved its dividend in a move that traders said was necessary to bolster its capital position. \nThe FTSE 100 was up 32.95 points, or 0.5 percent, at 6,719.52 by 1050 GMT, nearly 6 percent off all-time highs hit in April. \nThe index has been hindered in recent weeks by falls in mining stocks. However, FTSE 350 mining shares rose 2.6 percent, recovering from near six-year lows. \nWith copper also pinned near six-year lows, hit by concerns over demand from China and the prospect of a U.S. rate rise later this year, traders were not optimistic on the outlook for the sector. \n\"Miners have been hit quite hard, and must've reached a level where some see them as attractively valued,\" said Mark Priest, sales trader at ETX Capital. \n\"But we're not seeing a rebound in metal prices, there is talk the U.S. will raise rates and China is still a concern globally.\" \nAmong fallers, building materials group Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) dropped 2 percent after a downgrade from Citi to \"neutral\" from \"buy\". \nIt has dropped nearly 4 percent over the last two sessions after an update that reported results in line with expectations but gave little clarity on the outlook. \nChip designer ARM was also weak, and is down 6.2 percent this week as Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , which uses ARM's chip designs in its products, hit a six-month low.
