The young man is in a \"critical, unstable\" condition and undergoing surgery, US police confirmed. \nSt. Louis County's police chief Jon Belmar said the man opened fire on plain-clothes detectives late before being shot by the officers. \nBelmar also commented that a second shooting involving two groups of people had also taken place on the west side of West Florissant Avenue as a large crowd gathered. \n\"They were criminals. They weren't protesters,\" Belmar said of those involved in the shootings. \n\"There is a small group of people out there that are intent on making sure that peace doesn't prevail,\" he added. \"There are a lot of emotions. I get it. But we can't sustain this as we move forward.\" The shootings followed a day of peaceful demonstrations in Ferguson to commemorate Brown's death last year by a white local police officer. The killing opened the debate on relations between the police and black communities across America. \nAlso read: Two Ferguson police officers shot during protest hours after chief quit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:43:18.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
