Andrew Meares by Tim Dodd A key industry body employing electrical apprentices says that school leaver quality is not high enough to train young people in electrotechnology without catch up courses.\nSuresh Manickam, CEO of the National Electrical and Communications Association, said the lack of improvement in high school NAPLAN results, revealed in new figures published on Wednesday , underlined the problem facing employers.\n\"The quality of school leavers is not where it should be,\" he said.\nHe said that electrical tradespeople had to deal with increasingly complex technology – such as photo voltaic cells, batteries and renewable energy – and needed to be well-prepared for qualifications such at the certificate III in electrotechnology.\nNECA employs and trains about 4000 electrical apprentices, about one-third of the national total.\nQuality down Mr Manickam said a major issue faced by the electrical contractors who are NECA members was the difference in quality of school leavers around the country.\n\"There are major discrepancies around the states,\" he said.\n For example the 2015 NAPLAN results, released Wednesday, show differences between states in numeracy achievement in year 9.\nWhile all the states are close in the percentage of students (between 94 per cent and 97 per cent) who are meeting the national minimum standard in year 9 numeracy, some states (NSW, Victoria and WA) have more students achieving at high level while others (SA and Tasmania) have a greater number who are just scraping through.\n​\"If we're finding this problem as a first trade of choice then what are the other trades experiencing?\" Mr Manickam asked.\nFederal Education Minister Christopher Pyne said on Wednesday that the NAPLAN results showed that governments and school systems needed to focus on curriculum, teacher quality, parental engagement and school autonomy.\n\"They are the four things that will make a difference in Australia to the outcomes for students,\" he said.\n'Results have stagnated' \"In spite of spending 40 per cent more on school education over the last 10 years our results have stagnated, so it's not about money.\"\nThe Grattan Institute's school education program director Peter Goss said much more work would need to be done to draw conclusions from the 2015 NAPLAN data about which policies were having success in improving school achievement.\nBut he said that, in the case of Queensland where high school NAPLAN results did improve, the decision to add a preparatory year at the beginning of primary school several years ago was making a difference.\n\"One of the messages is that structural change such as adding an additional prep year in Queensland, has shifted the dial,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:05:58.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
