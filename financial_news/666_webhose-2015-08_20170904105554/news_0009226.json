PUBLISHED: 00:00, Fri, Aug 21, 2015 | UPDATED: 21:57, Fri, Aug 21, 2015 GETTY The FTSE 100 closed down at 6,187.65 points on Friday The FTSE 100 closed down at 6,187.65 points on Friday - a fall of 2.8 per cent for the day, and a drop of more than 5 per cent for the week. It marks its worst weekly performance since December. The index is down for nine straight sessions, its longest losing streak since 2011, and is almost 13 per cent below an all-time high hit in April. Across the Atlantic, Wall Street also saw shares drop today - with the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes all down more than 2 per cent. The FTSE fall came as data from China indicated that factory output in August shrank at its fastest rate in more than six years. I believe that this volatility is likely to remain with us, at least until the end of the year Nigel Green The county's factory output reading was the lowest since March 2009, sparking fears over global growth and possible deflation. Today China's main index in Shanghai was down 4.2 per cent, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong suffered a drop of 1.9 per cent. Analysts have warned that the bleak figures will continue as fears over global finances continue to grow. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, said: \"There are many, and legitimate, contributing factors to the global economic slowdown narrative. \"These include China-related issues, such as the recent devaluation of its currency, the stock market's boom and bust in recent months, and slower GDP growth. \"I believe that this volatility is likely to remain with us, at least until the end of the year... \"But for most long-term investors, fears of a near-term financial apocalypse are overdone.\" The FTSE 350 mining index also saw sombre figures almost reach their lowest point since 2009. It is believed to have been caused by a knock on effect from a China-led spike to metal prices, with miners being forced to reduce their spending.
