Ready to go to the movies, pay your Visa bill or leave for vacation.\nYou might want to double-check your account balance first, though, and make sure your bank credited your whole deposit. Citizens Bank just agreed to pay almost $32 million to settle regulators' claims that it didn't meet that basic expectation for some customers for about six years. The case is the first involving handling of deposits for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency created by the Dodd-Frank Act in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\nA subsidiary of Citizens Financial Group ( CFG ) , which recently had the largest initial public offering for a commercial bank in U.S. history, Citizens Bank told customers that it had procedures for verifying deposit amounts and ensuring checks and cash jibed with deposit slips, but from 2008 through 2012, it ignored discrepancies of $50 or less, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In 2013, it cut the threshold to $25.\n\"One could argue that it all came out in the wash,\" bureau director Richard Cordray said in a statement. \"Some consumers benefited by this policy and some were harmed by it. But for those customers who were harmed, the bank kept the difference, and over the years shorted consumers millions of dollars. We believe this practice was unfair and deceptive.\"\nMust Read: AIG Bailout Ruling Contested by Both U.S. and Hank Greenberg\nThe bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , and the Officer of the Comptroller of the Currency together assessed penalties against Providence, Rhode Island-based Citizens Bank of $20.5 million and ordered it to refund $11 million to customers.\n\"When a depository institution violates the basic tenet of what it means to offer a deposit account -- that is, to receive and keep safe the customer's funds -- it imbues a deep sense of mistrust,\" Cordray said. \"Fifty dollars may seem like a small amount to a bank with assets worth billions of dollars, but it is real money to regular people.\"\nReasons for the deposit discrepancies included bank scanners misreading checks and customers providing inaccurate deposit slips, the bureau said.\n\"Like many other peer banks, Citizens employed certain practices to ensure the next-day crediting of deposits in situations when deposit slips contained mathematical errors,\" the company said in a statement on its website. \"However, these past practices and disclosures, principally prior to early 2011, could have been better.\"\nThe bank implemented a new teller system in the last three months of 2013 that addresses the issue by automating the reconciliation process, which the bureau called \"a significant technology investment.\" Citizens, which held $100.6 million in total deposits as of the end of June, said it has \"adequate reserves\" to cover the settlement.\nThe company's shares have climbed 22% to about $26 in New York trading since it went public on Sept. 23, and the bank reported revenue of about $4.98 billion last year.\n\"It was not acceptable for Citizens to keep money for itself when errors were made,\" Cordray said. \"Consumers deserve to have confidence that they can move their money around securely without exposing themselves to unwelcome risks, such as a bank resolving an error by keeping the difference for itself.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.fdic.gov/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13255058/1/better-double-check-your-deposit--a-32-million-lesson-at-citizens-bank.html", "http://investor.citizensbank.com/about-us/newsroom/latest-news/2015/2015-08-12-193953567.aspx", "http://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/consumer-protection/index-consumer-protection.html", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13255058/1/better-double-check-your-deposit--a-32-million-lesson-at-citizens-bank.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13255058/1/better-double-check-your-deposit--a-32-million-lesson-at-citizens-bank.html&text=Better", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13255058/1/better-double-check-your-deposit--a-32-million-lesson-at-citizens-bank.html", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13255058/1/better-double-check-your-deposit--a-32-million-lesson-at-citizens-bank.html&title=Better"], "published": "2015-08-13T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:22:48.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
