Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: The government may be eager to see state-run banks come up with a plans of consolidate, but the biggest is balking on merging its own subsidiaries. Country's largest bank State Bank of India which could have done it in the easiest possible way says it has put the merger of its five associates with itself on hold as the giant grapples with challenge thrown by integrating technology. Speaking media after the launch of SBI m-wallet 'SBI Buddy' and SBI Foundation- the company that will undertake CSR activity on behalf of the entire SBI group, SBI chairman, Arundhati Bhattacharya said that SBI has bigger challenges to address before merging its associate with itself. \"The conversion to digital that is happening at such a fast pace, that's a very big challenge. The fact that we have some many other layers coming in like payments banks, universal banks, licence on tap, disintermediation happening through the crowd funding platforms crypto currency popping up there and there, so challenges are multi-fold today,\" she said. SBI chief said that at some point of time SBI would merge its associate banks because there are lot many challenges. \"Those challenges are more immediate than merging the banks.\" She further indicated that the banks would not accrue benefits of merging its associates. \"We are valued as one entity so even if I merge them, my value is not going to go up. Therefore the valuation will remain same, only things is I can bring about greater efficiencies. But I can bring better efficiencies without merging,\" she said. The bank has in recent months taken measures to reduce overlap of branches and ATMs and all its product roll out happens in both SBI and associate bank almost simultaneously. The bank and its associate banks also share the same technology platform. SBI has merged State Bank of Indore and State Bank of Saurashtra with itself four years ago. \"So today, actually speaking, I can go and add to my balance sheet if we go and acquire some other bank,\" Ms Bhattacharya said. There has been talks of merging Bharatiya Mahila Banks with SBI, but she declined to comment on it. Consolidation is one of key agenda in the next Gyan Sangam - where senior management of PSU banks meet to discuss future strategy - early next calendar year. \"Its difficult when you do a merger by force rather than when you do a merger of likes, where each one understands that the other one is bringing some strength and therefore, it is a merger of like entities,\" she said.
