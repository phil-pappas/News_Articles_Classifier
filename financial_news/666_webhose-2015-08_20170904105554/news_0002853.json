This area matches its Greece-related range top, and the Nasdaq’s intermediate-term bias points higher barring a violation.\nMoving to the Dow, its wider view is strikingly weaker.\nConsider that the index plunged to six-month lows last week following a failed retest of the 200-day moving average.\nStill, the Dow started this week with a steep single-day spike, and the quality of its rally attempt is worth tracking. Broadly speaking, significant resistance rests at the 17,800 mark — an area matching the 200-day moving average, currently 17,814 — and a close higher is needed to stabilize its backdrop.\nAnd the S&P 500’s backdrop remains comparably stronger, following a third successful retest of the 200-day moving average.\nThough the index is traversing a jagged six-month range, its longer-term bias points higher barring a violation of the 200-day.\nThe bigger picture As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks have diverged, and the current backdrop isn’t one-size-fits-all. The Dow industrials have recently reached six-month lows, while the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 remain comparably resilient.\nBeyond the headline benchmarks, consider the small- and mid-caps:\nStarting with the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -1.25% is flirting with six-month lows, and its 200-day moving average, currently 121.40.\nThis is a developing head-and-shoulders top, a pattern that would be resolved with a sustained violation of support around the 120 mark. Looking ahead, a close atop first resistance around 123 would stabilize the IWM’s backdrop, while a break atop the July peak would wreck the bearish pattern.\nViewed in isolation, the Russell 2000 is vulnerable to a technical breakdown based on today’s backdrop.\nMeanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s MDY, -1.23% backdrop remains tenuous, but comparably stronger.\nConsider that it’s compressing between the major moving averages, topping Monday almost precisely at the 50-day moving average, currently 175.10.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["https://buy.wsj.com/shopandbuy/order/subscribe.jsp?trackCode=aap4rt8r"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:12:02.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
