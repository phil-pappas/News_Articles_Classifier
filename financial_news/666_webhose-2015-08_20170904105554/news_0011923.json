Cisco, on the other hand, has been investing in products and services such as data analytics software, security and cloud-management tools.\nLast year, Apple partnered with International Business Machines Corp to sell iPhones and iPads loaded with applications geared at enterprise clients.\nApple's shares were marginally down at $112.84 in late-afternoon trading, while Cisco was down about 1 percent at $25.75.
