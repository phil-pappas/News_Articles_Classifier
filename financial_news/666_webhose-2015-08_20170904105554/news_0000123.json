GlobalWebIndex said that figure, which is actually 34% of global Tinder users , was based on 1,282 adults who said they had used Tinder in the last month. (Unlike many dating apps, Tinder links to your Facebook account and usually displays people’s real first names.)\nTinder’s social media team responded to Sales this week in a series of irate tweets , citing its own survey of 265,000 users that found only 1.7% of Tinder users were married and, in the process, generating a lot of publicity for the site. But while married people listing their status as single (or not listing a status at all) is probably among the worst lie (or omission) made on a dating app, studies show that the Twitter war over married people masquerading as singletons may have missed a bigger point: Most online daters lie about something in order to attract a partner.\nMore than half of online daters (54%) said dates have “seriously misrepresented” themselves in their profiles, according to a 2013 study by the nonprofit Pew Research Center’s “Internet & American Life Project.” Men will typically add one to two inches in height, while women will shave 10 pounds off their weight, says Dan Slater, author of “Love in the Time of Algorithms: What Technology Does to Meeting and Mating.” And many people readily admit to having a “Grindr” or “Tinder” age (making themselves younger, of course, not older than they are in real life.)\nRead: Lonely, single people are being blamed for America’s snacking frenzy\nOther studies support this thesis. Over half of U.S. online daters lie on their profiles, according to another survey by global research company Opinion Matters commissioned by BeautifulPeople.com, a site where members vote on whether (or not) to accept new members. What’s more, U.S. online daters lie more than their U.K. counterparts by a difference of 9 percentage points (53% versus 44%), the survey found. Greg Hodge, managing director of that site, attributes the difference to a more pervasive celebrity culture in the U.S. where certain people may feel under more pressure to live up to a physical ideal.\nAnd the smartphone camera can lie. In fact, it’s become easier to lie about your appearance since those surveys were released. Adobe Photoshop, which once charged hundreds of dollars for its software, now charges only $9.99 a month for a desktop version. It competes with photo-retouching apps like Line Camera, free on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating system, and FaceTune, which costs 99 cents for iOS and Android. Digital cameras also have sophisticated soft-focus settings. (Read: “ 10 biggest online dating photo mistakes .”)\nThe tacit knowledge that people are likely stretching the truth in their dating profiles doesn’t deter lonely hearts from looking for love online, which has almost replaced bars as the place to meet significant others. Around one-third of American marriages now begin online , are less likely to end, and are associated with slightly higher marital satisfaction rates than those of couples who met offline, according to one study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Of couples who met online, 5.9% broke up, versus 7.6% of those who met offline.\nAlso see: 10 things dating sites won’t tell you\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.globalwebindex.net/blog/why-tinder-has-a-lot-of-positives-to-shout-about", "http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:24:18.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
