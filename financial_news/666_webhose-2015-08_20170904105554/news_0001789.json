In value terms, demand fell by 24% year-on-year (y-o-y).\nInvestment demand also slipped due to the falling prices of gold. Total investment demand during the period was down 30% y-o-y at 36.5 tonnes.\nGlobally, too, gold demand fell with the major hit coming from India and China, the council said. Overall demand was down by 12% in volume terms in the April-June period.\n“It’s been a challenging market for gold this quarter, particularly in Asia, on the back of falls in India and China. The reverse is true for western jewellery markets, as increased economic confidence led to continued growth in consumer demand. It is fair to say that investment demand for the quarter remained muted given the continuing recovery in the US economy and booming stock markets in India and China during the quarter,” Alistair Hewitt, head of market intelligence at the World Gold Council, said in a statement.\nThe council, however, expects a pick-up in demand during the upcoming festival and wedding season. Also, Indian consumers typically buy more gold when gold prices fall.\n“Jewellery market prospects look healthier for the remainder of the year with the upcoming wedding and festival season in India. In addition, falls in the gold price have historically triggered buying in price sensitive markets and we are already seeing early indications of this across Asia and the Middle East,” said Hewitt.\nSince the start of this year, MCX Gold is down 4.4% to Rs. 25,597 per 10 grams. Globally, gold prices are down 5.3% to $1122.42 per troy ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:22:00.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
