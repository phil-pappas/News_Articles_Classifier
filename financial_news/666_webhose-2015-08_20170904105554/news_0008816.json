Advertising Print This Post The UK-based broker MCM FX has recently started offering binary options trading based on the technology of the provider GWAZY. As part of its promotional activities, MCM FX is now also sponsoring a competition in the GWAZY League. The offering was launched earlier this year , as a user-friendly interface for a unique trading competition experience. Anyone over the age of eighteen can join the GWAZY League and participate in free trading competitions and challenges where they can win gadgets, prizes or live accounts, depending on what is offered by the sponsors. All brokers who currently sponsor competitions and promotions also offer live trading. “The exciting gaming environment offered by the GWAZY platform opens new doors to brokers, giving them the opportunity to capture different market segments as most trading platforms that are currently available in the market reflect more ‘traditional’ trading methods. We would like to welcome MCM FX on board and look forward to more FX and Binary brokers joining us” said Martin, Head of Development at GWAZY Ltd. The GWAZY platform was launched as an alternative method to FX trading, designed for beginners and people who are interested in trading but in a stress free environment. The solution offers FX and binary options brokers, the chance to launch within two weeks and zero setup costs. The package includes a platform, manager, tools, media kit and reporting system. By sponsoring promotions and competitions, brokers can increase the popularity of their brand and eventually boost their business performance. The platform is available in English, Arabic, Farsi and Chinese. Got a news tip?
