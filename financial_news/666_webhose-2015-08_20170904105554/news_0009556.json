Courtesy of Dior by Jo Ellison Paris in July, and the couture shows were staged beneath a cloak of humidity. Fashion's most exclusive clientele wilted beside catwalks showing autumn clothes.\nFor these few days, the world's most sought-after customers gather in the city for fittings and appointments at the great design ateliers. In recent years, however, the clients have been drawn to couture less by the clothes around which the week is staged and more by the search for another glittering prize altogether.\nWhile the collections are displayed in vast theatres, each one more dramatic than the last, these treasures are exhibited in glass vitrines in small darkened rooms, brightened only by the tiny spotlights that bounce light off their many dazzling facets.\nThey are discussed with whispered awe, minded by burly bodyguards and priced upon application. This is the world of high jewellery: limited collections of bespoke jewels that are the pinnacle of craftsmanship and which often cost millions of dollars.\nVictoire de Castellane, jeweller to couturier Christian Dior, likes to take a playful attitude to her dazzlingly opulent creations. She prefers women to choose - and buy - their own jewels. Bertrand Rindoff Petroff High jewellery, unlike its cousin fine jewellery, was originally conceived as a way in which to present the largest and most opulent gemstones – its focus is big, bold and colourful. The pieces are typically unique and although some designs may translate into replication, the high-jewellery market is about the one of a kind.\nWhile the original marketplace for such pieces has traditionally been the Biennale des Antiquaires, staged every second September at the Grand Palais in Paris, in recent years high jewellery collections have emerged as an ancillary fixture to the July couture shows, with the various design houses unveiling their latest creations to capitalise on the passing trade.\nIt makes sense, perhaps, that if one is in town to be fitted for couture gowns, one might also like to pick up a set of diamond-encrusted earrings to complete one's new wardrobe.\nCertainly, the workrooms are a flurry of hushed activity at the Dior headquarters on Avenue Montaigne when I arrive to meet Victoire de Castellane, the creative director of jewellery at Dior since 1998. It's two days after Dior's couture show and a brisk stream of traffic moves across the atelier's pale-grey carpeted floors as clients arrive for their appointments with a battalion of seamstresses who hover in the shadows.\n The Soie Dior collection by Victoire de Castellane is, she says, inspired by the materials of couture, silk and grosgrain ribbons. Courtesy of Dior Above the fitting rooms, I am escorted around the high jewellery collection, where de Castellane's latest collection, Soie Dior, is being unveiled: 53 pieces - estimated to cost between €170,000 ($257,000) and €2.8m each - with dazzling designs inspired by the materials of couture, silk and grosgrain ribbons. The baguette and brilliantine gemstones appear to scroll and twist like fabric.\n\"When you play with a ribbon, it's instinctive, ephemeral, and I wanted to keep that notion of freedom,\" explains de Castellane. \"As we are in a couture house, I play with the identities and, for me, the ribbon is a fantastic identity because it's never the same movement, so there are endless possibilities and they are all unique. So I started with the ribbon and I played with it.\"\nDressed in black, with a poker-straight fringe and a panther's grace, the 53-year-old is as arresting to behold as are her designs; she looks strong and bold yet incredibly feminine.\nBorn into a great French aristocratic family, de Castellane first started playing with jewels as a child, and jewellery, she says, has continued to represent the same emotional comfort and escape she associated it with in her youth.\nBrilliant jewels, here by Victoire de Castellane of Dior, who says, \"I was so happy all the women were the customers. Men were just a bit lazy because they didn't understand all this figurative and narrative jewellery, because they were thinking only of diamonds . . . but women were completely into this.\" Courtesy of Dior \"I knew that this would be my world, because I was a shy and lonely little girl,\" she explains. \"My parents divorced when I was very young and I was an only child. So I saw my mother very sad, and I think I wanted to help her to fight. I said to myself: 'Life is so sad that I am going to jump into a world that I am going to create. So I jumped into my imaginary world, which was made up of beautiful stones and shining gold and women.\"\nDe Castellane has never lost her sense of marvel in the design studio. She attributes the greedy scale of her pieces to the same sense she had, as a child, of trying on adult jewellery.\n\"My grandmother had a lot of jewellery and when I was a little girl I'd try it on my hand and it was so huge! I always keep this in mind. I'm always creating with my spirit child, with my soul child,\" she adds. \"I can't do it another way.\"\nBefore Dior, de Castellane spent 14 years at Chanel designing costume jewellery and she continues to delight in throwing things into supersized relief and playing with clashing colour schemes; her own designs, which she continues to make, are vast, fantastical botanic creations that unfurl in psychotropic colourways.\n\"I love to make colours fight,\" she says of her approach. \"I love to make them contrasting but I hate when one is a little not happy with the other, so for me it is important that they complement each other, that the contrast is right.\"\nHer playful aesthetic is the perfect fit for high jewellery, where big is always best. \"Yes, we can say opulence,\" she says of her designs. \"Also, we can say, I don't know, generous.\"\nDe Castellane's designs for Dior show more restraint but she plays fast and loose with the house codes, taking inspiration from what she sees as its tropes (\"flowers from the embroideries and Christian Dior's garden; classicism, because Dior was a classics man, with the love of the 18th century; Versailles, Marie Antoinette ... \") while producing pretty, technically demanding pieces.\nIn the Soie collection, the most challenging item, the Ganse ring that appears to rise like a bouquet from the finger, required 12 separate appointments with the workshop to get the delicate setting to balance satisfactorily.\nWhile for the ribbon pieces, she says, \"the challenge for the workshop was to translate something very soft into a hard, precious metal like gold. With all the stone sets, everything had to be in movement to look like it is something soft and light.\"\nDe Castellane's boundless imagination has meant reintroducing ancient techniques to a workshop of master craftsmen. But hers is not a scholarly interest. She draws her designs and then pushes the workshop to deliver the results. \"And we always succeed,\" she says, smiling gracefully. One suspects failure is not an option.\nYet it is perhaps de Castellane's singular femininity that sets her jewels apart in this rarefied world. With her unapologetically romantic vision, the designer has slowly shifted the language of jewellery away from the giant diamonds of old and towards something gentler and more interesting.\nShe is considered by many to be the godmother of modern jewellery, and the influence of her style can be felt throughout the industry. She has paved the way for a generation of female jewellery designers whose focus is the pleasure of other women; one thinks particularly of designers such as Aurélie Bidermann and her apple-core charms, and Delfina Delletrez, who designs surrealist pieces inspired by Dalí.\nAs those streaming into the atelier around her testify, today's high-jewellery client is as likely to be a woman as a man, and perhaps especially so at Dior, where, as de Castellane points out, her jewels draw on a more direct emotional narrative.\n\"When I started with Dior for my first collection I was so happy all the women were the customers. Men were just a bit lazy because they didn't understand all this figurative and narrative jewellery, because they were thinking only of diamonds . . . but women were completely into this.\"\nI wonder what she makes of a remark made recently by Johann Rupert, chairman of the Richemont group, when he described jewels as something purchased by men for their wives (\"or mistresses\").\n\"The idea of waiting for a gift!\" de Castellane snorts with laughter. \"That you didn't choose. I hate the idea of [a man] buying for his woman or his wife. I saw a Chinese client yesterday,\" she continues. \"She bought for herself three sets of jewels - a yellow diamond, an emerald one and another. She was so happy and I thought, wow, that's a really powerful woman.\"\nFor de Castellane, however, jewels will never simply be a sign of visible wealth. At the heart of her design process she is still a five-year-old girl trying on family heirlooms.\n\"It's an archaic feeling. It's on your skin, it's very intimate. You are living with something that when you die, will remain after you. I love the idea that when I'm wearing my grandmother's ring, she's still with me. Jewellery joins all the dots of the woman. And as long as this is true, my mission continues.\"\nThe Financial Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:11:41.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
