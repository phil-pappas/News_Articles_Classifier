The movie about an ice princess was one of the top films in box office history, accumulating some $1.3 billion worldwide. \n- High-end clothes - \nDisney is not only about toys -- it is also delving into the world of high fashion, joining forces with trendy retailers like Vans, specialty shops such as Opening Ceremony and star labels such as Comme des Garcons and Marc Jacobs. \nAfter a first collaboration based on a simple Mickey Mouse sweater, Jacobs' autumn-winter 2015 collection included a series of items inspired by Snow White -- with price tags between $2,000 and $5,000. \nTo mark this year's live-action remake of the animated classic \"Cinderella,\" Disney worked with top-end shoe designers Jimmy Choo (LSE: CHOO.L - news ) and Stuart Weitzman to reinvent the iconic glass slipper. \nCatering towards a more mainstream audience with a smaller pocketbook, Japanese label D Style launched a line of Disney clothing targeting young women featuring images of classic characters such as Mickey, Minnie and Donald Duck. \nThe line is slated to arrive in the United States in October -- with a website for fashionistas. \nDisney will also continue its partnership with Japanese company Uniqlo that began in April. The store will roll out over the next 18 months a line of T-shirts featuring Mickey's silhouette in unusual prints, including patchwork denim. \nFollowing the success of \"Star Wars: Rebels,\" a cartoon series targeting young boys, Disney is also adapting its wacky superhero movie \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" -- one of the biggest box office successes of 2014 -- into an animated television show. \nAnd long-haired princess film \"Tangled\" -- about Rapunzel -- is also being adapted for the small screen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T22:22:45.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
