Clendening is no longer with the company.\nMcCool's shift to a strategic role was unexpected because of his more than 30-year association with Schwab Chief Executive Walt Bettinger. They began working together in 1984 at The Hampton Company, an Ohio-based retirement plan company that Bettinger founded in 1983 and sold to Schwab in 1995.\nWhen Bettinger was elevated to President and CEO in 2008, he made McCool head of Schwab's retirement division and its rapidly growing unit servicing independent financial advisers and their customers. Schwab subsequently merged the retirement business into another unit.\nIn addition to his recent role overseeing products, McCool ran Schwab's international businesses and focused on cash and margin lending products, its charitable foundation and new advisory businesses, according to the company's website. Those responsibilities are being dispersed among several executives.\nEarlier this year, Schwab said it was seeking a replacement for Joe Martinetto, its longtime chief financial officer who was promoted to senior executive vice president and expanding his role beyond finance. On Tuesday, Gable wrote that Martinetto will remain CFO \"for the foreseeable future.\" (Reporting by Jed Horowitz; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Bill Rigby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T02:00:13.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
