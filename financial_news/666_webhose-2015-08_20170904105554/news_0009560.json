Most trucks burn twice that much fuel, the company said.\nSome technologies used in the SuperTruck are far off in terms of mass production. For instance, the SuperTruck engineers used a hybrid-electric powertrain and waste-heat recovery technology that aren’t commercially viable yet. But some are. For example, the truck has “eCoast”, which automatically disengages the transmission when the truck is coasting.\nSolar panels run the length of the truck’s trailer, helping to charge the battery, which in turn powers the trailer’s heating and/or air conditioning system. Freightliner engineers spent five years developing the truck.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T00:12:50.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
