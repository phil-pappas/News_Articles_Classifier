He had one or two things that he wished we could have handled differently. He undertook to comply with the findings and remedial actions... so I am surprised that he has taken a different tone.\" \nHowever, Madonsela said this was consistent with what she faced while she was conducting her investigation. \n\"One thing was said and [it contradicted] another that was said. The narrative he would send us would say one thing and the document supplied would say another story. \n\"I am sad, but the investigation is continuing and the fact that he no longer works for Prasa doesn't change things, because he still resides in the Republic of South Africa.\" \nShe said her office would still be communicating with Montana and he was free to further engage with them to understand how she arrived at the findings and the remedial action. \n\"Where we say [in the report] this went wrong, we indicated how it went wrong. Secondly we also say where Prasa had done well. And the third approach was if there was inconclusive evidence we said that there was inconclusive evidence. \n\"None of the evidence was found on a hunch. It was based on the evidence we had,\" said Madonsela. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:31:41.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
