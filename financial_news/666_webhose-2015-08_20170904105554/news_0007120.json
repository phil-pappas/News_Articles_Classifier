Photo: Joe Armao\nWas this a billionaire's dummy spit?\nNo matter who you talk to, they all have the same verdict: the Federation Centre's board knew Steven Sewell's management style for three years, so why now?\nWhat was effectively a reverse takeover last year, of which Mr Sewell was a chief architect, to take control of Novion Property has now gone the other way. Novion has come up trumps.\nFollowing the abrupt departure of Mr Sewell, and last month his finance director, Tom Honan, the main executive team are all now Novion people, leaving the Federation team reverse-engineered out the door.\nAdvertisement Federation chairman Peter Hay is from Novion, as is the \"new\" CEO, Angus McNaughton, and CFO, Richard Jamieson. The main shareholder of the merged entity is billionaire John Gandel, with a 17 per cent stake.\nUnder a scheme of arrangement, dubbed a merger, Federation, which grew out of the shell of the beleaguered Centro Properties, made advances to merge with Novion. In a reverse bid, the deal had to be approved by Novion unit-holders.\nIt passed in June at a meeting in Sydney that ran for 30 minutes, with Mr Sewell presiding as the \"hand-picked\" chief executive of what will become a $22 billion retail trust called Vicinity.\nAs one institutional fund manager said, \"They have known Steven for three years, his management style and culture, so why know? He has gone from a rooster to a feather duster.\"\nIt's a decision that can be interpreted as calling into question the professional judgment of Federation's board.\n\"This just appears to be a billionaire's dummy spit by the cornerstone investor in Vicinity, and previously Novion, John Gandel,\" was another comment.\nIt's been said Mr Gandel did not like Quote: s from Mr Sewell that he had been \"hand-picked\" to run the group by Mr Gandel.\nThe thinking is that Mr Sewell has run afoul of Mr Gandel and so he had to go. The board seems to have turned on a 5Â¢ piece with this decision.\nSpeaking to the media on Monday, Mr Hay made it clear there was no specific reason for Mr Sewell's departure, before adding: \"We are not keeping secrets from investors and shareholders and there is nothing untoward in the decision. Steven leaves with our best wishes.\n\"The board looked at what was best for the company in the long run,\" Mr Hay said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:48:37.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
