A fall in revenues, largely due to the drop in the oil price, means that the government has projected a $39 billion budget deficit for this year. \nHowever, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thinks that the budget deficit could balloon to $130 billion in 2015, and has warned that Saudi Arabia will need “a sizeable fiscal consolidation” in the coming years. \nFrom a high of around $737 billion last year, the Gulf state now has $672 billion held as foreign exchange reserves. \nIn March and April alone, foreign reserves dropped by $31 billion, according to a report from Jadwa Research. \nSaudi Arabia has one of the lowest rates of government debt for any large economy, at around 1.6 percent of GDP as of the end of last year, according to the IMF.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:19:00.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
