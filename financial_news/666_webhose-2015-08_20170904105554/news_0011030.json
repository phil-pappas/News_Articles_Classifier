Amidst global volatility, Congress should protect the momentum of our growing economy (not kill it). We must avoid shutdown / austerity. — President Obama (@POTUS) August 27, 2015 \nThe warning comes on the heels of positive economic news on Thursday morning. The Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy expanded by 3.7 percent in the second quarter — much more than originally expected. ADVERTISEMENT Obama’s warning also comes roughly a week before Congress returns to Capitol Hill after its August recess and about a month before the deadline to keep the government funded.\nLawmakers must pass a new funding measure by Oct. 1 to prevent a shutdown. \nMany conservatives are calling for defunding Planned Parenthood as it comes under fire over its fetal tissue program. More than a dozen House lawmakers have warned Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) that they won’t support legislation that continues to fund the organization. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has repeatedly promised he would not allow a shutdown on his watch.
