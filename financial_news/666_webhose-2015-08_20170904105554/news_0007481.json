Photo: Justin McManus\n The Abbott government has given it's strongest signal yet that it will not implement a recommendation to ban do-it-yourself super funds from borrowing to invest in property.\n\"In the final report of the financial system inquiry, which the government commissioned David Murray to prepare, he recommended a complete ban on limited recourse borrowing arrangements in SMSFs,\" Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday.\n\"I want to emphasise that we have been considering this recommendation very carefully but flag that we want to make sure the approach we take is proportionate to the risks that have been identified.\"\nMr Frydenberg said he was troubled by stories of property spruikers pushing people to set up an SMSF so they could borrow against their retirement savings to make speculative property investments. However he said it was important to acknowledge that such events were the exception rather than the rule.\nAdvertisement Analysis showed that borrowing to buy property represented only a very small proportion of the total pool of assets invested in the $580 billion SMSF sector and that most of this was invested by business owners in commercial property.\n\"To put it in context only 0.07 per cent, perhaps 6,500 properties, were held in an SMSF through a limited recourse borrowing arrangement in 2013,\" he said.\n\"David Murray highlighted the risks associated with increased leverage in the financial system. Increased leverage always represents a risk and we recognise that. The government also recognises that most SMSFs do the right thing\".\nBorrowing rules could be tightened Tightening the rules around how SMSFs can borrow to invest, instead of placing an outright ban on the practice, remains \"under consideration\", he said.\nMr Frydenberg made the comments at the Tax Institute annual superannuation conference in Sydney on Friday.\nAsked whether he thought targeting action against property spruikers was a better solution than limiting the SMSF borrowing rules Mr Frydenberg said that was certainly an option.\nMore detail will be given when the government delivers its formal response to the financial system inquiry, which is expected in coming weeks.\nInvestor groups have lobbied against the recommendation to outlaw borrowing within SMSFs, arguing it would be an overblown response that disadvantaged the vast majority of trustees who were using debt responsibly in an effort to better provide for their own retirement.\nSMSF Association executive Graeme Colley told Fairfax Media in July he was confident the government would reach agreement on a compromise.\nAlternatives to an outright ban put forward by a range of SMSF groups include forcing stricter limits on the proportion of super savings a person can borrow, and scrapping personal guarantees.\nAustralian Securities and Investments Commissioner Greg Tanzer said earlier this month the watchdog was investigating about 10 real estate agents in relation to business practices that push people to use their super for speculative investments.\n\"We consider this practice is not appropriate and are taking actions to stop it,\" he said.\nMr Tanzer made his comments to a Parliamentary Joint Committee in response to questions from Nationals Senator John Williams who has called on the regulator to crack down on unscrupulous property spruikers .\nUnder the rules now, a person can set up a self-managed super fund for the purpose of getting a loan to buy an investment property that will be held in a separate trust.\nThe trustee receives any investment returns earned from the property, but if the loan defaults the bank's rights are limited to the value of the trust's assets.\nThis structure is designed to protect people from losing all their super. But the borrower, in most cases, has to provide a personal guarantee in case the investment goes bad, usually against the family home.\nMr Murray's report found the amount of these loans has increased almost 18 times in the five years to 2014 to hit $8.7 billion, which would exacerbate the impact of any downturn in the now booming in Sydney and Melbourne.\nA number of banks have already started tightening their approval processes in recent months.\nFlexible contribution caps under consideration Mr Frydenberg again emphasised that the government is committed to its promise \"not to make any unexpected or adverse changes to superannuation this term\".\nHowever he did flag the annual cap on voluntary super contributions as one policy area under review that might merit changes in the future.\n\"It is an area worthy of consideration whether we need more flexibility to allow for people with broken work patterns top up their super,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\nIn a joint submission to the tax inquiry last month seven SMSF advocacy groups called for the urged the government to replace the annual cap on superannuation contributions with a rolling or lifetime cap.\nMr Frydenberg also said the government was closely considering submissions to its tax inquiry outlining how the law could be changed to make it easier for financial services providers to develop more innovative retirement income products.\nA need to improving the retirement income solutions market was another focus of Mr Murray's inquiry.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/can-a-compromise-be-found-for-selfmanaged-super-fund--investment-property-borrowing-ban-20150728-gilxa7", "http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/senator-john-williams-pushs-asic-crackdown-on-smsf-property-spruikers-20150812-gixe44", "http://www.afr.com/news/policy/tax/selfmanaged-super-funds-want-end-to-contribution-cap-20150724-gijnjo"], "published": "2015-08-21T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T14:04:15.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
