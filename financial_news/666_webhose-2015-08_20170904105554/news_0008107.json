Women's birth control choice depends on relationship, sex An Indian-origin researcher in US has received a $380,000 grant to carry out research that may lead to a fast, low-cost test to diagnose patients with Alzheimer’s by listening to their voices, even over the phone.\nSona Patel, Professor at the Seton Hall University in New Jersey is conducting research on the vocal impacts of the disorder.\nPatel is building her study based on previous research that indicated differences in voice patterns between normally ageing adults, and those with Parkinson’s disease.\n“Your voice is really important,” Patel was Quote: d as saying by the NJ.com.\n“You react to (stimuli) with your voice automatically, without even realising it…now, the question is if we can use (voices) to indicate other neurological disorders,” said Patel.\nPatel has received a USD 380,000, three-year grant from the National Institute of Deafness and Communicative Disorders to carry out research at Seton Hall’s Voice Analytics and Neuropsychology Lab in South Orange.\nShe is using electroencephalogram (EEG), and auditory feedback testing to determine how Alzheimer’s patients respond to various speech tasks, and if their responses differ from those of Parkinson’s patients, and normally ageing adults.\nIn case her research indicates changes in voice patterns, Patel said it could be possible to develop non-invasive, less expensive methods to detect whether or not a person in the early stages of a disease has Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s.\nThe test would be simple to administer, and could even potentially be done over the phone, she said.\nPatel said that would not only increase early detection in the US, but could have a great impact on third world countries, where the disease is often never properly diagnosed or treated.\n 18, 2015 7:46 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:27:20.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
