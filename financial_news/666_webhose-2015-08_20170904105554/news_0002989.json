I had no hurry that day. Not that I could go around the city gaping at buildings or wondering why the dickens cars flocked on the roads, but there was nothing demanding my immediate attention and I had a couple of hours to spare. \nThat is a lot of time in the modern world. I wanted to take Samora Avenue, which in the sixties and early seventies was called Independence. However, I decided against that. \nThis street is unpredictable. It could be a dual way today, but a one-way street tomorrow. Yesterday it was one-way northward. \nToday it is one-way southward. Those changes take place, in so far as I could see, at the whims of the city fathers. You never know what changes the city mothers could decide there and when. \nJust to play it safe I took another street to Mnazi Mmoja and found myself along Indira Gandhi Street. Somewhere along that street I came upon a building. It was a sixteen storey structure. \nOpposite it on the other side of the street was the rubble of its twin building that had collapsed on 29 March 2013 killing several people and injuring scores of others. \nThe two buildings are said to belong to one Raza Huseein Damji who constructed a 16-storey building instead of 10 he was allowed on the permit. \nImmediately after the disaster the standing building, which also had 16 storeys was given a thorough safety inspection and discovered to have cracks that made it a risky structure. \nThe relevant authorities ordered its demolition. Almost two and a half years later the building is still standing with no activities of demolition anywhere near it. \nIts sight has set tongues wagging and people say the owner is using the time factor to make the people forget and continue the building's completion. \n\"He is waiting for President Kikwete's government to end its reign and start working on the building,\" a passerby who saw Reporter at Large taking shots of the building said. \n\"This structure has been found to be faulty, but corruption has prevented its demolition.\" Construction experts in the city may have found a better way of dealing with the building. \nHowever, the fact that it still stands there so many years after the disastrous accident of the 2013 has raised difficult questions. \nIt is understood that a probe team was formed to look into the building's condition and make a considerable assessment as to whether it should be pulled down or left be finished. \nThe report of that investigation was never made public if it ever was made in the first place. People say there is a lot going on behind the scenes. \nRaza is reported to have several buildings in the city. Having lost one - the one that collapsed in March 2013 - he is not going to lose another one if he can save it and he will use all and every means to ensure he saves it. \nThe 29 March 2013 construction accident killed 36 people. More people have died in some similar accidents. Nearly all of them have happened at an early construction stage. \nEssentially though, the accidents have been said to a result of a lousy job. Construction of multi-storey buildings should be done by construction experts only. \nBut corruption has wreaked the industry and there are many bogus builders doing the job. It is easy for bogus builder of buildings to masquerade as a good constructor. \nNo matter how well the architect may have done their job, the building can still collapse at some stage of its construction if the person building it does not follow specifications of its construction. \nThe collapse of a building during its construction is embarrassing and should be a discomforting experience to the constructors. \nAt some stage of its construction every so often inspection of the job should be done to ensure safety standards are adhered to. Professionally, a thorough assessment of the whole work ought to be made and the structure handed over as safe and secure. Most surprising still is how a building can collapse while under construction. \nMost blamed as the cause of such a sad result is corruption. When people responsible for a disaster of such dimension with the loss of so many lives are left to walk away Scott free there is fear of many deaths and the future of construction industry becomes bleak. Dar residents, indeed the nation at large, feel the city authorities owe them an answer. \nWhen will they be ensured of safety of this building at the corner of Indira Gandhi and Ithna Asheri mosque? Surely there is corruption that one should be totally ashamed of because it, most of all, erodes one's moral obligation. \nWhy is that building still standing there?
