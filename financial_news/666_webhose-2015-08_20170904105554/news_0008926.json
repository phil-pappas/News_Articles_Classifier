And welcome to the LifePoint Health second-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. \nOn today's call LifePoint will be making forward-looking statements based upon management's current expectations. Numerous factors could cause LifePoint's results to differ from these expectations and LifePoint has outlined these factors in its filings with the SEC. The Company encourages you to review these filings. \nLifePoint also asks that you please review the cautionary language under the caption important legal information in the Company's press release issued this morning. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or make any other forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \nAlso, please visit LifePoint's website for links to various information and filings. \n(Operator Instructions) \nAs a reminder, the conference is being recorded on Friday, July 31, 2015. It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Bill Carpenter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LifePoint Health. Please go ahead, sir. \n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [2] \n\nThank you and welcome everyone to LifePoint Health's second-quarter 2015 earnings call. We hope you've had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. \nI'll begin by taking you through some of the highlights from the second quarter and then I'll hand the call over to Leif Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer for a closer look at our financial performance. Following our prepared remarks Leif and I as well as David Dill, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will be available to answer your questions. \nAs we begin the call this morning I'm pleased to note that this marks our first quarter with the Company's new name, LifePoint Health. LifePoint is not just a hospital operator but a healthcare provider across a full continuum of care including physician practices, post-acute services, and outpatient centers. \nAs LifePoint Health we are better reflecting our portfolio of healthcare service providers as well as our strategic direction. We're excited to continue making communities healthier by offering a range of health services and look forward to maintaining our high-quality standards. \nNow for our second-quarter results. The second quarter of 2015 was in line with our expectations and underscores the confidence we have in our growth strategy. For the quarter revenues from consolidated operations were $1.27 billion, an increase of approximately 21% over last year. \nAdjusted EBITDA was $175 million, up by approximately 10% from a year ago. And diluted earnings per share were $1, an increase of approximately 19% over the second quarter of 2014. \nFor the quarter, same store equivalent admissions increased by 1.8%. Our performance once again demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy. We have many exciting initiatives underway that are driving growth while continuously improving quality of care. \nOver the last several years we have completed acquisitions as LifePoint, as part of Duke LifePoint and through other partnerships we have established around the country such as our partnership with Norton Healthcare in Kentucky and Southern Indiana. We've added $1.2 billion in acquired revenue over the last two years. We've entered into new and growing markets such as Warrenton, Virginia and Johnstown Pennsylvania as well as enhanced our position in markets such as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and states like North Carolina. \nWe have in place integration processes that are scalable. Our practice is to bring acquired hospitals in line with Company margins over three to four years. Given our recent acquisitions and active pipeline, we have the opportunity to grow EBITDA and cash flow substantially in the coming years. \nWith respect to our recent activity we expect to close on our acquisitions of Clark Memorial Hospital in Jeffersonville, Indiana and Fleming County Hospital in Flemingsburg, Kentucky later today. We also expect to close on Watertown Regional Medical Center in Watertown, Wisconsin at the end of August. These assets will add approximately $300 million in annual net revenue to the Company. \nAdditionally, as has been reported in local markets, we have signed letters of intent to acquire St. Francis Hospital in Columbus, Georgia and Providence Hospitals in Columbia, South Carolina. These two would add an additional $600 million to annual net revenue upon closing. Our ability to acquire, integrate and expand margins is reflected in our financial results and our ability to continue to grow our pipeline gives us confidence in the future. \nThe Affordable Care Act continues to be a positive for LifePoint. We ended the quarter with $1.5 million in incremental EBITDA contributions from healthcare reform. We're pleased with the outcome of King v. Burwell which should settle the question about the survival of the Affordable Care Act and we believe will translate into further Medicaid expansion. \nWe expect states that were waiting on the sidelines to once again evaluate the opportunity. Although not a LifePoint state, for example Alaska announced that it will move forward with Medicaid expansion and Utah which is a LifePoint state reported that it will participate this year. \nLifePoint remains a strong proponent of expansion including in our home state of Tennessee where we will continue to encourage our state legislature to demonstrate leadership. This is an important opportunity to provide coverage to some of the most at-risk citizens across the country. \nIn addition to our successful growth strategies, our commitment to quality and safety has become a differentiator for us. LifePoint designed a national quality program in collaboration with Duke University Health System to build upon our recent accomplishments in patient safety through the hospital engagement network. \nAs part of the LifePoint National Quality Program, hospitals are eligible to receive the designation as a Duke LifePoint Quality Affiliate when they meet rigorous standards of performance, leadership and patient engagement. We're proud to recognize Clark Regional Medical Center in Winchester, Kentucky as the first hospital to receive this designation. Through the LifePoint National Quality Program we're providing essential leadership in making communities healthier, establishing us as the partner of choice for many hospitals. \nI want to knowledge the departure of Marilyn Tavenner from our Board of Directors. Shortly after becoming a LifePoint Board member Marilyn was offered the opportunity which resulted in her appointment as CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans. \nWe certainly understand her need to divert her full time and attention to this new rule. The healthcare industry remains fortunate to have Marilyn as a leader during this time of change and we wish her well. \nIn conclusion, our teams across the organization are performing well and delivering superior care to our patients, executing on our acquisition and integration plans and managing costs. Our differentiated strategy makes us the partner of choice for many community hospitals and will continue to provide value for our shareholders. \nI'll turn the call over to Leif now for an in-depth review of our second-quarter results as well as an update on our guidance for the second half of the year. Leif? \n\nLeif Murphy, LifePoint Health, Inc. - EVP & CFO [3] \n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. As Bill said we had another solid quarter in line with our expectations. I will start with an overview of the main drivers of our second-quarter results and then finish with an update to our guidance for the year. \nStarting with volume, while same hospital admissions were down 4.2% for the quarter, for the second-quarter 2015 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year, equivalent admissions were up 1.8%. This increase in same hospital equivalent admissions was driven primarily by a 4% increase in emergency department visits, partially offset by 1.3% decrease in total surgeries. \nOur same hospital total surgeries declined primarily as a result of a decrease in certain low acuity outpatient surgeries. On a same hospital basis, our Medicare case mix index increased by 2.9% to 1.41 for the second quarter of 2015. \nSame hospital one-day stay admissions continue to decline, down 7.3% during the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of the prior year. We continue to believe that the reduction in one-day stays is generally reflective of industry trends toward outpatient services and not the result of the two-midnight rule. \nTurning to pricing, during the current quarter as compared to last year net revenue per equivalent admissions was up 2.6% on a same hospital basis and up 4% on a consolidated basis driven primarily by higher reimbursement rates from commercial payers. During the three months ended June 30, 2015 healthcare reform contributed an incremental $1.5 million approximately to revenue over the second quarter of 2014. We believe the total impact of new coverage under healthcare reform in the second quarter was between $13.5 million and $15.5 million in EBITDA with the low end of the range including only patients we treated previously as self-pay and the high end of the range also including new patients to LifePoint covered under health insurance exchange products. \nOur results for the second quarter of 2015 were in line with our expectations for reform and consistent with our previously issued guidance for 2015. Our revenues from consolidated operations in the quarter were up $223.4 million, or 21.3% to $1.27 billion as compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year. \nSame hospital revenues in the quarter compared with the second quarter of the prior year were up $44.6 million, or 4.5% reflecting strong same hospital volumes and improvements in reimbursement rates. Same hospital self-pay admissions were down approximately 13.5% and represented 4.5% of total admissions, down from 5% of total admissions in the second quarter of 2014. Same hospital self-pay emergency department visits were down approximately 8% and represented 14.7% of total emergency department visits, down from 16.6% in the second quarter of last year. \nIn our states that have expanded Medicaid we had seen self-pay emergency department visits continue to decline, down 16.7% and self-pay admissions continue to decline, down 20.5% when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. As we have discussed in previous quarters, although we continued to experience declines in our same hospital self-pay volumes during the second quarter of 2015, we have seen an increase in revenue related to co-pay and deductibles in our markets as the number of patients enrolled in insurance plans with higher patient responsibility has increased. \nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015, co-pay and deductible revenue before our provision for anticipated bad debts increased by $6.4 million, or approximately 12.2% to $58.6 million. Because these are difficult to collect, we have increased our provision for doubtful accounts on this revenue from approximately 52.5% in the second quarter of last year to approximately 55.7% in 2015. It's down slightly from 56% sequentially in the first quarter of 2015. \nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015 after deductions for bad debt, our co-pay and deductible revenue represented 2% of net revenue compared to 2.4% of net revenue in the same period of 2014. We remain focused on effective cost management in the quarter. As a percentage of revenues same hospital salary wage and benefit costs were flat at 46.4%. \nSame hospital supply costs improved by 50 basis points to 15.1% while same hospital other operating expenses increased by 30 basis points to 24.6% when compared to the second quarter of 2014. For the three months ended June 30, 2015 we recognized $14.2 million of meaningful use payments, consistent with our expectations. This is in comparison to $21 million of meaningful use payments recognized during the same quarter of last year. \nIn our second-quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA increased 10.3% to $175 million, an increase of $16.3 million from the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by our strong operating performance including the results of our recent acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an expected reduction in meaningful use income of approximately $6.8 million as previously discussed. \nOur second-quarter 2015 EBITDA margin declined by 140 basis points to 13.8% as compared to 15.2% in the same quarter of the prior year. The decline was primarily the result of margins for many of our recent acquisitions which as a group had a combined margin in the mid single digits in the quarter. \nAdditionally, we had an expected 90 basis points dilution from reductions in meaningful use income. Diluted earnings per share were $1 in the quarter, up $0.16 compared to $0.84 in the same quarter of the prior year. Our diluted earnings per share growth was driven by our strong operating performance during the quarter as well as the impact of our repurchase of approximately $25 million in shares of our common stock during the first quarter of 2015 under our Board approved repurchase plan and the full impact of all shares repurchased during 2014. \nAs of June 30, 2015 there were $75 million in shares remaining under our current authorization which expires in October of this year as well is $150 million under a new plan approved by our Board of Directors in June. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $188.4 million, beating our all-time record set in the first quarter earlier in the year. This represents an increase of $120.4 million or 177% from the same quarter of last year. \nOur operating cash flows in the quarter were positively impacted by increases in the amount and timing of cash receipts related to certain Medicaid DSH programs as well as decreases in the amount and timing of payments for interest in income taxes. We invested approximately $53.1 million in capital expenditures in the quarter and funded $12.5 million in acquisitions including working capital settlements. \nFree cash flow in the quarter was $135.3 million and after $18.8 million of cash proceeds received in connection with our sale of a hospital in Palatka, Florida that we announced last quarter cash increased by $140.9 million to $422.8 million as of June 30, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $8 million or 13.3% compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions. \nFinally, and consistent with our historical practice of updating guidance midway through the year, we have revised our guidance for full-year 2015 as detailed in our press release. Our updated guidance is adjusted to incorporate the following. \nFirst, it removes eight months of revenue and EBITDA estimated at $41.3 million and $2.7 million respectively for the divestiture of Palatka, Florida on May 1, 2015. Second, it incorporates our expectations for our recent acquisition in Roaring Spring, Pennsylvania and our anticipated transactions in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, Jeffersonville, Indiana and Watertown, Wisconsin. Annually we expect these transactions to generate approximately $320 million in revenue. \nProrated for their partial-year contributions in 2015 we expect them to generate approximately $140 million in revenue for the balance of the year and contribute less than 1% of revenue at the EBITDA line. We have not included our anticipated results of Providence Hospitals in Columbia, South Carolina or St. Francis Health System in Columbus, Georgia which we expect will ultimately contribute $250 million and $350 million respectively in revenue. \nConsistent with past practice we will wait to update our guidance until the transactions become definitive. As a result of these adjustments, we are increasing our revenue guidance to be in a range of $5.15 billion to $1.25 billion for the year. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $695 million to $720 million. \nWe now expect depreciation to be up to $290 million and we expect interest expense to be approximately $114 million. Finally, we expect earnings per share to fall in a range of $3.75 to $4.06 for the year. Depreciation expense associated with new acquisitions, operating at less than 1% EBITDA margins, results in an approximately $0.08 dilutive effect on EPS for the balance of the year. With regard to volume we are increasing the low end of our same hospital equivalent admissions guidance to be in a range of up 2.0% to up 3.0%. Finally, we expect our revenue per equivalent admissions to now be in a range of up 1% to up 2%. \nIn summary, we are making the right strategic moves, becoming more efficient operators and using our strong balance sheet to drive shareholder value. Additional information regarding our second-quarter results is available by reviewing our SEC filings including our 10-Q which we will file later today. \nWith that I will turn it over to Bill for some closing remarks. \n\nBill Carpenter, LifePoint Health, Inc. - Chairman & CEO [4] \n\nGreat, thanks Leif. We're pleased with the quarter and confident we are taking the right steps to continue to drive enhanced shareholder value. \nBefore we open up the call for questions I want to take this opportunity to thank all of LifePoint's talented employees and physicians who work hard every day to help us achieve our strategic objectives. I also look forward to welcoming our new employees, physicians and partners from Clark Memorial Hospital, Fleming County Hospital and Watertown Regional Medical Center in the very near future. \nWith that we'll take your questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T17:02:51.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
