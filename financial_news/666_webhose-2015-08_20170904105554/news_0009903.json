Share on twitter by Carrie LaFrenz Harvey Norman, the nation's largest white goods retailer, has posted its second year of double-digit profit growth as the housing market boom boosted sales at its stores.\n​Net profit climbed 26.6 per cent to $268.1 million in the year through June, also thanks to a $28.4 million rise in the estimated value of the retailer's property portfolio, which now stands at $2.32 billion.\nGlobal sales (excluding Singapore) from the franchised Harvey Norman stores rose 4.3 per cent to $6.02 billion, with same-store sales jumping by 4.6 per cent. Goldman Sachs analysts expected sales of $6.39 billion, while net profit was forecast to climb 23.7 per cent to $272.2 million. Bloomberg's net profit consensus estimate was slightly lower at $266.5 million.\nHarvey Norman chairman Gerry Harvey called it \"a good result that once again demonstrates the strength of our integrated retail, franchising, property and digital system.\n\"In what is still a generally challenging retail environment, we have seen further improvement in the performance of each of our business segments,\" he said.\nThe franchising operations segment increased 39.4 per cent to $200.4 million as the company reduced the level of tactical support it provides to its franchisees.\n\"While maintaining our investment in the Harvey Norman brand, tactical support has decreased by approximately 20 per cent in each of the past two years,\" Mr Harvey said.\nThe company-operated retail stores boosted their pretax profit by 42.9 per cent to $41 million on improved operational performances in countries like New Zealand, Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n Ireland and Northern Ireland have been major headache for Harvey Norman in the past few years. Trading losses from those markets have narrowed, although the benefit of this was offset by its business in Asia, where profits were weighed down by costs associated with new store openings.\nThe board flagged a fully-franked final dividend of 11¢ per share, to be paid on 1 December, ahead of the 9¢ dividend expected by analysts.\nThe retailer said 2015 had been \"a year of contrasts\", where the strong housing market in Australia partially compensated for subdued consumer confidence. Market share gains in some product categories countered sluggish overall demand, it said.\nThe company expects that continuing strength in the housing market will bolster its \"medium-term performance.\"\nFranchisee sales have increased 5.5 per cent and like-for-like sales have risen 6.6 per cent so far in the new financial year, Harvey Norman said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@carrielafrenz"], "published": "2015-08-28T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:05:25.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
