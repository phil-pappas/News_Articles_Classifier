Boyd said the FLRT ETF combines an active, top-down analysis with bottom-up security analysis. The fund also employs a modest amount of leverage to enhance the overall yield, and focuses on the larger, rated issuers within the loan universe. \n\"The bank loan funds right now are yielding about 5.5% on an index basis, and that's reflective of a selloff that we've seen in credit markets in general over the past several months,\" said Boyd, adding that investors won't see an immediate jump in income as rates tick higher. Instead, coupons will gradually increase as the Fed's tightening cycle moves forward. \nBoyd also said the asset class has proved less volatile than either plain vanilla bonds or high-yield bonds. In his view, the combination of bank loans floating rate structure, which reduces interest rate risk, and their seniority in corporate capital structures, which reduces total credit risk, both contribute to the lower volatility. \nMust Read: Why the Fed Is Losing Control of Interest Rates \n\"From a duration perspective, you are getting significantly less interest-rate risk, but high yield is yielding significantly more,\" said Boyd. \"If the market does very well, you will do better in those high-yield investments.\" \nRight now, there are worries about a liquidity crisis in the high-yield world, and that has been weighing on the market. Boyd said liquidity is not a problem in the bank loan world, but it does present its own unique challenges because bank loans are private issues, not securities with CUSIPs , so there is a longer settlement period. \n\"In a fund like ours, we are very conscious of liquidity, making sure we have liquidity in place at all times to respond to whatever market conditions are out there,\" said Boyd.
