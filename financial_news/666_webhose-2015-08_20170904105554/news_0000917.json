The capital the BoG wants us to inject into our operations is also something we are working on to raise. \n“We have some banks that we deal with. We also have some investors who are interested in our operations and are willing to help us raise the amount,” Mr. Delle added. \nHe stressed that DKM has some auxiliary businesses that would help raise the money adding, “customers should be rest assured, DKM will come back into operation soon,” he emphasized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:28:50.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
