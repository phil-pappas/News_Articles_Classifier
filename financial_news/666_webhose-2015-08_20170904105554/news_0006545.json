They last traded up 0.2 percent at $112.03 a share.\nStill TIPS lagged regular Treasuries on Thursday as TIPS yields fell less than nominal yields.\nThe yield premium on benchmark 10-year Treasuries over 10-year TIPS was last 1.57 percent, 0.3 basis point smaller than late on Wednesday. It contracted to 1.54 percent earlier which was the tightest since January.
