NEW DELHI: IFMR Holdings, a financial inclusion platform, today said it has raised $25 million (about Rs 163 crore) in equity from Accion, LeapFrog Investments and Lok Capital. Accion is investing $12.5 million of the total investment, while LeapFrog Investments will invest $9 million and Lok Capital $3.5 million, it said in statement.
