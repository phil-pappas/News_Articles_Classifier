He became an employee of Morgan Stanley in 2009 when it purchased Smith Barney from Citigroup. Arthurs was named to Barron's list of the top 1,200 advisers in the U.S. in 2014 and 2015.\nArthurs and Malof became partners in 1996, two years after Malof joined Citigroup, according to the group's profile on Morgan Stanley's website.\nBlair began working at Citigroup in 2001, having spent the three years prior at Merrill Lynch. Wyatt Arthurs joined Citigroup in 2005.\nMorgan Stanley confirmed that the advisers left the firm but declined to comment on the move.
