The fifth victim was the pilot of the Cessna, which had no known passengers, the examiner's office said.\nBAE Systems on Monday said the Sabreliner was registered to the British-based military contractor but declined to give any other details.\n\"While we are working with authorities to ascertain exactly what transpired, there are many details we do not know. As a result, we cannot confirm any names or other details at this time,\" it said in a statement.\nAccording to its website, the company has a shipyard in San Diego and has contracts with the U.S. Navy to train pilots.\nDebris from the collision littered a field west of the airport and caused a 2-acre (8,000-sq meter) brush fire that was put out by firefighters, Schuler said.\nNo one was injured on the ground, but a firefighter was taken to the hospital for heat exhaustion, he said.\n\"It appears it was a very violent crash, as you can tell by both aircraft being in multiple pieces,\" Schuler said.\nThe FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate what caused the crash, an FAA spokesman said.
