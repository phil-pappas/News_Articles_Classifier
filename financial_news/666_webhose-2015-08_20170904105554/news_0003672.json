The country’s $3.69 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves and relatively low national government debt levels mean it has the ammunition for fiscal stimulus.\n“Policy stimulus has failed to bolster aggregate demand and reduce excess capacity,” Daiwa Capital Markets analysts Kevin Lai and Junjie Tang said in a research note after factory gauges showed a weakening manufacturing sector. “In the current environment, we expect the government to do whatever it takes to let the world know that China’s economy is doing fine.”\nHere are some of the options China can choose from:\n1. Rate cuts:\nThe People’s Bank of China has cut its benchmark lending rate to a record low after reducing interest rates four times since the start of November. They have room to move further. The PBOC’s one-year deposit rate is at 2 percent and one-year lending rate is 4.85 percent, compared with near-zero benchmark rates in the U.S. and Europe.\nIt could also pump liquidity into the money markets in order to push down interbank lending rates. The 7-day repo rate, the benchmark rate of interbank funds, has fallen to less than 2.5 percent from 3.5 percent in mid-June.\n2. Required-reserve-ratio cuts:\nThe PBOC has significant room to lower required reserve ratios on banks to encourage lending. Even after a series of cuts, the RRR remains at 18.5 percent for major banks, among the world’s highest. Reducing the ratio by 10 percentage points would free up 13 trillion yuan ($2.1 trillion) of additional capacity for banks to lend, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n3. Direct lending:\nChina has been experimenting with targeted lending efforts since last year when the central bank extended 1 trillion yuan in lending support to China Development Bank Corp., or CDB, to fund the clearing of shanty towns.\nIn recent weeks the PBOC has injected capital into the so-called policy banks to stoke lending. The central bank has put $48 billion into CDB, people familiar with the matter said last month. Export-Import Bank of China got $45 billion, and 100 billion yuan from the Ministry of Finance went to the Agricultural Development Bank of China, Caixin magazine reported.\n4. Weaken the yuan:\nOxford Economics estimates that a currency depreciation of 10 percent to 15 percent would be needed to return monetary conditions to where they were six to 12 months ago. The yuan is up about 13 percent on a real trade weighted basis over the past year.\nThe challenge for China is that it wants the yuan to be accepted by the International Monetary Fund into its basket of reserve currencies, so it must avoid intervening too aggressively. A weakening currency could also trigger capital outflows.\n5. Buyer of last resort:\nIf push comes to shove, the PBOC could buy local or central government debt directly, just like some developed-economy central banks have done since the global financial crisis. China’s central bank already plays a role in keeping credit flowing to cash-strapped local governments by accepting collateral from banks in return for fresh money that can be used for new borrowing.\nBut China’s total debt, including companies, household and governments is at 282 percent of GDP, according to McKinsey Global Institute, meaning this is an option policy makers may not want to take in a hurry.\n6. Fiscal spend:\nChina’s government could ramp up infrastructure spending on everything from underground urban pipes to new ports and roads. It’s unlikely the government would unleash the scale of stimulus that it did after the 2008 financial crisis, but a still-strong central government balance sheet means authorities have wriggle room.
