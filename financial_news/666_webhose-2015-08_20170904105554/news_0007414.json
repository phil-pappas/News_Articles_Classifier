The court also ordered that the blogger be identified, the company said. \nCourt officials did not immediately respond to requests to confirm the ruling. \nA spokesman for Worldview declined to comment. \n\"On the basis of the investigation it has conducted to date, the company considers the allegations to be entirely baseless, untrue and defamatory,\" Petroceltic said in a statement. \nWorldview has sought clarification from the company about allegations of \"fraud and corruption\" at a Petroceltic project in Algeria. \nAs part of a long-running dispute over management of the company, Worldview made a failed attempt in January to oust Chief Executive Brian O'Cathain from the board. \nPetroceltic suspended a proposed $175 million bond issue earlier this month after Worldview said it could lead to bondholders securing key company assets below value. \nThe company's London-listed shares closed 7.4 percent lower at 50 pence on Thursday.
