It was something he did as a hobby in college and he never thought it was something he could earn from. He was constantly browsing the Internet to find out the mechanics of translating his ideas into reality. \nThe horizon of his thinking expanded when he did a course on entrepreneurship at Thika Technical Training Institute. \n\"Entrepreneurship was one of the units in my course, it was my best unit. It really thrilled me and from the time I was in school, I knew I will be an entrepreneur,\" said Mr Gatu. \nHis first attempt at business was in high school. He would buy bread from the canteen in bulk and repackage them in small sizes for sale to students who fondly called him 'Mr Money Maker.' \nNEMA GREEN LIGHT \nAnd indeed true to his colleagues' prophesy, Mr Gatu's current recycling business is raking in millions. \nHis breakthrough came in 2010 when he learned that Kenya Power was distributing energy saving bulbs in exchange for the conventional models. Kenya Power had a difficulty disposing the bulbs that were being dispensed with. \nMr Gatu gave the utility firm a proposal on how to recycle the bulbs. He had already received the green light from the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) on the project when he approached Kenya Power. \nThe power distributor embraced his idea fully and gave him a contract to recycle around 1.25 million bulbs at Sh6 million. This was a major boost for Mr Gatu's business. \nHe spent Sh3 million to expand the business, something he had always wanted to do but was curtailed by lack of money. He had approached banks for credit in vain. \nThis had forced him to borrow Sh15 million from friends. \nLUMP CRASHER \n\"We bought a mobile lump crasher. This is the machine that separates the components of bulbs into metal, glass and powder,\" said Mr Gatu. \nMetal and glass are sold while the powder, which is the harmful component, is accumulated and later discarded in a place approved by Nema. \nThe firm is now working on proposals for county governments so that all damaged bulbs are delivered to them at a fee. \n\"The persons who deliver the bulbs will be paid Sh20 to Sh30 for a bulb,\" said Mr Gatu. \nThe end products such as glass can be used for construction. \n\"We are also investing in a glass-making equipment. We have an option of giving the contract to other firms or making the glass on our own,\" said Mr Gatu. \nHe plans to join hands with an international firm in the next five years.
