This will open way for the bids,\" said National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich. \n\"We will then identify strategic investors and sign concession agreements with them.\" \nAt the moment, the Privatisation Commission led by CEO Solomon Kitungu and Chairman Henry Obwocha are holding consultations with stakeholders and sugar firms. The process will come to a close mid next month. \nRotich and acting Cabinet Secretary Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Adan Mohamed are part of the discussions. \nMr Kitungu told Sunday Nation that interested investors will only be known once the Commission advertises for Expressions of Interests (EOIs). Request for EOIs will be undertaken immediately after stakeholder consultations. \nFINANCIAL RESOURCES \n\"In addition to the financial resources, the strategic partner will also be required to have a track record of owning and operating profitable sugar companies for a specified period. The bids will be open to all investors who meet the criteria,\" said Mr Kitungu. \nThe sale agreement states that government will retain 25 per cent of the stake in the mills, 24 per cent will be disposed to farmers and employees through a Farmers and Employees Trust. \nThe strategic partners who will take over management of the mills will have 51 per cent stake. They must have the ability to buy shares and mobilise resources required to modernise the factories. \n\"The sale of 51 per cent stake to a strategic partner will comprise of new shares, to enable each of the companies to retain the proceeds from the sale shareholding to rehabilitate and modernise the factories and meet other financial obligations,\" said the sale agreement as seen by Sunday Nation. \nKenya has no option but to privatise the mills following pressure by the Opposition on the state of the local mills that has forced imports from Uganda to fill the deficit. Also, Comesa had stated that there would be no extension of the safeguard further. \nThe plan is a step forward following a long wait after the Parliament in January 2013 passed a resolution for the companies to be privatised ahead of the expiry of the February 2014 Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) safeguards. \nAccording to the sale agreement, the government will retain only 25 per cent of the stake it currently holds in Chemelil, Muhoroni, Miwani, Nzoia and Sony Sugar companies and sell 51 per cent to a strategic investors.
