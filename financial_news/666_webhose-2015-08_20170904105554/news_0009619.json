Oil had plunged to 6-1/2-year lows earlier this week.\nU.S. crude inched down about 0.1 percent to $42.52 a barrel, while Brent crude was down about 0.4 percent at $47.39.\nBesides the upbeat U.S. GDP, last week's jobless claims also fell more than expected. That kept alive speculation that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year if the economic momentum continues.\n\"Concerns about a possible softening in China's economic growth have been offset by news of a sharp upward adjustment in US 2nd quarter GDP,\" said Sydney-based Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in a note to clients.\n\"From a growth point of view, the US Fed looks well placed to begin increasing interest rates in December.\"\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, last traded at 95.773, up about 0.2 percent, after logging a one-week high of 96.031 in the previous session. The index remained well above a seven-month low of 92.621 touched on Monday.\nThe dollar was steady from late U.S. levels at 121.03 yen , significantly above Monday's nadir of 116.15. The euro was also steady at $1.1246.\nInvestors' focus remained on an annual meeting of the world's top central bankers at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming, seeking clues on how the fallout of the recent market turbulence could affect the U.S. central bank's future policy steps.\n\"We have to be careful ... trying to decide today how we might react to\" recent financial market volatility, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George told Bloomberg TV in an interview that aired on Thursday. George, known as a hawk, said that the U.S. economy still appears to be on solid ground.\nHer comments followed New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley's remarks on Wednesday that the prospect of a September rate hike \"seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago\" in light of the global market volatility.\nGold was slightly higher at $1,126.56 an ounce but still on track for a nearly 3 percent loss for the week.\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T03:53:40.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
