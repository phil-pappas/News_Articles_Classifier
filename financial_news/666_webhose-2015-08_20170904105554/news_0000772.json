Only the overheated food delivery sector seems to face as much competition , with at least 25 U.S. firms following the same business model.\nNew York-based CB Insights data indicates fashion consignment startups have received about $295 million in venture capital to date, and sees the good times coming to a close soon.\n“With eBay acquiring Twice, I would not be surprised to see more consolidation in this space,” said Matt Wong, a senior research analyst at CB Insights.\nThe beginnings of consolidation in crowded startup sectors should be a warning sign to private investors about the Silicon Valley boom. The glut of so many companies attacking the same problem or industry is a replay of the clutter during the dot-com boom and ensuing bust a decade and a half ago, with one big difference: All of these companies are still privately held.\n“There are plenty of good companies that did not catch the momentum,” said Tracy DiNunzio, who has raised a total of $47 million in funding as Chief Executive of Tradesy, which she founded in 2012 in Santa Monica, Calif. “It is effectively a land-grab right now and one of these platforms will become synonymous with online resale. We hope it is us.”\nMost of the consignment startups are trying to improve upon the legacy approach of eBay and Etsy Inc. ETSY, -1.10% the 10-year-old crafts marketplace that also has vintage and used clothing. The two e-commerce leaders have a more time-consuming process for selling and have struggled of late.\nJames Reinhart, co-founder and chief executive of ThredUp in San Francisco, got the idea for what became a second-hand clothing-sales service while he was studying at Harvard Business School and wanted to make some money by cleaning out his closet.\n“I opened a closet full of clothes that I wasn’t going to wear,” Reinhart said.\nIn a burst of energy, he took a huge stack to a nearby consignment store, only to be dismayed that he could not sell any of them. As a reaction, he helped found ThredUp In 2009, initially as a swapping site for clothing, books and toys. The site morphed into reselling children’s wear and then women’s wear, and shuttered its swapping service.\n“We were the first,” Reinhart said.\nThredUp has received a total of $53 million in venture funding, employs about 500 workers and runs two distribution centers, and plans to expand to sell all kinds of stuff you don’t want anymore — Electronics could be its next area of focus. ThredUp sends a big plastic mailing bag to consumers, who mail in their items to sell and receive in return a check or credit on the site, typically getting paid for about half of the items they send in.\nThredUp employees do all the work, measuring, photographing and describing items in a massive database with 12,000 new items added daily. The company makes money on the difference it pays consumers versus what it charges.\n“It’s more like an arbitrage,” Reinhart said, adding that ThredUp has hired several people away from Netflix Inc. NFLX, -2.32% NFLX, -2.32% “The bag is the platform,” he said, adding that the business is at its heart, “a hard-core logistics business.”\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/food-delivery-startups-crowded-market/?utm_source=CB+Insights+Newsletter&utm_campaign=1031820113-Overcrowdedfooddelivery06_28_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9dc0513989-1031820113-86176669", "http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Startup-farewell-party-leaves-a-mess-at-Dolores-6402576.php"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:46:53.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
