Yet in the face of lawsuits and investor outcry, the government replaced politicians and generals in its controlling board bloc with market professionals.\nBacelar, a member of the FUP oilworkers federation, a major backer of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's Workers' Party-led government, said the writedowns could ease the path for asset sales, a move he and FUP strongly oppose.\n\"Most board members have been appointed by the government but they all serve the market now,\" Bacelar said. \"As a defender of Petrobras' social mission, I'm all alone.\"\nPetrobras' quarterly profit fell to 531 million reais ($150.4 million) from 4.96 billion reais a year ago, the company said in a securities filing on Thursday. The write-offs were so unexpected that the average profit estimate of 12 analysts polled by Reuters, 4 billion reais, was nearly eight times bigger than the actual result.\nThe 1.28-billion-real impairment charge related to the cancellation of new projects in its gas and energy, refining, and exploration and production units. Petrobras also took an unexpected 1.6 billion real charge to resolve a tax issue with Brazil's federal government.\nChief Executive Aldemir Bendine, who took the helm in February, has said he wants to clean up a balance sheet in the wake of corruption and a plunge in the price of oil.\n\"We want to leave the company in a situation where it has the highest levels of management in the world,\" Bendine told reporters at the company's headquarters in Rio de Janeiro late Thursday. \"We want the company to go forward with its liabilities and the challenges it faces cleaned up.\"\nConsidering the need to take the impairment and tax charges, Bendine said the company's profit, one of the smallest in recent years, \"was great.\"\nPetrobras reported net sales, after taxes, of 79.9 billion reais and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of 19.8 billion reais, the company said.\n($1 = 3.5316 Brazilian reais) (Additional reporting by Marta Nogueira and Rodrigo Viga Gaier; Editing by Richard Chang and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T05:29:05.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
