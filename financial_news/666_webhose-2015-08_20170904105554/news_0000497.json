And recent acquisitions like MashUp are their ticket. Supplied Share on twitter by Agnes King Big four accounting firms Deloitte and KPMG have made a couple of acquisitions that signal big things about the expansionary ambitions of these billion-dollar professional services giants - and how they could upset the status quo.\nDeloitte acquired brand and spatial design agency MashUp over the weekend, while KPMG has inked a deal with well-known human rights campaigner Richard Boele to buy his social impact consultancy, Banarra.\nBanarra is KPMG's eighth acquisition in 18 months. Deloitte has stitched up at least as many purchases in that timeframe, while Ernst&Young has bolted on seven.\nWhile those three were busy snacking, PricewaterhouseCoopers pulled off a global deal to acquire venerable strategy house Booz&Co - tipped to be the biggest acquisition by an accounting firm in years.\nThe last five years in particular have seen the Big Four encroach on the turf of several parallel industries: information technology , strategy houses, law firms, property developers and - in the case of Deloitte's most recent acquisition - brand management and marketing agencies.\nDisciplinary boundaries are being eroded.\nMassively destabilising Affected industries say the big four are \"operating at the fringes\". They will never rattle the core operations of the encumbents in these sectors.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements But in 10 years covering the accounting sector, I've witnessed the profession being eroded at the fringe by alternative players and automation.\nIt is massively destabilising. So much so, that it has topped the list of strategic threats for all Big Four accounting firm managing partners for years.\nNow, they are fighting back.\nBut the recent spate of acquisitions has prompted many to ask how long the Big Four can keep buying things.\nThese things tend to go in cycles - the gluttony continues until things implode. Then the businesses contract, retreat to their \"core\", before the swelling starts over again.\nThis time round, however, the big four are being extremely strategic about their purchases.\nThey're not buying everything and anything. They're only bolting on services or intellectual property that is a direct adjunct to what they already do.\nBig Four accounting firms want to work on the \"big issues\" at the big blue-chip companies. That is their heritage.\nBut traditional tax, audit and accounting problems have diminished in the minds of directors and top level executives. Even significant risks like transfer pricing have been delegated to a functional business head.\nThe big four accounting brands need to restore their relevance to the c-suite. And these acquisitions are their ticket.\nThe biggest, gnarliest problems their clients are experiencing right now - they want to solve them. If you can't develop those problem solving skills organically in-house, or hire it in, then buying is the next best thing. The Big Four have employed all of these tactics.\nCulture is the challenge The challenge for the Big Four in extracting value from these acquisitions will be one of culture.\nThey are buying extremely nimble assets at the cutting edge of their field.\nLarge corporations by their nature are rarely especially innovative, entrepreneurial, or agile - and accountants have a unique reputation for being stodgy.\nAlmost everything about the boutiques being absorbed into the Big Four is counter to the entity they are joining.\nHowever, the Big Four are acutely aware their survival depends on their ability to adopt these 'new age' traits, and they've done a bucket load of work over the last few years to adopt a more entrepreneurial posture, as well as a greater acceptance of risk.\nAs they say, only time will tell.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Agi_King"], "published": "2015-08-03T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:38:07.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
