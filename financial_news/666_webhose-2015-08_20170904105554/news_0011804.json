We have a major investigation ahead of us. I envisage a long hard haul to find out what has happened,\" National Prosecutor Morten Niels Jacobsen said in a statement. \nNeither the tax authority nor the SOIK would disclose any information on the cases, or name any of the companies involved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:18:56.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
