Of further concern was the volume of shares traded, the highest since 2011.\nThe provider of share registration and wide ranging corporate administration services generated a net profit of $US153.6 million ($208.3 million), down 38.9 per cent compared with the previous corresponding period.\nThe lack of top-line growth is a concern given the group has made several acquisitions. Deutsche Bank summed it up well saying, \"Computershare's fiscal 2015 result and 2016 earnings per share growth guidance serve as a simple reminder that organic profit growth remains a challenge, leaving its overall growth outlook hostage to higher interest rates.\"\nThe broker is of the view that higher margin income should underpin a strong earnings growth story post fiscal 2016. But this long-term picture is seen to be factored into the share price and Deutsche Bank lowered its price target by 11.6 per cent from $13.80 to $12.20.\nThe broker also cut its profit expectations for fiscal 2016 by nearly 10 per cent to $US307.6 million. This forecast is broadly in line with Bell Potter's expectations and both brokers have a hold recommendation on the stock.\nBell Potter is more conservative with its price target, having reduced it by 16 per cent from $13.70 to $11.50. The broker said it considers the current fiscal 2016 price-earnings multiple of circa 14 to be appropriate for a business lacking growth.\nTrevor Hoey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:56:26.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
