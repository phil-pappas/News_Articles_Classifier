It wasn't the swinging, seaming conditions or flawed batting technique. It didn't come down to team morale or selection blunders or hostile crowds.\nNo, the (Joe) root cause of our awful capitulation was the whereabouts of the battlefield: the British Midlands. Been there? Don't. It's a horrible part of the world. Think 1970s Pittsburgh, between the collapse of the steel industry and the arrival of AIDS. Honeymooners, I'd recommend Fallujah.\nA poison mist of desolation hangs over this part of England (just beneath its suffocatingly permanent cloud cover), like an invisible force field, à la The Truman Show , or The Hunger Games – a carcinogenic blanket of bleakness those of us accustomed to the developed world can't simply shrug off.\nFirst, to Birmingham. It's worth bearing in mind that soon after taking up as our High Commissioner in London, Alexander Downer toured Britain's second-largest metropolis as a guest of its highly regarded chief of police. Lord Downer departed, declaring: \"never again!\" * And this from a man who's spent most of his life in Adelaide.\nIf Basil Fawlty ever pursued his ambition to upsize (to escape Sybil, if for no other reason), Birmingham's Crowne Plaza would've been the ultimate property for his foray into the Big Smoke. \"No Germans staying this week, Major, just Mervyn Hughes and his Aussie tour group in their parachute pants.\"\nRight after his towel rail fell off the wall, Ian Healy found the Major in the bar. \"This is the crummiest, shoddiest, worst-run hotel in the whole of Western Europe.\" *\n\"No! No! I won't have that!\" responded the Major to Heals. \"There's a place in Nottingham.\"\nAs bad as the hotel in Waugh's Scoop Yes, that's right, after Birmingham came Nottingham. There, the Australian squad and most of the commentariat – Warnie, Punter, Beefy – bedded down at the inimitable Park Plaza on Maid Marian Way (its decrepitude being a slur on her good name). This inn is best imagined as the sister residence of the \"serene and all-embracing\" Hotel Liberty in Scoop 's fictional east African state of Ishmaelia, which Evelyn Waugh based on the very real Taitu Hotel in Addis Ababa. Thunk its proprietor: \"It was very pleasant when all those noisy white men were shut away in their rooms; they brought in good money, these journalists – heavens, what she was charging them! – but they were a great deal of trouble.\"\nWithin moments of entering my room, I pine for Birmingham, or even just Abu Ghraib. The hanging rod in the wardrobe collapses. The air-conditioning is on the blink (it is barely 15 degrees out, but like all English buildings, it convects, and is burning up inside). Most of the TV channels are offline. And my latrine contains a generous DNA sample of the room's previous occupant. Without bothering with the professional services of a pathologist, I can identify him as the Yeti.\nIt's hard to believe that with the urn on the line, our cricketers had to stay here. How are you supposed to win the Ashes when you've lost the will to live?\nI go for a walk, for some fetid air, and stumble into the worst pub in England. Inside, it smells like misery. The folk playing the pokies are frightful to look at, a grossly obese strain of Tolkien's orcs – oily hair, septum rings, tattered garments. A dentist's dream.\nI keep walking, to progress my observation from anecdote to irrefutable anthropological truth. Yes, this is a town of carnies and gyppos who wandered too far from their caravans and so were forced to settle in one place. No wonder Lynton Crosby wins so many votes out here. He's been to Penrith. He knows the playbook.\nI return to the hotel and, self-medicating (self-evidently), swallow double my usual dose of uppers. Studiously avoiding the toilet, I order some early dinner, opting for something vaguely nourishing. When my sushi roll arrives, the tuna has been pulverised, perhaps sliced from the fillet with a teaspoon, and the entire dish is submerged in an estuary of sweet chilli sauce. Thus back to Scoop : \"The menu did not change at the Liberty … fibrous spindles of chicken with grey-green dented peas. 'Don't seem to have any relish for my food,' said Corker. \"It must be the altitude.\"\nThe next morning down the road at Trent Bridge, Australia is dismissed for a pitiable 60 runs before the luncheon interval. William Wallace barely occasioned more carnage at Stirling Bridge. I flee the scene immediately.\nBunkered down in that beastly hotel room, engulfed by my own wretchedness, I spend the next two days subsisting on one jar of salted peanuts, a KitKat and several bottles of Gavi ill-suited even for the Bolognese sauce at an orphanage. On iTunes, I loop Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms .\nOn the fourth day, I flee back to London, aboard a harrowing East Midlands train service (reeks, nothing works), which at least has the decency to spit me out at St Pancras. My internal organs ache and I haven't ingested anything wholesome for an eternity, so I stop at the champagne bar for a glass of Louis Roederer and then an ice-cold half-pint of Becks. By degrees, I convince myself I've really just stepped off the Eurostar from Paris, and this emboldens me sufficiently to step outside and hail a Black Cab.\n* The accuracy of the comments attributed to these persons may be tenuous.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "https://plus.google.com/+JoeAston"], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:10:26.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
