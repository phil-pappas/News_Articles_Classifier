The subordinated notes have a maturity date of August 28, 2025 and bear interest at the rate of 6.75% per annum, payable semiannually, over their term. The notes include a right of prepayment, without penalty, on or after August 28, 2020 and, in certain limited circumstances, before that date. The indebtedness evidenced by the subordinated notes, including principal and interest, is unsecured and subordinate and junior in right of the Company's payment to general and secured creditors and depositors of the Bank. The subordinated notes have been structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. \nThe Company plans to use the proceeds from the placement of the subordinated notes to redeem the $15.0 million of Series B preferred stock issued to the United States Treasury in connection with its participation in the Small Business Lending Fund and for general corporate purposes. \nIn discussing the private placement, President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Van Ostenbridge stated: \"We are pleased to announce the successful completion of our subordinated debt placement. The repayment of the SBLF preferred stock prior to the upcoming increase in the dividend rate to 9% and the replacement of such with new qualifying capital that is a lower rate, tax-deductible instrument, made the overall transaction very attractive.\" \nSandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. acted as placement agent for the private placement of the subordinated notes.
