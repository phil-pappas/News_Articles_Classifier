Bloomberg by Rose Powell The Australian dollar plunged on Tuesday as investors snapped up US dollars after China devalued its currency against the greenback by a record amount.\nThe People's Bank of China announces the mid-point against the US dollar for the day's currency trading each morning. The rate has been remarkably stable since March, but Tuesday's record 1.9 per cent downwards revision set off a flight to safety.\nWestpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow said the Australian dollar was collateral damage as the US dollar shot up.\nThe Aussie dropped from US74.4¢ to US73.5¢ within minutes. Other regional currencies, including South Korea's won and the Singapore dollar, were also hit.\nThe Australian dollar was collateral damage as investors bought the greenback. \"The yuan has been very boring for a very long time to the point most had stopped paying it any attention but China's decision today to weaken their own currency midpoint has started a sudden wave of purchasing,\" Mr Callow said.\n\"It seems the export numbers over the weekend were the final straw for the currency being kept steady as Chinese authorities try to promote stability.\"\nTD Securities chief Asia-Pacific macro strategist of foreign exchange Annette Beacher said the depreciation would be a shock to otherwise sleepy markets.\n\"The People's Bank of China is simultaneously looking at the recent poor trade report and improving the yuan's pricing mechanism,\" Ms Beacher said.\n The PBoC described the move as a \"one-off depreciation\", based on a new way of managing the exchange rate that better reflected market forces.\n\"Since China's trade in goods continues to post relatively large surpluses, the yuan's real effective exchange rate is still relatively strong versus various global currencies, and is deviating from market expectations,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\"Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the yuan's midpoint pricing to meet the needs of the market.\"\nThe bank said the midpoint would now be based on market makers' Quote: s and the previous day's closing price.\n# CNY 's real effective exchange rate gained 13% in a year.
