Louie Douvis by Alan Mitchell Business is demanding reform while ACTU president Ged Kearney wants an expanded payroll tax. Joe Hockey must be wondering how politics in a republic could possibly be as good as this.\nKearney's argument at Wednesday's National Reform Summit , was that an expanded and more efficient payroll tax would be better than an increase in the GST.\nPayroll tax, she argued, was paid by employers and was levied for those actually earning wages.\nThe former Treasury secretary, Martin Parkinson, corrected Kearney's economics . A payroll tax with no concessions, he said, is identical to a GST.\nBut if Kearney's argument was weak on the economic fine detail, it was stronger on the politics of tax reform.\nThe public is certain it pays the GST, but it thinks employers carry the burden of payroll tax. It also thinks company tax falls entirely on business, and it is likely to be sceptical of Parkinson's argument that half the burden of the tax falls on workers.\nSo, if business is to get a cut in company tax, it might be politically smart to ask businesses to contribute to the cost by paying more payroll tax.\nThe Treasurer's thoughts probably have been heading in that direction anyway.\n Small GST rise not enough\nAs commentators have noted, the 5 percentage point increase in the GST rate proposed by the NSW government would not raise enough revenue to solve the fiscal problems facing the federal and state governments.\nHockey will want the states to increase their other efficient taxes to raise more money and payroll tax is the most obvious candidate.\nIn a speech on tax reform last Monday, Hockey emphasised what he said was the sixth principle of the government's tax reform: that \"the revenue-raising capacity of each tier of government should be aligned to responsibilities of funding and service delivery\".\nEven if he doesn't want to be taken literally, it seems pretty clear that he does want good deal more from the states than Mike Baird's proposed increase in the GST.\nThe states are estimated to need an extra $20 billion a year by 2020 to make up for reduced growth of federal health grants. The federal government needs to close the budget deficit, compensate low income households for the increase in their living costs, and finance a cut in company and personal income tax.\nThe estimated $36 billion increase in the GST under the Baird plan is not going to be anything like enough.\nBigger rise would be unpopular\nOne option would be a bigger increase in the GST, but that does not seem politically feasible.\nAn efficient (that is, concession free) payroll tax in addition to the 5 percentage point GST rise would make more political sense.\nDespite claims to the contrary, payroll tax is inherently efficient and, under certain assumptions, is identical to a consumption tax.\nPeople forget that payroll tax was transferred to the states by the McMahon government in the early 1970s as an efficient growth tax.\nVote buying by the premiers and interstate tax competition has seen the payroll tax base eroded to an inefficient shadow of its former self.\nIf the politicians and business cannot manage the increase in GST and payroll tax required for reform, land tax could make up the difference.\nLand tax is more efficient than either the GST or payroll tax and, if it were confined to expensive properties, it would allow the nation's business leaders to make an additional direct financial contribution to economic reform.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:41:59.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
