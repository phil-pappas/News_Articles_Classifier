Alex Ellinghausen by John Kerin Australia expects Cambodia to honour its $55 million deal to take refugees from Nauru despite a Cambodian government official maintaining the deal has collapsed, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton indicated on Monday.\nMr Dutton said the comments were from a low level official and he expected Cambodia to honour the agreement.\nAs part of a deal thrashed out earlier this year Cambodia will get $40 million in extra Australian aid assistance and a further $15 million in resettlement costs for taking refugees from the Australian supported centre.\nThe Immigration Minister was commenting after a Cambodian government official was reported on Sunday as telling The Cambodian Daily newspaper that the country did not \"have any plans to import more refugees from Nauru to Cambodia\".\nFour refugees have arrived in Cambodia since June.\n\"I think the less we receive the better,\" interior ministry spokesman Khieu Sopheak told the newspaper.\nThe Cambodia deal also has come under fire from human rights groups given Cambodia is impoverished country with a poor human rights record.\n\"We have discussions ongoing at officials level, and we have a level of confidence in the MOU that we've signed with the Cambodian government which allows for more than four to go,\" Mr Dutton told the ABC.\n \"We hope a lot more will follow the four, but the MOU has been signed between Cambodia and Australia and we expect it to be honoured and we're working with the Cambodians to that end,\" he said.\nBut opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles called on Mr Dutton to provide an explanation.\n\"This is an expensive joke,\" Mr Marles said.\n\"How does Mr Dutton reconcile the Australian government's ambitions for Cambodia with the comments which are coming out of Cambodia itself,\" Mr Marles said.\n\"We've heard consistently from Cambodia that they have never imagined taking more than a handful of people from Cambodia.\"\nEarlier Foreign Minister Julie Bishop also insisted the deal was not under threat.\n\"That is not correct. You are relying on an alleged statement from one official,\" she told reporters in Sydney.\nMs Bishop said she had a positive meeting with her Cambodian counterpart in early August and the Cambodian Foreign Minister suggested he was keen to harness the skills of foreign workers to boost the country's economy.\nMs Bishop said both countries continued to work together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:55:28.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
