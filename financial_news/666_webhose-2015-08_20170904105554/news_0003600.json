PUBLISHED: 18:36, Sun, Aug 9, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:39, Sun, Aug 9, 2015 GETTY Treatment for pets is not cheap \nThe Macks, mother Margaret and adult son Ian, faced deadlock after submitting £168 of charges for their sick dog Zeus to Animal Friends. \n“We have always paid the premiums and never claimed before but this is most unfair,” says Margaret, 73, from Surrey. \nThe confusing demands and accusations of “misrepresentations” coming from Animal Friends did not help, they say. \nZeus, a stray, became part of the Mack family five years ago after they adopted him from Battersea Dogs Home. \nLike all rescue dogs his age was approximate, as Ian, who is disabled, told Animal Friends when he took out cover in early 2011. \nHe says: “I gave the policy details over the phone and the only thing the customer services person questioned was Zeus’s breed. \nHe said he only had room for one type in the box but Zeus is a cross, so we settled on rottweiler. \nWe gave his details exactly as we had received them.” \nNo further questions were raised, Ian paid his premiums and Animal Friends accepted his money. In late spring this year, however, Zeus needed treatment. \nAlthough it was Ian’s policy, Margaret paid the vet’s bill. \n“My son was short of funds so I settled it,” she says. \n“I put down my bank account for repayment on the claim form, it tallied with the bill. \nAnimal Friends rejected it saying this bank account number did not match the information they had. \n“We rang up several times explaining the reason. Ian and I have the same address and share the same surname, it seems obvious. \n“Then they queried the information about Zeus’s age, informing us that the age Ian had given over the phone was different to the one provided by the vet and that we must pay higher premiums and back payments.” \nThe underwriter for Animal Friends is Red Sands, based in Gibraltar but regulated in the UK. \nAfter much to-ing and fro-ing, the insurer, which donates generously to animal charities, finally offered to refund the claim but wanted Ian to resubmit the forms first. \nThis meant getting the vet to supply another bill. \nYet after the policy’s £99 excess and other charges were taken off the family would only have been left with around £45 which, given the inconvenience they had endured, seemed rather mean. \nWe suggested the insurer waive the excess as a goodwill gesture and pay Margaret. \nThey agreed to do this. After asking several times for guidance about its payment policy and the reason for the problems in this case, late last week there was more clarity. Conflicting assessments of Zeus’s age raised questions. \n“Different premiums would be due for an older pet,” director of operations Natalie Surtees explained but stressed Animal Friends fully understood the issues with rescue dogs and that their ages were approximate. \nAnti-fraud concerns and the need to comply with regulations were the reason for questioning the payment. \nThe Macks are delighted and hope that a letter they received from Animal Friends on Friday offering them just £45 is a mistake. \nCrusader will be monitoring the situation to ensure that all written promises are kept.
