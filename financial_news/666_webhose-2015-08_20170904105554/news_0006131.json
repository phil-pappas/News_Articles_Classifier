The government has targeted annual economic growth of around 7.0 percent for all of 2015. \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) , the central bank, in June announced its latest cut in interest rates, marking the fourth such move since November to boost lending as a driver for the economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:38:49.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
