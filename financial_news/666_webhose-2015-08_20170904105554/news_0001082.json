Photo: Erin Jonasson\nThis week, the building industry claimed there's an economy-crippling shortage of bricklayers. Similar claims of chronic skill shortages have been made by those leading the IT industry. As well as those in hospitality . And also those in actuarial science and engineering . The list is long. But how justified are their cries for attention and assistance?\nA glance at the latest unemployment figures would raise the eyebrow of even the mildest cynic. According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released just over a week ago, there are more than 800,000 Australians currently unemployed. This represents an increase of 40,000 jobseekers when compared to the month before. Importantly, that doesn't take into account the extent of under-employment, which would exacerbate those numbers further.\nThe chorus of industrialists calling for relief is often accompanied by a curious crescendo: an explicit demand for more foreign workers. There's nothing really wrong with inviting foreigners to work in this country since a certain level of migration is good for economic growth. But it is particularly interesting when it's badged as a reason to plug skill shortages when there are nearly a million people already here just waiting for something to do.\nOne explanation for such a position could perhaps be attributed to two of the simplest economic principles. The first is supply and demand. By expanding the supply of labour, the greater competition among those employees would ensure wages remain sedated. The second is cost minimisation. By bringing in people who are already trained and qualified, there's little need to spend money training and educating Australians who have the potential but aren't quite job-ready.\nAdvertisement\nScepticism about skill shortages even extends to the Federal government. In a report released a few months ago, the Department of Employment wrote that \"there are more than enough applicants with relevant qualifications, or appropriate skills and experience, for vacancies in almost every occupation.\"\nOne statistic from that analysis is especially noteworthy: there's an average of 13.6 people applying for every vacancy. Of these candidates, approximately 2.2 are deemed by employers to be suitable for each job. What this indicates is that, unsurprisingly, there are plenty of people to go around. In some respects, we're spoilt for choice. Even among the professions in which challenges are genuinely apparent, \"there has been a marked decline in the extent of skill shortages over recent years.\" So, basically, things are looking up. For employers, at least.\nThe impact of skill shortages on Australian small- and medium-sized enterprises was examined recently by researchers at Flinders University. Their findings were published in the Applied Economics journal in May. The scholars pointed out that what determines the existence of a skill shortage is actually just a survey. Which means the existence of a skill shortage is largely dependent on the subjective interpretation of the person doing the hiring.\nThe process, then, goes a little like this. Is it tough finding people at the moment? Then a skill shortage must be at fault. Are candidates demanding higher salaries? Say hello to a skill shortage. Are competitors poaching your best workers? Must be those skill shortages again. (It couldn't possibly be a lack of investment in training, planning, job design, staff engagement or creative recruitment, right?)\nNow here's what's even more fascinating about the Flinders University study. The 438 SMEs that were examined, all of which declared they were suffering from a skill shortage, also had their sales data crunched over a period of three years. Contrary to contemporary wisdom, the researchers discovered a \"lack of any evidence that skill shortages reduce sales performance.\"\nSo the drumbeating that occurs in this debate, warning of economic calamity should skill shortages continue, seems to be soundless.\nWhat do you think? Do skill shortages genuinely exist?\nFollow James Adonis on Twitter: @jamesadonis", "external_links": ["http://docs.employment.gov.au/documents/skill-shortages-statistical-summary", "https://twitter.com/jamesadonis"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:50:59.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
