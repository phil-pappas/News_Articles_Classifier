After yields on Treasury two-year notes rose the most in six weeks, traders are paying more to protect against price swings in those securities, which are susceptible to changes in the outlook for Fed policy.\n“We’re going to continue to be extremely sensitive to each data point we get, and each bit of Fed speak,” said Michael Lorizio, a Boston-based fixed income trader at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees $20 billion. “It’s almost an exaggerated focus.”\nThe two-year yield rose six basis points this week in New York, or 0.06 percentage point, to 0.72 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the largest weekly increase since June. The rate-increase forecasts are based on the assumption that the Fed funds rate will average 0.375 percent after the first increase.\nData Catalysts Traders are paying 6.2 percent more to protect against swings in two-year notes than they were a week ago, according to options prices. While the Labor Department’s July employment report is out of the way, economic data to be released next week may further change views on the timing of the Fed’s first rate increase since 2006.\nOne potential catalyst for short-term Treasury swings is retail sales data due to be released Aug. 13. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict sales rose 0.6 percent in July from the previous month. A strong report may give the Fed more ammunition for a September increase.\nStrategist George Goncalves said he is skeptical about a September increase, but that a robust report could sway him.\n“If retail sales are strong and inflation turns a corner, I could change my view,” said Goncalves, New York-based head of interest-rate research for Nomura Holdings Inc.\nFed Speak Lockhart, who’s a voting member of the Fed’s policy-setting committee, will speak on Aug. 10 at a Fed Bank of Atlanta conference and at the Atlanta Press Club. He could walk back or confirm the view he expressed last week that the U.S. economy is ready to support higher borrowing costs.\n“The move up in yields was fully a Lockhart trade,” said David Keeble, the New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA.\nTraders will also be trying to determine whether the Fed may be delayed by the latest drop in oil prices. Falling energy prices have suppressed a bond-market inflation forecast known as the break-even rate. That has helped long-term Treasury prices, which are more sensitive to inflation and economic growth.\n“If we see financial conditions worsen and the global backdrop is bad, absolutely, they’ll wait” to raise interest rates, said Goncalves. “People are on pins and needles, and really trying to take stock in the lead-up to the September meeting.”\n\",\"byline\":\"Alexandra Scaggs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T07:22:51.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
