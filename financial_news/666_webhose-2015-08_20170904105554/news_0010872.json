They also give the service provider a slice of every transaction online; the space has recently attracted companies including Apple Inc and Amazon Inc. \n\"What has become more and more pronounced is as the size of the screen gets smaller, whether it's a tablet, mobile or a watch, the less likely it becomes a consumer will finish his purchase,\" Sam Shrauger, senior vice president of Visa's digital solutions, told Reuters. \nThis is because entering numbers and letters on small keyboards is inconvenient and prone to mistakes. \nShrauger said 60 percent of shoppers using a computer finish their transactions compared to 45 percent of tablet users and 20 percent of mobile shoppers. \nLarge U.S. retailers including Best Buy Co Inc, Barnes & Noble Inc and Taco Bell have added Visa's payment service on their websites, Shrauger said. \nA year since launch, Visa Checkout has 6 million registered users. PayPal has 169 million active customer accounts. \n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T03:31:13.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
