Use your key for the next article Comment Play Aug. 7 -- Today’s \"BWest Byte\" is 1 billion, for the amount of traveler records Sabre keeps on record each year. Bloomberg's Emily Chang reports on \"Bloomberg West.\" on.aol.com \nSabre Corp., a former American Airline subsidiary that processes millions of reservations for hotels and airlines annually, confirmed on August 7 that its computer systems were breached recently. To date they have not been able to confirm if credit card or personal sensitive information was either taken or copied. American Airline, the world’s biggest airline, has forensic experts working diligently to determine whether the hackers had also compromised any of its computer’s systems. The announcements come on the heels of the recent United Airlines breach. \nThe original Sabre system was developed by IBM in 1964 as a way to automate American reservation services. In 2000 it separated from the airline to be a publicly traded entity. However it still shares some infrastructure with Sabre and has launched a probe to make sure the hackers were not able to move from Sabre to their systems. While Bloomberg has reported that American Airlines was also hacked the airline has said there is no evidence at this time of a breach. \n\"American has worked with outside cyber security experts who checked digital signatures, IP addresses and the style of attack, and there's no evidence to suggest a breach similar to that experienced by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. There is also no evidence that customer data may have been compromised,\" American Airlines spokesman Casey Norton said in an email response to media. \nDigital signatures and styles of attack are called fingerprints. While hackers may vary their style from breach to breach just as artists may vary painting styles, experts who have studied each artist can identify a painting or a breach based on a number of indicators. In this case people familiar with the Sabre hacking have concluded that the attack was the work of the same group that hit OPM, Anthem and probably United. \nAs with the United breach, concerns surrounding the Sabre breach are that millions of flight records were exposed, adding to data profiles if indeed the hackers also stole the OPM data. Sabre networks also held hotel bookings, car rentals, tour information, and far more. Complete itineraries, past-present-future, were in the compromised system. Additionally Sabre provides services for more than 80 percent of federal travel bookings . \nSabre is one of the largest global clearinghouses for travel reservations and includes more than 400 airlines, 125,000 hotel properties, 27 car rental brands, 50 rail providers and 16 cruise lines. Its global distribution system works with companies such as American Airlines, American Express, BCD Travel, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, Hogg Robinson Group (HRG), Expedia, Holiday Autos, Zuji, LastMinute, JetBlue, GetThere and Travelocity to search, price, and book reservations. Sabre’s website says it coordinates more than one billion travelers per year around the globe.
