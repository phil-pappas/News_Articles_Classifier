He has been released on bail pending further enquiries. \nThe scam, in which fraudsters purporting to be \"financial advisers\" from a bogus firm called JC Sterling & Roth cold-called people, was first brought to public attention by this newspaper. We visited the firm's London office, only to find that it did not exist. \n• Watch: The fake Ferrari shares being flogged by sham adviser, exposed by Telegraph \nFollowing our expose, victims reported that the fraudsters were still trying to persuade people to invest, explaining away Telegraph Money 's discovery by saying we \"got the wrong address\". \nAction Fraud and Wiltshire Police believe a network of criminals is behind the Ferrari shares scam, which means they are likely to be involved in a larger operation connected to a string of similar reported frauds. \n'I lost £176,000 to fake Ferrari share fraudsters' \nA spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: \"We aren’t able to go into any further details as the investigation is still ongoing. There are many other victims and offenders that are subject of ongoing inquiries.\" \nIn May Action Fraud, which acts as a national coordinator for fraud cases, confirmed that Wiltshire Police had started investigating the case. \nOne saver told Telegraph Money he had handed savings of £176,000 to fraudsters in what was the biggest reported instance of the scam to date. \nThe fraudsters were operating via a bogus company by the name of Charlton Fitzgerald, which may have been deliberately chosen to sound like Cantor Fitzgerald, the legitimate, regulated broker. They are also known to have used names including JC Sterling & Roth, Larse Captial and Vanquish Wealth Management. \nThe “opportunity” to buy Ferrari shares proved convincing to some investors, largely because it was based on a half truth. \nFiat Chrysler, the firm that owns Ferrari, has said it will sell some of its shares to the public later this year, but at the time the scam was operating its shares were not available to buy. \nMore recently another firm called Pfeifferroth & Schaffer Private Asset Management has been reported to be selling shares in Uber, the app-based taxi service, ahead of its forthcoming flotation. \nPension experts and the Government have warned of a rise in scams and unregulated investment sales as an unintended consequence of new pension freedoms introduced in April. \nBritish savers are being advised to ignore calls from “advisers” offering investment opportunities of any kind. \nHave you been scammed?
