More has to be done to incentivise the natives to fill them. \nAnother is that the genie is out of the bottle on immigration. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) countries that operate points-based systems struggle to control their borders. \nThe belief that leaving the European Union would solve the problem is for the birds. Even Switzerland, which has a far higher proportion of foreign born residents than Britain, is forced to agree free movement as the quid pro-quo for access to the single market. \nA third, related point is that relatively high levels of immigration are part of the price you pay for a successful economy. \nUnlike much of the rest of Europe, Britain is growing strongly, and is therefore a magnet for the dispossessed and the go-getters. If we were to run up the draw bridge, the economy would suffer. It’s a simple choice pure and poor, or diverse and rich. Forget the anti-corporatism that tends to go with the fortress Britain ticket; it would be small businesses that would suffer most. \nFinally, if we want to prevent the sort of humanitarian crisis we see at Europe’s borders, we should stop pointless and destabilising overseas adventurism of the type practiced in Iraq and Libya. Too late now. \n= Shelling out too much = \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) would be wrong to say City investors are on the point of insurrection over Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) ’s blockbuster takeover bid for BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) . Most big investors in Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) will also be major shareholders in BG, so if the stock and cash offer goes through, what they lose on the Shell roundabout they will gain on the BG swings. \nNone the less, it is ever more obvious Shell’s Ben van Beurden is overpaying for BG, as reflected in the fact that BG shares languish at a whopping great discount to the see-through value of Shell’s offer 981p per share against 1134p. \nI’m already hearing calls for a renegotiation of the terms. Yet the chances of this happening seem remote. Yes, the oil price has sunk even further since the deal was announced, and the stock market as a whole has suffered a major correction. But it would be hard to argue that this amounts to the “material adverse change” that would justify revisiting the terms. \nWhen Sir Martin Sorrell tried to claim “force majeure” as justification for reducing the terms of his offer for Tempus Group back in 2001 , the Takeover Panel sent him away with a flea in his ear. If 9/11 didn’t count as a material adverse change, it’s unlikely worries about the outlook for the global economy will do the trick either. \nThere’s always the outside possibility that Chinese or Australian regulators will come to Shell’s rescue and stick a spanner in the works, but Mr van Beurden who ill-advisedly said the deal only really sings once the oil price recovers to $90 a barrel would be unwise to count on it. He’s on the hook for a £750m break fee if he pulls out, a pay-out he’d be hard pressed to survive. So he’ll soldier on. As a cheap way into the Shell dividend gusher, BG continues to look a pretty good bet. But if oil goes sub $40 … \n= A case of market delusion = \nRobert Shiller, the Nobel prize winning economist of Irrational Exuberance fame, is about to publish a book on market manipulation and deception, Phishing for Phools , in which he argues that bubbles are often associated with half-baked popular myths that inspire investor optimism, but can neither be proved nor disproved. \nShiller views the state of stock markets today as very much an example of such delusion. Despite the sell-off of recent weeks, he still thinks them hugely over-valued, and believes a more appropriate level for the Dow right now would be 11,000. In fact, it is up there at 16,600. \nShiller’s valuation assessment is based on the “cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio”, or CASE for short. Rather than use the conventional stock market valuation yardsticks of current and forward earnings, CASE uses a 10 year rolling average, adjusted for inflation. Taking the late 19th century as the starting point, the average CASE ratio for the S &P 500 is 17, yet in July it was a whopping 27, a clear crash indicator in Shiller’s book. \nCASE may or may not be a reasonable guide to the long-term trend. It is, however, much less useful at predicting the timing of significant market adjustments. The fact is that only once in the past 25 years has the CASE dipped below its long-run average, or the point Shiller deems safe to buy, and in 10 of those years it has been above its current level. \nI’m not at all bullish right now, but I wouldn’t trust CASE to instruct my view. Return to trend is a pretty reliable rule of thumb in economics.
