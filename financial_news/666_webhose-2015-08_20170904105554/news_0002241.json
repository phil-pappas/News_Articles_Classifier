That's why the modern worker better bone up on his or her interpersonal skills, said Geoff Colvin, author of Humans Are Underrated . \n\"I say humans are underrated because our most essentially and deeply human traits, our ability to empathize and so forth, that's going to be the most valuable thing we can bring to work,\" said Colvin. Apple Nears Bear Market Territory After BofA Cuts to Hold \nColvin, who is Fortune's senior editor-at-large, added that empathy does not simply mean feeling someone else's pain. It means discerning what are a person is thinking or feeling and then responding in the appropriate way. \"That's the basis of building a better customer experience,\" said Colvin. \"Collaborating with others, solving problems, building relationships. It all starts with empathy.\" While Colvin views human interaction as a powerful force in an increasingly automated world, he said social media networks like LinkedIn and Facebook are actually weakening our ability to connect to one another, even though they boast millions of members. Colvin said that the more time people spend on their devices texting each other, the more they lose the ability to interact on a face-to-face basis. \"These technologies are great for continuing relationships that you already built in the real, physical world, but for establishing relationships it's not good and the more time we spend doing this, the less skilled we become at really dealing with one another,\" said Colvin. One place where robots are already being used is on the battlefield and it is raising moral questions, as well as technological ones. According to Colvin, the U.S. had 10,000 robots in Iraq being used for intelligence gathering and bomb defusing. \"The bad guys are going to use these things in bad ways, regardless of what we do. And we are going to have to decide how we really want to use them,\" said Colvin. Finally, Colvin said the key for workers afraid of losing their livelihoods to machines is to find out how much human interaction is involved. If it's not a lot, then that worker should consider retraining himself or herself to stave off the inevitable. \n\"Figure out what kind of job you have now and whether it really requires a lot of human interaction because if it doesn't then that job is probably going away,\" said Colvin. \"For example, the number one job among U.S. men is truck driver. Nearly three million men drive trucks, a job that doesn't require much human interaction. Self-driving trucks are already being tested on the roads of Nevada. That job is probably going away.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:38:00.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
