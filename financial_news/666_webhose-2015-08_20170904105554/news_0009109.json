A total loss of $1.25bn (£800m) was attributed to \"other expenses\". \nBut the sharp decline in oil prices over the past year has also played a part, with the value of a barrel of Brent crude at $48.81, down more than 50% from $101.60 a barrel 12 months ago. \nOther commodities have also been in decline. Coal prices are at their lowest in 12 years, with some analysts pointing out that water and cabbage are priced at higher rates in some parts of the world. \nCopper prices have seen a slump too, registering at a six-year low. \nBut Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg said his company was \"well positioned\" to benefit when the commodities market rose again. \n\"Against a challenging backdrop for many of our commodities, we have taken a range of pre-emptive actions in respect of our balance sheet, operations and capital spending/recycling in order to preserve our current credit rating and sustain our track record on equity distributions,\" he said. \n\"We remain by far the most diversified commodity producer and marketer and are well positioned to benefit from any improvement in pricing when it finally and inevitably materialises.\" \nIvan Glasenberg himself owns about 8% of the firm's shares, meaning that the loss in value over the last four months has resulted in a personal paper loss of around $1.4bn (£800m).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T12:33:10.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
