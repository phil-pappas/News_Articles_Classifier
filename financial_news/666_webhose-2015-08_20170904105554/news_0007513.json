The article sports a headline with which plastic surgeon Payam Jarrah-Nejad M.D., F.A.C.S. takes serious issue. “Women now prize plastic surgery over having kids, marriage” states the attention grabbing banner. Dr. J, as the plastic surgery is more casually known to his patients, says that the headline grossly exaggerates and distorts the reality that both female and male patients naturally do prioritize their expenses in order to pay for procedures. Dr. J points out that, in his view, plastic surgery is more affordable, even for individuals on relatively modest budgets, than most people assume. He adds, however, that that is not to say the RealSelf survey results are not legitimate. The study actually found that responders who had obtained a procedure chose to temporarily avoid a wide variety of discretionary expenses. One third say that had delayed vacations, and a somewhat smaller number had put off home improvements. Delaying marriage or having a child came much further down the list, but nowhere did it say that anyone had permanently forgone marriage or children in favor of plastic surgery. Dr. J. notes that saying that women would “prize” plastic surgery over getting married or having children is a gross and insulting distortion, while also exaggerating the fiscal sacrifices needed to obtain a procedure.\nOf course, it’s only natural for patients to be concerned about the cost of a procedure, says Dr. J, and it’s sensible to save money prior to any significant purchase. At the same time, he wishes to deflate the notion that plastic surgery is so costly that only the wealthy can afford it. In his actual experience with countless patients, Dr. J says, the issue of cost has almost never determined whether or not patients ultimately chose to go ahead with a procedure.\nHe goes on to say sensationalizing the cost of procedures has a darker side, as it may encourage prospective plastic surgery patients to pursue seemingly inexpensive options from cut-rate clinics based both in the U.S. and abroad. Dr. J points out that the risks of seeking out practitioners who are not board certified plastic surgeons are well documented and that, even for women who are not permanently harmed by botched procedures, the cost of revision surgeries to fix errors often dwarfs the cost of one ordinary successful procedure with a qualified plastic surgeon.\nWomen with questions about such matters as how to obtain flattering and safe breast augmentation in a financially sensible manner… or anyone interested in any procedure….can call Dr. J at 310-993-3800.
