Flows through the SEGAL pipeline are expected to return on Friday. \nFurther along the curve, gas for September delivery was up 0.40 pence at 39.35 p/therm. \nPrices were also slightly higher on the Dutch TTF market, with gas for day-ahead delivery up 0.08 euro at 18.98 euros per megawatt-hour. \nIn Europe's carbon market, benchmark EU Allowances (EUA) was down by 0.02 euros to 8.09 euros a tonne.
