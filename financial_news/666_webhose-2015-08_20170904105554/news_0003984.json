That sums up the plight they are in right now.\"\nS&P said that this year's financing needs will be covered by multilateral and other official sources, as well Chinese funding, noting that next year borrowing requirements will drop to around US$6bn.\nOther investors are taking a more sanguine view of Ecuador's prospects on the expectations that the country can cover upcoming funding needs through the local markets and development banks.\n\"We think Ecuador is being unduly punished,\" said Bryan Carter, head of EM debt at Acadian Asset Management. \"Granted, it is an oil exporting country and that impacts the economy, but even accounting for that, the bonds look cheap.\"\nElsewhere markets were largely weaker as investors took a hands off approach to a region seen vulnerable to China's decision this week to devalue its currency.\n\"People have been trying to figure out this move in China and what this means,\" said Jorge Piedrahita, CEO at broker Torino Capital. \"They have been reluctant to put risk on.\" (Reporting By Paul Kilby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T23:24:55.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
