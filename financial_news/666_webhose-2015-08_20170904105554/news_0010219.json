Advertising Print This Post \nBitcoin wallet, exchange and merchant services provider Coinbase has partnered with payment solutions provider Vogogo, enabling its expansion to Canada. \nCalgary-based Vogogo aims to take on the load of risk management, compliance and security for payments processed, bridging the gap between the fiat banking and digital currency worlds and allowing exchanges to focus more on their business strategies. \nIt has become a go-to destination for Canadian bitcoin exchanges, which have traditionally had a tough time maintaining banking relationships. More recently, it helped crypto exchanges Kraken and Bitstamp make inroads into the country. \nCoinbase’s services had until now only been available in the US (in selected states) and several European countries. The partnership with Vogogo will allow residents to hook up a Canadian bank account, deposit CAD into a Coinbase wallet, and buy bitcoin either through Coinbase’s brokerage service or through Coinbase Exchange. \nVogogo, which secured $12.5 million in funding in June, is publicly traded on the TSX Venture Exchange. After soaring by over 300% late last year to over $4.00 within a few months, it has since returned almost all of its gains, currently trading at $1.00. News of the partnership has not helped the shares, which are trading lower by over 7%. It market cap is currently CAD$48 million.
