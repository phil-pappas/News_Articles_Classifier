Sales of newspapers were down 4pc on a like-for-like basis, while magazines declined 5pc, although these were partly mitigated by cover price rises. \n\"Our transition plans are on track and progressing well, although the first half of the year has been challenging as we continue to address the operational issues that arose during 2014,” said Jeremy Stafford, chief executive. \n“In terms of group full-year performance, as we previously highlighted, profits will have a greater second half weighting this year as we continue to transition the business. There is a great deal of potential across the business and we remain on track.\" \nMr Stafford added that John Menzies was looking to grow its presence in the e-commerce parcel market following the acquisition of Highlands-based AJG Parcels for £7.5m in June. \nThe introduction of the new national living wage , announced by the Chancellor in the summer Budget, would hit employment costs primarily in its distribution business, the company added, but it was “considering a range of mitigating actions”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T11:09:35.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
