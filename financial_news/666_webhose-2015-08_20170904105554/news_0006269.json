The United Kingdom is one of the leading providers in the world when it comes to accounting, with over 200,000 students passing out as accountants every year. Some students specialising in auditing, financial reporting and taxation. Financial companies are after satisfying results, and their only option to obtain this is to hire skilled accountants. Accountancy is the assessment of all financial records resulting from economic activities undertaken by a client or company. Once all records are gathered and put into place, the final report is then communicated with different people within that company. For example this could be head of management, a board of directors, investors or creditors. Finance is quite undoubtably a respectable profession, although it does come with it's fair share of challenges. Accountants undergo working long hours in the office to get their work done, however this is a small price to pay if the bigger picture is considered. Cambridge Accountants offers large room for growth, due to their many subcategory roles. These subcategory roles give aspiring accountants the opportunity to specialise in other financial related fields. This includes assurance, audit, business finance, corporate recovery and/or bankruptcy, forensic accounting, taxation, financial outsourcing and management advising. Many accountancy firms can offer additional training for aspiring accountants, however already having these under your belt can be a huge career booster, as can working with a worldwide respected accountancy organisation. For those who have a flair for financial assessment and evaluation may be equally interested in auditing, and impartially is one factor that should never be forgotten about whilst auditing. This is one of the duties of an auditor, being able to bring to light any discrepancies which may have occurred knowingly or unknowingly. This can be picked up in the financial reports or if the results of the financial position of the company does not match with the given records. Cambridge Accountants have so far shown extraordinary professionalism and competence whilst dealing with clients, those of which have highly recommended them. About the Author Rhia for BAAM.
