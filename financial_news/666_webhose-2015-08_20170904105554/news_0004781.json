The commission's final report was handed to Zuma on March 31, who released it to the public on June 25. \nZuma on Sunday said the implementation of the commission's recommendations were being taken seriously by government. \nHe received responses from national police commissioner Riah Phiyega and Cabinet minister and was considering these. \nThe Association of Mining and Construction Union (Amcu) is holding a commemoration on Sunday at the koppie in Marikana where mineworkers were killed. \nThe union said it was open invitation and anyone could attend the event. \nEconomic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema and Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane was expected to attend. \nZuma on Sunday called on everyone to keep the families of those killed in their thoughts and prayers. \n\"As government, we stand with all the people of Marikana and the people of the Eastern Cape from where many of those who died came. \n\"We also stand with all the people of South Africa as well, who were horrified and shocked by the tragedy that unfolded in Marikana,\" he said. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:44:50.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
