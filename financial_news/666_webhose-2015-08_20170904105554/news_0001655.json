Photo: Rob Homer\nCautious consumers are driving the second-hand car market, with used car sales accounting for more than one third of Automotive Holdings Group car sales in the 2015 financial year.\nAHG sold 6225 more used cars to June 30 2015, outstripping the group's new car sales growth by more than 1500 vehicles.\nThe increase in AHG's second-hand sales points to sagging consumer sentiment , according to analysts, particularly in its home state of WA, which also has its largest dealership network.\nMarketwide car sales slumped to 9 per cent in the 12 months to July compared to 6 per cent growth in total car sales in NSW for the same period.\nAdvertisement \"We are in a relatively subdued macro environment,\" Patersons Securities analyst Ben Rowe said. \"People are watching what they spend so the used car market is more attractive than the new car market.\"\nAHG reaps a higher margin on used cars than on new vehicles but second-hand sales also benefit the group's service division, which enjoyed an 8 per cent lift in service or repair orders in the financial year.\nAHG's combined car and truck sales for Australia and New Zealand increased by 12,274 vehicles in 2015, up by 12 per cent on 2014 sales, ensuring it remains the biggest earner for the group.\nMr Rowe said the automotive division was the \"standout performer\" and the east coast dealerships were obviously \"ticking along very nicely\", offsetting some of the weakness in WA.\nAHG's profit after tax was up 20per cent to $94.2 million and full-year revenue grew by 10.8 per cent to $5.2 billion. The car and truck business benefited from AHG's $68 million acquisition of the NSW Bradstreet motor group in March 2014, and managing director Bronte Howson said the business had the \"war chest\" to fund further purchases.\n\"There are more acquisitions out there, it's just a matter of us moving when the opportunity arises,\" Mr Howson said.\nAHG is focused on expanding its dealership footprint in Victoria and NSW, where the sales outlook is strongest, supported in part by the runaway property markets.\n The group's refrigerated freight division was hit by lower volumes moving east-west as a result of the mining slowdown. Mr Howson estimated the fall at 10 per cent.\nAHG's acquisition of the Scotts Refrigerated Freightways and JAT Refrigerated Road Services supported growth for the division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:55:34.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
