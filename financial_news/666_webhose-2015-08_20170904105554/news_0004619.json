Photo: Glenn Campbell\nThe restart of Japan's first nuclear reactor in almost two years marks a potential turning point for the beleaguered uranium mining industry but analysts remain unconvinced the milestone will have any immediate impact on sagging prices.\nJapan's nuclear power sector was forced to a standstill after the Japanese tsunami of March 2011 triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant and prompted the country to turn off its 50 nuclear reactors.\nHe was strong at the helm and delivered what he said he was going to do but unfortunately delivered late and probably remained bullish for too long.\nMatthew Keane, Argonaut analyst The sector took a significant step forward on Tuesday with Japanese utility Kyushu Electric Power's restart of its Sendai unit 1 nuclear reactor. All going well, Kyushu Electric expects the plant to generate electricity by Friday and hopes to restart the second reactor at Sendai later this year. The two reactors were the first to pass the country's new nuclear safety requirements and are likely to be the first reactors back in operation since two reactors temporarily restarted in 2013.\nJohn Borshoff of Paladin Energy had long been heralding a restart.

Spot prices are now about $US36 a pound with the long-term price indicator sitting at about $US45.\nArgonaut analyst Matthew Keane said the restart reinforced Japan's energy intentions but was unlikely to have any major impact on the \"low and lingering\" price.\n\"There's a lot of inventory that is sloshing around and one reactor is not going to start eating away at that now, so it is a sentimental indicator for the market which exhibits and reinforces Japan is not going anti-nuclear,\" Mr Keane said.\n\"It is likely to be a prompt more than anything else for nuclear fuel buyers to come back into the market. Most of the fuel buyers recognise there's a [supply] surplus now but longer term, post-2020, there is a real structural deficit that's not going to be filled and probably even more impacted by the low prices which has stopped the development of the projects they thought would provide supply from 2020.\"\nThe World Nuclear Association said in a statement Sendai 1 was the first of 43 operable Japanese nuclear reactors expected to come back online over the next few years and one of 25 plants that have applied to be restarted.\nMr Keane said it was \"extremely important\" the restart of Sendai 1 went smoothly to ensure the other reactors seeking approval to restart had an easier path to re-powering.\n\"The status is we have more reactors planned and proposed now [globally] than there was pre-Fukushima,\" he said. \"So despite the incident the world is moving ahead.\"\nSelf described as \"bullish\" on uranium, Mr Keane said he had a price forecast of $US55 per pound for this financial year, increasing to $US70 a pound longer term.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Kaan Peker expects the spot price to continue to recover and forecast $US45 a pound by the end of the calendar year and over $US50 a pound in 2016.\n'Good sign' Australian uranium developer Vimy Resources managing director Mike Young said the restart was a \"good sign\" for projects in development, such as Vimy's Mulga Rock project in Western Australia.\n\"I think sentiment wise it might affect share prices but I don't know it will impact pricing because everyone has priced that in and everyone that looks forward has an idea Japan will come back on slowly,\" Mr Young said.\nLocally listed uranium plays Toro Energy and Paladin Energy posted strong gains on the market on Tuesday, up 11.7 per cent to 6.7¢ and 11 per cent to 20¢ respectively.\nOn Monday, Paladin Energy chief executive John Borshoff announced his departure from the uranium miner he founded over two decades ago .\nIronic timing The ironic timing of the reactor restart wouldn't have been lost on Mr Borshoff who has long been heralding a likely restart, and the positive impact that would have on pricing.\nMr Keane said Mr Borshoff was \"always going to be right… but he was too bullish too soon\".\n\"He was strong at the helm and delivered what he said he was going to do but unfortunately delivered late and probably remained bullish for too long,\" Mr Keane said.\nInvestment banker Alexander Molyneux will take on the role of interim CEO. UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock said \"the incoming CEO arrives with a lot of work still to complete\" as the miner works to cut its costs. UBS estimates Paladin is losing about $US6 a pound at current spot prices.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/street-talk/paladin-md-john-borshoff-to-take-his-leave-20150810-givkw9"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T12:55:31.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
