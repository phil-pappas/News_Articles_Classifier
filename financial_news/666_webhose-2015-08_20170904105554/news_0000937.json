Andrew Meares by Ben Potter Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris urged governments to return to big picture reform processes of the 1980s and 1990s which had a \"monumental effect\" on the economy.\nMr Harris defended the commission's low key draft report on reforming the workplace relations system by saying that the evidence did not support business critics who argued the system was dysfunctional.\nMr Harris didn't explicitly contrast the sweeping reforms of the 1980s and 1990s under the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments with the faltering and ineffective efforts of the Abbott and Rudd-Gillard administrations.\nBut he left the Committee for Economic Development of Australia in Melbourne in no doubt that he believed Australia would benefit from a return to an orderly approach to reform that had \"worked so well for us in the past\".\n\"I think it had a monumental effect on expectations among all parties in the economy for the persistent way it was pursued by governments of different political complexions over longer than a decade,\" Mr Harris said.\n\"And the vehicle of using major economic reform statements conveyed those expectations.\n\"There was a continuous series of these and no party could easily believe that they could be protected from the consequences of opening the economy up to competition and innovation.\"\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said on Thursday the commission's draft report on workplace relations failed to offer solutions to the problems of a \"conflict driven\" enterprising bargaining system.\n Mr Harris said he had encouraged Ms Westacott to put forward her views but he had also asked for supporting evidence – \"something we can take and further analyse\".\nHe said governments should continue to pursue workplace relations reform and the commission would be a willing participant.\nBut many anecdotal examples of workplace problems didn't go to \"the structure of the system\".\nFor example, he said evidence did not support the idea that the current minimum wage process delivered \"significant negative employment outcomes\" or that an earned income tax credit for new workers – which works well in the US – would be better in Australia.\nNeither did the commission find better alternatives to the National Employment Standards, or persuasive grounds to abolish awards.\nInstead it recommended more measured changes – an enterprise contract to save small business from the complexities of the bargaining system, a fresh approach to award modernisation, and \"cultural change\" at the Fair Work Commission with fewer members appointed from the ranks of union and employer officials.\n\"Long term improvement in the Australian workplace relations system requires change in the nature and performance of the regulator,\" he said.\n\"In future, the FWC cannot rely on partisan analysis. Any one party's analysis, no matter how sound, will be automatically marked down in public debate due to its source.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:05:05.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
