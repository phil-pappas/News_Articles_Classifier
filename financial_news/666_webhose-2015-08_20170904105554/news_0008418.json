Yes I’m not gonna be a pretentious douche by saying that money isn’t everything when in fact it is,” wrote one anonymous contributor.\n“My father is extremely rich. Extremely. I’m not gonna say from where because at this point, his investments are so diverse that I think even he’s not sure where his money [is] going. Suffice to say that at the height of his wealth, he was ranked top 100 richest by Forbes.”\nGrowing up in a mansion with a team of nannies, luxury holidays, friends clamouring for attention, and a Maserati for his 18th birthday (“although I’ve been driving his fleet of fancy cars since I was 15”) are par for the course, he writes.\nBut there are some lesser-known aspects to being a billionaire. “My friends used to assume that all I did at home was eat Kobe steak and caviar when that is far from the case,” he wrote.\n“Sure, I’ve had my fair share of fine dining, but my meals on most days are quite regular. McDonald’s, pizza and all that good stuff. Sure we had chefs but most of the time, I ask them to cook normal meals.”\nYes, the family has a private jet, but it’s “used mainly by my father when he is extremely busy to the extent that he cant miss even a few hours of work”.\n“If he’s not busy he flies commercial just like everybody else,” he writes. “Oh, but we do fly First Class. And whenever I go on vacation with my friends we fly private but we don't use my father’s jet, we charter one.”\nAnd while most people assume he’s only friends with rich people, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. “I’m friends with everyone, in fact some don't even know about my wealth,” he writes.\nWhat users really wanted to know, however, was whether he paid for his own WinZip licence. “I had to ask my friend to explain that joke since I'm not much of a computer guy. But the answer is I guess so? We have a guy come and set up all our computers with everything we need. So I’m not sure if he pirated any software but I don't think so.”\nJohn H. Hillman V the grand-nephew of a billionaire Pittsburgh steel tycoon and venture capitalist, also offered his take on growing up in a “storied family”.\n“How does it feel for me? Aside from knowing that I come from solid stock, which I try to live up to, I have constant reminders such as the Hillman Library which was named after my great-grandfather and is the main library of the University of Pittsburgh,” Mr Hillman wrote.\n“The question I most often hear about that building is: ‘Don’t you like, own a library or something?’”\nHe said he often had people mistakenly thanking him for curing their cancer, due to sharing a name with the Hillman Cancer Center. “I don’t like that at all, it makes me feel uncomfortable,” he wrote.\n“I have great friends. I can’t clarify that enough. They are all lifelong friends who know me well. It isn’t like I have hangers-on or people who want to be in my life because of a perceived wealth, though I believe others in my family might have that problem.\n“Every month I get a stranger that says ‘Hey, are you related to the Hillmans ...?’ or something like that. Basically I just go with the flow. I am modest, live a modest life and it’s all just fun and respect. Respect for my family and respect for people that are interested in ‘us.’ When I think of my family’s fortunes I think of how much has been given back to Pittsburgh and that is mainly how I identify with it.”\nAnother anonymous user explained how his grandfather was from an “obscenely rich” Eastern European family who lost everything in World War II. “His father, my great-grandfather was an oil baron and self-made man from an eastern European country, while my great-grandmother was nobility from the same country,” they wrote.\n“Our family lived in a 150-room mansion with a staff of 30+ servants. One obvious sign of wealth is having people work directly for you, for your personal life. Leaders of large organisations, such as CEOs, congressmen, and so on, maintain personal aides but these talented assistants serve a business need.\n“The extremely wealthy keep others around to run their personal lives, servants who work at any time day or night and live on-site. Grandpa’s immediate family was only four people, yet the cooking staff alone was seven people. They paid a yacht captain to maintain a boat used only once or twice a year.”\nBoth the grandfather and grand-uncle went to a boarding school like “Hogwarts” from Harry Potter. “The school was in a castle, with each grade having their own well appointed common room with hand carved pool tables and marble fireplaces. Each grade had just 15-20 students, and I believe the school faculty outnumbered the students.\n“Grandpa said that one did not ‘apply’ to this school, you were invited. He showed me a class photo and read off who each boy was and what his father did. The list was quite intimidating, as these families basically owned and ran that part of the world.”\nIncrease ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/what-its-like-growing-up-as-a-billionaire/story-fnu2po3p-1227465287247?sv=708e5844e530f24fae538229aef794ae&title=Growing+up+as+a+billionaire", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/what-its-like-growing-up-as-a-billionaire/story-fnu2po3p-1227465287247?sv=708e5844e530f24fae538229aef794ae", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/what-its-like-growing-up-as-a-billionaire/story-fnu2po3p-1227465287247?sv=708e5844e530f24fae538229aef794ae&h=Growing+up+as+a+billionaire", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Growing+up+as+a+billionaire&c=WHAT%26%238217%3BS+it+like+growing+up+as+a+billionaire%3F+%26%238220%3BIt%26%238217%3Bs+awesome.+I%26%238217%3Bm+not+going+to+be+a+pretentious+douche+by+saying+that+money+isn%26%238217%3Bt+everything+when+in+fact+it+is.%26%238221%3B&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/what-its-like-growing-up-as-a-billionaire/story-fnu2po3p-1227465287247?sv=708e5844e530f24fae538229aef794ae", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/what-its-like-growing-up-as-a-billionaire/story-fnu2po3p-1227465287247?sv=708e5844e530f24fae538229aef794ae&title=Growing+up+as+a+billionaire", "http://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-come-from-a-billion-dollar-family", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/what-its-like-growing-up-as-a-billionaire/story-fnu2po3p-1227465287247?sv=708e5844e530f24fae538229aef794ae"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:28:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
