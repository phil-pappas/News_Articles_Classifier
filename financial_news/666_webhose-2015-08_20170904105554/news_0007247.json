Wednesday's decision upheld that dismissal, without ruling on the claim's merits.\nAurelius owned $2 billion of pre-LBO debt, and it is unclear what the hedge fund paid for it, the appeals court said.\nThe 3rd Circuit separately revived claims by two bond trustees seeking to recoup $30 million from various Tribune creditors, saying that request would not jeopardize the reorganization plan.\nTribune emerged from Chapter 11 with a clean balance sheet and new ownership.\nIt has since split into Tribune Media Co, which owns broadcasting and digital media assets such as the WGN superstation, and Tribune Publishing Co, which owns newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times.\nTribune Media spokesman Gary Weitman declined to comment.\nThe case is In re: Tribune Media Co, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 14-3332 and 14-3333.
