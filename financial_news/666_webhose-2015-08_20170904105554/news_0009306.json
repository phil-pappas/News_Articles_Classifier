It's certainly worth using active managers skilled at identifying the best-value Eastern or Western companies that operate in Asia. And it pays to buy when markets with good long-term fundamentals experience savage short-term corrections. Here are six strategies to play the Asian consumption boom:\nInvest directly in Asian equities. Kevin Bertoli, portfolio manager of Asian equities at PM Capital, says investors should try to find the Asian equivalents of McDonald's, The Coca-Cola Company and Wal-Mart, rather than invest in multinationals with an Asian presence. \"Giant US companies emerged in the 1980s and 1990s when its middle class grew, and the same will be true in Asia as consumption takes off,\" he says.\nBertoli favours emerging South-East Asian economies over more mature Asian countries, such as Japan or South Korea, and businesses that operate in monopoly or duopoly markets. This strategy capitalises on the tailwind of Asian population growth, but reduces risks by investing in companies that have strong, defendable market positions and higher profit margins.\nThe Malaysian beer makers, Guinness Anchor Berhad and Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad, are examples, Bertoli says. The two companies, held in the PM Capital Asian Opportunities Fund, control 90 per cent of Malaysia's beer market and have profit margins of more than 20 per cent after adjusting for excise taxes. China's top five beer companies control 70 per cent of that market and have 5-10 per cent profit margins.\nBertoli also rates Tingyi Holding Corp (a maker of instant noodles and beverages in China), Astro Malaysia Holdings (a pay-TV provider), the Hong Kong-listed Beijing Capital International Airport and Sinopec Kantons Holdings (an oil terminal and pipeline provider in China). AAC Technologies, a Hong Kong-listed provider of acoustics and haptics (vibration technology for electronic gadgets), is another holding.\nBertoli says subsidiaries of US and European multinationals that are listed in Asia are mostly too expensive. These include the Indian listings of Colgate-Palmolive and Hindustan Unilever, and Nestlé's Malaysian subsidiary. \"They are all quality business, but they tend to have the highest valuations because investors gravitate to the best-known consumer names first, and sell them last during a downturn. You have to be patient with these stocks, wait for better value, and look for the lesser-known 'second derivative' consumer stocks that are growing strongly.\"\nBuy multinational companies with a growing Asian presence Montgomery Global Investment portfolio manager Chris Demasi believes China will drive Apple Inc's growth. \"China accounts for more than a quarter of Apple's revenue, but 60 per cent of its revenue growth,\" he says. \"Apple is doubling its Chinese business every year.\"\nRapid growth in the penetration of fourth generation (4G) cellular telecommunication networks will accompany gains in Chinese household income, Demasi says. \"The value of the premium smart-device will increase, through an ability to stream high-quality video and other services. It will be worthwhile to buy higher-value electronic devices.\"\nDemasi says Apple, at $US125 a share, trades on less than 10 times its trailing earnings after adjusting for its cash balance. \"Apple is meaningfully undervalued.\"\nHe also favours the French company Essilor International, a global leader in eyeglass lenses. More than 4.3 billion people have an eyesight impairment but almost 60 per cent do not have access to eye care. \"These numbers are more compelling in China, where Essilor derives a mid-teen proportion of revenues,\" Demasi says. \"China's market for clear glasses is expected to grow in the high single digits and sunglass lenses should have double-digit growth over the next decade as the population ages and access to eye care improves. About 1.3 billion Chinese are genetically predisposed to myopia (short-sightedness).\"\nK2 Asset Management's Nick Griffin favours international travel companies that are benefiting from the boom in outbound Chinese tourism. K2's international fund owns the US-listed Royal Caribbean Cruises and Carnival Corp. \"The Chinese are showing strong demand for cruising holidays and there is a favourable supply environment, with few big cruise ships built in the past five years. These companies dominate their market, have better control of pricing and can cater to a large, growing Asian market.\"\nGriffin also favours Asian cosmetic companies that sell to the middle class, and US and European sportswear companies such as Nike Inc, Adidas Group and ASICS Corp. The bicycle companies, Shimano Inc and Giant Manufacturing Co, also appeal. \"As in Western markets, the combination of urbanisation and rising incomes leads to greater interest in exercise and sports goods,\" he says.\nNathan Bell, of Peters MacGregor Capital Management, believes Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will benefit from the middle-class consumption boom. \"Having brought the company back from the dead, chief executive Sergio Marchionne has become almost as iconic as some of the company's household name brands such as Ferrari, Maserati, Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat. Asian customers will demand greater choice in what they drive, including many aspirational brands.\"\nBell adds: \"Ferrari will be spun off [from Fiat] later this year, creating a fear that the leftovers – a highly leveraged, low-margin, capital-intensive automobile manufacturer – won't amount to much. But with Marchionne creating billions in value over the past decade, we think the market is underestimating the company's prospects.\"\nBuy Australian companies with an Asian footprint Finding ASX-listed companies with a large presence in Asia is hard work. Those that have expanded offshore have typically favoured the US, UK or Europe.\nRob Hopkins, managing director of the top-rated SmallCo Investment Fund, believes iProperty Group has good prospects and is undervalued. It is an emerging ASX-listed company that provides online property advertising services in South-East Asia.\niProperty dominates in Malaysia and now in Hong Kong after buying REA Group's real estate portal, squarefoot.com.hk, late last year. The consideration, five million iProperty shares, made REA Group its largest shareholder, now with a 21 per cent stake.\nHopkins says iProperty is ideally positioned in large South-East Asian markets. \"As in the West, property advertising in Asia will continue to migrate from print to online over the coming decade. Large populations and very low rates of online property advertising in these markets will provide strong growth for iProperty over the next five years.\"\nOnline property advertising in Malaysia and Singapore is less than 10 per cent of the total property advertising and 3 per cent or less in Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia.\nA merger between iProperty and the PropertyGuru, the leading Singapore online property site, has been speculated. A TPG-led consortium, which included Seek co-founder Paul Bassat's Square Peg Capital, invested $175 million in PropertyGuru in June. iProperty fell on the news.\nHopkins also favours iSentia Group, a print and social-media monitoring provider that listed on the ASX in a June 2014 float, after raising $284 million at $2.04 a share. iSentia has raced to $3.54 as the market embraces its Asian expansion strategy.\nHopkins says iSentia is expanding rapidly in South-East Asia and Greater China through acquisitions and organic growth \"We expect a lot of growth for iSentia in the medium term as it rolls out its upgraded, improved digital platforms across Asia.\"\nAmong large stocks, Clime Asset Management favours Crown Resorts. The casino operator is leveraged to the Asian middle class through a 33.6 per cent stake in the Nasdaq-listed Melco Crown, owner of casino resorts in Macau.\nCrown has fallen 25 per cent from its 2014 high of $17.90. Clime wrote in a report: \"The fall largely reflects the market's anxiety over Melco Crown, which is affected by a structural change in the Macau market, as the Chinese government's anti-corruption campaign drives government officials from the lucrative VIP segment. We think the slowdown in Macau is temporary and is disproportionately reflected in the share price.\"\nAsia-focused unit trusts The potential for market shocks in Asian reinforces the benefits of investing in diversified managed funds rather than directly in stocks, and letting professionals manage your money.\nAsian share funds managed from Asia have performed strongly: the average return, 27 per cent over one year to June 2015, on Morningstar data, compares to a 4 per cent total return from Australian shares. Over 10 years, Asian managed funds returned an average 8 per cent annually, slightly more than Australia's top 200 shares, albeit with higher risk.\nBut the performance could deteriorate because Chinese equities by far account for the highest weighting in Asian share funds.\nThe Macquarie Asia New Stars No.1 Fund stands out over three years with an annualised 37 per cent return. Other top performers over that period include the Premium Asia fund (27 per cent) and the Platinum Asia fund (25 per cent).\nThe top 10-year performers are Platinum Asia (12 per cent annual return), the Aberdeen Asian Opportunities fund (10 per cent), Schroder Asia Pacific und and Maple-Brown Abbot Asian Investment fund (about 9 per cent each).\nMorningstar data shows a third of funds under management in Asian unit trusts were, on average, invested in China, another third in South Korea, India and Taiwan, and the rest spread across smaller Asian countries. By sector, the funds had high weightings in technology and consumer cyclical stocks compared to those that invest in Australian shares, meaning better exposure to growth industries and diversification benefits.\nTechnology and consumer stocks are expected to be big winners from the Asian consumption boom.\nExchange-traded funds over Asian indices Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that replicate the price and yield performance of Asian sharemarket indices provide more precise exposure to emerging markets, compared to buying multinational companies.\nLow-cost, ASX-Quote: d ETFs, bought and sold like shares, provide easy exposure to a basket of China's top companies, Hong Kong equities or other key Asian indices. These suit portfolio investors who want country or regional exposure in Asia, are happy with the market return and who use ETFs as an asset allocation tool in the international component of their portfolio.\nBut the absence of active management in emerging-market ETFs can be hazardous during volatile periods. ETF investors cannot rely on professional managers to limit losses, relative to the fund's underlying benchmark index.\nCurrency risks are another complication because most international ETFs Quote: d on the ASX are unhedged. That is changing as more issuers offer hedged version of their funds.\nAsia-focused ETFs have performed well, in part because of the lower Australian dollar. The iShares Hong Kong ETF has a three-year annualised return of 26 per cent to June 2015. The iShares Japan ETF returned 24 per cent and the iShares Asia 50 ETF 20 per cent.\nInvestors can also use ETFs for sector or company exposure. The iShares Global 100 ETF provides exposure to the world's largest companies, many with an expanding Asian presence. The iShares Global Consumer Staples ETF invests in companies such as Nestle, Procter & Gamble and The Coca-Cola Company.\nListed investment companies Listed managed funds are another option for Asia-focused investors and, unlike unlisted funds, can provide an opportunity to buy assets for less. Unlike unit trusts, the price of a listed investment company (LIC) can deviate significantly from its underlying net tangible assets (NTA).\nSeveral international LICs traded at a discount to NTA in June 2015, ASX data shows. In theory, this means investors can buy the LIC's assets for less than they are worth, but a discount many be appropriate if the manager has a poor performance or a patchy dividend record.\nMore fund managers are expected to launch Asia-focused LICs this year. Kerr Neilson's Platinum Asset Management is raising up to $600 million for the Platinum Asia Fund LIC.\nThe PM Capital Asian Opportunities Fund is a standout Asia-focused LIC. It invests in a concentrated portfolio of 15 to 35 Asian stocks and actively manages currency risks. The Asian Masters Fund is another strong performer, returning 42 per cent over 12 months.\nAlex MacLachlan, a director of the Asian Masters Fund, says its focus on markets such as India, benefiting from political and financial reforms, has driven gains. Investing in Pakistan, Vietnam and other frontier countries, as well as travel companies exposed to Asian consumers, and avoiding resource stocks, are the LIC's other key themes.\nAmong China-focused LICs, the AMP Capital China Growth Fund has traded at persistent discounts to NTA, frustrating shareholders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T07:00:04.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
