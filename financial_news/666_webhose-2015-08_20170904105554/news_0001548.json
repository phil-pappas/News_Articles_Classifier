today for a crucial vote on ratifying a hurriedly-concluded bailout deal, but Germany has cast doubt on the agreement.\nGreece and its creditors reached a technical agreement on a third international bailout after marathon talks in the early hours of Tuesday morning but the deal, which Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says should promptly unlock default-saving funds for his debt-crippled country, must still be approved by eurozone member states.\n>>Read: Greece agrees bailout deal, averts default\nA Greek government source said Tsipras had called an emergency session of parliament for Thursday, and eurozone finance ministers will then meet the following day to give their verdict on the deal, Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem's spokesman said on Twitter.\nAs eurozone ministers prepared to examine the accord in Brussels on Friday, Tsipras said he was confident the 400-page document -- set for a parliamentary vote in Athens late on Thursday night -- would be approved.\n\"I am and remain confident that we will succeed in reaching a deal and loan support ... that will end economic uncertainty,\" he said.\nBut in an apparent swipe at Germany, the 41-year-old premier said certain EU states had a \"hidden plan to reshape the eurozone, using Greece as the excuse.\"\n\"Greece will not give them the excuse,\" he said.\nCaution\nBerlin, however, has urged caution.\n\"We have formulated questions,\" Germany's finance ministry said in a statement. \"These are part of the review process which is not yet completed.\"\nGerman newspaper Bild cited a two-page finance ministry document that raised questions about Greece's debt sustainability, the role of the International Monetary Fund and over privatisations.\nBerlin is also unhappy about Greece's annual budget targets being scaled back, Bild said.\nGreece and its creditors are under pressure to finalise the €85 billion deal by August 20 when Athens must repay some €3.4 billion to the European Central Bank.\nSeparately, EU sources said Greece will tumble back into deep recession this year.\nThe Greek economy, which crawled out of a six-year recession only in 2014, will shrink 2.3 percent in 2015 and another 1.3 percent in 2016, they said.\nGrowth should then return, running at 2.7% in 2017 and 3.1% in 2018, the sources said.\nGreece has repeatedly complained that the austerity measures demanded by its creditors -- the EU, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund -- in return for two previous bailouts have only hurt an economy that has contracted by a quarter since the crisis broke.\nThe latest rescue package calls for a gas market overhaul, ends most early retirement schemes, eliminates fuel price benefits for farmers and raises some taxes, among other measures.\nThe government said Greek banks -- which were forced to shut down for three weeks as panicked customers withdrew billions of euros -- would immediately receive €10 billion from the package, and will be fully recapitalised by the end of the year.\nTough talks\nThe draft deal comes after months of acrimonious negotiations between the creditors and Greece's left-wing government, which took power in January.\nInvestors reacted with relief to news of the outline deal, with shares in Athens closing Tuesday 2.14% higher for a fourth straight day of gains.\nBut the positive run ended on Wednesday with the ATHEX index closing 1.93% down.\nAn EU source said it was unclear if the bailout would be finalised by the August 20 deadline -- leaving open the possibility that Athens might need a few days of emergency funding.\n\"In that case, we need all the member states\" to approve such a loan, the source added, in what could pose a fresh headache for negotiators.\nFinland's Finance Minister Alexander Stubb -- one of the hardliners on the bailout accord -- told AFP that Helsinki would carefully scrutinise all the details.\nTsipras is under pressure from hardliners in his radical left Syriza party who say the new accord will pile further austerity on a weakened economy and goes against the party's campaign pledges. He suffered a major mutiny by Syriza members in two previous votes on the bailout.\nThe embattled prime minister has warned that he may be forced to call early elections if the dissent continues.\nAn analyst at Capital Economics urged caution. \"While Greece appears finally to be on the verge of receiving a third bailout, the extremely optimistic economic and fiscal projections underlying the plan suggest that it might not last for very long,\" he said.\nVaroufakis pessimistic too\nMeanwhile, Greece's former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis on Wednesday warned that the latest bailout deal was doomed to fail despite Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras saying he was \"confident\" of ending economic uncertainty.\nIn a implicit criticism of his former ally Tsipras, he told BBC radio: \"Ask anyone who knows anything about Greece's finances and they will tell you this deal is not going to work.\"\n\"The Greek finance minister... says more or less the same thing,\" he added.\nThe controversial politician resigned the day after Greeks voted against a proposed bailout in a July 5 referendum, accusing the country's creditors of \"terrorism.\"\nVaroufakis told the BBC that Germany's veteran Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had had to \"go to the Bundestag and effectively confess this deal is not going to work\".\n\"The International Monetary Fund... is throwing up its hands collectively despairing at a programme that is simply founded on unsustainable debt... and yet this is a programme that everybody is working towards implementing,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:35:49.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
