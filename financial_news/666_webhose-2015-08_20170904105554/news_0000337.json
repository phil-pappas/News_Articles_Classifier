The FTSE 100 , which is mining-heavy, tumbled by 71.68 points, or 1.1pc, to 6,664.54 - 6.2pc off April’s record high. European bourses also floundered, with the CAC and DAX off by 1.9pc and 2.7pc, respectively. \n“Markets have become rather too accustomed to the idea that Chinese growth will decline gradually below the 7pc level, but they may be in for a rude shock if the slowdown is more rapid than expected,” Chris Beauchamp, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said. * China’s renminbi gambit: why it has devalued the yuan Luxury fashion house Burberry was among the heaviest hit, losing 71p, or 4.4pc, to close at £15.36. Last month, the FTSE 100 company, which sells extensively in China, revealed a second-quarter sales slowdown due to softer demand in Asia. \nThe weaker Chinese yuan also bruised cruise operator Carnival , down 44p to £34.80, and Merlin , off by 4.2p to 399.8p. China’s Fosun International holds a 5pc stake in Thomas Cook (Xetra: A0MR3W - news ) , knocking 0.3pc off the UK-based tour operator. \nMeanwhile, oil prices slumped below the $50 mark to $48.82 yesterday, while copper dropped by more than 3pc after the move from China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals. Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) plunged 15p, or 7.3pc, to 191p, BHP Billiton slid 5pc to £11.49 and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) slipped 4.2pc to 774.8p. Mid-cap Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) shed 2.8pc to 41.6p and Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) was down 6.8pc at 151.9p. \nPrecious metals miners became the darling of the FTSE 100 as other metals floundered, after gold rallied back to three-week highs. The gold spot price hit $1,108.30 per ounce. Randgold Resources jumped 21p, or 0.5pc, to £39.52. The gold miner was also boosted by Citigroup’s decision to raise its target price from £46.44 to £47.45, as the bank believes Randgold’s strong track record and positive future outlook outweigh any residual gold price concerns. Given the group’s robust balance sheet, Jon Bergtheil said that “should gold slip further, Randgold should be able to see out the tail-end of the bear market without too much difficulty”. \nMeanwhile, minnow Aureus Mining (Other OTC: ARSMF - news ) , whose chief executive David Reading hails from Randgold Resources, was boosted by the rising gold price and second-quarter results. The group’s pre-tax loss for the quarter came in at $2.2m, up from last year’s loss of $0.96m. However, Martin Potts, of finnCap, was quick to note “the figures represent the period immediately prior to the start-up of the main process plant at its New Liberty gold mine in Liberia”. The Aim-listed company climbed 1.8pc to 20.8p. Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) also advanced 0.5pc to 653p. \nElsewhere, a 17pc jump in half-year operating profit to £1.9bn helped Prudential (Amsterdam: PD8.AS - news ) climb to the top of the FTSE 100, thanks to robust performances in its Asian, US and UK businesses . Eamonn Flanagan, of Shore Capital, said, “all of the key financial metrics were ahead of the market’s expectations”. \n“The 17pc growth from Asia is allaying some of the fears amongst some commentators over the likely delivery from Asia”, Mr Flanagan added. The stock was changing hands at £15.77, up 70.5p, or 4.7pc. \nCineworld advanced 16.5p, or 3.1pc, to 548.5p, after Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) began covering the stock by issuing a “buy” rating. In a note entitled, “five star review”, the bank said it likes the company’s high visibility, self-funded growth and international expansion opportunity. \nMobile money company Monitise (Other OTC: MNQQY - news ) leapt 22.3pc to 6.7p after traders in the City speculated a “big seller” had offloaded a large amount of stock, as its trading volumes had been above average in recent days. \nIn July, Visa Europe announced it would sell down its 5.3pc shareholding in the Aim-listed company over time. While its current share price is still significantly off the 50p level it hit in August last year, analysts said mobile banking and payments remain “a hot area”, in which Monitise could become a bid target.

Mr Lipski was suspended from the company , which turns natural gas into diesel and jet fuel, on July 6, pending an investigation into “allegations of serious misconduct”. Yesterday, the group, whose biggest shareholder is Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, said Mr Lipski “was not the subject of a disciplinary hearing and there is no finding that any misconduct took place”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:11:06.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
