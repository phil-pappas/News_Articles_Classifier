Today, we are talking about a significantly bigger amount,\" Ahmed Aljannahi, Noor Bank's deputy chief executive, told reporters in Jakarta late on Tuesday. \nThe five-year $500 million offering from airline Garuda Indonesia was the first international sukuk from an unrated Indonesian corporate issuer. Noor Bank was one of several banks involved in the Garuda issuance. \nOfficials declined to specify the amount of the new sukuk but said it would be dollar based and would include other underwriters. \n\"This will bring in U.S. dollars. That will help strengthen our forex reserves and help Bank Indonesia maintain the stability of our exchange rate,\" Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said at the joint news conference. \nThe rupiah weakened to a fresh 17-year low of 14,117 to the dollar on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T11:00:16.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
