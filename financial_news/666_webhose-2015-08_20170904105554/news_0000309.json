The Company retained its interests in a global portfolio of media and entertainment assets spanning six continents. News Corp holds the Company's former businesses including newspapers, information services and integrated marketing services, digital real estate services, book publishing, digital education and sports programming and pay-TV distribution in Australia. The Company completed the Separation by distributing to its stockholders one share of News Corp Class A common stock for every four shares of the Company's Class A common stock held on June 21, 2013, and one share of News Corp Class B common stock for every four shares of the Company's Class B common stock held on June 21, 2013. The Company's stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares. Following the Separation, the Company does not beneficially own any shares of News Corp Class A common stock or News Corp Class B common stock. \nEffective June 28, 2013, the Separation qualified for discontinued operations treatment in accordance with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 205-20, \"Discontinued Operations\" (\"ASC 205-20\"), and accordingly the Company deconsolidated News Corp's balance sheet as of June 30, 2013, and included its results for the fiscal years presented as discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows. The Company has reflected the Separation as a distribution on the Consolidated Statement of Equity as of June 30, 2013. \nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows: \n� Overview of the Company's Business - This section provides a general description of the Company's businesses, as well as developments that occurred either during the fiscal year ended June 30, (\"fiscal\") 2015 or early fiscal 2016 that the Company believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or to disclose known trends. \n� Results of Operations - This section provides an analysis of the Company's results of operations for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated and a segment basis. In addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that impact the comparability of the results being analyzed. \n� Liquidity and Capital Resources - This section provides an analysis of the Company's cash flows for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, as well as a discussion of the Company's outstanding debt and commitments, both firm and contingent, that existed as of June 30, 2015. Included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund the Company's future commitments and obligations, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements. \n� Critical Accounting Policies - This section discusses accounting policies considered important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in application. In addition, Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox summarizes the Company's significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policy discussion found in this section. \nOVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS \nThe Company is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following segments: \n� Cable Network Programming, which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed primarily through cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators, telecommunication companies and online video distributors in the U.S. and internationally. \n� Television, which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the U.S. and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, in the U.S. (of these stations, 17 are affiliated with the FOX Broadcasting Company (\"FOX\"), 10 are affiliated with Master Distribution Service, Inc. (\"MyNetworkTV\") and one is an independent station). \n� Filmed Entertainment, which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide. \n� Direct Broadcast Satellite Television, which consisted of the distribution of programming services via satellite, cable and broadband directly to subscribers in Italy, Germany and Austria. The Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (\"DBS\") segment consisted entirely of the operations of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland AG (\"Sky Deutschland\") (collectively the \"DBS businesses\"). On November 12, 2014, Twenty-First Century Fox completed the sale of Sky Italia and its 57% interest in Sky Deutschland to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc, which was subsequently renamed Sky plc (\"Sky\") (See Note 3 - Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox). Sky is a pan-European digital television provider, which operates in Italy, Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom and Ireland. \n� Other, Corporate and Eliminations, which principally consists of corporate overhead and eliminations and other businesses. \nFollowing the sale of the DBS businesses, the Company continues to report in five segments for comparative purposes, and there is no future activity in the DBS segment. \nCable Network Programming and Television \nThe Company's cable networks, which target various demographics, derive a majority of their revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") based on the number of their subscribers. Affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to U.S. MVPDs to typically facilitate the carriage of a domestic cable network). The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Cable television and direct broadcast satellite are currently the predominant means of distribution of the Company's program services in the U.S. Internationally, distribution technology varies region by region. \nThe television operations derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising, and to a lesser extent, retransmission consent revenue. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues. \nU.S. law governing retransmission consent revenue provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the Company to seek and obtain payment from MVPDs who carry the Company's broadcast signals. Retransmission consent revenue consists of per subscriber-based compensatory fees paid to the Company by MVPDs that distribute the signals of the Company's owned and operated television stations. The Company also receives compensation from independently-owned television stations that are affiliated with FOX and receive retransmission consent fees from MVPDs for their signals. \nThe most significant operating expenses of the Cable Network Programming segment and the Television segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming, marketing and promotional expenses and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the cable network or broadcaster. Marketing and promotional expenses relate to improving the market visibility and awareness of the cable network or broadcaster and its programming. Additional expenses include sales commissions paid to the in-house advertising sales force, as well as salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses. \nThe profitability of U.S. national sports contracts and international sports rights agreements is based on the Company's best estimates at June 30, 2015 of attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant. Should revenues decline from estimates applied at June 30, 2015, additional amortization of rights may be recorded. Should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues, the Company may have improved results related to the contract, which may be recognized over the remaining contract term. \nFilmed Entertainment \nThe Filmed Entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of live-action and animated motion pictures and television series. In general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by the Company are exhibited in U.S. and foreign theaters, followed by home entertainment, including sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-rays, licensing through digital distribution platforms, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television exploitation. Television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently and subsequently released in seasonal DVD and Blu-ray box sets and made available via digital distribution platforms. More successful series are later syndicated in domestic markets. The length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and, therefore, may cause fluctuations in operating results. License fees received for television exhibition (including international and U.S. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. \nThe revenues and operating results of the Filmed Entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the Company's theatrical and home entertainment releases, the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and cable channels and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. Theatrical and home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace. The distribution windows for the release of motion pictures theatrically and in various home entertainment products and services (including subscription rentals, rental kiosks and digital distribution platforms), have been compressing and may continue to change in the future. A further reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment. \nThe Company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce certain of its theatrical productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take various forms. The parties to these arrangements include studio and non-studio entities both domestic and international. In several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. The Filmed Entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the third-party investors' contractual interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. Consistent with the requirements of FASB ASC 926, \"Entertainment-Films\" (\"ASC 926\"), the estimate of the third-party investor's interest in profits or losses on the film is based on total estimated ultimate revenues. \nOperating costs incurred by the Filmed Entertainment segment include: exploitation costs, primarily theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; amortization of capitalized production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent residuals. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses. \nDirect Broadcast Satellite Television \nThe DBS segment derives revenues principally from subscriber fees. The Company believes that the quality and variety of programming, audio and interactive programming including personal video recorders, quality of picture including high definition channels, access to services, customer service and price are the key elements for gaining and maintaining market share. \nThe DBS segment's most significant operating expenses are those related to the acquisition of entertainment, movie and sports programming and subscribers and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities. Operating expenses related to sports programming are generally recognized over the course of the related sport season, which may cause fluctuations in the operating results of this segment. \nOther, Corporate and Eliminations \nThe Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment consists primarily of corporate overhead and eliminations and other businesses. \nOther Business Developments \nCable Network Programming \nIn February 2015, the Company acquired trueX media inc. (\"true[X]\"), a video advertising company specializing in consumer engagement and on-demand marketing campaigns, for an estimated total purchase price of approximately $175 million in cash including deferred payments which are subject to the achievement of service and performance conditions. \nIn February 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the broadcast business of MAA Television Network Limited (\"MAA TV\"), an entity in India that broadcasts and operates Telugu language entertainment channels, for approximately $375 million in cash. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close before December 31, 2015. \nTelevision \nIn October 2014, the Company acquired two San Francisco-Bay area television stations, KTVU-TV FOX 2 and KICU-TV 36, with a fair value of approximately $220 million from Cox Media Group in exchange for the Company's FOX affiliated stations WHBQ-TV FOX 13 and WFXT-TV FOX 25, located in the Memphis and Boston markets, respectively. \nFilmed Entertainment \nThe Company and funds managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") formed Endemol Shine Group in December 2014 to which the Company contributed its interests in Shine Group and cash, comprising an aggregate carrying value of approximately $830 million. The joint venture, a global multi-platform content provider, is comprised of Shine Group, Endemol and CORE Media Group. The Company and Apollo have an equal ownership interest in the joint venture. As a result of the transaction, Shine Group ceased to be a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The Company recorded a gain of $58 million on this transaction which was included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2015. The Company's investment in the Endemol Shine Group is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. \nDirect Broadcast Satellite Television \nOn November 12, 2014, the Company sold its 100% and 57% ownership stakes in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, respectively, to Sky for approximately $8.8 billion in value comprised of approximately $8.2 billion in cash received, net of $650 million of cash paid to acquire Sky's 21% interest in NGC Network International LLC and NGC Network Latin America LLC (collectively \"NGC International\"), increasing the Company's ownership stake in NGC International to 73%. In connection with this transaction, the Company participated in Sky's equity offering in July 2014 by purchasing additional shares in Sky for approximately $900 million and maintained the Company's 39% ownership interest. As a result of the transaction, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland ceased to be consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $5.0 billion on this transaction, which was included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2015. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nResults of Operations-Fiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014 \nThe following tables set forth the Company's operating results for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, including presentation of Revenues by component excluding the DBS segment and related intersegment eliminations. \nFor the years ended June 30, 2015 2014 % Change (in millions, except %) Revenues: Affiliate fees $ 10,353 $ 8,984 15 % Subscription 1,964 5,467 (64 ) % Advertising 7,609 8,218 (7 ) % Content 8,677 8,596 1 % Other 384 602 (36 ) % Total revenues 28,987 31,867 (9 ) % Operating expenses (18,561 ) (21,108 ) (12 ) % Selling, general and administrative (3,784 ) (4,129 ) (8 ) % Depreciation and amortization (736 ) (1,142 ) (36 ) % Equity earnings of affiliates 904 622 45 % Interest expense, net (1,198 ) (1,121 ) 7 % Interest income 39 26 50 % Other, net 4,196 174 ** Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 9,847 5,189 90 % Income tax expense (1,243 ) (1,272 ) (2 ) % Income from continuing operations 8,604 3,917 ** (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax (67 ) 729 ** Net income 8,537 4,646 84 % Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (231 ) (132 ) 75 % Net income attributable to Twenty-First Century Fox stockholders $ 8,306 $ 4,514 84 % \nFor the years ended June 30, 2015 2014 % Change (in millions, except %) Revenues (excluding Direct Broadcast Satellite Television): Affiliate fees $ 10,396 $ 9,108 14 % Advertising 7,503 7,870 (5 ) % Content 8,700 8,665 - Other 353 419 (16 ) % \nAdjusted Total Revenues 26,952 26,062 3 % Direct Broadcast Satellite Television, net of eliminations 2,035 5,805 (65 ) % Total revenues $ 28,987 $ 31,867 (9 ) % ** not meaningful \nOverview - The Company's revenues decreased 9% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The changes in revenues were primarily due to the effect of the sale of the DBS businesses in November 2014. Excluding the activity of the DBS businesses, the Company's revenues increased 3% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher affiliate fee revenues partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenues. The increase in affiliate fee revenues was primarily attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels and the effect of the acquisition of the majority interest in the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network (the \"YES Network\") in February 2014. The decrease in advertising revenues for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the comparative effect of the broadcast of Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 and lower general entertainment primetime ratings at FOX. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $625 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. \nOperating expenses decreased 12% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the sale of the DBS businesses in November 2014 partially offset by increases at the Cable Network Programming segment. During fiscal 2015, operating expenses at the Cable Network Programming segment increased by approximately $1 billion primarily due to higher programming costs including STAR Sports' broadcast of the International Cricket Council (\"ICC\") Cricket World Cup matches, Fox Sports 1's (\"FS1\") inaugural broadcast of Major League Baseball (\"MLB\") regular season and playoff games and the continued investment in new shows at FX Networks suite of channels (\"FX\"). \nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 8% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the sale of the DBS businesses in November 2014 partially offset by increases at the Cable Network Programming segment of approximately $255 million. The increase at the Cable Network Programming segment for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to transaction losses on foreign currency exchange movements at FOX International Channels (\"FIC\"), the continued investment in STAR's sports and general entertainment channels and the effect of the acquisitions of the majority interest in the YES Network in February 2014 and true[X] in February 2015. \nDepreciation and amortization, including the amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets, decreased 36% for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization as a result of the sale of the DBS businesses. These decreases were partially offset by the amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the majority interest in the YES Network in February 2014. \nEquity earnings of affiliates - Equity earnings of affiliates increased $282 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was due to higher results at Sky which included the Company's proportionate share of approximately $790 million of gains related to the sale of Sky's investments in Sky Betting & Gaming, ITV plc and NGC International. Partially offsetting these increases were the results at Endemol Shine Group, an affiliate from December 2014 (See Note 3 - Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox), lower results at Hulu LLC and the effect of the acquisition of the majority interest in the YES Network in February 2014. \nFor the years ended June 30, 2015 2014 % Change (in millions, except %) Sky $ 1,139 $ 619 84% Other equity affiliates (235 ) 3 ** Equity earnings of affiliates $ 904 $ 622 45% \n** not meaningful \nInterest expense, net - Interest expense increased $77 million for fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the higher average debt outstanding as a result of the debt consolidated in connection with the acquisition of the majority interest in the YES Network in February 2014, and subsequently modified in November 2014, and the issuance in September 2014 of $600 million of 3.70% Senior Notes due 2024 and $600 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2044. \nOther, net - For the years ended June 30, 2015 2014 (in millions) Gain on disposition of DBS businesses $ 4,984 $ - Gain on disposition of Shine Group 58 - . . .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:15:52.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
