That would cut heavily into current shareholder value.\nGreece is in negotiations with the EU and International Monetary Fund for as much as 86 billion euros ($94 billion) in fresh loans to stave off financial ruin and economic collapse.\nQuestions about how easily that agreement will come have also been weighing on the bourse, which was closed for five weeks before Monday as part of capital controls to stop a flight of euros.
