handed a start with Sergio Aguero left on the bench following his Copa America exploits - before wrapping his foot around an superb curling shot that flashed into the top-right corner.\nSterling then fluffed his lines as he spurned a glorious chance of a debut goal just before the interval when played clean through by Toure, only to give Myhill a chance to block his shot.\nMyhill foiled Sterling again from a tight angle soon after half-time.\nWhatever Pulis said at half-time roused West Brom, though, and there was immediately more purpose to their game upon resumption.\nOne of Sterling's colleagues at Anfield last season, Rickie Lambert, almost marked his competitive Baggies bow in style with a brilliant free-kick which whistled agonisingly over.\nYet any home hopes of a revival were stopped in their tracks when Kompany met Silva's corner at the near post to beat Myhill with a looping effort which appeared to come off his shoulder.\nThe last thing the Baggies wanted to see was the introduction of Aguero, who replaced Bony for the final third of the game, but the Argentine didn't need to get out of first gear with the points already in the bag.\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >>> @TOISportsNews http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Yaya Toure,Vincent Kompany,Premier League,Manuel Pellegrini,Manchester City ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-08-11T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:34:04.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
