It features bonus tracks from pianist and composer Elodie Sablier and guitarist Tommy Emmanuel .\"\nAdvertisement Don't worry, there is still time to pick up tickets to his opening concert at the Sydney Opera House this weekend, or, Melbourne jazz venue, Bennetts Lane, next week.\nAll that composing, and touring, must be exhausting for the boss of a corporate business which has recently had trouble with employees getting confused about their work brief – you know, engaging in wealth destruction, not wealth creation.\nAnd this is on top of his duties moonlighting as a food writer for the The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age 's Good Food Guides .\nAt Hagger's senate committee appearances earlier this year over NAB's wealth scandals, Senator John \"Wacka\" Williams even suggested another career for the incredibly on-message banker. \"You ought to go into politics one day,\" said Wacka, who then asked Hagger to \"convince this committee\" that NAB had cleaned up its financial planning act.\nMr Hagger: \"We have been there for our customers, but we are not perfect ... are getting stronger by the day and we are implementing new measures by the day.\"\nCBA whistleblower Jeff Morris offered an alternative version of NAB's plight.\n\"In my opinion, NAB financial planning scandal is a carbon copy of the CBA financial planning scandal. The only difference is that NAB succeeded in sitting on the volcano for longer. The flawed business model which puts product sales above the client's best interests is all but identical ... I believe the full extent of the problems at NAB has not yet come to light.\"\nLet's hope the workload doesn't distract Hagger from his hobby.\nFlight Map Flight Centre shares might have bounced back strongly from the market turbulence early this week, but it doesn't mean the boss, Graeme 'Skroo' Turner , wasn't sweating the small stuff – like the ongoing issue of where exactly its diminutive Irish operations fit into the financial picture.\nAt Thursday's full-year results briefing he said Flight Centre now calls its British division \"UK and Ireland\".\nBut he couldn't let it rest without revealing the angst it has caused him.\n\"Apparently Ireland is not part of the UK. Some people in Northern Ireland think it is, but anyway.\"\nSkroo later insisted that he has no axe to grind over the issue, it is just genuine confusion.\n\"Great Britain doesn't include Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom includes Northern Ireland. When they play rugby, they play as one team. It is quite an unusual structure. Two countries that do some things together and not other things.\"\nMeanwhile, Flight Centre's departing chief number cruncher, Andrew \"Flanno\" Flannery , showed he has not dropped a beat despite the looming exit sign.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Mike Younger asked Flanno whether there would be major growth in the corporate division.\nFlanno: \"Once we get the Goldman account, we'll be fine.\"\nMike: \"I'd like you to get the Goldman account.\"\nLast Laugh Nine boss David Gyngell was on his best behaviour at the broadcaster's results announcement on Thursday, doing his best not to have a gentle dig at a certain rival channel which recently engaged it in the courts over its incredibly original cooking show, Hotplate .\nCBA analyst Alice Bennett queried Gyngell on Nine's \"TV anywhere anytime\" plans given Seven's recent announcements.\n\"I didn't say that, so we're not going to be sued by them for any sort of plagiarism, that's just the common wording of the vernacular,\" retorted a very playful Gyngell.\nSeven suffered the humiliation this month of having to drop Restaurant Revolution – its prime time rival to Nine's Hotplate – due to poor ratings and plug in risible programming like Cats Make You Laugh Out Loud , Dogs Make You Laugh Out Loud , and Pets Make You Laugh Out Loud .\nNeedless to say, the trilogy has easily out-rated Hotplate .\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["http://www.ariacharts.com.au/chart/classical-crossover-albums", "http://www.ariacharts.com.au/chart/australian-artist-albums"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:47:19.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
