Officials made clear earlier this week that there were \"still a number of points to clear up\". \nAccording to the Sunday edition of the German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a 27-page draft memorandum of reform commitments must be signed off by the Greek government this weekend to allow the new bailout to go through before the August 20 repayment falls due.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:11:27.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
