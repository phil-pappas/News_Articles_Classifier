NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Stores across the country are offering back-to-school sales on everything students will need for campus life -- from books and electronics, to cleaning supplies and toiletries. Some stores even offer extra discounts to students with a valid school I.D. For online student shoppers, Amazon offers a free trial of Amazon Prime for six months . Under the free trial, students receive free two-day shipping, exclusive deals and promotions, and unlimited photo storage. When the free trial ends, students will have to pay a fee of $49 per year, which is 50% off the cost of Prime membership. The student fee includes extra perks such as unlimited instant streaming of movies, TV shows and music.The free trial is a great deal for students who just want to take advantage of all the exclusive back-to-school deals that Prime members receive by email and also the free two-day shipping for last-minute items. But is it worth paying the $49 Amazon Student Prime membership fee afterward? Students who use Amazon to purchase at least five items with two-day shipping or nine items with standard shipping pay just as much in shipping fees as they would for the Amazon Student membership. With the membership, students save money with any additional purchases made that year. Once the paid membership begins, students no longer need to pay extra for movies on Netflix or songs on iTunes or Spotify.College students actively enrolled in at least one course at a college in the U.S. or Puerto Rico can sign up for the six-month free trial of Amazon Prime. Students must also have a \".edu\" email address and be able to provide proof of enrollment upon request by Amazon. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T18:48:11.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
