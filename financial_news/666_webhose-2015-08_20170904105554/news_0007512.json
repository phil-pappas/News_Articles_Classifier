The former Deltona Branch, located at 940 Deltona Boulevard, Deltona, Florida 32725, was relocated to this new, more convenient location and opened for business on June 29, 2015. The Enterprise Road Branch is at 2690 Enterprise Road, Orange City, FL 32763; which is along a main errand route for the area and is accessible to members who live and work in Deltona, Debary, and Orange City. SCCU hosted a weeklong celebration for the Enterprise Road grand opening, including a ribbon cutting and several giveaways and special events. Current and prospective members were invited to attend and SCCU is offering special limited-time incentives that are available through October.\nThe same friendly staff from the former Deltona Branch is now serving members at the new Enterprise Road Branch. The branch is a full-service location, offering members auto and home lending, checking accounts, retirement services, safe deposit boxes, commercial and business lending, ATM, and drive through service. Since the branch opened, SCCU has already welcomed 70 new memberships and helped many members get a new car by financing over $1,132,714 in auto loans.\n“We are always watching out for our members’ financial interests and trying to save them both time and money,” said Kimberly Tyree, SCCU’s Director of Retail Services for Volusia and Flagler counties. “We even go so far as to analyze traffic patterns to ensure our branches continue to be in well-traveled areas, where our members are already taking care of their household errands. This branch relocation is a result of that research and our insistence on being as convenient as possible for our members.”\nSCCU’s extensive branch network spans Florida’s East Coast from Flagler to Miami-Dade County. Anyone who lives or works in these areas is welcome to join – either at a branch, online at SCCU.com, or over the phone with Express Sales. Members can apply for auto loans, home loans, and checking accounts from anywhere and, in many cases, even sign their account documents online with Express Sign. In addition, SCCU’s Online and Mobile banking and ATM network give members 24-7 access to their accounts.\nSpace Coast Credit Union was chartered in 1951 and is headquartered in Melbourne, Florida. The credit union serves more than 300,000 members with assets of over $3.4 billion through a network of 58 branches and over 100 ATMs located throughout Florida and through its website sccu.com . Space Coast Credit Union is open for membership to anyone who lives or works in the fourteen Florida counties it serves.
