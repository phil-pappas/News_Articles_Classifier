Reinsuring against longevity helps insurers manage the risk that retirees live longer than expected.\nPrudential reinsured 1.35 billion pounds ($2.11 billion) of Legal & General's bulk annuity portfolio last year.\nL&G said this month that it was using structures such as longevity deals to reduce the capital costs of its annuity business.\n($1 = 0.6390 pounds) (Reporting by Carolyn Cohn ; editing by Jason Neely )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T14:43:26.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
