Photo: FDC\nThe People's Bank of China's move to lift its US dollar/yuan fixing rate by 1.9 per cent on Tuesday stunned the markets and sparked a 1 US cent fall in the Australian dollar .\nIt's also sparked confusion among those of us who are used to floating currencies, such as the Australian dollar.\nLike the majority of China's markets, its government largely controls its currency movements, and unlike floating exchange rate currencies which are determined by market forces (supply and demand), its currency moves as a crawling peg to the US dollar.\nHow does China's currency work? Advertisement In 1994 China's currency, the renminbi, was pegged to a fixed rate of 8.28 yuan to the US dollar. That remained until July 2005, when it was loosened to allow it to fluctuate 2.1 per cent from a set midpoint determined daily.\nThe system is also referred to as a crawling peg and had been very stable in recent months, barely moving from its peg of US16.1Â¢ to the yuan between April and now.\nOver the course of the past decade, that peg has been adjusted by the government as it deemed necessary, including placing a halt on its appreciation during the global financial crisis as demand for Chinese goods slowed.\nSince 2005 the renminbi moved to what is known as a managed float system against major currencies. Also more excitingly known as a dirty float , it is controlled through central bank's buying and selling currencies in a bid to cap its appreciation.\nWhy does China use this system to regulate its currency? Market analysts widely suggest that the yuan is held at a substantially undervalued level to make its exports more globally competitive.\nThis is where the reference, or fixing rate comes in. The yuan is pegged to the US dollar at a daily reference rate within a fixed band to control the value of the yuan. The government caps appreciation by selling yuan and buying greenback.\nOn a real exchange-rate basis, however, more recently yuan has been considered overvalued by around 13 per cent as it followed the US dollar up against other major currencies (the Aussie included).\nThe move on Tuesday created a drop of 1.4 per cent to 6.3 yuan to the US dollar in Shanghai, while it fell 1.6 per cent in its offshore Hong Kong trade, according to Bloomberg.\nWait, what? What are onshore and offshore rates? As the names suggests, onshore (CNY) yuan is traded on the mainland, while offshore (CNH) is traded through the Bank of China in Hong Kong and available to be bought and sold by international investors.\nThe CNH floats freely, unlike its onshore counterpart, and was introduced as part of China's efforts to internationalise the yuan.\nLoosening the grip on the yuan's reference rate effectively brings the CNY and CNH closer together, narrowing the gap between the market's value of the yuan and the government's artificial rate.\n\"It looks like this is the end of the fixing as we know it,\" Khoon Goh, a Singapore-based strategist at ANZ Banking Group told Bloomberg.\n\"The one-off devaluation of the fix and allowing more market-based determination takes us into a new currency regime,\" he said.\nDoes this mean China is entering the currency wars? Analysts reckon no. While Westpac's Sean Callow says the currency's been \"taken off the leash\" with the government now fixing the rate at or near the previous day's closing price and market Quote: s, meaning traders could push it on an upwards or downwards trend, HSBC's experts says it's a logical, measured step towards creating a more market based mechanism.\nThe central bank said itself that the move was \"necessary to further improve the yuan's midpoint pricing to meet the needs of the market\", citing its trade in goods posting \"relatively large surpluses\".\nIt also comes as no surprise this move was made a few days after some dismal trade figures came in, including an 8.3 per cent slump in exports in July, way worse than economists' estimated 1 per cent fall.\nWhat is a yuan? I thought China's currency was the renminbi. Renminbi is the official name of the currency. It was introduced by the Communist party when the People's Bank of China was established in 1948, and translates from Mandarin to \"the people's currency\".\nYuan refers to the individual unit. You can have one yuan, but you can't have one renminbi. Think of it the way you would think of using \"sterling\" and \"pounds\" to describe Britain's money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:47:27.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
