Even with a modest recovery to $56.40 a tonne, they are still down more than 22 percent this year. \nOverall underlying earnings for the first half were in line with most analysts' forecasts. \n(Reporting by James Regan; Editing by Ed Davies and Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:52:07.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
