Many banks have tried to retain and attract staff while circumventing the backlash against bankers' bonuses since the financial crisis by paying higher salaries. \nIt is a similar picture at the lower end of the earnings spectrum. Overall compensation for an associate-level worker on a commodities desk in London was almost 95,000 pounds, down 30 percent from 138,000 pounds last year, Emolument said. \nAnd expectations that the worst is over for banks' financial market trading look premature, with the latest earnings and volumes suggesting the pressure remains intense. Fixed income, currency and commodity (FICC) trading desks are unlikely to be expanded any time soon. \nEmolument is a real-time bonus and salary-benchmarking site to which individuals in finance and other professional services contribute anonymously. The 2015 figures were derived from up to 958 contributions since Jan. 15.
