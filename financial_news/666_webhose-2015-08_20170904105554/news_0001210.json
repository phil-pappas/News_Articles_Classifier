We need urgent attention on areas like education and health services, not only in the north eastern part of the country, but all round the country.” \nHe said Nigeria would fall back on institutions like the AfDB for support in generating employment. \n“We have vast potentials in the agricultural sector that can be explored to create more jobs. We also have small businesses that need funds for expansion,” Buhari said. \nIn his reaction, the outgoing AfDB executive said some development institutions like the World Bank, German Development Bank and the European Development Bank had already indicated their readiness to provide long term loan facilities to small businesses in Nigeria. \nKaberuka assured the President that the AfDB would always support economic projects in Nigeria. \nThe AfDB currently has a strong capital base of US$4.8 billion. \nMeanwhile, Dr Akinwunmi Adesina of Nigeria will replace the outgoing AfDB President next month. \n-  //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7368   11   Featured , Finance , Finance & Banking  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T09:37:11.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
