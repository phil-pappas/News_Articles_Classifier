He suffered a major mutiny by Syriza members in two previous votes on the bailout. \nThe embattled prime minister has warned that he may be forced to call early elections if the dissent continues. \nAn analyst at Capital Economics urged caution. \n\"While Greece appears finally to be on the verge of receiving a third bailout, the extremely optimistic economic and fiscal projections underlying the plan suggest that it might not last for very long,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T06:38:03.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
