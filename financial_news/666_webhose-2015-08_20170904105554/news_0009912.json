Government and the private sector can only employ about 100 each, the capacity of the industry is still small,\" Mbonye said. \nHe noted that going forward; universities should go beyond building capacities for employment to skills of self employment and innovation. \nThat way the Principal, said, there is a chance that Rwanda can develop a robust local industry. \nMbonye advised that learners need to be introduced to the industry and the private sector to increase their involvement and relevance to market needs. \nProfessor Elias Bizuru, the director of research at the College said plans were underway to build a collaborative framework with the government, private sector and civil society to work towards more development- oriented innovations. \nHe said their target is to commercialise at least two innovations from the university in a year's time and sponsor researchers to focus on innovation. \nThe university will also forge partnerships with the private sector in curriculum development to ensure that graduates are relevant to market needs and national development goals, he said. \nSince its inception about two years ago, the College of Science and Technology has been making necessary alignments to contribute to national development through research and innovation. \nThe university is expected to engage in research to inform innovations in line with the country's goals of a technology and knowledge-based economy. \nThere are also plans to engage the institution in research for short term, medium term and long term solutions in line with national development strategies, according to University officials.
