Assessing the conference, I think our government's organizational capacity have managed to facilitate the conference very well, and have done very admirable job considering the logistics work alone to organize such kind of immense event, where you have more than 6000 thousand guests, is not easy at all. Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and other governmental organizations have done commendable job in this respect. The organization was top notch. Excellent works has been done on the formality side. This can't be denied. \nIn addition to this, the event has brought some advantages to the country. I think more than anything what our country gained is in strengthening and promoting its tourist industry. The event helps our tourist industry and will help various sectors of the economy like hotels and other service industries. And then, there are the guests themselves. During their brief stay, they will see the good things and development that are visible in Addis. They can see the development of the country which is growing by 10% annually; they can also see that it is peaceful and stable country with decent and hardworking people. So, the conference has been a very good PR. I think for us it can be a promotional and good image building opportunity. This has been a great advertisement for Ethiopia. The fact that the overall picture of our country has changed from poverty and famine to this point in itself is a big deal. \nHerald: - What are the achievements of the conference? \nProf Dr. Fisseha-Tsion:- Most of the conferences that were held were more or less declarations. In such conferences, donors declare, pledge and promise many things. However, they have low track record in implementing them. When such kinds of conferences are held, both developed and developing countries have their own interest to promote and protect. So, its hard to reach consensus. Coming to the 3rd FfD conference, very soon, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) will end in 2015, while Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) starts in 2015. The sustainable development agenda will need 3.7 trillion USD annually, while the structural development programme needs 3 trillion USD. And we have heard on plenary session held during the conference in the presence of Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the leaders of World Bank, International Monterrey Fund (IMF), the OECD etc that the private sector is expected and hoped to fill this deficit. But how and from whom will the money come from? The role of the private sector can't be denied here, but how much can the private sector contribute for Africa and Ethiopia for that matter is not clear. Its not the primary objective of the private sector to implement the SDG. As the saying 'where is the beef?' goes, for one I do not believe anything that I don't see happening, as there have been many promises and pledges before that have not come into fruition. For example, there has been a pledge to pump 0.7 per cent National Income into development aid to Official Development Assistance (ODA) four decades ago, and so far only 6 countries have managed to meet the 0.7 per cent pledge. \nWhat also should be considered here is the fact that, generally, aid is decreasing at global level. Europe currently has its own domestic political and financial crisis. So I don't see them throwing money while they are in crisis themselves. And I don't think Africa and least developed countries should look at aid in terms of long-term strategy, because there is no binding right to development through aid. The pledging countries can give you the aid or not. The various declarations made by the General Assembly in New York on many issues are not binding. They have moral value and influence, but they are not binding. That's why they are generally called soft laws. They are kind of wish-lists. Even under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), seven of the goals depended on national effort. It's only the eighth goal that is dependent on global partnership. The SDGs are more or less the same, but they are intended to strengthen global partnership in a new way. But in view of the crisis in Europe, how much of it they will implement is debatable. So, my view is we should mobilize domestic resource as much as possible. \nHerald: - Since you have touched upon it; Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) and Tax has been the star and main thematic area during the conference, or so as to speak it as an alternative source of resource mobilization to replace aid. Did the conference achieve what it set out to achieve in that respect? \nProf Dr. Fisseha-Tsion: - As I have said earlier, aid is decreasing globally; and as an alternative, developed countries are looking to make effective use of mineral and other natural resources, including the manpower of developing and African countries, to build their capacity to mobilize their own resource through technical assistance. Secondly, in today's evermore globalized environment, multinational Companies (MNCs) together with their many subsidiaries and branches have become major players. Even though, they recently started to come in our country, they have long standing presence in some African countries. When they do business and transaction of goods and services, it is alleged that they also engage in tax avoidance, and in some cases in illicit financial outflow. According to some studies, the illicit financial flow out of Africa reaches up to 400 billion. Now compare that to the global aid which is 130 billion. This is not even for Africa alone, but globally. So, illicit financial flow out of Africa, including through corruption, is three fold compared to the global aid. Public investment on health, education infrastructure in Africa needs money in trillions. The question therefore is, from where is this money suppose to come? The first is from tax. The other can be from other public financing such as loans. Not only we should collect more, but we have to also spend better and wiser. Aid is not the best way to finance sustainable development. So, I think we should be able to mobilize our own resources. Otherwise it lead to be permanent state of dependency. As long as we depend on foreign sources for financial support, technology and other things, then it will be hard to bring sustainable and continuous development. \nOne of the main issues discussed related to the tax initiative is transfer pricing, base erosion, indirect profit repatriation from developing countries. Such transfer pricing techniques tend to undermine the tax revenue that is due to them. My fear is that OECD driven policy and framework most of the time tends to focus more the interest of the developed countries more than the developing. I think developing countries should enhance their capacity to protect their own interest in this arrangement. Of course the OECD countries have pledged to build the capacity of least developed countries' tax collection and tax auditing capabilities among other things. Even now, on bilateral level, DfiD is doing this with Ethiopia and other countries as well. So, all in all, there have been and will be efforts to enhance the tax collection and management capacity of LDCs. I hope that their promise will bring about tangible and concrete benefits to developing countries like Ethiopia. \nHerald: - But it was said that the outcome of the conference, i.e. the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, was successful in getting the desired agreement? \nProf Dr. Fisseha-Tsion: - My view is the conference didn't deliver as expected and desired. As I have said earlier in order to realize the Sustainable Development Goals, 3.7 trillion USD is needed annually, while another 3 trillion USD is needed for various structural development programmes. There is no concrete agreement from where that money will come from. This is why I asked 'where is the beef?' we can of course keep on hoping. But the success of the conference should be assessed based on concrete and verifiable results and benefits to countries like Ethiopia. Here again, my question is 'Where is the beef?' After all, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda should be ratified in September at United Nations General Assembly, and time will tell whether what has been promised is Addis will bring concrete benefits. What I can say is that it is not a total failure.
