Zambia produces a lot of maize and there is no way the prices of mealie meal should remain high. \nDefinitely, the setting-up of the new milling plants, for maize and other crops, will support food security in Zambia. \nThese easily accessible milling units will provide the rural and urban farmers with a reliable and consistent market for their maize, as well as produce competitively-priced mealie meal for consumers. \nThey will offer an advantage in the maize meal market, especially in the rural areas where the people are sometimes forced to \"import back\" mealie meal to the countryside from towns. \nThe milling plants will utilise local maize and produce mealie meal right in their areas of location, leading to a drastic reduction in the cost of transport and other logistics. \nThis will also enhance efficiency in the processing of the crops and supply of the resultant products. \nIt is hoped that the consequential benefits will be passed on to the final consumers via highly competitive prices of the products. \nIt is strongly believed that the high mealie meal prices are usually due to transportation costs, so the setting-up of the milling plants in parts of Zambia where maize is produced should be able to resolve that. \nFurther, the milling plants will provide the local communities with opportunities for employment while some of them will have access to skills training. \nApart from benefiting the people through reliable supply and competitive prices of the staple food, the project will also promote economic activities in these rural areas. \nGenerally, therefore, the project is expected to alleviate the sufferings of both urban and rural dwellers. \nThis is because one milling plant will need at least 12 people to put up the structure and to run it at that level. \nThis will result in not less than 30,000 jobs being created, thereby significantly pushing down the unemployment levels in the rural areas. There will be reduction of people among the households involved. \nNo doubt, the project is a step in the right direction which will provide an opportunity for the demonstration of the much-talked-about Public Private Partnership (PPP) concept. \nFor President Lungu and the PF, this is a campaign promise effectively fulfilled! It is a word well-kept! Zambia \nAgriculture and Livestock Minister Given Lubinda has said extreme climate change is affecting nutrition and food … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Times of Zambia.
