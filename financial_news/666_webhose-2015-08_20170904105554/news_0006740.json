Authorities have issued contamination advisories due to the incineration of toxic and poisonous chemicals at the port. Toyota said it still is assessing damage to its plant, according to Bloomberg . Cramer Sees 'Well-Run' Mobileye, Kroger Going Higher \nThe roots of Toyota's operations in Tianjin date back to the 1930s. \nIn the past five days, Toyota shares have fallen 2.3% in trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in comparison to the Nikkei 225 Index, which has fallen less than 1%. \nThe most recent reports suggested that as many as 8,000 new cars waiting for shipment were destroyed by fire. The brands affected included Hyundais, Kias, Volkswagens, Renaults and Toyotas. Hyundai vehicles accounted for about half the loss. Pictures first suggested that the blast may have originated among the cars, but later reports said they were burned as a result of the accident; the cause of which hasn't been determined. \nVW lost more than 1,000 Touaregs, plus Golfs, Beetles, Up!s, Tiguans and other models . About 1,500 vehicles belonging to Renault were lost, representing about $33 million of value. \nAccording to reports from CNN , Chinese officials have confirmed that calcium carbide, potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate were present in the vicinity of the blast, whose origins have not yet been identified definitively. Sodium cyanide, a substance that can turn into a highly poisonous gas, was also discovered. The disaster comes as China is preparing to celebrate the 70 th anniversary of the end of World War II . \nThe slowdown in China's economy and automotive sales means that potential losses due to destruction and dislocation in the port may be recoverable since dealer inventories are relatively large. Last year, Toyota's joint venture assembled about 440,000 Crown, Reiz, Corolla and Vios models, nearly half of the automaker's output in the country. The plant also produces parts that feed another assembly plant in Xiqing. \nVolkswagen took pains to reassure consumers that no vehicles affected by the explosion would ever be sold to consumers. \"At this time, we have already begun evaluating the state of our vehicles in all storage facilities at the Port of Tianjin,\" the automaker said in a statement. \"Under no circumstances will any cars damaged in this terrible accident make it to market.\" \nTianjin, the world's 10th-busiest port, is massive and the country's largest storage and shipment facility for vehicles arriving and leaving. The city of roughly 15 million people is located about 75 miles from Beijing and can be reached by high-speed rail and highway. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:03:51.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
