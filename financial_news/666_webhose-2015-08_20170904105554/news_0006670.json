It consolidates stakes in key affiliates including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd under the control of the founding Lee family's heirs. \nSamsung C&T did not disclose details on the shares it bought back, but U.S. hedge fund Elliott Associates - one of the most vocal opponents of the merger - said on Wednesday it had sold back some of its 7.12 percent stake. \nA person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Elliott sold a 4.95 percent stake to C&T, the entire share it could sell back. The fund, however, has said it would continue to do all it could to protect its interests. \n(Reporting by Se Young Lee; additional reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Miral Fahmy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:40:33.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
