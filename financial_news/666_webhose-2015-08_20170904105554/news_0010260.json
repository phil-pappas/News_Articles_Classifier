Simon O'Dwyer by Jacquie Hayes Greater numbers of Australians are choosing to be as big in death as they have been in life and are locking into elaborate burial sites early before they run out.\nCompetition is being made more intense by the influx of cashed-up Asian communities who are not only prepared to pay handsomely for traditional send-offs of local loved ones, they're bringing in the departed from offshore for interment here.\nWhile this isn't about buying real estate – you're purchasing burial rights – it's still all about location, location, location. That's why cemeteries and memorial parks are advising us to buy what we want in today's dollars now or risk getting priced out of the market when our time comes.\nAustralia may not yet be at the level of countries like the US where grave sites go for millions of dollars. But depleting burial space in existing cemeteries may require those of us wanting to be buried rather than cremated book in early or miss out when we check out.\nThis could be a devastating outcome for surviving family who are left with a sense of failure at not being able to fulfil a loved one's last wish, says Jane Grover, chief executive officer of Victoria's Southern Metropolitan Cemeteries Trust (SMCT).\n\"We've noticed that people who pre-plan have a funeral that involves less anger,\" Grover says. \"It not only makes that day incredibly smooth but it also keeps the family united because they're respecting mum or dad's wishes and there's nothing to argue over.\"\nA sense of peace is certainly present as one drives through the main gate of the 110-hectare Springvale Botanical Cemetery, the jewel in the crown of eight such properties managed by SMCT, this one south east of Melbourne's CBD. But a sign some way down the road reminds you that this is business, advising one to \"secure exclusive grave opportunities\".\nFeng shui cemetery There are many options here – a result, says Grover, of a deliberate effort to meet, via a designated community insights team, the needs of the surrounding communities and their specific needs. There are 230 multicultural groups around the Springvale site, so the offerings are diverse. Earlier this year the cemetery opened what it says is the only dedicated feng shui Buddhist cemetery in Australia, Song He Yuan.\nIt's already attracted strong interest from interstate and offshore families about future interments, says Springvale's consumer insights manager, William Babington.\n\"Among the Chinese and Indo-Chinese communities particularly, it's all about paying respect to your parents who raised you, cared for you,\" Babington says. \"These cultures are all about caring for their elders. They won't use palliative care, for example. It's quite amazing to see the lengths people go to. They spare no expense [on their funerals].\"\nIdeal feng shui plots range in price from $16,000 to almost $300,000 for a family grave in which three generations can be interred, he says.\nSpace at a premium The Italian community, meanwhile, is willing to pay similar amounts to be buried in a crypt or mausoleum at Melbourne General Cemetery where spaces – and prices – are at a premium.The only way is up for those prices given death rate projections. About 36,000 people die each year in Victoria, a number that will double in the next 20 years, says Grover, driven mainly by the deaths of the baby boomers.\n\"Globally, it will be the biggest death rate post the WWII babies,\" she says.\nGiven that outlook, Grover has made it her personal mission since joining SMCT four years ago – initially as chief operating officer and the past six months as CEO – to build a more sustainable business. She came to the SMCT after a career in hospitality and casinos and has overlaid her private-sector principles on a sector which she says hasn't seen innovation for some time.\n\"We're re-imagining death,\" she says, and it seems death becomes her, considering the success she's brought.\nSMCT's cemetery operating revenue in 2010 was $35.5 million. At the end of the last financial year, that figure was up to $59.5 million – a 15.7 per cent increase on the previous year's $51.4 million.\n\"We've innovated, we're trying to sell to the heart, but the importance of working with the community has actually grown our revenue,\" she says. \"If you have products and services that the customer wants, they'll come.\"\nThe job was made easier with the construction at Springvale of a new function and administration building, the Clarence Reardon Centre, named after the cemetery's first interment 102 years ago, a seven-month-old baby.\nThe decision to take the retail and catering divisions in-house – including construction of a full kitchen and appointment of executive chef Allan Koh (ex Koko Japanese Restaurant at Crown Casino) – means the group can cater for weddings, parties, anything. In the past seven months, the centre has brought in an additional $3.6 million in functions alone.\n\"We'd like to be in the Good Food Guide 12 months from now,\" Grover says. \"We have aspirations.\"\nBroad-ranging events have been organised to keep the modern cemetery alive. Jazz has been performed in the garden, a wedding was conducted in March and an upcoming acoustic performance is booked out. Moonlight cinema is a possibility.\n\"We want to demystify cemeteries and get people to see them for the great community assets that they are,\" she says. \"We're a multi-asset, multi-function business and we're trying to normalise this environment and make sure people are comfortable but also that we're sustainable.\"\nSpringvale still has about 15 years of saleable life, she says. Its successor, the similarly-sized $53.5 million state-of-the-art Bunurong Memorial Park, is due to open in December.\nOne of Grover's biggest challenges will be making sure the sector comes with her.\n\"We're running quite fast but we need to improve the sector because it's been dormant for a long time,\" she says. \"We're saying there's a better way of doing things.\"\nSo if you're getting the sense you're running out of time, it might be time to lock into that final resting place. Then you can relax and get on with living the rest of your life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:11:08.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
