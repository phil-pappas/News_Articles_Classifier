At Syntagma square in central Athens,... on.aol.com \nWhile in our mind it is still even money that there will be a further modification of the Greek bailout and that the Eurozone will carry on as it has for 16 years now, there exists the strong possibility that Greece will “opt out” of the inconvenient currency part of the European Union. What does it mean? Nobody knows, nobody has ever opted out of the currency after opting in. \nThe Greek people have decided that it means they are in big trouble, and they have been lining up at ATMs in order to get their hands on as many Euros as possible before the lights go out. For Mr. Tsipras, this in turn means he must declare a banking holiday and capital controls, which is a time tested recipe for causing any remaining economic activity to screech to a halt as anyone with a brain and more than a few Euros to their name starts working 24/7 on ways to keep their assets off the government’s confiscation radar. \nHowever, as in Cyprus, smart Greeks with a working data connection have a medium at their disposal that may ensure that their assets stay well away from their government: Bitcoin .The mini-spike in Bitcoin indicates that the Cyprus scenario is playing out again. If anyone recalls that event, it took the Bitcoin from relative obscurity to trading at around $1,100 before the mania wore off. Will it happen again? \nIt is anybody’s guess, but here are some statistics that may help guide your own educated ponderings: \nPopulation of Cyprus : 1.14M, pre banking holiday bitcoin price: $49 (March 2013), post banking holiday Bitcoin spike: $1,124 (October 2013) \nPopulation of Greece : 10.82M, pre banking holiday bitcoin price: $249 (June 2015) , post banking holiday Bitcoin spike: ? (January 2016?) \nWe’ll let you do the math on the hypothetical situation we have planted, but the dynamics of what is occurring in Greece, from a monetary standpoint, are extremely similar to the Cyprus scenario.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T06:33:50.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
