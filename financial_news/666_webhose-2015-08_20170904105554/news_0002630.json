They have also been hurt by record commodity-led deflation. \nExpansion into higher margin non-food areas is providing some relief. \nSainsbury's began selling clothing in 1994 and in its 2014-15 financial year Tu clothing sales grew to 800 million pounds ($1.2 billion). \nThe firm is currently the UK's seventh largest clothing retailer by volume and 10th largest by value, according to market researcher Kantar Worldpanel. \nA selection of Tu clothing is available in over 400 of Sainsbury's over 1,200 UK stores. \nHowever, customers previously only had access to the full Tu clothing range if they lived near one of the 160 stores carrying the full collection. \nThe new website means a much wider range of items is now available for home delivery and click and collect. Some 710 stores will offer click and collect, including 112 convenience stores. \n\"Customers have increasingly been looking to buy Tu online, and we have seen a really positive reaction to the new site from the selection of postcodes that have had access to it over the past few months,\" said Sainsbury's director of online, Robbie Feather. \nIn June Sainsbury's posted a sixth straight quarter of falling underlying sales but said it believed its strategy was working. \nIts share price has fallen 15 percent over the last year.
