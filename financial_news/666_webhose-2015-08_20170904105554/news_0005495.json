He was looking to boost revenue from areas such as international education, philanthropy, and business sponsored research projects. He said the university had identified about 10 pockets of extra funding each worth about $50 million a year.\n\"It's ambitious, it's bold, it's idealistic. I'm proud of that,\" Professor Jacobs said.\nUNSW is in the 101-150 range of the world's most prestigious ranking, the Academic Ranking of World Universities, 109th in The Times Higher Education ranking, and 48th in the QS ranking. Professor Jacobs said he wanted to see the average ranking under 50 within a decade.\nThe new strategy paper was a key step in building UNSW's new 10-year strategic plan, a process which Professor Jacobs began when he took over as vice-chancellor in February this year.\nBoost to research and teaching It had eight main points, led by boosting research and increasing the quality of teaching.\n But it also set three goals for social engagement – improved equity, knowledge exchange with business and the community, and a new public forum to debate big ideas – as well as three global goals in international education, new international university partnerships, and addressing global development issues.\nProfessor Jacobs said the big costs would be in boosting research and teaching, which would mean hiring talented academics and researchers and blending digital education with face-to-face learning.\n\"If we get those two right, the other priorities will flow from it,\" he said.\nSome of the extra $3 billion to fund the university's push would come from internal restructuring, including teaching all year round, including through the summer break, in three semesters rather than two.\nAnother major change would be to encourage academics who were successful researchers to spend nearly all their time researching, and to urge those who were good teachers to make teaching their focus.\nCareer tracks Professor Jacobs said that would include creating a proper career track for teaching only academics which could take them up to professor level. He envisaged that about 35 per cent of academics would do mainly research, 35 per cent would mainly teach and about 30 per cent would do both.\nHe also planned to ensure the profile of both staff and students represented the distribution of the Australian community. That would including lifting the number of women at professor level – now only 23 per cent – and making sure indigenous Australians were well represented.\nHe also believed the business investment could be a larger source of revenue for the university and aimed to make UNSW the leading university for industry engagement – with strong entrepreneurship and research being used by business.\n\"We will build a seamless knowledge transfer infrastructure,\" he said.\nHe said more than 5000 staff, students and other stakeholders had been consulted on the new strategy. The final plan will be released in October this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:56:04.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
