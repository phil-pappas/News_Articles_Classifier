Or Malcolm Turnbull, the only Liberal who would deliver instant economic credibility.\nIt is what’s known in politics as the turkeys voting for Christmas.\nThe refusal to come to terms with the fact that Hockey is a lame duck is a real shame, because the last Treasurer with any authority was in 2007, when Peter Costello exited the stage.\nImagine, if Abbott actually wins the next election, it will be 10 years since there was a Treasurer who could cut the mustard in question time.\nOh, what a time to be alive.\nRemember Wayne Swan, the Labor Treasurer Hockey taunted would never, ever deliver a budget surplus? Hockey was right of course.\nOnly problem is it’s a club Hockey now shows every sign of joining.\nSwan still sits in Parliament on the backbench. Sometimes I wonder if he sticks around purely just to smile across at his tormentor and what an ineffective treasurer he is.\nHockey has entered that political dead zone where nobody is interested when he talks about tax cuts. What sort of Treasurer is that?\nThere was some silly criticism this week that the tax cut debate sunk like a stone in the media cycle because Hockey failed to provide enough detail to his tax plan.\nRubbish. It’s just that the bloke sounds like a flog.\nWhen did a lack of policy detail ever stop Paul Keating or Peter Costello or John Howard prosecuting an economic argument? Never.\nAlso, Hockey’s best tax lines about average earners hitting the second highest tax bracket were stolen from Martin Parkinson. Who? He’s that widely respected Treasury boss that the Abbott Government sacked.\nHockey has long reigned as the Dyson Heydon of the Liberal Party, the man the ALP most want to stay in his job because it gives Bill Shorten another excuse to get away with murder.\nAsk any Labor MP and they will tell you. The only way they reckon they can win the next election is if Abbott and Hockey stay in the job.\nThey don’t think they can beat Scott Morrison or Malcolm Turnbull.\nStill, there’s certain ministers who are prepared to conduct their own decapitation strategy if strategy brains like Eric “Dolce & Gabbana” Abetz decide they would rather risk Bill Shorten than Malcolm Turnbull.\nMorrison could decide to throw his lot in with Turnbull to become Treasurer, but that is a political alliance that would send his conservative backers including Sydney radio host Ray Hadley apoplectic.\nWitness this week’s kerfuffle over Hockey’s decision to join a parliamentary friendship group for Republicans. Hockey later tried to respond to conservatives unhinging about this frolic when he couldn’t nail his day job, by explaining that it was just “drinks in an MPs office”.\nRepublicans, raise your glasses! Your hopes of constitutional reform are safe with Joe Hockey, as he drinks a VB with two mates in an empty office and smashes a packet of Doritos. Onya, mate.\nHockey plays down republic push 1:11 Play video\nTreasurer Joe Hockey has played down his move to support a parliamentary push for an Australian republic.\nSky News 27 Aug 2015 News Many Liberals would feel more relaxed and comfortable if his banker wife Melissa Babbage, who foresaw the GFC, was pulling the economic levers. But last time anyone checked we elected him, not her. Pity.\nThe other alternative, allowing Scott Morrison to continue in his role as the Phantom Treasurer, is not viable. It’s also rather emasculating for poor Joe. Still, there are some Liberals who are not convinced Morrison can count.\nWatch out though for Morrison to kickstart the housing affordability debate again soon.\nIt should provide a fresh opportunity for Morrison to go all Rain Main on us again as he whips out data, graphs, economic modelling and associated Treasury fetish wear.\nDithering is in Hockey’s DNA, witness his last minute call for a conscience vote on climate change during the 2009 leadership ballot that rolled Turnbull. A conscience vote on climate change? What a wally.\nIt was a political suicide note that saw Tony Abbott elected as Liberal leader by one vote.\nMaybe that’s why the PM still thinks he still owes Hockey one.\nFor being such a big idiot that he managed to go from front runner to getting Abbott elected in a three way contest?\nSix years in the treasury portfolio when you’ve never landed a blow anyone can remember seems like a pretty good go.\nParticularly when Hockey only got the job after Julie Bishop was the subject of vicious undermining by Hockey’s boosters and little minions.\nHow funny is that now? Extremely funny. Laugh Out Loud.\nThe karma bus is coming for Joe Hockey.\nSamantha.maiden@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Why PM should pluck Joe Hockey ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/why-tony-abbott-should-sack-joe-hockey-as-treasurer-for-christmas/story-fnu2pwk8-1227504731679?sv=855d18152237938afebed078c862e90b&h=Why+PM+should+pluck+Joe+Hockey", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/why-tony-abbott-should-sack-joe-hockey-as-treasurer-for-christmas/story-fnu2pwk8-1227504731679?sv=855d18152237938afebed078c862e90b", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/why-tony-abbott-should-sack-joe-hockey-as-treasurer-for-christmas/story-fnu2pwk8-1227504731679?sv=855d18152237938afebed078c862e90b", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Why+PM+should+pluck+Joe+Hockey&c=OPINION%3A+There%26%238217%3Bs+a+reason+why+Tony+Abbott+should+pluck+Joe+Hockey+for+Christmas.+He%26%238217%3Bs+stuffed.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/why-tony-abbott-should-sack-joe-hockey-as-treasurer-for-christmas/story-fnu2pwk8-1227504731679?sv=855d18152237938afebed078c862e90b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/12Mjg4dzqXCZZOxGl2kiEBvHPoNs1_DV/promo264949005&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/why-tony-abbott-should-sack-joe-hockey-as-treasurer-for-christmas/story-fnu2pwk8-1227504731679?sv=855d18152237938afebed078c862e90b&title=Why+PM+should+pluck+Joe+Hockey", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/why-tony-abbott-should-sack-joe-hockey-as-treasurer-for-christmas/story-fnu2pwk8-1227504731679?sv=855d18152237938afebed078c862e90b&title=Why+PM+should+pluck+Joe+Hockey", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/samantha-maiden-lets-be-honest-joe-hockey-is-a-flog-and-has-to-go/story-fni0cwl5-1227504452139"], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:45:48.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
