The central bank serves as the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, storing its accumulated earnings from oil exports. \nNet foreign assets dropped 9.4 percent from a year earlier in June. They peaked at a record $737 billion last August. \nThey were dropping at faster month-on-month rates earlier this year, but last month the government began covering part of its deficit by selling bonds for the first time since 2007, placing a 15 billion riyal issue. This has reduced pressure for the reserves to fall. \nThe assets are held mainly in the form of foreign securities such as U.S. Treasury bonds - securities totalled $483.3 billion at the end of June - and deposits with banks abroad totalling $119.7 billion. The vast majority of the assets are believed to be in U.S. dollars. \nThe June data appeared to show a shift in the central bank's approach. For many months it had mainly been running down its bank accounts rather than selling securities. \nBut in June, it liquidated a massive $32.4 billion of securities while increasing its deposits abroad by $22.9 billion, the data showed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:54:37.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
