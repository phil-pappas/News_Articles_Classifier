Gold has, however, found support after sliding to a five-and-a-half-year low at $US1,077 an ounce in July and is now up for a third straight session. Spot gold was up one per cent at $US1,103 an ounce at 3.27pm EDT (0527 Tues AEST), while US gold futures for December delivery settled up 0.9 per cent at $US1,104.10 an ounce. Among precious metals, spot platinum gained the most, rising 3.1 per cent to $US989.50 an ounce, a session high. The US dollar turned lower after Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the global deflationary trend \"bothers\" the Fed but is one of many factors it is watching, stoking uncertainty about a September rate hike. The 19-market Thomson Reuters CoreCommodity Index surged 2.1 per cent as copper, oil and grains rallied. Gold prices extended gains on short-covering and buy-stops that were triggered around $US1,100, traders said. \"The gold market triggered a lot of stops on the upside. That was a pretty good driving factor,\" said Phillip Streible, senior commodities broker for RJO Futures in Chicago. While the market is still awaiting further clues on the prospect of a near-term rate rise, gold is lacking an immediate driver, ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said. \"Gold prices just need a new acceleration point. We still expect the interest rates in the US, and the dollar, to (provide that),\" Boele said. Gold fell for a seventh week in a row last week, its longest such retreat since 1999, having struggled to pull away from a five-and-a-half-year trough reached in July. Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares, slipped to their lowest since September 2008 on Friday. Spot palladium rose 1.3 per cent to $US605.50 an ounce while silver was up 2.5 per cent at $US15.21 an ounce.
