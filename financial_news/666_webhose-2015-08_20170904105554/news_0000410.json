Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) raised its price target on the stock to 2840 pence from 2780 pence. \nAdjusted operating profit before amortisation of purchased intangibles and non-recurring items, rose to 366.1 million pounds ($569.69 million) from 288.8 million pounds a year earlier. \nThe company has been trying to reduce its reliance on stock trading by tapping into faster growing businesses such as clearing and exchange-traded funds - low-cost funds that provide an alternative to active fund management. \nThe 214-year-old exchange group said it would pay an interim dividend of 10.8 pence, up from 9.7 pence last year.
