The second was from about 12:57 p.m. to 1:35 p.m., according to the exchange’s website.\nSystems like the Nasdaq TRF help knit together U.S. stock trading, which is distributed across more than 50 markets. Roughly a third of trading takes place off the public exchanges, on venues like dark pools that match trades in secret up until the point they are completed. Dark pools then have to report transactions to services like the Nasdaq TRF.\nAny dark pool or alternative trading system that only uses the Nasdaq TRF might be unable to operate during a disruption.", "external_links": ["http://nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=MarketSystemStatus\\"], "published": "2015-08-05T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T21:24:52.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
