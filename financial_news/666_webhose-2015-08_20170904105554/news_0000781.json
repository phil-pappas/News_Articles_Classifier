At least it's a humane death. One could even make a case for Jeremy Sims' Last Cab to Darwin as a film that salvages a life-affirming message from tragedy.\nMichael Caton plays Rex, a cab driver in his late 60s who has spent his entire life in Broken Hill. His household consists of himself and a dog. The dog is called \"Dog\" because, as he later explains, \"Rex\" was taken. Across the road lives Polly (Ningali Lawford) an Aboriginal woman of Rex's vintage who is his long-term lover, although they like to keep it quiet.\nRex's intimate circle is completed by John Howard, David Field and Alan Dukes – three mates he meets on a daily basis in the pub. Alone in his loungeroom, Rex spins pop records from the 1970s and makes himself sandwiches of processed meat and tomato sauce.\nThis routine is upset when Rex learns he has malignant stomach cancer, and probably only three months to live. He intends to keep driving his cab to the bitter end, but when he hears a radio interview with a Dr Farmer in Darwin, who is pioneering a controversial new euthanasia program, he decides to take matters into his own hands.\nMichael Caton as Rex in a scene from \"Last Cab to Darwin\". Without discussing his decision with anyone, Rex loads up the cab and prepares to drive the 1900 kilometres to Darwin. His mates can hardly believe what he's doing, while Polly is furious with his stubborn behaviour. Although he leaves her the house, she is mortally offended at his refusal to let her care for him.\nThe film soon becomes a road movie, with picture-postcard views of the outback and the tiny communities along the way, such as William Creek, Oodnadatta and Daly Waters. En route Rex hooks up with the young Aboriginal larrikin, Tilly (Mark Coles Smith), and an English backpacker named Julie (Emma Hamilton), who is working as a barmaid. These are his companions when he turns up at Dr Farmer's suburban practice, feeling sicker than ever.\nTo his consternation, Rex finds it is no simple matter to end his life. Although euthanasia was briefly legalised in the Northern Territory, it was so hedged in with legal and medical restrictions the process was a minefield.\nBy the book Michael Caton as Rex in \"Last Cab to Darwin\". Wendy McDougall Jacki Weaver plays Dr Farmer as a conscientious GP who needs to do everything by the book. Her caution forces a delay that gives Rex time to think about his life and his relationships. As time ebbs away he begins to ask himself what is really important, and makes a decision.\nAlthough Last Cab to Darwin is based on the true story of Broken Hill cab driver, Max Bell, who sought to die with the assistance of Dr Philip Nitschke, playwright Reg Cribb has used Bell's tale as a vehicle for many different themes. As well as a reflection on mortality and the ethical dilemma of euthanasia, the film explores black and white relations in Australia with unusual sensitivity.\nThe story has its corny moments but Caton's performance is good enough to overcome the feel-good factor. One would have to be a sociopath not to feel sympathy for this stoic personality driving towards an appointment with death. The dialogue has a convincingly Australian feel: vulgarity and dry humour alternating with grim taciturnity. A lot of work has gone into this script in which every character labours under the knowledge of Rex's impending doom. Sims and Cribb manage to capture the awkwardness without falling into cliche.\nWhen it comes to the relationship between Rex and Polly, it resembles a battle. Although they are obviously rusted on to each other, there is a sense of taboo about their liaison. Aboriginal people are usually treated as second-class citizens in country towns, and Rex feels ashamed of how people would view his romance. For her part, Polly feels angry that Rex would leave her the house but spurn her affections.\nThen there is Tilly, the boozing, philandering, sharp-talking drifter. Talented but self-destructive, full of mischief but low on confidence, Tilly is a recognisable type among young Indigenous men. To survive in this story he has to be more than a stereotype. If Julie, the British backpacker, is attracted to Tilly, it's partly because she is free of all the ingrained prejudices that are incubated in remote communities. Having recently watched the even-handed way young French, German and British waitresses treated black and white customers in a bistro in the Pilbara, I began to think this too-good-to-be-true portrait might be more realistic than I'd suspected.\nAlthough Last Cab to Darwin may be morbid in its subject matter, it is a more complete package than almost anything I've seen by an Australian director over the past few years. I exempt Mad Max: Fury Road , which is in a class of its own, but for a conventional drama, Jeremy Sims has given us an Australian movie that can be shown around the world and do us proud.\nFear of commitment American comedy nowadays seems to consist largely of gross sexual scenarios and toilet humour. Judd Apatow's Trainwreck is pretty gross, but if it rises above the competition it is almost entirely due to Amy Schumer, who wrote the screenplay with herself in the starring role. That character, also called Amy, closely mirrors many aspects of Schumer's life, although one assumes the reckless sexual appetites are a comic exaggeration.\nSchumer is no glamour queen. She puts her own description into the mouth of her female boss in this film, who tells her she's cute enough but not intimidatingly beautiful. Cute enough to pursue a hyperactive sex life that has only one rule: no sleepovers. Amy's promiscuity is more like a philosophical principle learned from her father, Gordon, (Colin Quinn) who made his daughters repeat the mantra: \"Monogamy isn't realistic!\" when his predatory behaviour ended in divorce.\nAmy has absorbed this lesson. She keeps up a constant stream of partners while maintaining a regular boyfriend on the side – a musclebound hunk named Steven, played by wrestler, John Cena​. The bedroom scene with Steven is a masterpiece of bad sex, complete with suggestions that this mass of muscle is trying hard to convince himself he's actually interested in women. The sexiest thing he can think of is protein.\nThe running gag is that Amy is the female equivalent of a womanising, macho slob. She treats poor, sensitive men as sex objects, falls asleep and snores as soon as she climaxes. She has no desire to get married, settle down and have kids – it's the guys who nurture these fantasies.\nMeanwhile, her sister, Kim (Brie Larson), has taken the opposite course, finding an excessively cheerful, pot-bellied husband (Mike Birbiglia​) and becoming stepmother to the precocious young Allister (Evan Brinkman). The film gets great mileage from this vision of the nightmarish, Disneyfied nuclear family, even if the heroine will eventually succumb to its charms.\nAmy writes for a magazine called S'Nuff , which runs features such as \"You're not gay, she's boring\", and \"Ugly celebrity kids\". Her boss, Dianna – played wickedly by a catty, vampish Tilda Swinton – decides that Amy's outspoken hatred of sport makes her the perfect person to write a profile on Aaron Connor (Bill Hader​), sports doctor to the stars. But when Amy meets Aaron something unusual happens – she falls in love. This conflict with her usual principles finds Amy struggling to overcome her attraction to this do-gooder, who is also a leading light in Doctors Without Borders.\nAlas, this is also the point when the story fastens onto those train tracks that lead to a conventional Hollywood resolution. This is not exactly unusual for Apatow, who delights in pushing the envelope as far as it can go, before the natural order of bourgeois society is reaffirmed. There are echoes of those old films in which Katharine Hepburn spends most of the movie as superwoman, but ends as a happy housewife.\nAaron's profession allows scope for numerous cameos by high-profile sports figures. The surprise is the towering LeBron James, who has more than a passing role and reveals a striking talent for comedy. He's every bit as comfortable in front of the camera as he is on the basketball court.\nIt's a shame that even the most outrageous American comedies have this need to show that sex, booze, drugs and parties are but temporary distractions that must be overcome for characters to achieve true happiness. Bad Grandpa (2013) was probably the exception to the rule. For most of Trainwreck Amy looks at Kim's family arrangements with horror, and we share her pain. When she begins to crave this lifestyle the hard edge of the comedy is blunted. We've had our fun, and now it's time to reinstate the middle-class American dream.\nSentimentality takes centre stage when Amy is forced to deal with the terminal illness of her foul-mouthed, unreconstructed father. Gordon may be a shocker on all fronts but she loves him deeply. It's part of Amy's conversion from sexual desperado to a productive member of society. This redemption is a predictable part of any rom-com and it would be pointless to imagine a more subversive conclusion. We may at least be thankful for the wit and irreverence that Schumer displays for most of the journey before this train is bought safely into the station.\nJohn McDonald writes on visual arts for The Sydney Morning Herald .\nLast Cab to Darwin\nDirected by Jeremy Sims\nWritten by Reg Cribb & Jeremy Sims\nStarring Michael Caton, Ningali Lawford, Mark Coles Smith, Jacki Weaver, Emma Hamilton, Leah Purcell\nAustralia, rated M, 124 mins\nTrainwreck\nDirected by Judd Apatow\nWritten by Amy Schumer\nStarring Amy Schumer, Bill Hader, Brie Larson, Tilda Swinton, Colin Quinn, LeBron James, Mike Birbiglia, Evan Brinkman, Vanessa Bayer, Ezra Miller, John Cena\nUS, rated MA 15+, 125 mins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T16:05:05.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
