Photo: Louise Kennerley\nDick Smith's share price plunged 14.5 per cent on Tuesday, despite announcing a third consecutive year of sales and profit growth.\nShares had fallen to $1.71 by midday after opening at $2.\nThe stock dive came as same-store sales grew by just 1 per cent - well below market forecasts - after falling 0.1 per cent in the second half. Total sales rose 7.5 per cent to $1.32 billion, falling below guidance of 9 per cent.\nDick Smith's shares were smashed in the wake of its result.\nOverall, total sales had increase by 7.5 per cent to $1.31 billion in the 2015 financial year, off the back of new stores and an improved digital offering .\nAdvertisement Dick Smith reported a net profit after tax of $37.9 million for the 2015 financial year, with underlying net profit of $43.4 million, up 3.1 per cent from $42.1 million in 2014.\nEarnings before tax were $79.8 million in 2015, up 7.3 per cent from $74.4 million in 2014.\nCommenting this morning on the early price dive, CEO Nick Abboud said he did not know why the market was reacting negatively to the company's performance.\n\"I can't comment on why the share price is where it's at,\" Mr Abboud said.\n\"We grew the fastest in Australia in our sector with 7 per cent growth, [and in] the second half - which is the most recent result - we had an NPAT of over 7 per cent for the business and we're off to a good start.... for the first month on July.\n\"So I'm not sure what's happening there. What we need to do is continue to deliver an improvement in profit and sales, which we've done in the past two years.\"\nDick Smith has doubled its online performance last year, with 8 per cent of the electronics retailer's sales coming from digital customers.\nThe company, which floated on the stock market in 2013, said on Tuesday it had recorded standout sales in the key areas of entertainment and computers, while becoming a market leader in wearable fitness products like Fitbit and Garmin.\nDick Smith says it grew its share of the fitness market by 1 per cent last year, and is looking forward to more growth as new products are released.\nThe company's private label products also sold well, accounting for over 12.5 per cent of total sales, with plans afoot to increase its private label range by 40 per cent.\nDick Smith opened 25 new stores last year, bringing it to a total of 393 across Australia and New Zealand, including four duty free stores at Sydney International Airport.\nBoth the company and its arch rival JB Hi-Fi plan to take a slice of Australia's $1.7 billion small appliance market, and Dick Smith says it will roll out kitchen appliances, coffee machines, vacuum cleaners and irons to 100 of its stores within the next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T09:43:40.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
