He ended his speech by declaring, \"I have decided in 2020 to run for president,\" quickly riling up social media.\nSwift won video of the year, the night's top award, for the star-studded music video of her revenge song \"Bad Blood,\" which is reportedly about her feud with singer Katy Perry\n\"I know there's been a lot of discussion about what this video means but I'm just happy that in 2015 we live in a world where boys can play princesses and girls can play soldiers,\" the 25-year-old singer said.\nPerry did not attend this year's awards show.\nViacom Inc-owned MTV's annual VMA hands out Moonman statuettes to the year's top achievements in music videos, but is better known for delivering irreverent and unexpected moments.\nSunday's show was all about the shock factor as a scantily clad Miley Cyrus, 22, cursed her way through her hosting duties, flashed her bare breast accidentally and performed a new song about smoking marijuana.\nSinger Justin Bieber returned to the VMA stage after a two-year break to perform two new tracks, tearing up at the end of his performance.\nSwift led the winners with four Moonmans including best female video and best pop vide for \"Blank Space.\"\nNew Jersey rapper Fetty Wap was named artist to watch, Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson's summer hit \"Uptown Funk!\" was named best male video and Nicki Minaj's \"Anaconda\" won best hip hop video.
