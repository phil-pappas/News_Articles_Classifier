They say oil companies have not demonstrated that they can clean up a spill in water choked by ice. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates that U.S. Arctic waters hold 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil, and Shell is eager to explore in a basin that company officials say could be a \"game changer\" for domestic production. \nShell bid $2.1 billion on Chukchi Sea leases in 2008 and has spent upward of $7 billion on exploration there and in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska's north coast. \nShell hopes to drill two exploration wells during the short 2015 open-water season. It has until late September, when all work must stop. It has two drill vessels and about 28 support vessels in the Chukchi Sea. \nThe permit to drill deep into the ocean hinged on the arrival of a capping stack, which is a roughly 30-foot device that can be lowered over a wellhead to act like a spigot to stop a blowout. The government requires Shell to have the device ready to use within 24 hours of a blowout. \nThe capping stack sits on a 380-foot icebreaker that suffered hull damage July 3 as it left Dutch Harbor, a port in the Aleutian Islands. The vessel named the Fennica was repaired in Portland, Oregon, and briefly delayed from leaving July 30 by Greenpeace protesters in climbing gear hanging from a bridge over the Willamette River. \nThe Fennica reached the drill site 70 miles off Alaska's northwest coast Aug. 11. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T22:27:35.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
