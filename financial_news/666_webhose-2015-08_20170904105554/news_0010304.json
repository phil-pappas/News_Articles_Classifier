Peter Braig by James Eyers The chief executive of the country's largest mortgage broker, the newly listed Australian Finance Group, has urged the banking regulator to \"hold fire\" on more moves to cool the investor lending market , saying current measures are already \"starting to bite\".\nAFG managing director Brett McKeon said investor loans had fallen as a percentage of AFG's book.\n\"May and June investor numbers are off quite significantly over the previous six months – we think APRA is starting to bite in that regard,\" he said during a briefing after AFG posted its maiden profit result as a listed company on Thursday that is 8 per cent above the prospectus forecast.\nHe urged the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to take stock of its regulatory efforts.\n\"APRA needs to sit back and see what washes through ... We would like to see APRA hold fire for a while, and see the impact of these policy changes,\" said Mr McKeon, who owns just under 10 per cent of the company, which floated in May.\nLike its listed competitor Mortgage Choice, market sentiment around AFG has been weighed down by action this year from APRA, which is pressuring banks to keep a lid on property investor lending growth at 10 per cent.\n​ In a speech on Wednesday, APRA chairman Wayne Byres said it was too early to say whether more action would be needed to preserve the resilience of the banking system.\nThe prudential regulator remained open to taking further steps but would prefer \"if lenders themselves maintain a healthy dose of common sense in their lending practices\", which would reduce the need for APRA to do more, he said.\n AFG's net profit of $19.3 million for the full year, on total revenue of $526 million, which was up 16 per cent, was driven by higher loan settlements as the group's 2400 brokers turned their attention to owner-occupiers.\n\"Brokers have been able to redirect their focus on owner-occupier business and find new business there. Brokers are very good at finding business,\" Mr McKeon said.\nAFG shares jump The market applauded the result, sending AFG shares up almost 5 per cent before they settled to close at $1.08, up 0.5 per cent. But this is still well below the issue price of $1.20.\nAndrew Wackett, an analyst at Macquarie, which owns part of AFG and managed the float, said the shares had struggled to climb above the listing price because of APRA's attention on the investor market and \"this is the first indication they can grow earnings in that environment. Now they will have to prove they can continue that over time\".\nAFG's slide pack showed investor loans as a proportion of their book rose strongly from January to April, when they peaked at 43 per cent. Since then, investor loans have fallen to 37 per cent.\nLike Mortgage Choice, which last week reported a full-year cash profit of $18.6 million, down 1.2 per cent, Mr McKeon said AFG would benefit from increased complexity in the market caused by banks' responses to APRA's macro-prudential action.\n\"With the product changes in the market, we are in a more difficult landscape and consumers tend to turn to brokers more for advice in that sort of market.\"\nMr Byres said in his Wednesday speech that if investor lending continued to grow at about 10 per cent, this would still be the fastest class of credit and be at twice the rate of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). \"A moderation in lending growth as currently envisaged should therefore not be seen as unduly restrictive: it is not placing a foot on the credit brake but rather easing off the accelerator,\" he said.\nMr Byres also noted that loans originated by mortgage brokers tended to have a \"materially higher\" default rate compared with loans originated by banks' own networks; this was not because brokers had lower underwriting standards \"but simply that the new business that flows through these [brokers] appear to be of higher risk\".\nAFG, which has a residential and commercial loan book of $107 billion (containing trailing commissions), said growth of its \"Edge\" home loan product had exceeded expectations, with more than $460 million settling during the period, well ahead of forecasts of $150 million. Total residential settlements were $31.2 billion, up 19 per cent on the previous year.\nAFG has a panel of about 30 lenders offered to its brokers – including all the large and regional banks. It said on Thursday it would expand its lending panel during the next 12 months and was in \"advanced negotiations with a number of new lenders\".\nThe company also flagged the announcement in the next couple of days of new white-label mortgage product and said it was exploring options to introduce AFG-branded deposit accounts.\nAFG is also working with Realestate.com.au on a pilot in Victoria that may be rolled out to other states to provide its brokers with leads. \"We see that as a good growth opportunity,\" Mr McKeon said.\nHe also said the recent deal with online small business lender Prospa provided an opportunity for brokers to expand their offering and suggested other lenders could be added to that panel.\n\"We see opportunity in SME asset lending and more work is being done online in those channels. While it is early days and we still are feeling our way, we expect that will be attractive to a number of brokers and there has already been take-up by our network. The speed of approval is attractive and the terms for brokers are not a lot different,\" he said.\nAFG brokers have relationships with 600,000 consumers, he said, and \"we believe our brokers should be picking up more lending opportunities in their own databases\".", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/apra-launches-crackdown-on-loans-to-property-investors-20141209-123lko.html"], "published": "2015-08-27T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:08:55.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
