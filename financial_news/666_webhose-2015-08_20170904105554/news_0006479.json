The four-week average, which is less volatile and provides a clearer picture of where the job market is headed, increased 5,500 to 271,500. ADVERTISEMENT A few weeks ago, the monthly average for unemployment applications fell to its lowest point in more than 15 years. Meanwhile, the economy added 215,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate stayed at 5.3 percent, a seven-year low. Employers are laying off fewer workers as the labor market improves, bolstering expectations for wage growth and consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic growth. The total number of people receiving unemployments benefits dropped 24,000 to 2.25 million. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending Aug. 8 were in California (+2,498), Illinois (+2,042), New York (+1,554), Pennsylvania (+1,035) and Puerto Rico (+920).The largest decreases were in Virginia (-329), Kansas (-236), Florida (-182), Indiana (-116) and Rhode Island (-53). 1 day Clinton aides’ BlackBerrys likely...
