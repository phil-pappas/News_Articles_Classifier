Announces Board Approval of Dissolution and Liquidation, Reports Second Quarter Earnings Results Ambassadors Group, Inc. 4 hours ago Content preferences Done \nSPOKANE, Wash., Aug. 14, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ambassadors Group, Inc. ( EPAX ), today announced that its Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company's shareholders for the Company to dissolve, liquidate and distribute to stockholders its available assets. Separately, the Company reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. \nThe Company has been engaged in a lengthy and intensive evaluation of potential strategic alternatives in order to preserve and maximize stockholder value. Those potential alternatives included pursuing a strategic transaction with a third party, such as a merger or sale of the Company and dissolving the Company, winding down its remaining operations and distributing its net assets to its stockholders, after making appropriate reserves for liabilities and expenses. \n\"After evaluating the Company's strategic options, the Board of Directors has reached the conclusion that it is in the best interests of the stockholders to dissolve and liquidate the Company,\" stated Philip B. Livingston, Ambassadors Group Chief Executive Officer. \"The Board of Directors and management, together with the Company's advisors, devoted substantial time and effort in seeking, identifying and pursuing opportunities to enhance stockholder value; however, the process to date has not yielded any opportunities viewed by the Board as reasonably likely to provide greater realizable value to stockholders than the complete dissolution and liquidation of the Company,\" Mr. Livingston continued. \nThe Company's dissolution was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors but is subject to stockholder approval. The Company intends to present this proposal to its stockholders of record as of September 10, 2015 at a special meeting of shareholders. The Company will file prescribed proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission in advance of that meeting. In connection with the dissolution, the Company intends to distribute to its stockholders all available cash other than as may be required to pay expenses and pay or make reasonable provision for known and potential claims and obligations of the Company, as required by applicable law. The Board of Directors' decision contemplates an orderly wind down of the Company's remaining business and operations, including the dissolution and winding-up of subsidiaries. If approved by the Company's stockholders, the Company intends to file a certificate of dissolution, pay, satisfy, resolve or make reasonable provisions for claims and obligations as well as anticipated costs associated with the Company's dissolution and liquidation, and seek to convert its remaining assets into cash or cash equivalents as soon as reasonable, practicable and financially prudent. \nIf the Company's stockholders approve the proposal, the Company currently expects to make an initial liquidating distribution to stockholders of approximately $44 million up to $50 million, or $2.50 up to $2.85 per share. The Company expects to make this initial liquidating distribution as soon as practicable following receipt of stockholder approval and filing of a certificate of dissolution. The amount of this initial distribution reflects the Company's current liquid assets offset in part by provisions, or reserves, for future operating costs and expenses associated with dissolution and liquidation and, as required by law, for other known and potential claims and obligations. \nDelaware law requires that, in connection with a dissolution, the Company's Board of Directors make reasonable provision for known and potential claims and obligations of the Company and maintain those reserves until resolution of such matters. The Board of Directors, in consultation with its advisors, has evaluated the liabilities, expenses, and known potential claims and obligations of the Company, as well as other matters, in order to estimate the amount that will be reserved. Insofar as the reserves required by applicable law exceed, in the view of the Board of Directors, the ultimate amounts the Company will likely be required to pay creditors, the Board of Directors believes there is a reasonable possibility that a portion of the reserves will ultimately be distributed to stockholders. The Board of Directors currently believes that total aggregate distributions to stockholders could range between $44 million and $53 million, or $2.50 and $3.00 per share. The Board will evaluate the Company's reserves on a periodic basis and will approve liquidating distributions when and as it deems appropriate. Additional liquidating distributions will be made to the extent the required contingency reserves are released and upon the Company's non-cash assets being monetized, which would likely span a multi-year period. Further details regarding anticipated future distributions will be disclosed in the Company's proxy materials to be filed in connection with the special meeting. \nThe amount distributable to stockholders, both initially and in total, may vary substantially from the amounts currently estimated based on many factors, including the resolution of outstanding known claims and obligations, the possible assertion of claims that are currently unknown to the Company, the ability to receive reasonable value when selling or otherwise monetizing its assets, and costs incurred to wind down the Company's business. Further, if additional amounts are ultimately determined to be necessary to satisfy or make provision for any of these obligations, stockholders may receive substantially less than the current estimates. \nUntil such time, if any, as the stockholders approve the Company's dissolution, and the Board of Directors decides, and instructs management, to proceed with a dissolution, the Company will continue to investigate and consider any feasible, alternative, value-creating transactions of which it becomes aware. If prior to its dissolution the Company receives an offer for a transaction that, in the view of the Board, would be expected to provide superior value to stockholders than the value of the currently estimated distributions, taking into account factors that could affect valuation, including timing and certainty of payment or closing, proposed terms and other factors, the dissolution could be abandoned in favor of such a transaction, even if dissolution has been previously approved by the Company's stockholders. \nIn a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 23, 2015, the Company disclosed its estimates of various cash and non-cash exit costs, including for severance and related compensation benefits, rent and other contract termination fees, acceleration of depreciation and other prepaid costs, and other associated costs related to its closing. These amounts are estimated below and are not audited: Approximately $1.3 million to $2.4 million in severance costs, including $0.3 million in non-cash charges for the acceleration of equity awards under the terms of existing separation agreements; Non-cash charge of approximately $2.0 million in property and equipment and other asset write-downs; Estimated $0.6 million to $1.3 million in various contract termination fees, ongoing maintenance expenditures, and facility and business closure expenses; and Approximately $0.4 million to $0.8 million in estimated legal and other professional fees including estimated ongoing insurance costs. \nThe Company expects to recognize the majority of the charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. \nThe Company operates on a calendar year basis for financial reporting. Due to seasonality, the Company historically was typically not profitable in the first and fourth quarters. During the second and third quarters, the majority of delegates traveled and the Company recognized revenue at that time. In the upcoming quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company expects to be profitable and all delegate payments made, less the costs to deliver those programs and refunds, will be converted to deployable cash. The Company anticipates margins and patterns from delegate travel that will be consistent with those produced in past summer travel periods. At July 31, 2015, deployable cash, as defined herein, was $54.4 million. \nInvestors are encouraged to consider the Company's June 30, 2015 deployable cash, its pattern and margin of third quarter profitability and the summary of exit costs, when evaluating the Company's stock. There are risks, including the risk of litigation that should be considered as well. Investors should refer to the Company's Form 10-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC for its discussion of Risk Factors. \nFinancial Results Overview Gross revenue from continuing operations of $47.2 million during the first six months of 2015 compared to $57.4 million in the prior year period, a 17.7 percent decline year-over-year.
