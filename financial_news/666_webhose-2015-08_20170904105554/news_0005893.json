He was replying to a query about the progress with regard to setting up of the MPC.\n\nMehrishi said there should be a system in which the government could state its point so that that the RBI could decide the rate after taking into account the merit of the views of stakeholders.\n\nThe revised draft of the Indian Financial Code (IFC), released by the Finance Ministry last month, had suggested doing away with the RBI Governor's veto power and wants a seven-member MPC to take decisions by a majority vote. Of the seven members, four would be government nominees and the rest from the RBI.\n\nUnder the present system, the RBI Governor is appointed by the government, but controls monetary policy and has veto power over the existing advisory committee of RBI members and outside appointees that sets rates.\n\nAs regarding the PDMA, the Finance Ministry in the Budget had proposed to set up an agency to manage government debt and also to shift the regulation of government bonds from RBI to Sebi. However, due to opposition from the RBI, the proposal could not go through.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:28:48.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
