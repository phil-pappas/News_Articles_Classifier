By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 27 minutes ago 0.0001 0.0000 \nMoney Makeover: This couple hope to downsize to a bungalow and live on £30,000 a year in retirement. We look at whether the numbers add up \nWhen Paul Beglarian's former employer offered him a cash lump sum in exchange for giving up his final salary pension, he jumped at the chance. \nThe offer was made in early 2013, well before the Government announced its pension freedom reforms, and Mr Beglarian liked the idea of having full control of his savings. He gave up a lump sum of £90,000 at age 65 and a £12,500 annual pension, for a cash lump sum of £272,000. \nMr Beglarian and his wife Liz, both 57, now own a small estate and lettings agency. He would like to pass the business on to his son when he retires. \n“Ideally I would like to retire at age 60 with an annual income of £25,000 to £30,000, including the state pension,” he said. \n• Calculator: Final salary pension value \n• Calculator: How 'compounding' can make you a millionaire \nThe couple plan to pay down their £265,000 interest-only mortgage and downsize to a bungalow ahead of their retirement. \nThey want to swap their £425,000 house for the bungalow, which they would like to buy outright. \nAt the moment, Mr Beglarian’s mortgage repayments are £500 a month, but he regularly overpays and makes total payments of around £15,000 a year. \nIn order to clear the mortgage and build up a solid retirement fund, Mr Beglarian has been investing his £272,000 lump sum in a high-risk portfolio in an effort to maximise his returns. \nThe money, held in a Scottish Widows retirement account, is invested in just four funds the Scottish Widows Jupiter UK Growth, Fidelity American Special Situations, Scottish Widows Investec American and Framlington Biotech funds. The portfolio has achieved impressive returns and, two and a half years on, is now worth approximately £450,000. \nMr Beglarian initially invested in a high-risk portfolio because he wanted to build a £1m pension pot so that he could take a tax-free lump sum of £250,000 to pay off the mortgage. \nJust over 12 months later however, the Government announced in the 2014 Budget that savers would be able to take some or all of their pot as cash if they wished from the age of 55. \nDespite this, he has developed a taste for high returns and is reluctant to move his money into more balanced investments. \n“I am comfortable in high-risk funds,” he said. “I have to be or I will never get rid of the mortgage.” \nMr Beglarian wants to keep his money invested for as long as possible and draw an income from it periodically. He is adamant that he does not want an annuity. \n“I am open to changing the funds I hold in my pension,” he said. “I tend to switch a few times a year to funds that have been doing really well for a few months in the hope that they will continue to perform.” \n• Find out more about DIY investing on Telegraph Investor \n= Dennis Hall of Yellowtail Financial Planning said: = \nMr Beglarian has experienced spectacular returns from his pension investments, 65pc in just two and a half years. This works out at approximately 22pc a year. \nBy comparison, popular fund manager Anthony Bolton’s long-term average when managing Fidelity’s Special Situations Fund was 19.5pc. But here’s the rub Bolton also had long periods of negative returns. It’ll happen to Mr Beglarian too, we just don’t know when. \nAlthough I understand why he chose a high-risk investment strategy, it worries me. When he does hit a bad patch there will be limited time to recover any losses, assuming he is able to recover. In that situation he may feel forced to take even greater risk, or end up settling for a lot less than he hoped for. \nSo looking ahead, just how hard does the money need to work to help the couple achieve their retirement objectives? \nThree years from now they would like to be mortgage free, living in a bungalow with a present day value of £325,000. They also want a retirement income of up to £30,000. \nThey have approximately £160,000 of equity in their present home, so need a further £165,000 to downsize and be mortgage free. Adding costs and the £6,250 in stamp duty they’ll need to pay, means they’ll need closer to £175,000 all in. They’ve been making mortgage overpayments of £9,000 a year, so over the next three years that could further reduce the property shortfall to around £148,000. Let’s park that for a moment and consider their pension needs. \n• How to build the perfect portfolio \nThey won’t receive a state pension until age 66 so retiring at 60 means they’ll be supporting themselves for six years on Mr Beglarian’s pension alone. When the state pension finally kicks in, assuming both qualify for the full rate of approximately £151 per week, then Mr Beglarian’s pension only needs to provide around £15,000 a year in today’s terms. Add inflation and by age 66 that rises to nearer £20,000. \nAssuming his pension remains invested, he’ll draw income directly from the pension fund each year. He would need a fund at age 66 of £400,000 assuming a withdrawal rate of around 5pc a year. \nFor the first six years however, he will be drawing heavily from the pension while waiting for the state pension. On top of that there’s the £148,000 needed to meet the property shortfall this will most likely be by way of mostly tax-free cash from the pension. \nSome quick calculations suggest this all requires a pension fund of between £575,000 and £600,000 in three years’ time. To achieve that from his current position requires an average rate of return of around 10pc a year, less than half his current track record, but still a stretch. \nKnowing that might allow Mr Beglarian to take his foot off the pedal slightly, and perhaps allow himself to diversity his investments more. He currently only has four funds, which is a high-risk strategy in itself. Diversification will almost certainly reduce his maximum return, but will also provide more protection when things turn against him. \nHe says he invests in funds that have been doing well for a few months, and in rising markets he can benefit from market or sector momentum. However, it also carries the risk of investing into a bubble. Right now Neil Woodford is worried about a bubble forming in the biotech space, which is an area Mr Beglarian is invested in. \n• Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas \n= Tom Kean of Thameside Financial Planning said: = \nMost people tend to build up a business with the aim of selling it at the time they retire, often at the expense of pension planning. There is a classic argument not to do this, as the business might not be as successful as they had hoped, or it might not fetch the price they had imagined. Happily though, this does not seem to be an issue for the Beglarians as their only child will be taking over the reins. \nIn the early years of retirement they may need to deplete some of their pension capital, perhaps more than they might ordinarily have the confidence to do, sound in the knowledge that at age 66 their income will be topped up by the state pension. This is likely to pay a combined total of £15,730 a year, which is over 50pc of their income target. \nTheir current pension portfolio is indeed quite high risk and not very diversified. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) might be that they have already achieved enough growth in the fund to meet their requirements from this plan, and could therefore afford to de-risk. But given their intention to leave it invested for as long as they can, which is conceivably another 30 to 40 years, more risk could be exactly what they need. But a good balance is needed here. \nThe Beglarians are aiming to downsize in the next three to five years, which would yield around £85,000 after costs. This means they would be likely to have a pension pot of perhaps £500,000 and other capital of say £100,000. This could be invested to yield 5pc a year, giving them an annual income of £30,000 to see them through to age 66 when their state pension starts. \nMoney Makeovers \n- 'Will my £60,000 redundancy payout last until I retire?' - Will £86,000 salary fund a family gap year? - 'With £250,000 how can I help my children, aged seven and 37, buy property?' \n= Would you like a Telegraph Money Makeover? = \nIf you'd like to be considered, please send your responses to all the following questions with the header ‘Give me a Money Makeover’ to money@telegraph.co.uk. \nYou must be willing to be photographed for the article, which will appear online and in the paper.
