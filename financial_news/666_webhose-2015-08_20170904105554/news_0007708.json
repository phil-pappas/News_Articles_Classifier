We expect India’s investment growth to improve to 7.2 per cent in FY16 from 4.6 per cent in FY15,” the report said.\nAs per the report, land acquisition hurdles, lack of funding, weak and environmental clearances are key bottlenecks to investment.\n“The impact of global developments on domestic investment also needs to be monitored. The recent sharp decline in global metal prices, for example, is likely to curb private-sector investment in the metal sector, delaying its recovery,” the report added.\n 21, 2015 5:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:51:43.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
