Derrick Fong by Tony Featherstone 6 ways to cash in on the Asian consumer boom\nDramatic falls in Chinese shares have created an opportunity to profit in one of the biggest megatrends of our time – the upcoming Asian consumption boom as billions of people join the middle class.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index's 8.5 per cent fall on Monday, the biggest one-day loss in eight years, followed a 32 per cent collapse in June. The meltdown reinforces the dangers of investing in a Chinese equity market that relies more on government intervention than market forces, and the potential for emerging-market volatility.\nBut it also creates a cheaper entry point for Australian investors who want long-term exposure to the Asian consumption boom and can wait for better value as fears about China's market and economy intensify.\nChina's sharemarket woes are spreading. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, a more reliable and regulated market than China's mainland sharemarkets, has slumped 13 per cent in three months. So has the Taiwan SE Weighted Index.\nFurther falls in Chinese shares in coming months, amid expectations the carnage will hurt sentiment and spill into China's economy, would dampen sharemarket indices across Asia. Investor confidence is being eroded as the market second-guesses the duration and size of Chinese government support for equity prices.\nFund managers are capitalising on China's correction by investing in markets, such as Hong Kong, that are strongly linked to Chinese growth and less risky. They are buying well-established Asian companies that dominate their markets or, to limit risk, favouring US and European multinational companies with a growing Asian presence.\n\"The fall in mainland Chinese shares has had a contagion effect in other Asian markets that were sold off – and this is where we see some of the best investment opportunities today,\" says Kevin Bertoli, portfolio manager of Asian equities at PM Capital. \"For some time, we have been concerned about a disconnect between Chinese shares and the Chinese economy, the lack of regulatory safeguards and the market's reliance on the Chinese government to prop it up.\"\n Buying into the trend Bertoli says the best time for investors to buy into the Asian consumption trend is during market volatility. \"The trend will run for the next 20 years and should be a key portfolio theme for Australian investors. But the market is well aware of the trend so stock valuations, in many cases, are very full. You need to wait patiently for periods of higher market volatility and buy when valuations become more attractive, as is the case now.\"\nTempo Asset Management principal Joe Bracken says: \"We are big believers in the Asia theme, but China's market is too embryonic. By comparison, the Hang Seng index is much more regulated and less volatile, trades on a historic price-earnings multiple of 10-12 times (compared with the US at 18 times) and provides a strong entree into China. We also like Japan as its government continues to stimulate the economy through quantitative easing.\"\nBracken believes the Chinese market is not \"massively\" expensive compared to developed markets. \"The Shanghai Composite trades on a historic PE about 18 which is comparable with the US, even though China has stronger growth prospects. But the concern is Chinese equities rely so heavily on government support. You couldn't rule out further big falls.\"\nAfter soaring more than 150 per cent over 12 months, the Shanghai Composite plunged by a third in June and early July as panic selling from retail investors magnified losses. The Chinese government stepped in to stabilise a market in freefall. The index bounced off its low in July, but tumbled early this week as market fears about China's growth resurfaced. Again, the Chinese government rescued the market, this time with an $11-billion injection.\nCritics say this shows why Chinese shares are best avoided: they rely too much on retail investors, excessive margin lending and government intervention.\nNathan Bell, head of research at Peters MacGregor Capital Management, is a China bear. \"We are prepared for a hard landing in China and wary of owning cyclical or low-quality businesses that masquerade as high-quality growth companies due to an unprecedented Chinese credit boom. If you pay a high price for a business that suffers revenue falls while margins get crunched as growth slows in China, you could lose most of your money, not to mention the risk of being defrauded if you speculate in unfamiliar markets with less stringent regulations.\"\nNobody doubts the magnitude of the Asian consumption boom, its relevance for long-term investors or the logic of buying into the trend after heavy price falls. But this megatrend – characterised by periods of high volatility and hype – is a conundrum for Australian investors.\nOnly 9 per cent of Australian businesses operate in Asia and nearly two-thirds have no intention of changing their stance towards the region, according to a PwC survey. It found Australia invested more in New Zealand, which has 4.5 million people, than in Asia, which will have 3.2 billion middle-class consumers by 2030.\nThis means Australian investors have to invest directly in Asian-based companies, buy global companies with operations there or use ASX-listed managed funds or unit trusts that specialise in the region. With that comes currency, company and manager risk.\nA long-term approach Nevertheless, taking a long-term approach to Asian equities, based on diversification and risk minimisation strategies, is worthwhile. Asian share funds, managed in Australia, returned an average annual 21 per cent over three years to June 2015, Morningstar data shows.\nLong-term outperformance in Asian funds is likely. The global middle class will soar to 4.9 billion in 2030, from 1.8 billion in 2009, the OECD forecasts. Asia will provide two-thirds of expected growth and another two billion middle-class Asian consumers will be on Australia's doorstep within 15 years.\nBy 2025, Asia will produce half the world's total economic output, notes PwC. Its countries will need to spend $8 trillion in infrastructure by then to support forecast economic growth and a higher population, the Asian Development Bank predicts.\nEven if these forecasts are half correct, the Asian middle-class boom will be unlike any in history, and a trend that Australian investors (particularly self-managed superannuation funds) cannot ignore. But great care is needed.\nLike most megatrends, the Asian consumption boom is well known and priced into equity markets. Asian households that can spend $US10-$US100 on each member every day will, in time, have a profound effect on the global economy. Yet Asian consumers are unlikely to supersede US consumers as the engine of global economic growth anytime soon.\nMoreover, megatrends can seduce investors who buy on the basis of simplistic top-down trends and ignore company valuations and industry risks.\n\"Even if Asia is the great growth story of the next 20 years, you still need to pay an appropriate price for the individual businesses in your portfolio to do well,\" Bell says. \"We have struggled to get comfortable with the quality of financial information and management across most of Asia, albeit things are improving with the adoption of Western reporting, governance and management standards. We prefer to own well-run, predictable businesses listed in western markets that benefit from increasing market share.\"\nMany fund managers favour US or European multinational companies with an expanding presence in Asia that are listed on better-regulated Western exchanges. K2 Asset Management, an early investor in the Asian consumption trend, initially focused on luxury goods and casinos. Its strategy has evolved to include Western travel companies, such as cruise lines, and Asian cosmetic companies that target the Asian middle class.\n\"Recently the big problem has been an oversupply of luxury goods in Asia,\" says K2 Asset Management's head of global equities, Nick Griffin. \"Too many Western companies built too many stores in the wrong places as they raced to capitalise on the consumption boom. The demand is there, but wealthier Asian consumers often buy luxury goods when they travel overseas.\"\nThe poor performance of Western multinationals in Asia is another concern. McDonald's, Wal-Mart Stores and many other Fortune 500 companies have struggled to deliver sustainable high-growth in Asia. Some have misunderstood Asian preferences; others have struggled with a maze of regulatory requirements.\nAnother drawback is the diverse earnings profile of multinational companies. German luxury car makers, for example, have outstanding potential to sell more vehicles in Asia, but Western markets still provide the bulk of their revenue. Multinationals, a safer way to play the Asian trend, do not provide pure exposure to the region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:03:33.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
