This is the first action by the HKMA under Hong Kong's Anti Money-Laundering Ordinance, which came into force in 2012. \nMeena Datwani, Director-General (Enforcement) of the HKMA, said, \"This was a case of internal control failures\" relating to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) rules. \"The HKMA takes such failures seriously and wants to send a clear message to the industry that all authorised institutions should have effective AML/CFT systems,\" she said. \nWhile SBI Hong Kong (SBIHK) said, \"As a member of the Hong Kong banking community for over 35 years, SBIHK is committed to a policy of zero tolerance of non-compliance with regulatory guidelines supported by a robust compliance and risk function, while providing the products and services to our esteemed customers. \nWe fully support the HKMA's efforts to ensure high standards of due diligence and monitoring among Hong Kongs financial institutions. \n\" It said neither the HKMA nor the external consultants found any instances of problem accounts or suspicious transactions during the period in question, or the years following.\" \n\"As noted by the HKMA, we have undertaken very positive and intensive remediation work to address their findings, which refer to procedures and policies in place during 2012 and 2013,\" it said in an emailed statement. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T12:03:43.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
