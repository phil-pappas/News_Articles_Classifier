The oversupply has prompted the group to mothball production capacity.\nNet profit for Orica’s 2015 financial year, which finishes next month, is now expected to range from $416.6 million to $441 million, 10 per cent to 15 per cent lower than earlier forecasts.\nMr Calderon, appointed to the top job at Orica in mid May, said mining companies and services suppliers need to adjust to a permanently tougher environment.\n“In the new normal we all have to adjust, we all have to work more efficiently and we need to work better together.”\nIndia would not serve as a replacement for China and could even skip the industrialisation phase of its development, he said.\nIt might instead jump to a services-led, consumption-based economy that would not require massive levels of bulk commodities such as iron ore, Mr Calderon said.\nIndia’s steel consumption would peak at 250 million tonnes annually around 2040 while China’s last year produced 820 million tonnes, he said.\nMr Calderon, who was in the running to take the helm at BHP during his days there, came to Orica after former chief Ian Smith was sacked for aggressive management behaviour.\nOrica had a great ingrained culture, Mr Calderon said, and he was determined his management team would live by core values of respect, collaboration and performance.\nShares in the group closed $3.19 lower at $15.64.\njohn.dagge@news.com.au\n All over for big booms", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/all-over-for-big-booms/story-fni0dcne-1227474856150"], "published": "2015-08-08T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:49:26.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
