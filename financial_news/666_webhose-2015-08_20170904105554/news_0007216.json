I want to highlight the best stuff out there and really encourage filmmakers to take it to the next level.”\nCategories include “Cinematic,” “Aerial Sports,” “Drones for Good,” and “Student Film.” The winning films will be screened on Nov. 19 at the Roxie Theater in San Francisco.\nJust what kind of entries can you expect to see at the festival? Probably something like this footage of Burning Man, shot by Codel:\nDrone film festivals are becoming more of a trend world-wide as more consumers get their hands on drones. Goldman Sachs estimates the drone market is worth $1.4 billion in 2015 and forecasts it to more than triple by 2017 .\nThe first-ever New York City Drone Film Festival was held in March 2015, selling out in five days and receiving more than 150 film submissions from 10 countries. International Drone Conference InterDrone is also hosting its own InterDrone Film Festival this September in Las Vegas. (Full disclosure: the author of this story is speaking on a panel at InterDrone.)\nDrones are already widely used in Hollywood.\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) spent $4.11 million on lobbying between 2012 and 2013, with one of its major focuses on allowing drone use for filmmaking. Footage from a drone has been used in films including “The Hunger Games,” “Skyfall” and “The Dark Knight Rises.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.interdrone.com/news/interdrone-announces-the-interdrone-film-festival", "http://friff.co/", "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/04/29/drone-used-in-san-francisco-wedding-proposal", "http://www.nycdronefilmfestival.com/", "http://eddie.com/2015/07/28/introducing-the-flying-robot-international-film-festival/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/m2ThTb6iffA"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T12:22:08.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
