The latest hot item is Texas Pete Chili Sauce . This is a canned food product that can be served on hot dogs, hamburgers, or eaten plain like chili . The product is selling on eBay for an average of $8 per can. According to an article posted online by The Shelby Report , \"TW Garner, the makers of Texas Pete Sauces and affiliated products, has discontinued it Texas Pete Chili Sauce for hot dogs and hamburgers.\" \nBasic economics tells us that the less there is of something, the more it costs because the demand is greater than the supply. This is a simple concept, yet many eBay sellers (especially newbies) can't believe that something as simple as a canned good can sell for 10 times its shelf price on eBay. Yet this is exactly what is happening. \neBay shows 99 completed sold listings for Texas Pete Chili Sauce in all different configurations from 30 can wrapped flats to single cans. If you know how to sell an item on eBay, there are a few ways to cash in on this discontinued item. First, check local grocery stores on both the regular aisle and the clearance section. Even at regular price, this is a good flip. (Check expiration dates - expired food cannot be sold on eBay.) \nCheck closeout stores like Big Lots. Grocery stores often sell their discontinued stock to closeout stores who in turn sell the product for a deep discount. Again, check expiration dates to make sure the item has 1-2 months left before expiration. \nFor maximum profit, price high and hold until other sellers run out. All research indicates this product is going away forever. As the supply decreases, prices will increase. If expiration dates allow, hold and wait to be one of the last sellers with the product. The sky is the limit on eBay. Discontinued items can be a gold mine on eBay. This is one place that knowledge is power and money in your pocket.
