This is “a full two weeks earlier than last year,” the company boasted in an email sent this morning. \nIn other words, it’s official — Christmas creep now starts in August. \nMolly Blakeman, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said that the company knows that not all customers are ready to do their holiday shopping this early in the year, but some are — and the early layaway program will help them. \nWhat’s more, they’re not the only retailer who starts thinking about Christmas when it’s still 90 degrees out. In 2013, Kmart SHLD, +1.37% launched a holiday commercial just a few days after Labor Day. And Hobby Lobby begins selling Christmas decorations in May . \nThis, we have no doubt, is going to dismay many Americans. More than seven in 10 Americans say they are either “annoyed” or “very annoyed” when they see holiday items in stores before Halloween, a survey by data firm RichRelevance found. \nAnd while some shoppers may not be ready to think about decking the halls when they’re still on summer break, some people — roughly one in 10 Americans -- are all about the Christmas Creep, saying they either “like” or “love” when retailers load up the shelves with holiday items before Halloween. And layaway plans do help lots of consumers — particularly those who have poor credit or little money -- get the items they want for the holidays.
