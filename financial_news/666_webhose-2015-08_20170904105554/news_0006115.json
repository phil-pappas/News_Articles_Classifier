With an investment return of just 1.4% in the first half of 2015, its recent performance has been underperforming its peers. \nBut management seems to be finally getting their act together. It has engaged with an activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors to tackle its bloated cost structure and improve its performance by increasing its share of equity investments. \nThe trust could take action to shrink its discount, by buying back shares in itself on the open market to reduce the discount in its shares. It did just that in 2011, when it bought back some £350 million worth of its own shares. With pressure from an activist investor, a return to share buybacks is quite likely. \nMercantile Investment Trust (LSE: MRC) is a UK-focused equity investment trust that has a long history of outperforming the sector. In the past year alone, the investment trust delivered a 20.9% after fees return on its NAV, which compares favourably to the peer average of 17.0% and the FTSE All Share total return of 5.0%. With an ongoing annual charge of just 0.50%, its 11.2% discount seems unjustified. \nTempleton Emerging Markets Inv estment Trust (LSE: TEM) is one of the most popular emerging market investment trusts on the market, with assets under management totalling £1.63 billion. Unfortunately, its heavy exposure to China and Brazil has meant its investment performance has lagged its peer average in recent years. \nCaledonia Investments (LSE: CLDN) has a significant proportion of its assets in private unquoted companies through direct holdings and private equity funds. Because of its heavy exposures to the UK, the rest of Europe and Asia, its investment performance has lagged the sector average. On top of this, it has a very high ongoing annual management charge of 2.61%. \nFidelity China Special Situations (LSE: FCSS) trades at a very substantial discount to its NAV, as the recent volatility in the Chinese equity markets and sell-off in emerging markets has reduced demand for the trust. As volatility settles down in China's equity markets, the trust's discount could narrow to its historical average of around 10%.
