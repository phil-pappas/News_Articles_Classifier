Working from a tropical island is easier than you think By Elizabeth Anderson | Telegraph – 13 minutes ago -0.03 \nMore and more people are swapping office blocks for beach views \nIt’s something many of us have dreamed about giving up the weary commute and working far away on a tropical island. \nBut for more and more people, that dream is becoming a reality. Under UK law, all employees have the right to request flexible working, and companies are increasingly putting measures in place to allow their employees to work remotely. \nFinding opportunities can be tough, but 27-year-old Greg Caplan is one entrepreneur hoping to make it easier for people who are keen to work abroad, yet daunted about the logistics and what it would involve. \nHis company, Remote Year, brings together a community of 75 professionals and freelancers from across the world. Over a year-long programme, the team is travelling across South America, Europe and Asia, spending a month in 12 different countries. \nAll participants in the programme are currently employed in jobs they are able to do remotely, and Remote Year organises a travel itinerary and communal workspaces. Americans make up half the group, but there are also people from Brazil, New Zealand and various European countries. \nCaplan, who previously worked for companies including Groupon (NasdaqGS: GRPN - news ) , says many people are put off by the idea of travelling solo. “Travelling and working is very do-able but the hard part is feeling part of a community. Many people don’t want to do it alone.” \nHe says more than 25,000 people applied for the 75 places in this year’s intake. The group is currently in Cavtat, Croatia, after starting the tour in Prague last month. Applications to join next year’s scheme have just opened. \nLindsay Daniels, who works in communications, applied to the programme because she regretted not travelling after studying. The 27-year-old American, who was previously based in San Francisco, persuaded her employer, technology firm Polycom (NasdaqGS: PLCM - news ) , that she could still do her job away from the office. \n“My focus is my job - I love the company I work for. But at the same time I’ve always wanted to travel. I never got the chance after college. Having an employee that’s travelling across the world is an unusual situation, even for a company like Polycom that already allows its employees to work remotely. However, they were incredibly supportive when I asked them.” \nRemote Year charges successful applicants an initial payment of $3,000 (£1,924), plus a monthly fee of $2,000, which covers all travel between destinations, accommodation, workspace with Wi-Fi, and any planned events and activities. \nDaniels says this is cheaper than living in San Francisco, where rents are high. Although she has had to pay extra for visas and vaccinations, she no longer pays other bills such as car insurance and utility bills. \n\"Overall I'm spending less money. I like the community aspect that Remote Year brings, especially because I'm not an experienced traveller.\" \n• The 13 best places in the world to work remotely \nAs property prices continue to spiral, working abroad has become even more tempting to people whose only office equipment is their laptop. According to a survey by technology jobs website Dice, 72pc of UK-based tech professionals would consider an international move if the right opportunity came along. \nJordan Sale, director of marketing at Fundrise, a Washington DC-based property investment platform, was planning to take an extended holiday when she spotted the Remote Year opportunity. \n\"I had been working at Fundrise for a year and a half, and was nervous about bringing it up to my employers. We're a small team but growing really quickly. However, I outlined every element of my job and how it was possible to do everything remotely, then pitched it to my boss, and he said yes. He really understood the value of travel and that I might leave if the urge became too great.\" \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) adds that having a representative abroad has been beneficial to the company, which is expanding its overseas operations. Despite the time differences, Sale says she tends to keep US hours - this means that in Europe she starts work about 1pm, working through until the evening. \n\"I thought a lot about the out of sight, out of mind theory. But developments in technology means it's hard to be forgotten. I schedule weekly calls and always come prepared with questions. I speak to my team all the time on email or on chat,\" she says. \"You need to be motivated and self-driven, and these are important skills to develop.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T11:27:06.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
