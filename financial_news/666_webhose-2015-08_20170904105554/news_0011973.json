Photo: Suppled\nA market stall is often the first stepping-stone on the road to business success. It's a make or break experience for entrepreneurs wanting to test the future of their whiz-bang product.\nPositive customer feedback and healthy sales at a market can be enough to turn a side business into a flourishing start-up.\nGrab their attention by creating a visually exciting and shareable stall.\nFinders Keepers co-founder Sarah Thornton. Here's how to make the most of your market stall:\nBrooke Johnston and Sarah Thornton: Social media is everything. Photo: Supplied\n1. Stand out\nAdvertisement Shoppers aren't the only ones you need to impress at a market. Buyers from retail outlets are also on the lookout for new concepts, so it's important to stand out from the crowd.\nFounders of the popular Finders Keepers markets Sarah Thornton and Brooke Johnston say a market stall that's visually appealing naturally attracts more customers.\"Grab their attention by creating a visually exciting, and most importantly a shareable stall,\" says Thornton.\n\"Include signage with your social media details and official hashtags​ to take advantage of the increased following you'll get at the event.\"\nYour stall should have a clear theme and brand. Visit local markets, trade fairs and galleries for inspiration.\nEnsure you refresh your stall's look each time you visit a market, Thornton adds.\n\"If people notice your stall looking the same, they'll assume the products are the same,\" she says.\n\"No one likes to overhear, 'Yeah I've seen that stuff before' when they've got new products that are being dismissed, purely because of the layout.\"\n2. Signage\nAt any market your wares will be in competition with other those at others stalls. Get on the front foot with signage that sums up what you're selling, advises Kate Vandermeer​ and David \"Noonie\" Nunez​ from market traders The SuperCool.\n\"Ensure you have very clear and professional signage so that customers remember and recognise your brand name,\" says Vandermeer​.\n\"Word of mouth is so important and at markets, it's busy and there's lots of brand competition so it's important to delineate your brand from the neighbours.\"\n3. Merchandising\nMarkets are crowded places where buyers like to take everything in as they walk by. So put yourself in the shoes of your customers when you set up your space.\n\"It should be welcoming, attractive and most importantly it should exhibit your products in the best possible way,\" says Johnston from Finders Keepers.\n\"If your items are clearly visible, and your stall is full, but not overflowing, that should be just right.\"\nPlace your most striking pieces at eye level and try to arrange your other products so that you have a combination of display heights. Avoid setting up your products so people can only look straight down at your table. This means only the people at the front of your stall will see your pieces during busy times.\nBring your stall to life by going above and beyond, says Johnston. Use props, furniture or a look-book​ to bring your designs to life.\n4. Product mix\nEveryone is looking for a bargain at the market. Stallholders need to reel in the bargain-hunters and convert their cash into a good profit.\nThink about offering multiple price points to attract a range of people and more importantly, bring in the spenders.\nThornton and Johnston suggest three main categories of price points: bread and butter items at low prices, middle range for unique but affordable items and highlight or investment pieces at the most expensive end.\nBread and butter products tempt your customers, while items in the middle range are likely to make the bulk of the income. Investment pieces are like the icing on the cake.\n5. Social media\nJust like any business, your stall needs to connect with customers. Social media is the easiest way to do this, says Vandermeer​.\n\"Make sure you're on Instagram​, Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest,\" she says. \"Having a social media connection for your customers is as important as a website, if not more so these days.\n\"Customers need to be reminded as to where you are, what you're selling and social media is an important marketing tool that's free and easy.\"\nMore traditional ways of connection suit some customers. So make sure you have business cards at hand and if you have an email newsletter, make sure you have a sign-up sheet at your stall.\nForge as many connections as you can and make the most of the face-to-face feedback.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:24:04.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
