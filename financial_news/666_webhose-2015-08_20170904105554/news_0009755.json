AP by Marc Jones Wall Street opened sharply higher on Wednesday after data showed US orders for durable goods rose more than expected in July.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 393.31 points, or 2.51 per cent, to 16,059.75, the S&P 500 gained 41.58 points, or 2.23 per cent, to 1,909.19 and the Nasdaq composite added 132.58 points, or 2.94 per cent, to 4,639.07.\nEurope also staged a fight-back on Wednesday, as traders tried to shake off fears about China's slowing economy and stocks collapse that is wreaking havoc in global markets.\nEurope's main bourses, which had surged on Tuesday after China cut interest rates , clawed their way back towards positive territory having been down as much as 2 per cent earlier.\nChina's key share indexes had attempted to move higher several times during Asian trading only to be slapped back by waves of selling, reflecting investors' views that much more support was needed from the government and the central bank.\nDespite a late struggle, the CSI300 index closed down 0.6 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index ended off 1.3 per cent for fifth straight day in the red as Beijing also dished out another round of trading bans .\nCopper, often considered a proxy for Chinese and global economic activity because of its extensive use, also led another broad-based slide in industrial metals as a 2.5 per cent tumble left it back near six-year lows.\n\"The root of this is concern that growth in China may be a lot lower than what the market had thought,\" said Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management in Zurich.\n \"They made further announcements yesterday but the market does not appear fully convinced, it has not distracted people from the fears about the economy.\"\nBut there was some signs of calm beginning to return.\nThe CBOE Market Volatility Index was still elevated at 36, indicating significant uncertainty, but the \"fear index\" as it is known was well below the previous day's 6-1/2 year peak of 53.3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:04:10.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
