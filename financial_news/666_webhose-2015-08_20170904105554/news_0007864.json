The Miami-based foundation announced the 2015 finalists Monday. \nThe 27 ideas were selected from 358 submissions. Many of the proposals aim to lift local businesses, create more public space along corridor, boost community engagement and celebrate the corridor’s diversity through art. \nThis year several greening projects along the line connecting the downtowns of St. Paul and Minneapolis are vying for money — including a parklet that would replace a street parking spot downtown, a new plaza for the Rondo neighborhood in the parking lot at Johnny Baby’s bar, and planning for a new park near Lexington Parkway. \nA report last summer by the Trust for Public Land found that the 11-mile Green Line corridor is 4.7 percent park land, or 10 acres per 1,000 residents. The report noted St. Paul’s Midway area was underserved. The Trust for Public Land was one of the 27 finalists with its idea to work with the community near the Lexington Parkway station to develop concepts for a new park. \nThe emphasis on green space shows “the importance of public life and creating these places that encourage people to get out of their houses and get out of their cars and interact with people in public space,” said George Abbott, interim program director for the foundation in St. Paul. \nIn downtown, the St. Paul Riverfront Corp. was a finalist for money to temporarily demonstrate elements of the proposed River Balcony project — a pedestrian connection along the Mississippi River bluff between the Union Depot and the Science Museum of Minnesota. Though elements of the path are in place or could be built as part of the Custom House apartment project at 180 Kellogg Ave. E., the funds would allow project partners to test ideas temporarily, said Tim Griffin, director of urban design for the St. Paul Riverfront Corp. \nGriffin said a main driver of the project is the Exeter Group’s planned renovation of the former 750,000-square-foot post office building into the Custom House, which includes a portion of the river connection. With more downtown residents, the city will need parks and green space for them, he added. \n“This will become like the High Line in New York,” Griffin said. “It will become a park for those downtown residents.” The River Balcony would be easily accessible via light rail at the either the Union Depot or Central Station. \nApplicants in this year’s challenge also had to demonstrate a connection to the Green Line, Abbott said. \nWinners of the contest, who will share $500,000, will be selected this fall after a more detailed application-review process. \nThe open challenge format is important to the foundation because it allows the community to collect ideas from new sources that they might not otherwise find, Abbott said. The foundation is offering feedback to finalists before the updated proposals are due to help them fully develop ideas, he said. \nThe full list of finalists is available on the Green Line Challenge website . \nLike this article?
