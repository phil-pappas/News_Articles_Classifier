Global banking and investor services, which incorporates capital markets activities and asset management, contributed around 40 percent of the bank's revenues. \nIn Russia, where SogGen's Rosbank business has been affected by the country's weak economy, it cut losses to 45 million euros from 91 million in the first quarter. \nSocGen (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) continued to cut costs in its Russian operations and shed additional 1,200 employees over the second quarter. \nRevenue from French retail banking rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier as the economy picked up speed. \n\"SocGen results are very good, which allayed concerns over solvency and the group's exposure to Russia,\" analysts at Natixis (Paris: FR0000120685 - news ) said in a note. \nThe bank's shares were up more than 8 percent at 48.24 euros by 0910 GMT, on track for the biggest one-day gain in two years and touching their highest level in over four years. \nThe bank said it expected its common equity tier 1, a measure of balance sheet strength, of close to 11 percent by the end of 2016. \nIt previously had a target of at least 10 percent but had already reached it, with the level hitting 10.4 percent at the end of the second quarter. \nThe bank plans to carve a further 850 million euros ($925 million) in savings out of its costs by the end of 2017 in addition to the 900 million it is on course to make by the end of this year. \nSocGen reported second-quarter net income of 1.351 billion euros on revenue of 6.869 billion, boosted by a surge in equities trading volumes. This beat analysts' average forecasts for net income of 969 million and revenue of 6.125 billion . \nIt benefited from a 312 million euro positive impact from the revaluation of financial liabilities but took a 200 million charge for potential litigation, bringing total legal provisions to 1.3 billion.
