The Dow was confirmed to be in a correction on Friday. \nFutures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (Other OTC: HGSXF - news ) were down 2.1 percent, suggesting that more bleeding may be in store when trading begins again in Asia. \nIn a sign the U.S. market may begin to see some stabilization on Tuesday, U.S. stock futures opened for the overnight session to the upside. S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.5 percent, while Nasdaq e-minis were up 0.4 percent and Dow e-minis were up 0.5 percent. \nThe CBOE Volatility index, or VIX - popularly known as the \"fear index\" - briefly jumped as much as 90 percent to 53.29, its highest since January 2009. \nPreliminary data from BATS Global Markets show 1,287 trading halts on U.S. stock exchanges on Monday due to excessive volatility or tripping of circuit breakers, far more than usual. \nThe S&P 500 index posted 187 new 52-week lows and just two highs, while the Nasdaq recorded 613 new lows and eight highs. \n\"Emotions got the best of investors,\" said Philip Blancato, chief executive at Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) York. \"The conjecture that the Chinese economy can propel the U.S. economy into recession is ridiculous, when it's twice the size of the Chinese economy and is consumer-based.\" \nAll of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with energy losing 5.18 percent. \nU.S. oil prices tumbled about 6 percent to fresh 6-1/2-year lows, while London copper and aluminum futures hit their lowest since 2009. \nExxon and Chevron (Swiss: CVX.SW - news ) each fell more than 4.7 percent. U.S. oil and gas companies have already lost about $310 billion of market value so far this year. \nThe dollar index was down 1.72 percent. It fell more than 2 percent earlier to a seven-month low as the perceived probability of a U.S. interest rate hike in September receded. \nTraders now see a 24 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will increase rates in September, down from 30 percent late on Friday and 46 percent a week earlier, according to data from inter-dealer money broker Tullett Prebon (LSE: TLPR.L - news ) . \nWall Street's selloff shows investors are becoming increasingly nervous about paying high prices for stocks at a time of minimal earnings growth, tumbling energy prices and uncertainty around a Fed rate hike. \nAlibaba lost 3.49 percent to $65.80, below its IPO price of $68, making it the second high-profile tech company to fall below its IPO price in the past week after Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) . \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE 3,064 to 131. On the Nasdaq, 2,632 issues fell and 281 advanced. \nVolume was heavy, with about 14.0 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, double the 7.0 billion average this month, according to BATS Global Markets.
