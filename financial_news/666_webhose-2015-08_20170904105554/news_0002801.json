August 13, 2015 \nBut not the power you’re thinking of. No, then again, I like that too! \nBut no I’m talking about the Starz drama, Power. \nHere’s the lowdown on the show: \nIt appears James “Ghost” St. Patrick has it all — a drop-dead gorgeous wife, a stunning Manhattan penthouse, and the power and success that come with owning hot new nightclub Truth. But a closer look reveals a man living a double life. \nWhen Ghost isn’t tending to his Fortune 500 business, he’s catering to clients of another operation: a drug empire that serves only the rich and influential. While loyal sidekick Tommy protects the cash-cow narcotics venture at all costs, Ghost’s new reality is using Truth as more than a front to launder money. \nIt’s a way out of the drug game and into a legitimate life with his family, even if everything he loves becomes unknowingly threatened. \nI catch it weekly on Starz and I watch every episode at least 4 times. So I’m a little addicted. It replaced Sons of Anarchy and Empire. For now. \nSo A few weeks ago I caught Naturi Nauthton on Essence and they brought up a tricky subject. \nShould A Married Woman Have Her Own Money? \n\nWhat do you think? Should a married woman have her own stash? \nMy thoughts – I don’t agree with hiding money from your husband. But I think every adult woman should have her own bank account with her own money. And your husband should know about it. \nI don’t agree with depending solely on another person as an adult to take care of my financial well being. Too much can and does go wrong in those scenarios and I’d rather know how to take care of myself financially than depend completely on someone else to do that for me. \nIf he gets up one morning and declares that it’s over and you have no credit, no bank account and haven’t had a job in 10 years – then what? \nSo it’s more about independence than it is hiding money to be deceitful. \nI think that changes the game completely. Not only are you being honest that it’s there, but you’re not carrying around this secret stash “just in case”. \nHe should know, “just in case” you have your own stash, whether it’s because he acts up, he leaves or he passes away. You’ve covered all bases. \nAnd I don’t think men should feel threatened about it. They should want to know that regardless of what they do, she’s already planned on being OK financially in any event. They should too! I wouldn’t want my husband to stick with me because I have a paycheck and he doesn’t. \nOn the surface we can say “but it means she doesn’t trust him”… \nBut what it’s really about is – life happens and/or people change. A man should never want a woman whose only reason to stay is finances. And a woman should never put herself in the position to be forced to make decisions based on her bank account vs what’s best for her. One example would be a woman staying in an abusive relationship because she has no financial means to leave and make it on her own. \nWhen a man asks for a prenup, most applaud him for protecting his assets but a woman is more likely to be scorned for having a stash of cash that protects her financially should she need to make the jump. \nThoughts?
