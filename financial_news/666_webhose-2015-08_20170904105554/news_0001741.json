I kept it under wraps, and now the album is finished,\" he said. \nN.W.A -- which stands for Niggaz Wit Attitude -- shocked much of white America in the late 1980s with its unapologetic takes on street life through songs such as \"Fuck Tha Police.\" \nFrom his humble upbringing, Dr. Dre went on to develop headphones and other audio products under the name Beats Electronics, which Apple bought last year for $3.2 billion. \nForbes this year estimated his net worth at $700 million. \nWhile focusing on the music business, Dr. Dre has not released a solo studio album since \"2001,\" which despite its name was released in late 1999. \nFor years he has been reported to be working on an album called \"Detox,\" but he said on his radio show that he had abandoned it. \n\"This is something you're not going to hear many artists say. The reason 'Detox' didn't come out was because I didn't like it. It wasn't good,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T19:22:46.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
