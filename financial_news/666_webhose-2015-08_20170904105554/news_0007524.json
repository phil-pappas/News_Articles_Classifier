Using colourful language, as Mr Wingate has done, does not turn weak points into strong ones, and does him and his company no credit.” \nGatwick did not return a call requesting comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T21:49:12.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
