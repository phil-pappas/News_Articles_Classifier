The act relates to public officers. \nIn Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report, entitled Derailed, she found evidence of widespread maladministration and impropriety in the awarding of tenders worth R2.8 billion at Prasa. \nMontana was widely implicated in the report. \nIn 2012, the SA Transport and Allied Workers' Union reported allegations of corruption and tender irregularities at Prasa to the public protector. \nMontana has said he will go to court to challenge Madonsela's report. \nMadonsela said she was disappointed about Montana's decision to challenge her findings in court. \nMadonsela said Montana wrote to her after she released her provisional report. He said he was happy with the report and undertook to comply with the findings and remedial action. \nMaimane claimed on Thursday that Montana used Prasa finances like it was his \"personal piggy bank\" and cancelled and rewarded tenders on a whim, which contravened laws and regulations. \n\"Mr Montana therefore directly allowed and, in fact, facilitated maladministration, corruption, conflicts of interest and financial mismanagement on a large scale,\" he said. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T10:21:16.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
