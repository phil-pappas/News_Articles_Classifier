Photo: Reuters\nNegotiators from the US and 11 Asia-Pacific countries are unlikely to sign off on a free-trade agreement after a four-day meeting in Hawaii, according to a person briefed on the talks.\nTrade ministers hashing out the details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership had sought to wrap up a deal in principle on Friday. They've been unable to resolve differences on automobile and dairy issues, the person said, requesting anonymity because the meeting hasn't concluded.\nNegotiators, who will return to their home countries instead of continuing discussions in Hawaii, all but completed work in areas such as intellectual property and state-owned companies, creating confidence that they can work out the remaining issues soon, the person said.\nAustralian Trade Minister Andrew Robb.
