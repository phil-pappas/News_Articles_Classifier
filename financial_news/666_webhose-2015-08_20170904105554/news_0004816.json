Investors currently expect it to stay there until next February or March, a prediction which was essentially endorsed by the Bank, whose job it is to keep inflation as close as possible to 2%. \n\"Were Bank Rate to follow the gently rising path implied by market yields, the Committee judges that demand growth would be sufficient to return inflation to the target within two years,\" the minutes said. \nThe Bank’s signal that rates will soon increase comes despite its prediction that inflation will remain close to zero for the next few months – and will stay lower for longer than expected, due in part to falling oil prices. It also comes in spite of a 3.5% rise in the value of the pound since its last set of major forecasts in May. \nHowever, the main focus is likely to be on interest rates. Although many economists were expecting two or three, rather than just one, MPC member to vote for higher rates, this is nonetheless the first meeting with a split vote since December. According to the minutes, Mr McCafferty thought that there were risks “of a more significant overshoot of inflation following its return to the target.” \nThe minutes also said that whatever happens to official Bank rate, mortgage costs are likely to rise soon, with the gap between mortgage rates and official bank rate expected to widen. \nIt said: \"banks’ funding costs, an important influence on mortgage rates, had risen since May and it was possible that mortgage rates would shortly begin to rise.\" \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:14:50.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
