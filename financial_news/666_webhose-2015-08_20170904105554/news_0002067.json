Now, the legendary Italian brand is ready to offer something a bit more mainstream with the 2016 Alfa Romeo Giulia sedan. \nIt's an important vehicle Fiat Chrysler Automobiles —Alfa's parent company — as the company seeks to stake a claim to the American luxury auto market. \nWith this BMW 3-Series sized car, FCA may be able to jump start the revival of the cult brand in America. \nAt first glance, it's immediately clear that FCA spent a lot of time and effort on the new Giulia. According to the company, the sedan was created by a \"Skunkworks of the best engineers, designers, and stylists within the company.\" \nSo what does this mean for the consumer? \nAlthough there will be several versions of the car with varying degrees of hotness, it was the top-of-the-line Quadrifoglio edition that was recently presented to the press in Italy. \n(Alfa Romeo) At the heart of the Giulia Quadrifoglio is a Ferrari-inspired, all-aluminum, turbocharged V6 engine producing a prodigious 510 horsepower. That means the Alfa is good for 0-60mph in just 3.9 seconds — on par with the best BMW's standard-bearing M3 can do. Although the Bimmer does it with considerably less horsepower. \nThe Giulia is built on an all-new, rear-wheel drive platform, upon which a series of new models will be based. For those searching for a truly visceral driving experience, the Alfa's equipped with a performance-oriented sports suspension and a perfect 50/50 front/rear weight distribution. This should make the Quadrifoglio a dream to put through the corners. \n(Alfa Romeo) And then there's the sound. The turbo V6 expels exhaust with flair through the car's quad-pipes. As the engine revs, it snaps, crackles and pops its way to auditory nirvana. Don't believe me? Just listen to the video embedded below. \nOh and then there are the looks. In true Alfa fashion, the new Giulia is stylish and flamboyant, but with a dose of German practicality. It maintains the company's trademark front grille, but the rest of the car is more Teutonic muscle sedan than Italian Autostrada cruiser. \nAlfa Romeo and FCA have yet to announce pricing for the new Giulia as well as the exact timeline for its US arrival. \nStay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T23:00:24.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
