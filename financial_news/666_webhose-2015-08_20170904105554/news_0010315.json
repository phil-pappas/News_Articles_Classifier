Any interference is a significant safety risk. \n\"The other item was a wireless digital audio transmitter and receiver sender that operated on a radio band assigned exclusively for aeronautical use,\" Ms Mudafar said. The device's plug was also deemed unsafe as it didn't comply with New Zealand's safety standards. \nFishpond has received five previous warnings for advertising radio communication equipment that failed to comply with local laws. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T03:54:36.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
