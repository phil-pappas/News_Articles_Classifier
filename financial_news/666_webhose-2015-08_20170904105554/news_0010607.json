But Brilinta has shown additional benefits and AstraZeneca is working to ramp up its use. \nFollowing the success of the PEGASUS trial, the British drugmaker is hoping for U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Food and Drug Administration approval for extended use of Brilinta as early as next week. \nGiving Brilinta to patients who had a heart attack over a year ago could more than double the number of people eligible for the medicine. \nGrowing Brilinta is a top priority for AstraZeneca, which has forecast that annual sales of the drug could reach $3.5 billion by 2023. \nThe new ESC guidelines, announced at the organisation's annual meeting in London, also allow for shortened dual drug use of just three to six months, if patients are at high risk of bleeding, as well as extended use up to 30 months. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T21:09:39.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
