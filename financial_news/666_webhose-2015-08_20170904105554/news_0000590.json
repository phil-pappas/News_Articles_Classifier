Not only because of the difficulty of getting a new or similar job after dismissal, but more because of the seeming lack of fairness to the worker. \nMoreso, when we take into account the fact that the NRZ case has been long standing and heard against the backdrop of employees protesting and sleeping at company premises in search of a fair deal. \nUntil the pending appeals are heard and determined or the government amends the Labour Act to either conform to the judgements or change their import, workers can expect their employers to callously handle labour disputes with threats or actual dismissals. And government will play politics while claiming to respect the doctrine of separation of powers. \nIf there is anything that we can learn from these unfortunate developments, it is that Zimbabwe is now in a full fledged age of state capitalism/ neo-liberalism or as Naomi Klein ably puts it, \"disaster capitalism\". And our courts, by default, are interpreting the law within this ideological ambit. \nThe latter is characterised by the withdrawal of the state from what should be an obligatory role of protecting citizens from the vagaries of the \"free market\". In this there is rampant privatisation of state assets and limitations on the labour rights of workers, especially in times of endemic economic crisis. \nAdd to this a deliberately diminished role of trade unions and unionism and you have a recipe for an undemocratic laissez faire economic framework that benefits the already rich, those that are politically connected to the detriment of a majority poor. \nGovernment will however not own up to such an economic policy. As South African academic Patrick Bond puts it in his analysis of his country's economic policy, our government will \"talk left, walk right\". Cabinet has already discussed the matter and reports show there are some amendments that are going to be made to the Labour Act. The specifics to these amendments are yet be known but it is clear that there are no big ideological questions at play. \nGovernment has no intention of changing its overall \"shock doctrine\" free market economic policy couched on the coattails of state capitalism as derived from the Chinese model. \nIn light of this unfair reality, the ball is firmly in the labour movements' court. It is the struggling Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and its affiliates that has to redefine its agenda in view of the broader disempowering intentions of government. The current period of labour rights activism by default has to come to an end if there are to be countermeasures to the unmitigated state capitalism that we are faced with. \nIt has to walk the talk on its overall economic vision for the country in its own ideological terms. As far as I can remember, this would be a social democratic macroeconomic template where basic rights to services (education, health, transport, water, electricity and employment) and fair labour laws form the backbone of government policy where it seeks to interact with capital. \nIn order to be effective, the labour movement has to return to the source, that is the worker. It has to re-organise its representative capacity from the work floor through to affiliates and touch base with young generations of workers and students. All to be done in an organic fashion with direct organising, knowledge production and internal democratic accountability and contestation. \nThe late 90s solution that had sought to address these challenges via a workers party in the form of the then MDC may still be on the table, but it is no longer as serious an option as it should be. \nNot least because that former workers party has dabbled in so many other alliances and ideological ambiguities, it no longer represents the full interests of workers. \nLabour union leaders have to understand that this basically means they have to go back to the drawing board and redraw their priorities in the struggles against this state capitalist reality. To paraphrase the age old words of the Manifesto of the Communist Party (circa 1848), \"workers of Zimbabwe unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains\". \nTakura Zhangazha writes here in his personal capacity (takura-zhangazha.blogspot.com) Zimbabwe \nPRESIDENT Robert Mugabe could have played both puppet and puppeteer, in the Zanu PF debacle that resulted in the removal … see more » Copyright © 2015 Zimbabwe Standard.
