Petrol, on the other hand, is now selling at È»3.49 pesewas a litre. \nSHELL has already increased its prices but TOTAL and GOIL say they will keep the prices unchanged at the pumps for a while. \nSome of the OMCs told Joy Business that they are prepared to hold prices for now but if the cedi should continue to depreciate, they might be forced to increase prices. \nAt the last review on August 1, some of the OMCs reduced prices, even when all indications pointed to a need for an increment. \nSome analyst are worried that if the trend should continue, some of the OMCs might be forced out of the market because they may not have the necessary shocks to withstand the changes in prices due to the cedis’ performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:36:21.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
