Vegetables I know have matured and are ready to pick are missing in the mornings. I worked so hard on my vegetable garden and this person is treating it as his or her own. The thief only picks enough for the next day or two, but all my best stuff is going.\nHow do I catch this culprit? My only clue -- I only see footprints from one kind of shoe -- looks like the treads of the same runners. -- Mad and Frustrated, Wolseley\nDear Mad: Be a modern-day Sherlock. Buy a cheap hidden security videocam to catch your garden thief by day, plus put in motion sensors at night. Neighbours may also have an idea who it is, but don't know you well enough to come over. So cheerfully go door-knocking and ask. Volunteer to keep an eye out for them, too. They may all be losing fresh-grown produce out of their gardens and you can form an alliance to make this a very unappealing neighbourhood for raiding. If there are any readers with suggestions, please write in.\nDear Miss Lonelyhearts: My husband works the night shift and comes home at 8 a.m. expecting to sleep. The kids are out of school and I'm a teacher off work for the summer. The last month has gone badly. I can't keep the children quiet except to put them on brain-numbing computers. I don't have a lot of money to put them in courses. Kids make lots of noise naturally when they play in the yard. I just can't keep them quiet until 4 p.m. every day.\nMy husband is a good guy, but he's looking really ragged and he's getting short with me and coming downstairs to bawl out the kids like a big angry bear and makes them cry. -- Help! Fort Garry\nDear Help: Poor kids, poor you and poor papa bear. Stop the problem at the source. Buy cheap black-out drapes -- dark-coloured heavy corduroy stapled flat to the window works like charm. Then you need soft, good-quality earplugs so he doesn't hear a thing. Take everything out of the bedroom you will need so you're not tip-toeing around him during the day (light-sleeping people can feel you there, and it's annoying). Hand him something light to eat when he gets home, such as a toasted bagel and cream cheese, so his empty stomach is not waking him. Then put a cup of double-strength chamomile tea by the bed that he can glug down cold if he wakes up too early and needs to relax.\nWhen he wakes up, hand him a glass of orange juice and encourage him to go for a run. That wakes up your body like nothing else, and puts a person back in a good mood.\nThis method was suggested to me by famous Crescentwood butcher and wise man Bill Kerr, who advised the neighbourhood on everything. I worked two summers on a CBC Radio news-reading shift from 4 a.m. to noon, and that was how I survived -- and even enjoyed activities in the early evenings. Go out and have fun with the kids, or even better, with a friend and her kids as well.

Let them stay up past their regular bedtime to see him more. You can dial bedtime back down a week before school starts. You need to have a romantic life with papa bear too, so get a sitter here and there and go out for dinner on a patio or catch a movie and hold his hand, not just the popcorn.\nPlease send your questions and comments to lovecoach@hotmail.com or Miss Lonelyhearts c/o the Winnipeg Free Press, 1355 Mountain Ave., Winnipeg, MB, R2X 3B6", "external_links": ["http://familydaysout.com/kids-things-to-do-canada/winnipeg/mb"], "published": "2015-08-07T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T12:19:35.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
