Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Has there been a more delicious leak of the political machine than Wednesday's flawlessly timed leak of talking points from the Prime Minister's office to ministers on how to answer questions about cabinet leaks?\nThat the briefing notes, leaked only minutes after Abbott foot soldier Eric Abetz labelled leaking colleagues as \"gutless\", only added to the satire.\n\"In contrast to the experiences of Rudd and Gillard governments, our cabinet is functioning exceptionally well,\" ministers were advised to reply in the face of awkward questions about leaks, cabinet's wafer-thin agenda and patchy processes.\n\"Julia Gillard sent her bodyguard to NSW meetings. Our cabinet processes are more effective and productive than Labor's chaos,\" was another helpful line for ministers.\nSerendipitous: briefing notes on how to deal with cabinet leaks ... doh, leaked! Rod Clement But why limit comparisons to governments? In contrast to the experiences of the Australian cricket team and the Wallabies, our government is functioning extremely well.\nThe problem with political talking points is that the protagonists can appear somewhat myopic in hindsight.\nTalking points through history Consider these speaking points through history.\n Treasurer Joe Hockey suggested Labor was in league with the very worst sort of people – a fringe group of environmental lawyers. Andrew Meares \"Our new religion is going exceptionally well and Jesus has my unqualified support\", Judas Iscariot briefing notes, circa 33AD.\n\"I'm right behind Caesar's leadership\", Brutus, Rome, 44 AD.\n\"Give me a woman who loves beer and I will conquer the world\", Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, 1918.\n\"There's more chance of me becoming the full-forward for the Dogs (Western Bulldogs AFL team) than there is any chance of a change in the Labor party\", Julia Gillard speaking notes. May 2010.\nGiven the high hilarity quotient on this week's Coalition leak, Labor leader Bill Shorten kicked off question time by asking Prime Minister Tony Abbott to confirm that his cabinet was indeed \"functioning exceptionally well\".\n'Smirking phony' No surprises that Abbott ignored his office's own advice on killer political lines, instead taking a leaf from Labor's own hallowed talking points and echoing a line or two of Gillard's famous misogyny speech.\n\"What I'm not going to do is accept lectures on cabinet solidarity from a Leader of the Opposition who backstabbed two prime ministers,\" Abbott railed.\nIn fact he was proud of his cabinet and its decision to help 100 million people in India by enabling the $20 billion investment in Adani Carmichael coal mine in Queensland to go ahead , unlike you-know-who: Shorten, \"that smirking phony over there, that assassin, the two-time Sussex Street assassin\".\nNow this was a talking point to savour – Labor hates jobs and the overseas hordes, the Coalition helps the poverty-stricken millions in India – and Abbott ministers adopted the line with gusto.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey suggested Labor was in league with the very worst sort of people – a fringe group of environmental lawyers – to derail poverty-leavening coal mines and would stop \"10,000 new jobs being created in Australia and stop the provision of enough energy to power the lives of 100 million impoverished Indians for up to 90 years\".\nForget cabinet leaks, Shorten is a danger to democracy.\n\"Twice, this Leader of the Opposition led the Sussex Street death squads to politically assassinate two PMs and then he was caught out telling lies about it,\" Abbott said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-08-19T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:19:21.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
