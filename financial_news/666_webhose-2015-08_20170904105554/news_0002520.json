Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg Many online trading firms look at the UK as the golden standard, wishing to display to both their clients and competitors a London office address and British phone numbers, even if most of the operation is done abroad. London has the largest GDP of any city in Europe and currently rivals New York as the world’s leading financial center. Its major financial district, City of London is the epicenter, hosting the headquarters of major global banks and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) one of the oldest and most trusted financial institutions in the world. One of the major reasons that the UK is an important hub for the financial industry is because the LSE lists some of the most influential retail trading companies in the world.

In our latest Quarterly Trading Industry Report (QIR) we have a look at what makes the UK such a desired destination while examining the underlying realities of the market. The research covers the national economic situation, the tax structure, regulation regimes and other crucial aspects to consider if a firm wishes to establish a presence in the country. Additionally, a spotlight is focused on the online gaming industry that has many parallels to financial trading in the UK, where forex is sometimes referred to as Spread Betting and binary options regulation has not yet switched from gambling to financial .
