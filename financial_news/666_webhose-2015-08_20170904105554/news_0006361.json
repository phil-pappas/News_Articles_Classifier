Bullard, who has long called for tightening, was Quote: d in a Wall Street Journal report as saying the latest U.S. growth data boosts the case for a hike in September.\nHis comments helped the dollar pare losses late into the U.S. session on Friday. Yet U.S. Treasury yields still hovered near troughs hit on Friday, suggesting some doubts remained about the timing of a Fed hike.\nThe dollar was up 0.2 percent against the yen at 124.17 yen.\nThe Australian dollar was lower at $0.7290, hurt by an official survey that showed growth at China's big manufacturing companies unexpectedly stalled in July as demand at home and abroad weakened. The Aussie is often used as a liquid proxy for China plays.
