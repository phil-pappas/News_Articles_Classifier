Photo courtesy of blog.scottsmarketplace.com used with permission \nThe explosion of online review sites are often the go to source for many people when sussing out information about a particular business. \nEven if one doesn't necessarily care about web reviews, when one search a particular business, reviews often come up on page one. But how does one know which reviews are legit? Business is cut throat and competitors often trash one another. Furthermore there are others who are paid by a business or service to write a glowing review despite never setting foot in the door or ever having any prior contact them. \nFirst rule of thumb is to to take with a grain of salt all one star and all five star reviews. Frankly dismiss them, even though some might be authentic.The second rule is to eliminate all vague words, like nice, good, pleasant, bad, poor, etc.. \nRegarding the first rule look for in between ratings between two and four stars. The second rule has anther test. For example if reading a restaurant review and the person has submitted a review where they say, the food was 'good' the service 'excellent', etc.. without going into specific menu items, ambience, location, size, etc..then again move on. \nSome review sites claim they use a sophisticated proprietary algorithm to weed out phony reviews, but even this mathematical formula isn't an exact science. Other review sites don't filter out any reviews. \nSome businesses are now turning the tables and rating customers such as Uber while others have launched litigation against individuals for posting negative reviews claiming defamation. There is a cottage industry promoting that they can cleanup one's online reputation by removing bad press or at the very least moving those bad reviews further down in search engine rankings, making them less visible. \nTherefore when doing research about a business or service don't overvalue these reviews as anything but very subjective, to say the least and probably be skeptical of them entirely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:22:32.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
