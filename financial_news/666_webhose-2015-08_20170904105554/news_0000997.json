Joe Armao by Trevor Hoey When Orica's new managing director, Alberto Calderon, handed down his findings after undertaking a thorough analysis of Orica's businesses, it was a bitter pill to swallow as he flagged a non-cash impairment charge in the vicinity of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2015.\nHowever, Calderon was merely meeting the request for much improved transparency and from an operational perspective, initiatives such as re-establishing the ground support division as a separate business unit makes sense given it is essentially a mining services operation with vastly different drivers compared with the group's ammonium nitrate assets.\nNot surprisingly, the most substantial anticipated impairment relates to the ground support business, which Calderon expects to be between $730 million and $870 million. With regards to the ammonium nitrate business, the Indonesian Bontang asset came under the microscope and this area of the group's operation is expected to face impairment charges in a range between $500 million and $600 million.\nWhile there is no getting around the fact that shareholders were disappointed, this recent review demonstrates Calderon's commitment to revitalising the business and transforming it into a much more efficient enterprise.\nOrica's shares fell from $18.83 on the day prior to the announcement to close at $15.64 under record volumes for the past 12 months. However, there was a bounce on Monday and perhaps this indicates long-term investors see the sell-down as a buying opportunity.\nAnalysts at Citi have maintained a buy recommendation with a 12-month price target of $22.00. The broker highlighted that the new managing director had given good visibility to the drivers of the fiscal 2015 earnings impacts.\nHowever, UBS wasn't impressed, downgrading its 12-month price target from $17.50 to $14.00 while maintaining a sell recommendation. The broker downgraded earnings per share estimates between fiscal years 2015 and 2017 inclusive with 2015-16 slashed by 24.5 per cent.\nTrevor Hoey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:11:05.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
