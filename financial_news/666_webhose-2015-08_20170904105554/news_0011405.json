Cement output grew 0.9 percent between April and June, down from 9.6 percent a year earlier when Modi took office, government data show.\n\"The slowdown in the construction sector is very, very depressing which will have a negative impact on the overall GDP growth numbers,\" said Samantak Das, chief economist at Knight Frank India.\nRating agency Moody's last week cut India's growth forecast to 7 percent for this fiscal year, against the government's target of 8 to 8.5 percent.\nIndia releases its gross domestic product figures for the April-June quarter on Monday.\nHEADING HOME\nThe lack of jobs is already felt in the northern state of Bihar, source of many of the labourers toiling near Delhi.\nIn Patna, the state capital, eight out of 20 labourers contacted by Reuters had this year made the 1,000 km (600 mile) trip back from Delhi because they could not find work - pressuring salaries in a region where wages are already low.\nAccording to brokerage Ambit Capital, rural wages may now be falling after growing 4 percent in the year to March - a far cry from the double-digit annual rises between 2010 and 2014.\n\"Labourers are starving and are ready to work even at lower wages as there are fewer or just no jobs,\" said Navendu Kumar Thakur of the Builders Association of India.\nThe squeeze comes at a bad time for Modi.\nBihar heads to the polls this year, in an election his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party must win to gain seats in the upper house of parliament where he lacks a majority to pass economic reforms.\nHALF-BUILT\nEconomists say that lower interest rates and a government splurge on infrastructure should help revive construction, which contributes a tenth of GDP.\nModi's party also wants to regulate property markets and tie investor money to specific projects to stop developers diverting cash.\nBut the slowdown around Delhi, where unsold inventory is highest, shows no sign of ending.\nNoida, a city of 640,000, has grown rapidly in the last decade, expanding to a point where its middle-class housing complexes meld with Delhi's urban sprawl on one side and villages on the other.\nAround the site where Kumar worked, half-built high-rises dot the skyline. Cranes and diggers stand idle. His former employer, The 3C Company, has cut staff on the 3,000-unit \"Lotus Boulevard\" by more than half, employing some elsewhere.\nSales staff at two sites reported a 30 to 50 percent decline in bookings in the last year.\nReal estate association CREDAI's Rohit Raj Modi estimates more than a million labourers worked in construction at Noida at its peak in 2013, at least double today's number.\nEven when the market recovers, a shift to mechanisation on larger sites would limit demand for workers.\n\"From a labour point of view, the peak is over,\" he said.
