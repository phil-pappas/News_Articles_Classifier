Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger One of the world's biggest investment firms, Aberdeen Asset Management, has cast a shroud over the Australian listed property trust sector at the end of reporting season, warning of a \"looming property price correction\" and urging institutional investors to put their money into unlisted wholesale property trusts instead.\nThe report sub-titled \"When will the sun set on the property market?\" and written by Aberdeen's Australian fixed income team, which oversees $12 billion of investments, identified a number of \"early warning signs\" in the behaviour of A-REITS which it said were in evidence prior to early crises like the GFC, when returns and values plummeted.\nIt said office property was more vulnerable than retail and industrial property to a correction because the spread between cap rates and bond rates – the risk premium – was overstated due to very high incentives, above 30 per cent in capital cities.\nThe report also highlighted the disproportionately large amount of foreign investment into commercial property, which it said created the potential for more volatility in asset prices and warned that pressure from equity analysts was encouraging M&A activity and the acquisition of poorer quality assets simply to boost returns in the short term.\n\"We prefer low geared, wholesale property trusts with supportive liquidity arrangements that encourage long term through-the-cycle, decision making,\" said Amy Green, investment manager at Aberdeen.\nA 'laughable' prediction Darren Steinberg, CEO of the $7.3 billion Dexus Property Group, which owns more office towers than other A-REIT, dismissed the Aberdeen report as \"quite laughable\".\n\"It's poorly researched. They're trying to push unlisted funds,\" Mr Steinberg told the The Australian Financial Review .\nIn its latest full year results , Dexus forecast further cap rate compression of between 25 and 50 basis points over the next 12 months, lifted FFO guidance and said occupancy had increased without the need to use huge incentives.\n \"Capital allocation is global. The same people who are investing in London, Tokyo and Singapore, still see significant value in the Australian market.\"\nHe also pointed to improving market fundamentals \" We've had a strong start to leasing markets in 2015/16 and barring unforseen volatility, we anticipate a very strong year\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-08-26T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:08:29.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
