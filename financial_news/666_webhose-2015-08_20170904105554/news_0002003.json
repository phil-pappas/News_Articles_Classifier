These people are giving their time and sacrifice by doing this most altruistic endeavor. They are on call 24/7 and literally put their lives on the line. \nVolunteer firefighters are sometimes referred to as paid-on-call firefighters due to some compensation they receive. \nWhile volunteer fire fighters are a paid a small hourly wage, they are not in it for the money. So to even consider a 'volunteer' fire fighting as a misnomer because they are paid a little bit of money is not applicable. \nThat said, the contribution they are making to their community by helping people is immeasurable. \nTherefore, while all firefighters whether they work in a paid capacity with a local fire department in a larger urban center, or in a less populated area in a non paid capacity as a volunteer, are helping people in distress. \nBut those who volunteer their time solely to give back to their community have the bigger hoses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T13:44:27.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
