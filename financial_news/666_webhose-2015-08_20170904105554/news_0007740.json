They account for nearly 80 percent of property and casualty premiums.\nProperty and casualty insurers in the Tianjin region typically pass on about 10-15 percent of risks to local and international reinsurers, Fitch said.\nZurich Insurance and Allianz are among the foreign insurers who have received claims stemming from the blasts, which killed more than 100 people and destroyed or damaged thousands of cars at Tianjin, the world's third largest port in terms of total cargo volume.\nHowever, Germany's Allianz has said it did not expect major financial claims from the explosions, which occurred on Aug. 12.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Gould; editing by Thomas Atkins )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:08:21.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
