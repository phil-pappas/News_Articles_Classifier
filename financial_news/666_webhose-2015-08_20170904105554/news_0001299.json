The quality of a school district is a hot topic in some real estate markets – and barely warrants a mention in others.\nLocal schools are an important factor for families with children, according to a new survey by real estate website Trulia, with nearly one in five Americans indicating that their ideal home is located in a great school district. Among parents of children under the age 18, the percentage of homebuyers who want to live in a great school district jumps to 35% versus 12% for those without kids. It pays to brag about your local school district if it’s highly rated, says Trulia chief economist Selma Hepp.\nLooking at homes for sale on its website from June 2014 to June 2015, Hepp analyzed how frequently the word “school” was mentioned in the sales listings in the 100 largest U.S. metros and the frequency of the word “school” was mentioned with a positive adjective such as great, winning, award winning, excellent, good, or best, among others. Hepp also looked at the relationship between listings advertising schools and property prices.\nIn metro areas with the highest share of listings mentioning the local schools, up to three out of 10 listings mention schools. Orange County, Calif., and San Jose, Calif., had listings with the highest mentions of the word “school” with 28% and 25% of listings, respectively, mentioning a school. Orange County and San Jose were also the No. 1 and No. 2 districts where listings mentioned the word school with a positive adjective (6.9% and 4.4% of the time, respectively). Las Vegas listings had the fewest mentions of nearby schools.\n“No one wants a nice home in a town with a bad public school district,” says Jordan Daniel, a real estate broker at Douglas Elliman in East Hampton, N.Y. and advisor to The Expert Institute , a New York-based network of specialists. Many homebuyers won’t want to pay both high taxes and private tuition, if they can avoid it, he says. His own parents bought their home in Long Island because of the school district it was in. “Families are moving into those areas for that reason.”\nSource: Trulia Read: When urban planning turns towns into private country clubs\nWhy are some districts hot for house sales while others are not? “In housing markets where all the schools are equally good, home sellers are less likely to highlight schools in their listing descriptions,” Hepp says. “But in markets like California and Florida where the quality of the schools can vary from being great to awful, schools can be a major selling point for prospective buyers.”\nSchool district quality is more consistent in other areas, like parts of the Northeast, including Connecticut and Massachusetts. And yet schools are not frequently mentioned in real estate listings in those areas. Homebuyers in those markets may not be as concerned with schools when buying a house as they may be with some other amenities, Hepp says, because of the consistent number of good school districts there. Schools are also rarely mentioned in Las Vegas, but for a different reason; that city attracts more retirees and international buyers than parents with school-aged kids.\nSo does the proximity to good school districts influence home prices there? The answer is complex. “Home prices in great school districts are generally higher, however higher prices may be a result of higher-income residents living in those districts,” Hepp says. “The connection is hard to disentangle.” Are schools better because of the higher tax rates, or did the higher income households move to the areas because of better schools? “This answer is still debated among experts,” she adds.\nMany of the country’s best public schools on the U.S. News and World Report annual survey of more than 21,000 public high schools were not included in Trulia’s 100 biggest metro areas. One theory: They are standout schools in their own districts and/or they are not all in Trulia’s 100 largest metro areas. The appropriately named School for the Talented and Gifted in Dallas was ranked No. 1 in the “2015 Best High Schools Rankings.” (Check out the rest of that list here .)\nSource: Trulia Also see: 3 features Americans want in their dream home\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T15:14:47.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
