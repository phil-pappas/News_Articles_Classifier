Food brought in for private consumption is still permitted. \nRussia has complained that some importers are circumventing the ban by illegally slapping on new labels that claim the food was produced in neighbouring ex-Soviet countries. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Russia destroys more tonnes of smuggled Western food AFP \nRussian officials on Friday destroyed hundreds of tonnes of fruit as they pushed on with a controversial drive â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T00:28:36.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
