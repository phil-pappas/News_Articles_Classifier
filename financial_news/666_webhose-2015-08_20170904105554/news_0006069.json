A reading of the sector's stocks rose 1.3 percent after closing on Friday with its largest two-week drop in almost four years on investor concern over the future of media consumption.\n\"The Star Wars news has lent a bid to Disney and that has spilled over into the rest of media space today,\" James said.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.78 points, or 0.39 percent, to 17,545.18, the S&P 500 gained 10.9 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,102.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 43.46 points, or 0.86 percent, to 5,091.70.\nAmong the best performing stocks on the S&P 500 and largest boost to the Nasdaq were those in biotech. The Nasdaq Biotech Index rose 2.1 percent after falling 4.8 percent over the previous two weeks.\nWith 92 percent of the S&P 500 companies having reported results so far, second-quarter earnings are expected to have edged up 1.2 percent, while revenue is expected to have fallen 3.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nTesla rose 4.9 percent to $254.99 after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $465 from $280 and said Tesla was its top pick among U.S. automakers.\nZulily soared 49.1 percent to $18.74 after Liberty Interactive said it would buy the online retailer for $2.4 billion. Liberty was down 1.5 percent at $29.80.\nEstee Lauder fell 6.8 percent to $82.80 after the cosmetics maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales.\nThe S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and 83 new lows.\nAbout 5.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.84 billion daily average for the month to date, according to BATS Global Markets data.
