ETFs have diverted many investors from directly buying and selling certain stocks, leading to less competition for these stocks and increased trading costs for everyone, as measured by the bid-ask spread. That is how Simon Constable describes one of the study’s key findings in The Wall Street Journal.\nAnd “lower benefits from information acquisition” refers to analyst coverage of a stock decreasing as ownership of that stock by ETFs rises. The study’s authors have found that is happening, and they lament that analysts have lower incentives to cover individual stocks. Wall Street’s company-specific research in general has been useful for investors, they say.\nAnother reading of the study comes from the Financial Times, which says the ability of active fund managers to pick winning stocks is being eroded by the ETF industry’s huge growth . That sounds like a potentially vicious circle for active managers. Investors choose passive funds over those run by stock pickers, making life more difficult for the stock pickers and possibly leading to even more money exiting their ailing actively managed funds.\nBut the study already has its skeptics.\nCurrent conditions are “no more or less challenging for active managers” than they have been since 1991, Vanguard’s Jim Rowley told the FT. Rowley is a senior analyst in indexing pioneer Vanguard’s investment strategy group.\nThe study sounds a similar note as a Morningstar researcher did in an April column about a possible “dark side” to Vanguard’s success . And by emphasizing that stocks could be increasingly moving together, the study is repeating one common fear about ETFs .\nA version of the new study dated July 26 has been published on the Social Science Research Network’s website . The study’s authors are from the Arison School of Business in Israel and Stanford University’s and UCLA’s business schools.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1002b57c-3c5c-11e5-8613-07d16aad2152.html#axzz3iPMmyHXj", "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2625975", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-downside-of-etfs-1439172141"], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T20:08:35.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
