Louie Douvis Mr Stevens indicated that finding new drivers for economic growth was crucial given monetary policy has essentially reached its limits.\n\"A stable monetary standard and a strong financial system, while necessary conditions for prosperity, are not sufficient ones. More is needed – and that's why you are here.\"\nGrowth the key The governor lauded the focus on finding ways to spur economic growth, saying it was more than an academic debate and was effectively about ensuring the pie is big enough to help ensure national fairness.\n From left, Australian Financial Review editor in chief Michael Stutchbury with Treasurer Joe Hockey at the reform summit. Edwina Pickles \"Reasonable people get this. They also know, intuitively, that the kind of growth we want won't be delivered just by central bank adjustments to interest rates or short-term fiscal initiatives that bring forward demand from next year, only to have to give it back then.\n\"They are looking for more sustainable sources of growth. They want to see more genuine dynamism in the economy and to feel more confidence about their own future income.\"\nMr Stevens listed key potential reforms measures that support innovation and risk-taking - rather than only financial risk taking, of which he said there was too much.\n\"In that regard, how to minimise adverse effects on work effort, enterprise, capital accumulation and innovation, due to tax or other factors, would be a worthwhile question – accepting, as a condition, that there is an amount of revenue the government must raise to fund the provision of services only the government can supply.\n\"Minimising those adverse effects means a larger economy; more income; more revenue and so on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:05:44.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
