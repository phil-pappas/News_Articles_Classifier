H&T charges a typical 446.9pc annual interest rate for an average one-year loan. \n\"There will always be demand for short-term cash from consumers,\" the pawnshop boss said. \n• Gold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) price fall: there's worse to come \nMr Nichols said the business withdrew from the payday loan market after finding the model employed by Wonga unsustainable. \nH&T has been one of the better performers in the sector after a number of its rivals such as Money Shop and Cheque Centre shut swathes of shops on the back of the slump in gold prices. Last year Albemarle (Stuttgart: AMC.SG - news ) & Bond collapsed into administration after it was forced to melt its own gold reserves to meet financial commitments. \nMr Nichols said that he expected there to be a further retrenchment from his high-street rivals. H&T has closed one shop during the past six months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:04:28.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
