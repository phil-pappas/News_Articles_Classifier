It also relaxed reserve requirements.\nThe monetary easing came after Chinese stock indexes fell more than 7 percent, hitting their lowest levels since December, following their more than 8 percent plunge on Monday. The rate cut brought a relief rally, with U.S. and European shares rebounding sharply. Oil prices also rose.\n\"Markets have reacted positively to easing from China's central bank,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. \"Stronger risk sentiment is helping the dollar against the euro and yen.\"\nAnalysts said, however, that volatility was likely to continue.\nThe U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last up 1.25 percent at 94.505. The dollar was last up 1.1 percent against the safe-haven yen at 119.700 yen, while the euro was last down 1.6 percent against the greenback at $1.14310.\nAnalysts said the PBOC move, which came amid concerns over an economic slowdown in China, increased risk appetite by lending more stability to markets.\n\"Markets have more confidence that policymakers in China are going to try to mitigate any weakness by adding to stimulus,\" said Sireen Harajli, a foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York.\nAnalysts also said data showing U.S. consumer confidence hit a seven-month high in August and new single-family home sales rebounded in July supported the greenback.\nThe dollar has recently come under pressure against major currencies such as the euro and the yen as fears about Chinese growth and a huge selloff in global stock markets have thrown into doubt whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.\nThe concerns over China and Monday's selloff in global markets also pushed up implied volatility in the foreign exchange market, a broad measure of currency swings, to its highest in two years.\nAgainst the Swiss franc, the dollar was last up 1.5 percent at 0.94455 franc. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index was last up 1.4 percent.\n(Reporting by Sam Forgione; Additional reporting by Anirban Nag in London; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Chris Reese )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T22:07:24.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
