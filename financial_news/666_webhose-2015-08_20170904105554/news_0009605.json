It was eliminated in 2008 in a major defeat for then-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and subsequent attempts at reinstating it have failed.\nThis time, the government considers sharing part of the CPMF proceeds with states and municipalities to reduce resistance to the tax in Congress, O Globo said.\nFaced with what is expected to be the worst recession in 25 years, the Brazilian government has been forced to lower its fiscal savings goals because of a sharp plunge in tax revenue.\nBringing back the CPMF would be part of a strategy that includes planned asset sales and spending cuts to achieve a primary surplus target of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2016.
