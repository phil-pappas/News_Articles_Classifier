Slide 1 of 7 Twitter Inc.’s TWTR, -0.50% stock dipped below its IPO price for the first time Thursday, serving as a reminder that going public doesn’t ensure profitability for investors.\nThe Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.52% is on track for its steepest four-day loss in about four years, and technology shares have been hit particularly hard.\nThe broad selloff could deter companies that had been primed to go public after Labor Day, particularly if markets remain unstable. Investors tend to turn away first from untested companies in times of trouble.\nThe selloff in the broader market may carry over to private companies valued at $1 billion or more that may consider going public, said Bill Gurley, general partner at venture-capital firm Benchmark, on Twitter .\n“One might reasonably assume this would have an adverse impact on late stage private market liquidity and valuation. I certainly do,” Gurley tweeted.\nThis could also signal a change in how investors determine what companies to invest in and refocus business priorities, he said.\n“Investors are likely to refocus on business model viability and path to profitability. This will seem like an abrupt sea-change to many,” he tweeted.\nHere is how the shares of companies that recently went public have fared:\nFactSet Slide 2 of 7 1. Fitbit Inc.\nFitbit Inc. FIT, -6.67% soared on its first day of trading back on June 18. Shares of the maker of wearable fitness trackers opened at $31, above the $20 initial public offering price, and ended the day at $29.68. Prices continued climbing, hitting a closing high of $51.64 on Aug. 5. But shares tanked after the company warned it expected lower margins, even as it beat earnings expectations. They fell sharply again on Friday, along with the broader market.\nFitbit shares have fallen 15% in the last month, compared with the S&P 500’s decline of 5%.\nFactSet Slide 3 of 7 2. Etsy Inc.\nEtsy Inc. ETSY, -5.54% had a strong debut on April 16, with shares opening at $30.98 versus its IPO issue price of $16. They closed at $30 that day. But it has been a different story for the crafts site since then.\nIn the past three months, shares of Etsy have fallen 22%, as investors have worried about the company’s high expenses, continued unprofitability and the risk that its sellers leave the platform. The one-month drop has been a steeper 29%.\nShares of Etsy were down 5% Friday.\nFactSet Slide 4 of 7 3. Amplify Snack Brands Inc.\nShares of Amplify Snack Brands BETR, +5.94% have yet to trade at their IPO price of $18.\nShares of the maker of SkinnyPop popcorn — which isn’t a lower-calorie popcorn —debuted at $17 on Aug. 5 and closed at $16.14 that day. They were up sharply Friday, bucking the broader selloff, but remain more than $4 below the issue price.\nFactSet Slide 5 of 7 4. Planet Fitness Inc.\nThis is another stock that didn’t deliver a first-day IPO pop, although it didn’t flop either.\nWhile shares in the operator of a chain of gyms PLNT, -4.41% debuted on Aug. 6 at $14.50, below their $16 IPO price, they clawed back that day to close at the issue price.\nShares set a closing high of $18.68 on Aug. 10. But they have tumbled this week and now trade slightly above the IPO price.\nThe company said in its prospectus that it has $506.4 million in debt, which could hamper its growth.\nFactSet Slide 6 of 7 5.
