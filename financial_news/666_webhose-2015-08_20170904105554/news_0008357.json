In the suburbs and rural areas, developments tend to be focused on first home buyers or empty nesters. They tend to be of higher value, with more time spent on design and offering underground or off-street parking, large living areas and other attractive features, the report says. IBISWorld senior industry analyst Spencer Little says retirement communities also fall into the trend towards lifestyle communities. \"If it is out in a more suburban area they're probably looking at larger rooms, larger buildings and the golf and other types of facilities and services are tacked on as well,\" Mr Little says. It's all about lifestyle in the marketing videos of developers, Urban Taskforce Australia chief executive officer Chris Johnson says. \"It's all about here's where you get the coffee, here's where the child care is, here's where you can walk, you can play, you can meet people. \"I think they're understanding that this is actually a cultural shift that's happening.\" In inner-city areas, IBISWorld says the majority of multi-unit housing developments are likely to be towards the lower end and rental market. But the strongest returns for the industry are expected on large-scale developments of up-market apartment complexes in Sydney and Brisbane, particularly riverside, harbour-side and themed developments. It notes the trend towards high-density residential developments on disused inner-urban tracts or docklands is similar to development trends in European cities.
