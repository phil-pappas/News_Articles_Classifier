Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle An internal debate within the Abbott government about its approach to the national disability insurance scheme has moved from the expenditure review committee to the full cabinet, as Disabilities Minister Mitch Fifield insists the scheme will go ahead as promised.\nMonday night's cabinet meeting saw a further discussion of the NDIS after, as reported in Tuesday's edition of The Australian Financial Review , divisions emerged within the ERC about the scheme.\nDiscussion on the NDIS was one of the few items on Monday night's cabinet agenda which, as the Financial Review reported on Friday, has become increasingly thin in recent weeks.\nThe Financial Review reported on Tuesday that there had been a push to try to slow down the scheme's rollout at the ERC meeting, only weeks before Canberra is due to sign deals with the states on the multibillion-dollar scheme.\nSources now say that Treasurer Joe Hockey was against signing an imminent deal with the NSW government, which would establish the basis on which the scheme would move from a series of trials to a full rollout of the scheme in July next year, that he was opposed by Finance Minister Mathias Cormann and Social Services Minister Scott Morrison, and that the issue was left unresolved by ERC.\nSome sources say that the debate was about the politics of the NDIS, while other sources say a general discussion about the approach to the NDIS across the country – built on increasing concern about the budget bottom line in the mid year review of the budget – grew out of a need for ERC to sign off on a completed agreement with NSW, the first major state due to sign up on the scheme.\nCost of the NDIS This year's budget papers put the cost of the NDIS at $38 billion over the next four years, of which the federal government is to fund $18.9 billion, making the nascent scheme a constant source of angst within the cash-strapped government.\n There is another point of contention with the states about the NDIS. They want early access to funds being collected under the Medicare levy established to fund the scheme. Whatever the merits of their arguments for a change in the arrangement, the revenue is boosting the federal government's apparent bottom line while it remains undistributed.\nTuesday's story Quote: d senior sources insisting the NSW deal would proceed as planned but said there still appeared to be a question mark hanging over the speed of the rollout in other states and territories.\nSenator Fifield said on Tuesday that any suggestion that the NSW deal would not proceed were wrong and told the Senate that \"this government is not looking for ways to slow down the rollout of the NDIS\".\n\"We are looking for ways to deliver the NDIS, to make sure that it is the best that it can be,\" he said.\n\"To put beyond any doubt the intention and determination of this government to roll out the NDIS in full, colleagues need look no further than the budget papers themselves, which see the full appropriation for the NDIS laid out over the forward estimates.\"\nTiming not clear However, Senator Fifield could not say when the deal with NSW would be signed, even though it is understood to be ready to go. Questions also remain about progress on deals with other states.\nAll the bilateral agreements with the states and territories are due to be signed off by the end of this month.\nQueensland Disability Services Minister Coralee O'Rourke said on Tuesday that Queensland \"has bent over backwards to meet every requirement asked by the federal government in the development of the bilateral agreement\".\n\"We are ready to hit go but we need Tony Abbott to come to the table.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-18T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:32:00.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
