'My family and I are perplexed that our efforts to help others attract such scrutiny and derision,' says Mr Forrest. by Andrew Forrest In the past month Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest has been critiqued by several news outlets and programs , including The Australian Financial Review and the ABC's Four Corners . This is his response.\nAustralia is a great and free country, where people can disagree without fear of reprisal. Millions of people around the world do not have this luxury and all of us benefit from this freedom. When public scrutiny, however, is littered with biases and ideologies that we sometimes laugh off as the politics of envy or tall poppy syndrome, we hide the truth that such prejudice against anyone \"having a crack\" reduces the strength of our society.\nAs a leader of a number of organisations subject to such scrutiny – like Generation One, which is addressing Indigenous disparity sustainably through meaningful employment; Walk Free, and its six major initiatives in the worldwide struggle to end modern slavery; and the charitable Minderoo Foundation – I feel compelled to set the record straight.\nFor those who have also been revisiting the period when I controlled Anaconda Nickel 14 years ago, it is clear they have adopted a revisionist view of history. For instance, it is old news that I think I am the most imperfect person I know, just like it is equally old news that I lost control of the company I also founded.\nAndrew Forrest meets Pope Francis in February to discuss his global anti-slavery project, Walk Free. Leigh Henningham Anaconda's (now Minara's​) massive and groundbreaking Murrin Murrin project had enormous teething difficulties, especially during the extraordinarily demanding and exhausting commissioning period. Getting it off the ground was easily the most challenging business venture of my career, and now, under the leadership of the highly able Glencore, it is one of the world's leading nickel producers. This status could not possibly have been achieved but for the \"never, ever give up\" determination of that pioneering executive and operations team.\nThey alone prevented Murrin Murrin from joining the majority of huge resource projects that have spectacularly failed around the world. The operation that our team built for $1.5 billion looks pretty competitive against the $3.5 billion write-off when BHP Billiton shut Ravensthorpe​, its lookalike project in WA. Or Rio's $4 billion write-off of Riversdale, or similar operations that have cost three to five times Murrin Murrin. ‎\nKey facts 'ignored' It has been well-documented that the shortcuts the primary contractor introduced in the start-up phase didn't work and management responded by introducing the then largest mining company in the world, Anglo American, to invest $240 million for a stake of less than 24 per cent.\n Richie Ah Mat, Andrew Forrest and Prime Minister Tony Abbott during the Closing the Gap morning tea in the Prime Minister's courtyard at Parliament House in Canberra in February 2014. Alex Ellinghausen In the rush to criticise my loss of control, it was largely missed that this investment gave Anaconda a $1 billion valuation; not a bad outcome for a $6 million ASX listing only six years earlier.\nEqually well ignored is that during the entire period of my stewardship, Anaconda never missed an interest payment [nor] defaulted on its loans. All discounted debt buybacks and defaults took place between one and three years after I had retired from the company.\nAnglo's pitch for control failed and it was under the stewardship of Glencore that Anaconda's share price collapsed from $1.90 to 35¢. Glencore subsequently pitched a deplorably discounted 14-for-1 rights issue at 5¢, where it would pick up the entire shortfall and absolute control of the company. Not at a premium but a massive discount.\nDespite being long out of the company, our team organised a high premium takeover offer. We provided shareholders a choice. When the dust finally settled, Glencore offered a $1 billion valuation to acquire the whole company.\nAndrew Forrest says he and his wife have contributed more than $220 million to charitable causes since 2001 through cash and shares in Fortescue Metals Group. Tony McDonough Murrin Murrin is operating just as strongly today and will do so for decades. Like Fortescue, it will collectively give opportunities to tens of thousands and pay billions of dollars to support local communities and the nation.\nMy new emerging explorer, Squadron Resources, has also attracted cynicism despite its early successes. Like Anaconda before it and Fortescue now, Squadron will maintain its dedication to supporting early-stage exploration across Australia and bridging the gap from exploration to development, while closely following the law and best-practice environmental management.\nPassion for parity My passion for creating parity for the Aboriginal community has also enjoyed its fair share of criticism.\nWhen the Australian Employment Covenant was established soon after The Apology in 2008, there were more than 90,000 registered unemployed Indigenous job seekers, of which at least half were disadvantaged or seriously disadvantaged.\nThe initial target for job opportunity creation, therefore, was 50,000. This wasn't \"a pluck number\", as misinformed observers have sought to suggest, but a serious and long-term attempt to help close this huge disadvantage through employment. This was a three-way covenant between the employers of Australia to provide opportunities, the government to provide employer-directed, job-specific training, and Indigenous ‎people to step up to the created opportunities.\nAustralian employers should be applauded. They blew the smoke off targets and committed over 63,000 jobs. Nearly 24,000 of these have already been filled and more are added each day. Unfortunately, bureaucrats complicated the scheme by failing to only fund relevant training as directed by employers – despite the then prime ministerial commitment of Kevin Rudd.\nThe Abbott government has recently done much to address this shortcoming by creating a network of 29 Vocational Training and Employment Centres (VTECs) that connect disadvantaged Indigenous job seekers with training that leads to a guaranteed job. Each is funded on achieving 26 weeks' retention in a job – and, as a result, their most compelling feature of success is their 80 per cent-plus retention rates – and this is often with job seekers previously considered highly disadvantaged. The alternative system was only achieving 24 per cent and often with candidates who did not suffer the same disparity as VTEC applicants.\nWhen I was a young boy, I was surrounded by Indigenous disparity, where a lack of Indigenous education and employment created growing devastation. Those in charge lightened their conscience by stacking welfare into the gap. The result was predictable. I believe rectifying this situation through employment is our most profoundly important Australian work.\nWhen the [Department of the] Prime Minister and Cabinet asked me to lead an inquiry into this, we wrote the Creating ‎Parity review; ‎an intertwined set of recommendations that, if fully implemented as agreed by experts, would for the first time eliminate the disparity – while saving Australian lives and billions of dollars. Implementation will take serious determination and I wish all our government and the opposition the courage they need to do it.\nAnti-slavery activism I have also come under fresh attack for my efforts to end global slavery through the Walk Free Foundation we established in 2010. We have been labelled by the armchair critics as naive and dangerous. Like the efforts to [end] Indigenous disparity, ending global slavery is a momentous task. It is the most difficult and awful human injustice in the world.\nIn 2012, we created the global Walk Free Movement, the largest anti-slavery movement in the world. It is a completely \"cost-free to users\" platform, bringing together the voices of anti-slavery – the individual advocates and organisations around the world. Importantly, we also brought a number of small non-government, non-profit organisations face-to-face to meet, network and strategise across countries.\nWhile some have been dismissive of the 8.3 million people who have taken online action through the Walk Free Movement as \"clictivists\", consider the following. Until the movement was established, there were hundreds – probably thousands – of highly credible local organisations working tirelessly around the world to end slavery. For all but a select few, the idea of achieving global reach with their campaigns was nonexistent. Working with our partners, our campaign actions have led to 11 governments, the European Parliament and the International Labour Organization​ agreeing to implement recommendations. Out of our campaigns targeting business, eight major companies have also adopted our anti-slavery recommendations.\nWhen I first came to this issue, I was shocked to discover that despite the millions of dollars that had been spent on responding to modern slavery, the metrics on this issue that would allow informed decision-making were poor to nonexistent. As a businessperson, I know the importance of the metrics. First you get your hard data, then you make your decisions, then you drive and track your progress.\nEncouraged by other members of the Giving Pledge like Bill Gates, Walk Free set out to build national-level data on modern slavery, globally, almost from scratch. This was not for the faint-hearted. Modern slavery populations are kept out of sight by irresponsible regimes and criminal elements. In 2014, we published the second edition of the Global Slavery Index , a report that draws on the best available data to provide as clearly as possible a picture of modern slavery in 167 countries. According to our research methodology, over 35million people are living in some form of modern slavery.\nFor a sector badly in need of data – both to understand the problem and against which to measure progress – the importance of this tool cannot be overstated. The index is new and seeks to measure a deeply hidden and poorly understood crime. We do not claim it to be perfect by any means, however polls and surveys of tens of thousands of people in dozens of countries demonstrate our measurement methodology as the most accurate there is.\nWalk Free also provided the seed funding of over €1 million and very dedicated staff to get the Global Freedom Network going, and we continue to support it today. It is a very serious philanthropic, non-business venture that culminated in two wonderful and historic moments: the first ever official Islamic fatwa condemning slavery, and, secondly, the December 2, 2014 Proclamation.\nThere was no precedent for the gathering and formal agreement of the world's top religious leaders. The Proclamation they signed removed all doubt that there was ever a moral or religious basis anywhere in the world to support modern slavery.\nFamily 'perplexed' Finally, cynics have found reason to attack my charitable contributions to dozens of national and international organisations, primarily through the privately established Minderoo Foundation.\nMy wife and I have contributed more than $220 million to charitable causes since 2001 through cash and shares. We have also publicly pledged the vast majority of our wealth philanthropically during and at the end of our life time through the Giving Pledge.\nI have been repeatedly questioned and criticised for giving shares to charities. This type of criticism is plainly incoherent. Shares in wonderful companies are what I own and I respect them more than cash, as they provide employment and build the industries that make our country great. I give away what I own. I don't see how I can give away what I don't.\nMy family and I are perplexed that our efforts to help others attract such scrutiny and derision. Encouraging, not kicking, enterprise and philanthropy helps build the strong society all our kids ‎deserve.\nAndrew Forrest is Fortescue Metals Group chairman and a philanthropist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:11:49.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
