The 'old-school' investors are more often wary and would rather have nothing to do with stocks reeling at 52-week lows.However, this contrarian strategy offers huge return potential and might actually help investors lower downside risk while achieving market outperformance. The idea is to aim for stocks that have ample long-term growth prospects to supersede near-term pressure, and ultimately lead to profitability. Why Stocks Nearing 52-Week Lows Could Still Be Good Bets Often, the herd mentality of investors compels them to dump beaten down stocks hovering around their year-long lows, simply because it seems to be the common rage. However, the rationale that goes against this view is that stocks might have tumbled over the past due to several reasons, be it company-specific or macroeconomic.Thus, low valuations do not always mean that the stock has lost all potential. The market, as you know, has a propensity to overreact to both good and bad news, ensuing in random stock price movements that do not always rightly match up with the company's long-term fundamentals. Hence, before dismissing these beaten-down stocks, it makes perfect sense to analyze such overreaction. Zacks Style Score to the Rescue The stocks trading near their 52-week low levels are undoubtedly available cheap. But is it prudent enough to bet one’s hard-earned money on such stocks? We highly recommend that before you venture out, determine whether the stock has bottomed out and is set for an upward trend or will it tend to lose value further.It is here that our new style score system can come in handy and help you pick the right stocks that still have compelling fundamentals and bright future prospects. Remember, the low valuation of these stocks serves as the perfect opportunity for investors to get on board, purchase them and ride the anticipated growth trend.Please note that our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. Back-tested results show that stocks with Growth Style Scores of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space. 4 Fallen Angels to Buy Now We hereby zero in on four stocks based on the following credentials: a solid Zacks Rank, an impressive Growth Style Score and current price as a percentage of 52-week high-low range under 5 (a value of 0 indicates that the stock is trading at its 52-week low).Further, these picks have solid growth metrics, and have been witnessing impressive earnings estimate revision activity lately, which implies that analysts are increasingly bullish on these stocks.Here's a look at four fallen angels trading near their 52-week lows that could still be worth putting your money in. Linn Co, LLC LNCOThe company was formed for the purpose of owning LINN units. LINN is focused on the development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, which include various producing basins within the U.S. The company’s shares are currently meandering around their 52-week low of $2.88.We believe, LINN Energy’s signing of a non-binding letter of intent with GSO Capital Partners LP, the credit arm of The Blackstone Group L.P., which will finance its oil and natural gas development activities, bodes well. This strategic move will allow LINN Energy to increase production and cash flow without burdening itself with higher capital investments.The company possesses a Zacks Rank #2 and a solid Growth Score of ‘A’. Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company, with two upward estimate revisions for the company’s 2015 earnings. This has led to a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015, from 16 cents 30 days ago to 65 cents – a massive increase of 306.3%. VIVUS Inc. VVUSMountain View, CA-based VIVUS focuses on developing compounds to treat obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes and sexual health. The company's portfolio comprises two drugs: Qsymia for chronic weight management and Stendra for erectile dysfunction (ED).We remain positive on VIVUS’ partnerships for Stendra. The company is currently in partnership discussions for Stendra in Latin America and certain Asian countries, and an announcement in this regard is expected shortly.Though the stock is currently looming just above its 52-week low of $1.09, a Zacks Rank #2 and a firm Growth Score of ‘A’ lends further optimism.Adding to the positives, the company has also been enjoying solid earnings estimate revisions. Over the past month, current year estimates have narrowed from a loss of 83 cents to a loss of 69 cents per share. Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. PPHMTustin, CA-based biopharmaceutical company, Peregrine Pharmaceuticals researches and develops monoclonal antibodies for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer in the U.S. and internationally. Notably, the company is presently trading near its 52-week low of $1.00.Peregrine Pharma’s lead pipeline candidate, bavituximab, is being developed for multiple oncology indications including the treatment of second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We believe the successful development and commercialization of bavituximab would be a major positive for Peregrine Pharma, which currently has no approved drug.The company also boasts a solid Zacks Rank #2 and an equally impressive Growth Score of ‘B’. Moreover, the stock has been witnessing positive estimate revisions over the past one month, as the current year consensus estimate of loss has narrowed 8.6% over the same time frame. Computer Task Group Inc. CTG Headquartered in Buffalo, NY, Computer Task Group provides information technology (IT) staffing, IT solutions, and application management outsourcing services in North America and Europe. The stock is currently hovering just above its 52-week low of $6.45.However, the company has been undertaking several strategic initiatives to address opportunities for growth or improvements in financial and operational efficiency. This should bolster investor sentiments, going forward.Moreover, flaunting a Zacks Rank #2 and Growth Score of ‘B’, this IT services firm has also seen positive estimate revisions over the past month, which has resulted in its 2015 Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings climbing from 33 cents to 40 cents per share. Window of Opportunity It is widely said, “Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises”. Investors should look to make the most from these potentially undervalued stock picks as the low valuations that some of them are experiencing today could actually make for a great buying opportunity. Indeed, the aforementioned stocks wallowing around their 52-week lows can actually turn out to be windows of opportunity, taking your portfolio returns to new highs!Want    ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T06:01:01.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
