Good Housekeeping magazine once dubbed the service a “fashionista’s playground.”\nYahoo plans to tap into Polyvore’s taste-making skills and loyal consumer following to sell more ads in its digital magazines focusing on style and beauty. The acquisition will join dozens of other mostly small deals that have been engineered by Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer during the past three years in an attempt to boost advertising sales.\nThe results have been lackluster so far, barely budging Yahoo’s revenue.\nEarlier this week, Yahoo released a financial forecast calling for little or no growth in its revenue, after subtracting ad commissions, during the current quarter that will end in September.\nThe acquisition, which hasn’t closed yet, will mark a homecoming for three of Polyvore’s co-founders, Jianing Hu, Guangwei Yuan and Pasha Sadri. They are all former Yahoo engineers.\nPolyvore’s website will continue to operate after the deal is completed, according to Yahoo.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 9:49 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T00:19:48.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
