In our view, though such action will be data dependent, there seems to be a bias towards at least one more cut,” SBI Research said in a note.\nOn the other hand, DBS said in a research note that RBI is likely to remain largely data-dependent in rest of this year.\n“We continue to expect the RBI to keep rates on hold in September, but acknowledge an easing bias,” DBS said.\nJapanese brokerage Nomura also reiterated similar views and said that the RBI is in “neutral gear” for now and expects rates to stay on a prolonged hold.\n“In our view, policy rates in India are already at neutral levels and our macroeconomic forecasts do not support further easing for three reasons: firstly, growth is already in the initial stages of a business cycle recovery; secondly, sustained disinflation is unlikely; and thirdly, inflationary expectations are still high,” Nomura said in a report.\nAfter three cuts in seven months, RBI yesterday decided to keep the benchmark lending (repo) rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent as also the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 4 per cent.\n 05, 2015 1:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:11:40.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
