The trusts were sponsored by Countrywide Home Loans and EMC Mortgage Corp. The FDIC alleges that BNY breached its contractual obligations by failing to provide notice of representation and warranty violations and demand Countrywide and EMC to replace or buy back the noncompliant loans, provided false regulatory certifications and remittance reports, and failed to take possession of complete mortgage files. The FDIC asserts claims for breach of contract, the federal Trust Indenture Act, and the New York Streit Act. Complaint .
