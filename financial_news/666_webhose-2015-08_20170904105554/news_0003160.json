Christopher Pearce Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Most business leaders support a market-based system to reduce carbon emissions but fear they will be punished by the federal government if they speak up, says former National Australia Bank boss Cameron Clyne.\nMr Clyne, who stepped down from the bank last year, said he experienced a backlash after backing the former Rudd Labor government's carbon price in 2007.\n\"I dealt with months of backlash, emails and abuse and everything else. And the political environment, if anything, since then has got more charged,\" Mr Clyne told ABC Radio on Monday.\nMr Clyne, who wrote an opinion piece in The Sydney Morning Herald criticising Canberra's \"wilful ignorance and blindness\" of political leaders over climate change , said that most business leaders supported a carbon trading scheme but they feared about speaking out.\n\"[They feel] this particular government is pretty hostile to criticism. They feel the distraction of getting up the government's nose is simply not worth it and becomes a huge distraction from running their business,\" he said.\n\"A lot of them are lamenting the lack of clarity on energy policy.\"\nMr Clyne again denied he was a Labor supporter or that he was considering a tilt at politics.\nAustralia 'missing out' But he said the economy needed to deal with the realities of a move away from fossil fuels and should be directing more investment towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. It would be \"economically reckless\" to do otherwise, he said.\n\"Business needs policy to promote growth, I am supporting growth policies. Where investment is going into renewables worldwide and we're missing it, that's not a growth policy,\" Mr Clyne said.\n\"The first thing you want to do as an economy is diversify. We are heavily reliant on coal the world is moving, quite rapid to renewables, that's where the investment dollars are going and we need to more much more aggressively towards renewables.\"\nMr Clyne said the business costs of leaving \"stranded assets\" such as coal-fired power stations would be an enormous cost for the nation, including more jobless.\n\"We know from history what happens when a business or a government sets its face against a change that is coming anyway,\" Mr Clyne wrote in his opinion piece.\n\"It's usually not the politicians or the chief executives who end up at the unemployment office. Leadership mistakes are worn by people who are least at fault for the bad decisions - the workers, their families and the communities that depend on them.\n\"It's everyday Australians who bear the brunt, cop the hit and pay for the wilful ignorance and blindness of political leaders - and some in the business community - to the very real and very rapid changes that are all around us.\"\nMr Clyne said international talks in Paris - where countries will announce their post-2020 emissions reduction targets - was a chance for the Abbott government to show some leadership on climate change.\nEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt said Australia would take \"serious and credible\" targets to Paris , but it was likely to fall short of the larger cuts being undertaken by other countries.\nIt comes as a new study shows the nation's 20 largest polluters will be able to increase their carbon emissions without penalties under the federal government's direct action policy.\nThe federal government said it would announce the details of its so-called \"safeguard mechanism\" which kicks in once companies exceed the emissions baseline of 100,000 tonnes of carbon.\nClimate change policy looks like becoming a centrepiece of next year's federal election after Labor signalled it would support an emissions trading scheme.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow", "http://www.smh.com.au/comment/strong-leadership-needed-on-carbon-reduction-policies-20150802-gipla5.html"], "published": "2015-08-03T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:53:56.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
