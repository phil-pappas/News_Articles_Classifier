Andrew Meares by Fleur Anderson Prime Minister Tony Abbott has flagged that a Department of Finance review of travel claims by House of Representatives speaker Bronwyn Bishop could lead to further tightening on politicians' travel entitlements.\nMr Abbott, Mrs Bishop and a number of Coalition ministers attended the Perth funeral on Friday of Liberal backbencher Don Randall who died suddenly last week.\nThe politicians who flew to attend Mr Randall's funeral are understood to have travelled together and were conscious of the intense scrutiny on their travel plans.\nThe pressure on Mrs Bishop to resign is unabated despite her apology on Thursday for a $5000 helicopter charter for a Liberal fundraiser and partly taxpayer-funded attendances at the weddings of former Indi MP Sophie Mirabella and Brisbane MP Teresa Gambaro.\nMr Abbott said politicians could not get away with \"exploiting the rules\" and Mrs Bishop was a \"very, very chastened person\".\n\"We banned politicians travelling overseas first class, we have heavily limited family travel inside Australia and overseas, and we have banned immediate family employment and as you know there were quite a few members of Parliament who were employing spouses, children, et cetera in their offices and that is all now being stopped,\" Mr Abbott told radio station 2SM.\n\"So, a lot has happened and let's see what else might emerge out of the review that is going on now.\"\nMr Abbott said his family travelled overseas shortly after winning government and flew economy.\n \"Well, look, I took the family overseas at Christmas 2013 and we certainly made the very long trip to Europe in economy class. That's what the people do and that's what we certainly did when we were travelling privately.\"\nHowever, Labor has threatened to disrupt federal Parliament if Mrs Bishop remains in the Speaker's chair when Parliament resumes on August 10.\nA no-confidence motion is expected on August 11 to give time for the Parliament to dedicate the first day of the spring session to condolence motions for the late Mr Randall.\n\"No one can pretend that that goodwill is still there,\" Labor's Tony Burke said of the co-operation between the parties supporting the authority of the speaker.\nTasmanian Liberal MP Brett Whiteley wrote to Mrs Bishop to tell her of his electorate's anger toward her behaviour and last week Eden-Monaro Liberal MP Peter Hendy called for a review of parliamentarians' travel entitlements.\nOnline activist group GetUp! has gathered a petition of signatures on an open letter to MPs and Senators backing reform of politicians' entitlements and is threatening to publish the names of politicians who do not sign the group's demands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:10:10.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
