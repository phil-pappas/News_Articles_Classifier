On Thursday, WME-IMG, the entertainment and sports megalith that owns and administers the official fashion week venue (where only about one-third of the designers on the schedule show although that is still more than at any other location) as well as MADE, the official off-schedule venue for up-and-coming designers, is set to unveil its own branding.\nThe new look stacks the letters NYFW in a stylised black and white pattern and spells out New York Fashion Week below or stretches the letter out horizontally, and in both cases, it finishes with the kicker \"The Shows\". It was created by the agency Mother New York.\nThe logo will be used to distinguish the WME-IMG shows from, well, other shows. And it will appear on the various digital channels that are being introduced, including a New York Fashion Week mobile app, Facebook page, website at NYFW.com, Twitter and so on.\nBackstage pass to Alexander Wang. It also represents the reboot of the main show schedule under its new owners: William Morris Endeavor bought IMG, former administrator of the shows at Bryant Park and Lincoln Center, in 2013, creating WME-IMG.\nIn April, the company announced that the centralised shows would move from the much-derided home in Lincoln Center to a pair of cavernous, and kind of hip, new venues: Skylight at Moynihan Station, the post office on 33rd Street; and Skylight Clarkson Square, in TriBeCa.\nFirst time The new spaces and logo come with new names attached. For the first time, Public School, Prabal Gurung, Derek Lam and Jeremy Scott will stop doing their own edgy, off-piste thing to become part of the establishment schedule, and Intel and Lexus are stepping up as sponsors (along with the usual names, including DHL and Tresemmé).\n Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger are also returning, sort of. They are still going to hold their shows in their own venues, as opposed to either of the central options, but under the official WME-IMG umbrella.\nWME-IMG is pretty excited about all of this. New names! Cool names! New logo! Elegant logo! And so on.\nStill, between this news and the CFDA New York Fashion Week branding, there are now two logos with the same four letters, representing broadly the same event. No matter how logical the internal rationale, it seems to me to be a recipe for added confusion in what is already a pretty confusing situation.\nWhen I asked, Catherine Bennett, managing director of IMG fashion events and properties, said she did not think the duelling logos would be a problem. She said they were complementary and would simply signpost brands that were part of WME-IMG New York Fashion Week versus brands that were part of New York Fashion Week overall, and unite all WME-IMG communications. It's – you know – a clarity thing. This may be true.\nBut it seems to me, when most people think of \"the shows,\" they don't think only of the WME-IMG shows. They think of the entire New York Fashion Week schedule.\nOf course, this may be a subliminal way of WME-IMG associating itself with all of the shows, with an eye to the future, which is interesting to consider. The company does have a tendency to think big.\nWe'll find out how it all works in a month, when the ready-to-wear circus kicks off.\nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:07:32.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
