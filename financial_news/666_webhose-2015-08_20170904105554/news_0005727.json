The 12 surviving crew have to wait patiently until help arrives.\nThe stiff-upper-lipped captain played by John Mills (who else?) persuades the crew they must all think positively and breathe and move as little as possible to conserve oxygen for however long it takes before the divers arrive. So everyone sits quietly, breathing only through the pores and not panicking because panic uses up oxygen.\nPierpont couldn't help thinking of Morning Departure when Kingsgate Consolidated (KCN) was giving its presentation to the Diggers, because no submarine ever sank further. From a peak of $12 five years ago, KCN shares are currently selling around 64Â¢.\nKCN deserved some hammering, because it made a mistake when it took over the Challenger gold mine in South Australia, which resulted in a $332 million write-off. But most of its sinking has been due to circumstances beyond its control.\nKCN's big asset is the large, low-grade Chatree gold mine in northern Thailand. From Pierpont's exceedingly casual reading of the headlines, Thai politics have been chaotic for the past eight years. That chaos was transmitted to the government bureaucracy,resulting in no new exploration licences being approved since 2008.\nSo KCN has been forced to wait as patiently as any breathless submariner for necessary mining permits and lease extensions to be granted. Chatree is situated in a rich alluvial belt, but KCN has been unable to develop promising new discoveries. If Chatree were in some settled, friendly environment such as South Australia it could have given birth to three or four extra mines by now.\nChatree is the only gold mine in Thailand, which is something of a negative because the government has no template for dealing with it.\n The chaos appears to be clearing since the military took over Bangkok. Permits are starting to be approved again. There is now a gold policy before the Thai parliament. Once it is passed, Thailand will have a template and Kingsgate will be able to work to it. But if it doesn't pass by September, the policy will be scrapped and everything goes back into the melting pot.\nFor all these reasons, the market has been unenthusiastic about KCN shares. But that lack of enthusiasm has been greatly exacerbated by short-sellers.\nPierpont has never understood why short-selling is permitted on stock exchanges. In any other walk of life, someone who sells something they don't own is committing a crime and may even wind up in prison. But on the ASX you can sell a stock down to zero with no penalty at all.\nWorse, the ASX protects short-sellers in a way that it protects nobody else. Just ask Kingsgate's chairman, Ross Smyth-Kirk.\nKingsgate has been the most heavily shorted stock on the ASX for several years and the ASX has done nothing to protect its shareholders. The accompanying chart shows the short position in Kingsgate since the start of 2013. The chart shows that the short position in Kingsgate was frequently above 10 per cent of its capital. At the end of July it was 7.3 per cent.\nTheoretically, a short-seller is supposed to cover the short within three days. It seems clear from the chart that in practice a short position can be rolled on for infinity.\nWorse, Ross isn't even allowed to complain about it. At the annual meeting in November 2013, Ross said (in part): \"For long periods of time we have been the most shorted mining stock on the board for little reason other than they have found that they can.\n\"Sharemarket investment should not be about who has the fastest computer or who has the smartest, latest algorithm. Those who don't see high-frequency and its associate, manipulative short-selling, as a threat to the integrity of the market and to our capitalist system are ignoring the lessons of history.\"\nThat speech was barred from the ASX website. Pierpont can only assume, therefore, that the ASX is more interested in suppressing criticism of short-sellers than in protecting shareholders.\nThe standard defence of short-selling is that it thickens markets. That is pure nonsense. All short-selling does is depress market to the detriment of long-term investors. Short-selling also does nothing to assist the formation of capital, which is supposed to be a prime purpose of stock exchanges.\nKingsgate's final woe is that a disgruntled shareholder has emerged. Hardly surprising, of course, for a company that's written off 95 per cent of its share value.\nThe particularly disgruntled shareholder is Sean Tomlinson, who shot to fame last November as a newcomer to BRW 's Young Rich list. Sean is a Gold Coast entrepreneur who failed there as a restaurateur, although the experience gave him a basic education in point-of-sale software.\nHe formed Revel Systems to develop iPad point-of-sale software and by last November was holding 20 per cent of the company, which by then had an enterprise value of $US450 million. Not bad for a 26-year-old.\nSean is now based in Hong Kong and picked up some 3.9 million shares in Kingsgate around last November. He wouldn't have lost much on the investment so far, but he's been nagging the board for the past few months.\nSean queried why the company had spent so much money on a potential IPO of the Thailand interests that so far hasn't happened. (The gossip Pierpont gets from the Pat Pong bars is that the IPO was blocked by the Thai preference shareholder, thereby crippling the plan to turn the pref shares into ordinaries which would be held by the Thai public. By the time Kingsgate had removed the pref shareholders, the market had crumbled and so the whole IPO was put on hold.)\nIn one letter Sean said Kingsgate's performance for shareholders had been nothing short of disgraceful and fundamental changes to the board and operations were required immediately.\nThe Kingsgate chaps suspect Sean has been talking to Kingsgate's former chief executive Geoff Day. Geoff had a spectacularly short career as CEO, having taken up the job on September 8 last year and having left it on October 15.\nGeoff had differences with the board. He was never a director but attended one meeting on September 30. On the next day Geoff gave an investment mandate to a company called Treadstone. Pierpont heard that he hadn't mentioned the mandate to the board on September 30 and directors were a bit cross when they discovered what had happened.\nWhen Pierpont mentioned this allegation to Geoff several months ago, Geoff said he'd ring your correspondent back. Pierpont's still waiting for the phone call.\nOn Pierpont's count, Sean doesn't have the numbers to roll the present board, but even if he did your correspondent cannot see what a new board could do to improve Kingsgate, which at last is looking in better shape..\nLast week Kingsgate's new chief executive, Greg Foulis, told the Diggers that Chatree is performing well and has a reserve of more than a million ounces. They are now drilling to see if there is more gold below the existing pits. In South Australia the existing Challenger gold deposit is nearing the end of its life, and has been written off. However, that's history and there's hope for the future in the shape of several other prospects nearby.\nGreg reckoned the silver-gold deposit Nueva Esperanza in Chile was now Kingsgate's flagship project. Reserves are currently estimated at 1.9 million ounces of gold equivalent and the geologists reckon there is potential for considerably more. So it's been a long hard road, but Kingsgate looks as though it is nearing some success in the field, which ultimately is the only way to satisfy disgruntled investors.\nMeanwhile, Pierpont suggests any reader who's interested should head for his local video shop and rent a copy of Morning Departure , because it's a marvellous training movie for investors. After all, investors in small mining companies often have to live forever in the dark, not panicking and waiting patiently for some kindly diver to discover their distressed shares and bring them back to the surface again.\nPierpont hardly needs to point out the parallels with the exploration industry, but he will anyway. Of the 46 companies who presented at the forum, Pierpont counted 20 who needed cash, which is the oxygen of the exploration industry.\nDiscovering a promising deposit typically takes a few years and costs a few million dollars. But that's the easy bit. The hard bit is finding the cash (oxygen) for the feasibility studies and plant, the latter being liable to cost anywhere from $50 million to $1 billion.\nUntil a diver arrives in the shape of a brave banker or end user, small exploration companies are doomed to stay at the bottom of the ASX list with a nice mineral deposit, but waiting and praying for a kindly funder to arrive in his or her diving suit.\nMeanwhile, however thriftily those companies are run, their cash ebbs out slowly. And because their share prices are low any equity issues will be highly dilutive and drive their share prices down even further. Pierpont reckons he could name half a dozen companies who have found quite reasonable deposits, but whose shares are languishing at 1Â¢ or less.\nFinally, Morning Departure has a realistic ending. Eight of the crew manage to escape and the other four, including Captain Mills, have to wait while the rescue ship winches the submarine up from the seabed. But then a fierce storm strikes, the submarine drops back to the bottom and the movie finishes with the last four calmly awaiting certain death. It's just like the sharemarket.\nPip!
