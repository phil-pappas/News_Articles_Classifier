Cited as Significant Contributors to Debt by Region Source of Debt % \nA Closer Look at Canada's Major Debt Contributors \n\"While rates are at all-time lows, it's important that Canadians are aware of the risk associated with taking on additional debt, regardless of its purpose. Having a financial plan which includes careful budgeting and asset allocation can help avoid any risk and uncertainties,\" said Sameh Elrefaei, Head of Personal Lending, BMO Bank of Montreal. \nHome Sales Across Canada Remain Resilient \nAbout half (49 per cent) of Canadians cited buying a home as a significant contributor to their current debt, with 34 per cent saying it is the main factor. According to BMO Economics, home sales are up 6 per cent in the first half of 2015 from a year ago. \n\"Home sales remain resilient across most of the country, led by soaring transactions in Toronto and Vancouver. Of growing concern, however, is that rapidly rising house prices in these two cities could encourage some households to take on larger mortgages than they can handle when interest rates rise,\" added Mr. Guatieri. \nHome Renovations Continue to Outpace Overall Consumer Demand \nOne third (33 per cent) of Canadians said a home renovation or repairs added to their debt, and one in ten said it was the major source this year. \n\"Home renovations and repairs are running at a near 3 per cent real rate, in part due to an aging population, as seniors tend to spend more of their income on fixing up their home than younger age groups,\" said Mr. Guatieri. \nAuto Sales at Record Highs \nSlightly less than half of Canadians (46 per cent) with current debt said the purchase of a car added to their debt levels, and about one-fifth (18 per cent) said this was the top contributor. BMO Economics revealed that auto sales are at record highs and continue to rise moderately, supported by inexpensive credit, extended loan terms and rising employment rates. \nEducation Expenses Continue to Outpace General Inflation \nExpenses including tuition, textbooks and supplies have risen around 3 per cent, putting extra pressure on student debt. The report revealed that over one third (37 per cent) of Canadians under 35 hold debt from student loans, and about one third (32 per cent) of all Canadians surveyed said education expenses have contributed to their current debt levels. Survey results are from interviews with an online sample of 1,001 Canadians conducted between June 19th and 22nd, 2015. The margin of error for a probability sample of this size is Â± 3.1%, 19 times out of 20. Data has been weighted by region based on the most recent Census figures, so that it is representative of all adult Canadians. \nTo view the full results of the 2015 BMO Annual Debt Report, please click here . \nAbout BMO Financial Group \nEstablished in 1817, BMO Financial Group is a highly diversified financial services provider based in North America.
