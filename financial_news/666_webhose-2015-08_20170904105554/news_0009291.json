Photo: Louie Douvis\nWoolworths shareholders have urged new chairman Gordon Cairns to appoint an experienced retailer as chief executive but have played down fears that the food and liquor group could become embroiled in a full blown price war.\nFund managers welcomed the appointment of Mr Cairns, a former chief executive of Lion Nathan, saying he would bring much needed stability to the retailer after months of turmoil.\nHowever, they said Mr Cairns' background in fast-moving consumer goods meant that it was even more important that Woolworths appointed a new chief executive with a background in retail, ideally in grocery retail.\nMr Cairns, who takes the helm on Tuesday from Ralph Waters, has said that finding a new CEO is his first priority but has yet to decide if retail experience is a prerequisite to making the short list.\nAdvertisement \"I haven't made up my mind on that yet â€“ that will be a board discussion,\" Mr Cairns told Fairfax Media when his appointment was announced last Friday.\nWoolworths' senior management team kicked off an investor roadshow on Monday after unveiling a worse than expected 12.5 per cent fall in full-year net profit to $2.l15 billion last week.\nInvestors said outgoing chief executive Grant O'Brien did not join the briefings, heightening speculation that he had been sidelined from day-to-day running of the company after resigning in June in the wake of the second profit downgrade in four months.\nThe meetings were led by Food Group managing director Brad Banducci and chief financial officer David Marr.\nWoolworths shares fell more than 4 per cent before closing down $1 at $26.40 as analysts slashed profit forecasts after factoring in the price reductions needed to reverse negative same-store sales in the Australian food and liquor business.\nWoolworths says its has invested more than $200 million into reducing grocery prices since February and its prices are now as cheap or cheaper than Coles. However, the investment has done little to boost same-store sales, which have fallen 0.9 per cent in the first eight weeks of 2016, matching the 0.9 per cent slide in the June quarter.\nPrice war Analysts believe Woolworths may need to invest between $400 million and $550 million into branded and private label prices this year, crunching food and liquor margins and potentially triggering a full-blown price war with Coles and Aldi.\n\"Coles and Aldi will not stand still while Woolworths turns the ship,\" said UBS analyst Ben Gilbert. \"The risk of a price war has increased in our view.\"\nHowever, investors said neither Woolworths, Coles nor Aldi wanted a price war and would behave rationally to protect earnings.\nAnalysts believe Woolworths' Australian food and liquor margins could fall from 8.0 per cent in 2015 to around 6.8 per cent in 2016, contributing to a 14 per cent decline in underlying group net profit to $2.1 billion.\nWoolworths' flat underlying net profit in 2015 would have been worse if the retailer had not cut costs by reducing staff bonuses.\nCitigroup analyst Craig Woolford estimates that Woolworths saved $145 million in 2015 by reducing short term incentives to as many as 10,000 staff, offsetting some of the extra investment in price reductions.\nWoolworths told store managers and assistant managers in June that no bonuses would be paid in 2015, even if they achieved their personal performance metrics.\nCitigroup fears the cut in bonuses is harming in-store execution, pointing to feedback from suppliers that Woolworths' execution of promotions is weak.\n\"We think the drop in bonuses is impacting on execution and will slow down a recovery,\" said Mr Woolford, who expects earnings before interest and tax to fall 11.6 per cent to $3.3 billion and group net profit to fall 12 per cent to $2.16 billion in 2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/woolworths-confirms-gordon-cairns-as-new-chairman-profit-falls-125pc-20150826-gj8ofx", "http://www.afr.com/business/retail/woolworths-chairman-gordon-cairns-faces-three-tough-choices-to-find-new-ceo-20150830-gjbbab", "http://www.afr.com/business/coles-woolworths-iga-to-lose-market-share-to-aldi-david-jones-says-moodys-20150813-giy6x0"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:22:38.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
