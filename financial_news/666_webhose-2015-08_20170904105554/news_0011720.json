Julian Andrews Share on twitter by James Chessell On the eve of the second Ashes Test at Lord’sin mid-July, Bill Muirhead​ hosted a South Australia Club function at London’s other great cricket ground, The Oval. The star of the show was Australian cricket coach Darren Lehmann, a Gawler, South Australia boy who had the 320-strong crowd gathered on the Oval’s roof terrace eating out of his hand. After all, it’s not every day that you get to hear from the coach of the national side hours before a critical match.\nA founding director at renowned London advertising agency M&C Saatchi, Muirhead, who is probably the best-connected Australian expatriate working in London, has served as South Australia’s agent-general in the UK and Europe since 2007. It is a job he takes very seriously.\nAbout five years ago the Adelaide-born Muirhead set up the South Australia Club as a networking forum to help promote the state’s exporters and encourage foreign investment. Speakers have included comedian Barry Humphries, former Wallaby Michael Lynagh​ and Brett Gosper​, who runs World Rugby.\nDays after the former foreign minister Alexander Downer, another proud South Australian, started as high commissioner in London in 2014, Muirhead organised a big bash in the marbled halls of Australia House on the Strand. Downer was clearly impressed. During a trip home to Adelaide in February, he joked to Labor Premier Jay Weatherill​ that “South Australia’s going better in London than it is in South Australia”.\nThe poster that helped the Conservative Party win the 1979 election. Drawing on his four decades in advertising, mostly working alongside Charles and Maurice Saatchi, Muirhead has also masterminded publicity stunts on behalf of his state. When a scandal about horse meat used in British burgers erupted in early 2013, Muirhead posted an “open letter” to Australian expats and tourists on the South Australia government website advising them to avoid the local product and suggesting they try Vili’s Pies, which are made in Adelaide. “Our food packs enough punch not to need the extra horsepower,” he wrote. The letter generated two days of free headlines after a PR mate of Muirhead’s tipped off the British press.\nPies are a subject close to Muirhead’s heart. Sitting down with the AFR Magazine at his office in Australia House a few days after the Lord’s Test, Muirhead is still disappointed that, although the function at The Oval was a great success, the 500 Vili’s Pies ordered for the occasion ran out early in the night.\n“You cannot ever under-cater,” he says with rueful smile. “You know they didn’t want me to do pies when we started [the SA Club]. They wanted to do larks’ tongues in aspic. I said, ‘Sorry this is South Australia, this is Australia, we are having pies’. Everybody loves them.”\nHis disappointment was, however, tempered by a letter he’d opened a few hours before the function began. It was a personally signed note from British Prime Minister David Cameron thanking him and his colleagues at M&C Saatchi for their work during the election campaign earlier in the year.\n British Airways' \"Face\" ad, 1989. It is the second time a Tory PM has written to Muirhead to express appreciation for his part in an unexpected victory; the first was John Major, in 1992.\nLynton Crosby and Bill Muirhead, a double act It seems unlikely but two South Australians played a part helping secure the Conservatives’ shock win on May 7. One of them was Lynton Crosby, the straight-talking former Liberal Party federal director appointed by Cameron as the Conservatives’ campaign director in 2013. Having masterminded Boris Johnson’s two successful bids for London mayor, Crosby was already well known in British political circles. The emphatic nature of Cameron’s triumph elevated “The Wizard of Oz” to celebrity status in Westminster circles.\nThe other was Muirhead, whose job was to oversee the campaign’s “creative output”. Ad agencies play a supporting role in political campaigns and Muirhead, who is reluctant to talk directly about his work with the Tories, is the first to point out that Crosby was in charge and “David Cameron was the guy who won it”. He continues: “Having done many of these campaigns, I’d borrow something JFK said, which is, ‘Victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan.’”\nCastlemaine XXXX ads to launch the beer in the UK. The campaign ran in the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, Muirhead and his long-time offsider at M&C Saatchi, Jeremy Sinclair, deserve credit for coming up with some of the campaign’s more interesting moments. With television and radio advertising banned in British elections, they made their mark with posters. One proved to be particularly effective. It featured a shrunken Labour leader Ed Miliband​ literally in the pocket of a giant Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond​. For most of the campaign Tory MPs stuck to a narrow script that emphasised their party’s economic credentials and cast doubt over Miliband’s competency. In the weeks before polling day, amid growing speculation Labour might have to consider a coalition with the freer-spending SNP to achieve a majority in the House of Commons, the Tories zeroed in on the risk a potential Labour-SNP marriage of convenience could pose to the economy.\nThe image of an uncertain-looking Miliband poking out of Salmond’s sharp blue suit expressed the sentiment so well that no words were needed. And it performed the main function of a good billboard, which is to create buzz. National newspaper headlines mentioning a relationship between SNP and Labour surged after the poster was launched. “It gave a sense of potency to the risk,” Crosby says. “A campaign needs to very simply and keenly make a connection with voters. You don’t have time to be fluffy or too nuanced. It’s not a think tank.”\nMuirhead says he likes the discipline of posters. “It’s a bit like headline writing – if you can’t state your message in a sentence, you’ll lose.” Cameron’s win was all the sweeter because almost every poll before election day had predicted a hung Parliament. Instead, he became the first Tory PM since Major in 1992 to secure a majority in the Commons.\nNot many big election battles fought on foreign soil feature a chief strategist born in South Australia’s Kadina and a senior adman from Adelaide. “A cynic might say it’s just a coincidence and of course it is,” Downer says. “But it’s a nice coincidence.”\nMuirhead was confident enough about Cameron’s prospects to put a few bets on a solid Tory victory. He was less certain when first approached about an interview for the AFR Magazine . Arguing it was too soon after election day, he said his role was not “terribly substantial”. He then complained he found personal interviews “uncomfortable and embarrassing”. Eventually he agreed to discuss “mainly South Australia”, when it was made clear the story would run regardless.\nHis reluctance to talk is partly strategic. His job with the SA government to promote the state is non-political, meaning he cannot express partisan views. Crosby also becomes notoriously unhappy about anyone within the extended Tory family who goes off message. Yet despite a career in advertising that has often lived up to the glamorous stereotype – including a period of Ferrari ownership – Muirhead appears genuinely keen to keep a low profile. “He is extremely down to earth, extremely straightforward,” says Sam Delaney, author of the book Mad Men & Bad Men, What Happened When British Politics Met Advertising , which traces the history of political ad campaigns. “For someone who’s tremendously successful and wealthy, there’s no pretentiousness about him.”\nThat Muirhead should end up promoting cross-border investment for SA is perhaps unsurprising. His father Denis worked for the Australian Meat Board in New York before being transferred to London. The family followed and Bill finished his schooling at St Dunstan’s College in South London. After returning to Australia after school, Muirhead wanted to be an architect but “didn’t get the maths”. So he studied commercial art, which led to advertising.\nHe became what the industry describes as an “account man”. This is the hopefully charming and dependable executive who manages relationships with clients and chases new business. They are different from the more flighty “creatives”, who are responsible for crafting the ads.\nMuirhead landed a job in Sydney with ad agency Jackson Wain. When the firm opened an office in London, he found himself back in the Old Dart with every intention of returning to Australia again after a few years. He began to build a career, working at traditional firms servicing traditional clients. But everything changed in September 1972, when a client introduced Muirhead to Maurice Saatchi, who persuaded him to move to Saatchi’s smart new office in Soho’s Golden Square.\nThe first firm Maurice set up with his brother Charles, Saatchi & Saatchi, was anything but traditional. “I thought they were completely nuts,” Muirhead recalls. “They were all playing football in the office with a big layout pad that had been screwed up and turned into a football with sellotape.”\nIt is worth noting one of the main reasons Muirhead got the job in the first place was because of his above-average height. Charles had read in a book that tall people did better in business and decreed all new account men had to be at least six foot (182cm).\nDespite this, Muirhead decided changing agencies was worth the risk. He was about the same age, 23, as Charles and Maurice. They drank at the same pubs and chased the same girls. If it did not work out, he would be back in Australia soon anyway. The name Saatchi & Saatchi implies a joint venture but Delaney says the firm initially reflected the personality of the older brother, Charles, who was “creatively ambitious but professionally robust”.\nCharles was one of Britain’s best young copywriters, with a flair for unconventional, attention-grabbing ads. He could be charming but often acted like a tyrant. In Alison Fendley’s​ Saatchi & Saatchi: The Inside Story , Muirhead recalls a time when Maurice was being rather offhand during a pitch rehearsal for a kitchen company. Enraged, Charles chased him around a table and whacked him with an aluminium chair.\nAs the business grew, Charles became more elusive. This only added to his reputation as a mercurial and idiosyncratic maverick. Muirhead, who describes Charles as a genius, found his new employer completely liberating: “That was the great thing about Charles Saatchi. It didn’t matter who you were, it didn’t matter if you were the dispatch person. If you had a good idea he would listen to it. In a way that was inspiring.”\nMuirhead was once sent to the offices of the Daily Mail to sell an ad of dubious quality. Having managed to convince the newspaper’s management it was a gem, he returned to Golden Square feeling much happier. Then Charles spotted the ad. “It’s rubbish,” Charles screamed as he ripped it up and came up with another. He sent a sheepish Muirhead back to the newspaper the next day. They liked the new ad even better.\n'Labour isn't working' poster If there was a moment that transformed Saatchi & Saatchi from an upstart London shop into a global advertising powerhouse, it was the day the firm won the Conservative Party account. With Thatcher on the rise against a faltering minority Labour government, the brothers had identified a client with huge potential.\nAt the time the British political establishment considered negative campaigning to be vulgar or, even worse, American. But in keeping with the firm’s blithe disregard for convention, Saatchis came up with one of the most famous attack ads of all time. Part of a poster campaign that ran in the summer of 1978, it depicted a long queue of jobless Brits snaking into an employment office beneath the headline “Labour isn’t working”. It provoked a furious reaction. One government minister accused the Tories of “selling politics like soap powder”. The message might seem mild by today’s standards but in 1970s Britain it was considered crass.\nIt was also very effective. On the night of the 1979 election victory Conservative chairman Lord Thorneycroft​ publicly thanked Saatchi & Saatchi for winning the election. Muirhead dutifully argues Thatcher won the election. But he does acknowledge “Labour isn’t working” – voted poster of the century by Campaign magazine – “marked a sea change in political advertising because it was the first to adopt the aggressive marketing tactics which now characterise modern elections”. The poster also did wonders for its creators. “It took Saatchi & Saatchi from local obscurity in London to global recognition,” Muirhead says.\nAdvertising agencies in the 1970s were either “hotshops”, where it was all about coming up with unconventional ideas for edgier brands, or they were established houses that serviced their large corporate clients “nicely”. Saatchis aspired to be both. One of the first ads to put the fledgling agency on the map was a Sinclair creation known as “Pregnant man”. Created for the Health Education Council to encourage the use of contraceptives, it featured a picture of knocked-up chap and the words: “Would you be more careful if it was you that got pregnant?”.\nBut building a reputation for cutting edge work was not enough. Saatchis then embarked on an acquisition spree that made it the biggest firm in the world by 1984.\n“From the beginning they said they wanted to be number one in the whole world, which meant going up against agencies that had existed for the best part of a century,” Delaney says. “It seems far-fetched but within 10 years that is exactly what they had become. A huge part of that was their relationship with Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party. That helped to really put them on the map and legitimised them in the minds of big corporate entities like British Airways.”\nLanding BA in 1982 was a coup for an upstart agency. Britain’s national carrier was close to bankruptcy and was sacking tens of thousands of workers when Muirhead took over the account. “BA’s situation was so bad that we told them we couldn’t show planes or staff because it would upset people,” he says. Yet it was a high-profile company in a glamorous industry.\nThe airline’s faith was rewarded when Saatchis produced an ambitious Spielberg-esque ad showing Manhattan flying over Britain as people emerged from their houses to stare up in amazement. It featured the now-famous slogan “The world’s favourite airline”. Muirhead had come up with the highly successful concept after learning BA each year flew more passengers to more countries around the world than any other airline, including the population of Manhattan.\n“I remember presenting the ad to [BA chief] Colin Marshall and [chairman] Lord King, who were then running the airline. I got halfway through the storyboard and they asked, ‘How are you going to do this?’” he says. “I think they thought I was on drugs.” (The BA chiefs asked Muirhead the same question a couple of years later when he pitched the classic and very expensive “Face” ad, which featured an aerial view of a smiling face formed by a crowd of people.)\n'The figurehead, the suit, the brains, and me' Muirhead did not just observe Charles Saatchi’s relentless push for world domination. He ran the New York office, managed the entire business and duchessed countless clients. When the brothers eventually lost control of the business and formed breakaway firm M&C Saatchi in 1995, Muirhead was one of five founding partners. Twenty years later, four of the partners still share a seventh-floor office in Golden Square.\n“There’s Maurice (the figurehead), David Kershaw (the other suit), Jeremy Sinclair (the brains, genuinely a genius, no ego) and me,” Muirhead says. Charles, who made headlines in 2013 when he was photographed with his hand locked around the neck of his then-wife Nigella Lawson, sold out to focus on his art collection and gallery.\nIt is not hard to see why Muirhead has succeeded in advertising. Dapper and charming, he is also self-deprecating, a character trait not always found in successful ad executives. Once asked, “Who would play you in a movie?” by Campaign magazine, Muirhead replied “Sir Les Patterson”. He will occasionally make light of his importance to the firm by signing off emails to the other M&C Saatchi partners as “Pete” in a reference to Pete Best, the fifth Beatle. “I’m not perfect,” he says. “I’ve made loads of mistakes. I still haven’t been found out, as far as I know.”\nMuirhead, who describes himself as over 65, has thrived in England. He lives in Kent with his English wife Jeanne – the couple have three adult sons – and also keeps an apartment in St James’s Square in central London. Outside work he skis, plays tennis and goes mountain biking.\nHe recently completed the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage trail in northern Spain. He speaks with an English accent and boasts a contact book that includes a who’s who of Britain. As president of the invitation-only 30 Club, whose members are drawn from the top media, advertising and marketing groups, Muirhead was able to convince Cameron, Prince William and David Miliband​ to be guest speakers.\nHis associates say his achievements are due partly to his roots. “Bill has that Australian ability to be very direct when he needs to be but he’s also good at building a team around him,” Crosby says. Downer says Muirhead’s extensive network stems from his down-to-earth “way with people, which is characteristically Australian”.\nMuirhead says it’s hard for an Australian not to be liked in London. “People love us here,” he says. “Also [Brits] don’t know what suburbs we come from or what school we come from. So you can walk into Buckingham Palace or Downing Street or somewhere in the Old Kent Road and you are fine. English people are a bit uncomfortable out of their little zones. Being Australian and working here, without a doubt, is an advantage.”\nMuirhead, who flies back to Australia once or twice a year, owns a house in the Sydney harbourside suburb of McMahons Point. He used to have a farm in South Australia but sold it after his parents died. “Both sides of the family go back to the 1800s in South Australia,” he says. “We are genuine OAFs (old Adelaide families). Doing this [agent-general] job helps me keep a connection. I love South Australia and I’ll always be Australian. It’s just worked out that I’ve spent most of my working life overseas.”\n﻿ Gin and tonics with the Thatchers Muirhead nominates his role as agent-general as one of his biggest achievements. The other big source of professional pride has been his work on Conservative election campaigns stretching back to Thatcher’s first victory in 1979. He once spent a day at 10 Downing Street sipping gin and tonics with senior Saatchis executive Tim Bell, Thatcher and her husband Denis. When he refused the offer of another drink because he’d “had enough”, Denis replied: “Don’t be stupid. There’s never enough in this house.”\nWhile Saatchis didn’t get to work on every subsequent Tory campaign, it is a relationship Muirhead describes as special. “The reason why political accounts are the best in the world is because the issues are big, the results are immediate and you will help change the world. And you will probably do your best work.”\nThis is certainly true with Muirhead. While he was involved around the edges of Thatcher’s campaigns, he was front and centre when it came to Major. As Saatchis’ new managing director, his first big achievement was winning the account in the first place. The Tories wanted a clean break from anyone linked to the Thatcher era but Muirhead talked them into allowing the firm to pitch. At the presentation, Sinclair told them it was not enough that Major was a “nice guy”, he had to either “kill or be killed”. Saatchis got the job.\nDuring the 1992 campaign, which the polls predicted Labour to win, Saatchis did a poster with the headline “Labour’s tax bombshell”. Underneath, on an image of a bomb, was written, “You’ll pay £1250 more tax a year under Labour”.\nToday, ad agencies play a comparatively limited part in elections. A new generation of strategists, researchers and communications professionals control a party’s message, particularly around election time. And the rise of social media means these political professionals can use many ways of getting the message across.\nIn the case of the recent Salmond “pocket ad”, Crosby says the idea of linking “the risk to the economy of a Labour government” to the SNP came from the party machine’s research. It was the agency’s job to come up with a striking image. Yet when Major was running for office the tax bombshell idea originated from the agency. With little in the way of competing media platforms, the agency helped turn around the campaign by pushing the tax line right up until election day. It was integral to the strategy.\n“To my mind it was the year that advertising and the impact of Saatchi & Saatchi and their strategic thinking and their discipline and their creativity played a huge and critical role,” Delaney says. “And that was the one that Bill was at the helm of. He was in charge that year.”\nOn the night of Major’s election victory, Muirhead did something strange. He caught a black cab across London to the Labour Party headquarters. He had some friends working for the opposition and was wondering “what the other guys must have been thinking”.\nIt was about 2.30am and Muirhead just sat in the cab for five minutes before going home to Kent. “I don’t know why I did that,” he says. It seems likely the fear of failure had something to do with it. Ask Muirhead to talk about what makes his industry tick and he nominates loss.\n“The lifeblood of advertising is new business,” he says. “The moment you stop winning new business you are dead. It’s a fact of life you don’t keep your clients forever. You have to be hungry.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "http://www.southaustraliagov.co.uk/about_us/453,south-australia-club"], "published": "2015-08-26T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:09:23.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
