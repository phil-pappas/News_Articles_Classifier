PUBLISHED: 19:12,   19:14, Sun, Aug 2, 2015 GETTY Bank lending to businesses will increase throughout the year The EY ITEM Club forecast for financial services said at the start of the financial crisis in 2008, lending to firms peaked at £575billion, but has dropped every year since then. The report said growth this year will be marginal at just 0.25 per cent compared with last year, but the figure is expected to continue rising over the next four years, up to 25 per cent higher than 2014 levels. Lending in the second half of this year needs to be just 3 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago for business lending figures to grow overall this year, it added. Gross lending for the first half of this year is up 19 per cent to £103.4billion on a year ago, and is expected to pick up further, the report said.
