Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi Former Telstra chief executive David Thodey has been appointed chairman of the CSIRO.\nThe Minister for Industry and Science, Ian Macfarlane, announced the appointment, alongside Mr Thodey, at CSIRO's Food Innovation Centre at Werribee on Thursday.\nMr Thodey was chief executive of Telstra from May 2009 to April 2015, and prior to that had a 22-year career with IBM, working in senior marketing and sales positions, including as chief executive of IBM Australia/New Zealand.\nHis five-year appointment as chairman of Australia's national science agency begins in November. The CSIRO board has seven members, including Mr Thodey and chief executive Larry Marshall, who began his term in January.\n\"I feel privileged and honoured to be asked to contribute to the future of the CSIRO, an outstanding community of researchers and scientists,\" said Mr Thodey.\n\"We as a nation have an important opportunity to collaborate across the research community and industry to improve Australia's global competitiveness. This is essential for the future of our country.\n\"Consistent with the new CSIRO vision, I hope that the CSIRO can be a catalyst for innovation across key focus industries and the wider community. We must make sure that Australia remains a global leader in the areas of science, research and industry innovation.\"\nMr Macfarlane described Mr Thodey as \"one of Australia's most well-known and respected businessmen ... he will bring a wealth of industry acumen to Australia's peak science agency as it plays an increasingly central role in maximising our economic opportunities and industry growth.\"\n He said Australia needed to lift the rate of collaboration between industry and researchers.\n\"CSIRO is at the heart of this process and Mr Thodey's appointment to work alongside our nation's most respected scientists will further enhance our record on collaboration and commercialisation.\n\"Mr Thodey is an innovative Australian businessman and an experienced board chairman and senior executive who offers expertise in management, corporate and government relations, information and communications technology, and sales and marketing.\n\"Mr Thodey's experience in building business networks will be valuable to CSIRO as it implements its new 2020 Strategy.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@cauchis"], "published": "2015-08-06T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T07:02:31.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
