It was scheduled to cease production in 2008, but GM has repeatedly moved that date. In 2012, it was set to close in 2013. Most recently, it was expected to shut down in 2016. \nThe consolidated line also produces the previous generation Chevrolet Impala. The flex line, GM's other Oshawa line, produces the current model Impala, Buick Regal, Chevrolet Camaro and Cadillac XTS. \n\"This new investment represents a very effective way for us to meet strong demand for the Chevrolet Equinox and it's positive news for our community,\" said Steve Carlisle, president of GM Canada, in a release. \n(Reporting by Allison Martell; Editing by Alan Crosby) Company Earnings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T21:34:06.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
