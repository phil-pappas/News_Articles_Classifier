Peter Rae/Fairfax Media by Carrie LaFrenz Finding investments that can deliver returns despite the weak economic growth has become the holy grail for investors of all shapes and sizes, from super funds to mums and dads. But spotting those opportunities is not easy, or for the fainthearted.\nFemale-led investment firm Arete Investment Partners is hunting for those returns in the small and mid-cap sector, where risks and returns can be great.\nBut to achieve this the one-year-old boutique firm, led by Jacqueline Fernley and Kelli Meagher, will focus only on firms that it says are in control of their own destiny. The portfolio will hold about 40 stocks at any one time and the pair will not invest in any companies that have been loss-making in the previous three years, have low liquidity or are highly leveraged.\nMeagher, a former fund manager at Northcape Capital and an analyst and fund manager at AMP Capital, says the fund stays away from companies whose fortunes are tied to certain events – such as the approval of a new drug by the Federal Drug Administration in the United States – or speculation, such as a company digging for gold.\n\"We have 40 years' investment experience between the two of us and we have specialised in small and mid caps for most of our careers,\" she says.\n\"Our edge is you can have the facts but really it is about insights and interpretation of those facts.\"\nNot in control Fernley says the firm excludes two-thirds of the index ex-50 \"because they are not in control of their future\".\n \"You want the decisions you make to be successful based on that investment thesis playing out. Where there are things that occur that we call sideswipes, which come from left field and blow you up, often those things are like weather or FDA approvals,\" she says.\nFernley and Meagher use a bottom-up strategy, whereby they focus less on economic or sectoral trends and more on specific companies whose stock is expected to achieve better than the average market return.\nThey believe it's a crucial approach in the currently environment.\n\"It's a really strong consensus view that we are in a low-growth environment globally,\" says Fernley, who was formerly head of research and a director at Wilson HTM and led the investment team at Magellan Financial Group.\n\"So for super funds to deliver the investment returns to their clients, they need to start think differently in how they place their investments. It is not going to be such an easy run to do the same things as they did for the last 10 years because you won't get the returns.\n\"You must look for companies that are growing regardless of the global environment and that's what we do best.\"\nMeagher adds: \"Bottom-up stock picking is as important as ever right now.\"\nHigher dividend yield Morgan Stanley says the ASX top 50 has a higher dividend yield at 4.8 per cent but dividend and earnings growth are at the lower end of the spectrum, at 3.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively.\nHowever, in the small to mid-cap space, dividend yield is slightly lower, at 3.5 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively. But dividends and earnings are growing at a much greater rate, of 9.4 per cent and 11 per cent for mid caps and 9 per cent and 30 per cent for small caps.\n\"If you buy and hold the right companies, the investor is much better off over time,\" Fernley says.\nArete is overweight in ResMed, Super Retail, Domino's and Veda.\nThe firm is backed by Fidante, with seed capital from Challenger Financial, including a five-year working capital facility. The founders have been running a portfolio since November, and say performance is ahead of expectations but won't reveal a figure. Other boutique funds that sit under the Challenger incubator arm include WaveStone, Alphinity and NovaPort.\nThe seed to start Arete was sown on a trip to Thailand, where the pair talked business, life and values.\n\"We took a walk on the beach and talked about investing and the most appropriate product for today,\" Meagher says. \"We talked about how important culture is to a successful business and the type of business we wanted to create.\"\nIn five years Arete's goal is to have $1 billion under management – half-way to its capacity of $2 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:10:29.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
