It says that consumers have been faced with significant bills - one man said he was charged £12,000 for his daughter's use of a mobile phone taken out in his name in Egypt - and that there are large disparities in tariffs charged between operators. It is calling for an industry-wide cap on data roaming charges around the world. \nHere we offer advice on what you can do to minimise your bill while staying connected this summer. \n= What is data roaming? = \nData roaming is your tablet or phone’s use of a mobile network it does not own to send and receive data. It is how mobile users are able to surf the internet, download emails and music, refresh social media feeds, and upload pictures to Instagram, Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) or Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) while abroad. However, the charges for doing this can be very high. \n= How much does it cost? = \nWithin the EU, data roaming charges are capped as follows, plus VAT where it applies. \nOutgoing voice calls (per minute) - €0.19 \nIncoming (Other OTC: ICNN - news ) voice calls (per minute) €0.05 \nOutgoing texts (per SMS message) €0.06 \nOnline (data download, per MB*) €0.20 \nSee here for the source of these figures on the EU website . \nThey are also expected to be further reduced in April 2016, and abolished entirely by 2017. The EU does not expect that this abolition will lead to more expensive charges at home. \nHowever, no such caps exist outside the EU, and tariffs can vary dramatically between country and mobile phone operator. Charges are typically £6-£8 per megabyte and a MB doesn’t get you very far at all, especially with the use of picture-heavy social media and news websites. \nMobile operators are obliged to apply a cut-off limit once users have run up about €50 (around £49 including VAT) of data per month, wherever they travel in the world. However, there are some catches: signing up for a data bundle add-on for a block of data may automatically opt a user out of this cut-off. And even if a mobile phone owner agrees to waive the cap intentionally, enormous bills may accumulate as a result. \nThere have been numerous horror stories of holidaymakers running up bills into the thousands: last year, Telegraph Travel reported on a family left with a bill of nearly £3,000 after a daughter used her mother’s phone to check Facebook while in Turkey. \n= When might I not realise I’m using data roaming? = \nMany apps, especially those for news and social media, download the latest data in the background, even if they are not in active use. Instant messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger also use data. The Citizens’ Advice Bureau is calling for a cap on non-EU data roaming across the mobile industry: it says it has seen cases of military personnel left with bills of thousands even when they have not used their phones heavily but simply because apps are downloading background data. \n= How can I avoid these charges? = \n= Turn off roaming = \nThe easiest way to avoid passive or active data download while abroad is to turn off data roaming. Mobile models vary, but the below screenshots show how to do this on an iPhone 5. \nGo to Settings > Cellular > and switch the “Data Roaming” and “Cellular Data” options from green (on) to white (off). This will prevent any apps from downloading data without you knowing, and will prevent you from being charged to access the Internet or social media sites. \n= Restrict your internet usage to Wi-Fi = \nYou can still perform all the functions you use data for at home surfing the Internet, video, photo and music upload and download, for example via Wi-Fi. Connection speeds can be ropey in remote areas or where thick walls, high user numbers or poor positioning of the router mean the signal is weak, but bearing this may be preferable to paying for expensive data usage. Most of Telegraph Travel's recommended hotels have free Wi-Fi for guests - so see our recommendations in favourite holiday destinations such as the Turquoise Coast , and Provence , and it is increasingly common in cafes and restaurants throughout the world. \nThink carefully, however, before transferring highly sensitive data using a Wi-Fi connection, such as banking details or your location. Prefer if possible Wi-Fi that is secured by a password. \n• Roamer: the app that could put an end to roaming charges \n= Buy a data bundle = \nThese are packages, sometimes called “add-ons”, that offer a set limit of data 100MB, 2GB, etc to be used abroad within a specified timeframe. On some plans, such as 4GEE and T-Mobile, users will be notified once the allowance paid for expires or is used up (whichever comes first) and they will not be able to access the internet until another bundle is purchased. \nOn other providers, customers may still have to keep an eye on data usage (a mobile network provider app will typically have usage trackers) to avoid being charged standard roaming rates once the bundle has been used up. Avoid downloading films, video and music while abroad, which will use up your data in a flash. \nEE has an interactive tool that allows customers to see how much data will cost them depending on where they will be travelling. For a search for the UAE for T-Mobile customers, for example, it shows that it costs £1.50/minute to make calls, and provides a range of data add-on options (which you can only actually purchase once abroad). See more at ee.co.uk/help/add-ons-benefits-and-plans/call-or-going-abroad/roaming and explore.ee.co.uk/roaming . It has also recently launched a Europe data bundle that offers unlimited calls, texts and a data allowance for £4 per day in Eurozone countries, including 4G (where available). \nVodafone WorldTraveller ’s add-on system allows users to take the minutes, texts and data from their UK contract to 30 countries, including India, the USA, South Africa and New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) Zealand for £5 extra a day. Be warned that you will be charged the usual high roaming charges if you exceed your standard UK allowance. \nThere is a similar plan available for Europe, Vodafone EuroTraveller , for £3 per day. \nO2 also has an interactive tool, but it is less user-friendly than the EE version, and add-on options are less numerous. It says that its “Data Abroad Bolt On” allows users 200MB of data a month for £120 less than the £1,200 if one were to use data at the standard tariff of £6/MB outside of Europe, but still a lot of money. \nFor travel within Europe, customers can use “ O2 Travel ”, which allows use of data for £1.99 per day with no upper limit, although it says that data speeds will vary with usage. It includes Switzerland and Norway but not Turkey. \n• Data roaming: the best mobile phone tariffs \n= Use apps that don’t use data = \nBefore you leave the UK, download apps that you can use abroad that do not require an Internet connection and therefore do not need data to function. \nThe Telegraph Travel Guides app contains guides to 23 destinations including Venice, Paris, New York, Rio de Janeiro and Hong Kong. It lets users navigate maps and explore sights, restaurants, shops and hotels by GPS, without using data. \nCurrency converter XE.com needs an internet connection for the latest rates, but it caches exchange rates too, meaning that it can still be used to get a rough idea of how much something will cost without using data. \nGoogle Maps can also be saved as offline versions while you still have access to the internet, for usage when you don’t. Full instructions can be found on the Google Support website . \nAlternatives to Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) include CoPilot for driving navigation and CityMaps2Go , which combines detailed maps with travel tips for cities including New York and Paris. \nWhen you download a map for later offline usage, switch your phone to “airplane mode” and check it opens correctly to test that it will work once you have data roaming switched off. \nSee more advice on the best travel apps that don't use data roaming . \n= Use a local SIM card = \nIf you are travelling for anything more than a few days and know you will be making lots of calls and texts, and using lots of data, it is worth investing in a local SIM card, so you are charged at local rates rather than roaming rates. \nDonald Strachan, who has written extensively on travel technology for Telegraph Travel, has offered advice on the best local SIMs in European countries such as France, Italy and Spain, and the best local SIMs for travelling with iPads and MiFi (a portable device allowing several users to share a 3G or 4G internet connection \n= Turn off your voicemail = \nAlthough call charges are capped within the EU, checking your voicemail can be charged at extortionate rates in other areas of the world. Speak to your mobile provider and check details of your specific handset to work out how to turn off your voicemail while travelling. \n= Switch to Three = \nThree's \" Feel at Home \" service allows its customers to use data, call and text functions just as they do at home as part of their normal contract plan in 18 countries, including Australia, France, Italy, the USA, New Zealand and Indonesia. Excluded are calls to numbers that start with 070, 09 and 118 directory services. If you have an all-you-can-eat data package, you can use up to 25GB. \n• Data roaming: how to get the best download speed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:00:48.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
