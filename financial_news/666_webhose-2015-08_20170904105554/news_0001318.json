Photo: Peter Braig\nTelstra is set to have a tough year ahead thanks to rising competition, according to leading analysts and investors.\nAustralia's largest telecommunications giant on Thursday announced a solid set of results with net profits of $4.23 billion and a 1¢ increase to its fully franked dividend to 30.5¢ a share.\nBut Telstra chief executive Andy Penn also used his first annual results in the top job to tell shareholders he would protect the telco's mobile dominance – even if it eroded revenues and profit margins.\nThe move has left analysts and investors expecting a muted financial year 2016 result as Singtel-Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia ramp up the pressure on Telstra's vital mobiles division , which makes up 41 per cent of total revenue.\nShareholders responded to rising competition concerns and the lack of a buyback or special dividend by sending Telstra's shares down 16¢ to $6.08 a share.\n\"We expect Telstra to have to continue to spend to protect its subscriber base in the face of more intense competition,\" Credit Suisse analyst Fraser McLeish said. \"We therefore forecast mobile costs to increase 6.3 per cent in FY16 and for mobile margins to decline to 38.4 per cent.\"\nMacquarie Wealth Management warned clients to expect tough times ahead for several of Telstra's divisions and reduced its rating of the company to \"underperform.\"\n\"Recent results have delivered a comfort factor for investors – whether it be through upbeat trends in mobiles or even the stabilisation of poorer performing segments,\" it told clients. \"This type of comfort factor was absent from this result for us.\n\"Heading into FY16 we expect slowing growth rates from mobiles given increasing competition; fixed to remain under pressure due to NBN related costs, line losses and rejuvenated competitors.\"\nUBS analyst Eric Choi maintained his sell rating on Telstra despite the company making slightly more in net profits than forecast.\n\"We recognise Telstra has appeal in the current environment with a circa 5 per cent net dividend yield,\" he said. \"However, on most fundamental yardsticks the Telstra valuation looks full.\n\"Protecting the core domestic business remains critical: as mobile competitive pressure continues to build, NBN will increasingly level the playing field in fixed and competitors look to challenge Telstra share at the lower-end of corporate /enterprise.\"\nBut Nomura Securities analyst Sachin Gupta was far more positive on the telco and reiterated his buy rating with a target price of $6.60 a share.\n\"There isn't much to fault in Telstra's second half 2015 results, which are again consistent and compelling,\" he said. \"These dynamics are as strong as one can find for any regional incumbent telco, and its 16-17 price to earnings ratio is at par with integrated telcos.\n\"The questions will be on profitability, monetisation and opportunity cost of this cash use – but Telstra appears to be managing all this well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:54:00.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
