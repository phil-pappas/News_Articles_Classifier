Andrew Quilty by Ron Ashkenas and Matthew Mccreight Many of us are familiar with the concept of \"Getting to Yes,\" an iconic negotiation strategy developed by Harvard professor Roger Fisher and others. For many managers, however, the more difficult day-to-day challenge is \"getting to no\" - which is what we call the process for agreeing on what not to do.\n\"Getting to no\" is a classic management issue because the vast majority of us tend to accept requests and assignments without first filtering them by what's possible, what's urgent and what's less of a priority. In an age when we are encouraged to be \"team players,\" it may seem counter-intuitive to tell managers to say no more often, but that's exactly what many need to do. While saying yes to every assignment may initially please senior executives, it usually leaves people over-stressed and inundated with work - a lot of which ends up half-finished or forgotten. In the long run, no one is happy.\nCounter-productive In one media company, the senior executive team developed a three-year strategy for getting ahead of the increasingly digital and socially driven media environment. They assigned different pieces of it to middle managers. But since the managers didn't drop anything else from their plates, the entire endeavour was akin to an after-school elective - something that had to done once all the regular work was completed - and not much was actually accomplished.\nA more productive approach might have been for one or more of the overloaded middle managers to organise a meeting with the head of strategy, the chief executive and other senior executives. As a group, they could have talked about the common dilemma they all were facing and considered either reducing their other assignments or changing timelines.\nBudgeting your time Similarly, a technology firm hired a new president for one of its regions to jump-start local sales growth. Once she arrived, a dozen different leaders, from marketing to information technology to research and development, invited her to meet with their teams. Meanwhile, the chief executive kept asking her to come back to headquarters to update the corporate leadership team. After six months of saying yes to every meeting, the constant travel had begun to take its toll. She had a much better understanding of the company, but she had made no progress at all on the growth objective.\nAs an alternative, she might have established a \"calendar budget\" for herself from the beginning - with a commitment to spend only a certain amount of time away from the region, and a focused amount of time on the growth challenge. Then she would have had a good rationale for postponing some of the \"get to know you\" trips and meetings until she had a solid plan for addressing her most significant business issues.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

What's worth remembering is that learning how to \"get to no\" is critical for both your success and your company's. organisational effectiveness requires trade-offs. Managers aren't responsible for pleasing everyone. If a new project becomes top priority, managers need to ask what trade-off should be made to accommodate it. And it's important to engage in these dialogues regularly.\nIt's OK to raise questions and push back on assignments and requests, even if you're answering to powerful people. Ask senior leaders whether a new assignment takes precedence over some other project that's already in your portfolio, and if so, how should you let people know about the change of timing and shift of resources. You also could ask how the new project fits with the broader strategy. Senior leaders may not have thought every scenario through, so raising these issues can be a constructive approach to exploring what needs to be done.\nSure, it's easier to just say \"yes\" in the short-term; but taking on an assignment that you don't have the time for, or one that will compromise other key goals, won't make anyone feel good about you in the long run - and it won't help your organisation. That's why \"getting to no\" is such a critical challenge to master.\nRon Ashkenas is a managing partner of Schaffer Consulting.
