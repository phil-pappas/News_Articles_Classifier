However, the aircraft with the new interior is only available three times per week till now. As two-thirds of KLM's Boeing 777-200 fleet has been refurbished, we can offer a consistent upgraded product on a daily basis. This once again underlines the importance Ghana plays in the KLM's worldwide network,' Axel Metselaar said. \nHe added that by the end of 2015, a total of 15 Boeing 777-200 in KLM's fleet should be refurbished. \nIn March 2013, KLM introduced this new World Business Class interior aboard its Boeing 777. Currently, 10 out of 15 aircraft of this type in KLM's fleet have been refurbished. The Amsterdam-Accra-Amsterdam route has been specially selected to have this new refitted product on a daily basis from August 17 and onwards. \nThe 15 Boeing 777-200 will all be equipped with both new cabins by the end of 2015, according to the management. \nBY Samuel Boadi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T04:38:14.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
