The country is also a big consumers of agriculture and manufactured products from Rwanda. \nRe-exports to Burundi and DRC have fallen in the first six months. \nMinerals, the country's second foreign revenue earner, have not been doing well either. The prices of wolfram, cassiterite and coltan -- Rwanda's leading mineral exports dipped by 31 per cent. Output also reduced as jittery mineral exporters reduced production. \n\"Industry revenues are going down drastically and some miners are laying off employees while putting on hold recruitment plans because of difficulties in paying staff,\" said Jean Malic Kalima, the managing director of Wolfram Mining Company Ltd and chairperson of the Rwanda Mining Association. \nJob creation \nThis is another concern for policy makers given the country's plans to create 200,000 jobs annually to absorb hundreds of unemployed youths. Mining employs over 33,000 workers. \n\"Since last October, we have not had stable prices; the rate at which prices are dropping has worried miners,\" added Mr Kalima. \nHowever, miners are also blaming their profitability woes on what they call high traceability fees introduced by agencies that track conflict minerals. \nThe Great Lakes region has been in the spotlight over conflict minerals, coming from the DRC, with tracking agencies such as ETR-ITSCI introducing mineral tagging. \nAlthough the government can do little to influence global prices, it is, however, trying to do some advocacy for a reduction in traceability fees. \n\"Although it is good to comply with traceability standards, it is better to see a reduction or complete elimination of traceability charges; we are engaged with regional and international agencies to ensure this is realised,\" said Evode Imena, the State Minister for Mining.
