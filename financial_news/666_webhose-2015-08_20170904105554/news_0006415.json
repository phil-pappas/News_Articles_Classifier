We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?\nI’m a doctor working in the NHS , about two years from finishing training to become a consultant.\nI have been offered an opportunity to work in the private sector in the research and development section of a large pharmaceutical company. The perks would be better pay – I’m being offered more than double the salary I would earn in the NHS – and sociable working hours. On top of this all my professional subscriptions and registration fees would paid by the company.\nThe work sounds interesting – a project based on various different bits of research and new drugs.\nCurrently I find my work as a doctor very unsatisfactory. I enjoy patient interaction and all the clinical stuff but it’s repetitive and almost like pattern recognition. The stress and long hours aren’t a problem, it’s the ennui that is getting to me. My day-to-day ward work is basically looking after elderly patients whose main problem is social – they need a residential home etc. and are better looked after by a social worker.\nMy non-medical friends think I’m crazy for not just jumping ship. My doctor friends are split – some say go for it and “I’m so jealous” and some say stay and finish your training. Do I just take this job and run, taking the incumbent risks or stick out the next two years and see how it goes?\nDo you need advice on a work issue?
