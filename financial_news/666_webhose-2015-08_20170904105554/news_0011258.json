I explained that\nthe wave of activism has increased within the retail and restaurant sector and while the glare of REIT gold may seem attractive to many, the aura is less appealing when compared to the life cycle of the business operation that ultimately is reflected in the underlying value of the company. My argument – that converting to a REIT for the sake of monetizing the real estate – is often a foolish tool for financially engineering a C-Corps balance sheet that doesn’t necessarily create long-term shareholder value. I explained that companies that can withstand the relentless competition are better equipped to maintain financial flexibility , and not having to fire-sale the fortress. Today the Wall Street Journal reported that McDonald’s Corp . (MCD) and an activist investor (Glenview Capital Management) are looking for ways to inflate the Golden Arches by tapping the real estate piggybank. According to the WSJ “McDonald’s could unlock at least $20 billion in value if it were to spin off its U.S. real estate” into a REIT. Forbes Real Estate Investor Earn safe, reliable income with the help of veteran real estate expert Brad Thomas in Forbes' newest advisory Forbes Real Estate Investor . As I suggested in my recent article, there are some challenges to spinning off the real estate into a REIT structure. As I explained, the REIT will have to hire a management team to run the real estate operations and that is generally difficult given the fact that most of the properties will be leased to a one tenant concept”.Should McDonald’s unload the real estate in a REIT vehicle, it will essentially have one tenant that sub-leases to thousands of franchisees. McDonald’s would receive rent checks from the franchisees and then payout a lesser amount to the REIT.Because McDonald’s real estate empire has such a low basis there is likely to be a nice spread (difference between franchisee rent and rent paid to the REIT) but most of the rental proceeds must be paid out to the REIT in order to be competitive in its dividend payouts.According to SNL Financial, the average dividend yield of the Net Lease REIT sector is 5.04 % (as per July 31 st ) and that means that the McDonald’s REIT would need to payout out substantial earnings (or AFFO) to maintain a competitive payout.Of course, because McDonald’s is now the Landlord to thousands of sites it must also maintain the sites (for the franchisees) and that means the prospects for monetizing $20 billion are less likely. If the new REIT forked out the dough for renovations McDonald’s would have to pay higher rent and of course that will mean the franchisee will get squeezed.But maybe the franchisees are already squeezed?It’s widely known fact that McDonald’s is in the real estate business, not the hamburger business. In the book “McDonald’s Behind the Arches” by John F. Love the author explained, The beauty of McDonald’s taking a “sandwich” position on real estate – leasing from the property owner and subleasing to the franchisee – was that it produced predictable profits. He went on to say, In subleasing the store to the franchisee, he (Ray Kroc) marked up McDonald’s lease costs, initially by 20 percent and then by 40 percent...That was the deal …take it or leave it…that was the rent”. The McDonald’s franchisees don’t have a choice and according to Love the leases are NN meaning the franchisee also pays for taxes and insurance.Assuming McDonald’s spins off its franchisee-leased real estate the “landlord” control goes away. Love explains, Kroc and Sonneborn (McDonald’s first chief executive) believed the control of the real estate also gave McDonad’s the type of control over the franchisee that it wanted but could not get from a franchisee agreement. By spinning off the franchise-leased assets McDonald’s would be not only walking away from an incredible cash cow, but also bifurcating the control factor that the global hamburger empire was built on.Even if a proposed McDonald’s REIT formed, the franchise leases would be considerably above market and it would be challenging for McDonald’s to conduct arm’s length transactions with franchisees. Many of the relationships go back many decades and the complications would be extraordinary.So why is the REIT structure being discussed?That simple. By spinning the real estate into a REIT, McDonald’s can monetize its real estate empire and avoid paying the huge capital gains tab. Not to worry though.The IRS will eventually get paid. The McDonald’s REIT would payout at least 90 percent of net income in the form of dividends so there’s really no free lunch.What about monetizing the real estate using the IRS 1031 exchange rules?That’s also a possibility but McDonald’s has two problems. First, the company should think about sooner than later. I’m writing an article now (for Forbes) on the possibility of Congress chocking the property exchange laws as part of the broad tax reform mandates. Secondly, McDonald’s would need to essentially swap out its real estate by replacing it with similar income producing properties.Obviously, it would not makes sense for McDonald’s to sell its real estate and then reinvest the proceeds into a portfolio of Walgreens or CVS properties.Perhaps a better idea is for McDonald’s to sell a portion of its assets to a REIT. Realty Income (O) is armed with $2 billion of liquidity and could easily digest a large portfolio of McDonald’s owned real estate using a sale/leaseback structure. STORE Capital (STOR) would also be a logical buyer with liquidity of around $500 million.It’s seems like a more tactical approach but McDonald’s to sell (and lease back to a REIT) the corporately-owned real estate and redeploy the proceeds into new (and more profitable) franchisee deals (including relocations), essentially dodging the tax man while reinvesting into new store growth that generates outsized returns (the franchisees have no choice so the profit margins are super-sized).The bottom line is that there the REIT path could provide much needed liquidity for shares in the Golden Arches, but I’m not sold on the REIT-burger happy meal. I believe that selling to a REIT is a much better solution and I’m sure the legendary founder, Ray Kroc, would agree.For more information on my monthly newsletter CLICK HERE .\nThe author owns O.\nBrad Thomas is the Editor of the Forbes Real Estate Investor and writes for Forbes.com and Seeking Alpha.
