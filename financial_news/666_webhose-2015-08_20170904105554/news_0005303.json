Tomohiro Ohsumi by Toru Fujioka Japan's economy contracted last quarter as consumers and businesses cut spending and exports tumbled, putting pressure on the prime minister to return his focus to Abenomics.\nGross domestic product fell an annualized 1.6 per cent from January-March, ending two quarters of growth, the Cabinet Office said on Monday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a 1.8 per cent drop.\nThe slump in the private-sector demand came as exports to the U.S., Asia, and Europe fell, undercutting a support for the world's third-biggest economy. Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda is counting on weakness to fade this quarter as he chases a distant 2 per cent inflation target with unprecedented monetary stimulus.\n\"There was nothing good in today's GDP data,\" said Hideo Kumano, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute and a former BOJ official. \"Private consumption was very weak, while exports also weakened, reflecting a slowdown in emerging economies, especially China.\"\nThe slump is a setback for Shinzo Abe, whose support has suffered as he's championed unpopular defense bills and the restart of nuclear reactors. Abe made reviving the economy a priority when he took office in December 2012, advocating reflationary policies that weakened the yen and spurred corporate profits.\nAbe's efforts to increase long-term growth prospects -- the \"third arrow\" of his Abenomics program -- have \"slowed to a crawl,\" say economists Marcel Thieliant and Mark Williams at Capital Economics.\nChina Devaluation Consumption dropped for the first time in four quarters, reflecting the effects of poor weather and as consumers try to cope with last year's sales-tax hike and pay that hasn't kept pace with rising living costs.\n Exports fell 4.4 per cent from previous quarter, the steepest decline since 2011.\nThe economy is flashing warnings that the weakness could persist. Consumer confidence fell in July to the lowest in six months. Inventories climbed to the highest since 2009 in June, pressuring manufacturers to curtail production.\nThe stumble comes as China -- Japan's biggest trading partner -- is fighting off its own slowdown, with a currency devaluation last week that triggered convulsions in global markets and adds to challenges for Japanese officials in reflating the economy.\nSumitomo Metal Mining Co., Japan's biggest nickel producer, this month cut its profit forecast as slower Chinese demand weakens commodity prices.\nAbe faces a party leadership election next month amid declining public support. More people disapproved his cabinet than approved in August, for the first time since his premiership in 2012, according to public broadcaster NHK.\nGovernor Kuroda said last month he didn't think Japan's slowdown would continue from July, and earlier this month said recent weakness in industrial production and exports would be temporary.\nCentral Bank Japan \"need not worry\" about China's currency devaluation of the yuan because it can always offset the effects by easing monetary policy, said Koichi Hamada, an adviser to Abe.\nEconomists surveyed before Monday's data didn't foresee a strong bounce. Japan's economy will grow 2 per cent from July to September, according to the median estimate of economists.\n\"Government and BOJ officials are likely to emphasize growth rates should be averaged out,\"said Yoshiki Shinke, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. \"Even so, economic data show that it's getting difficult to say Japan is recovering now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:56:03.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
