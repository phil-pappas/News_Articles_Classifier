As you are aware, records are being checked right now, not only in the oil sector, but also in the various departments of government. \n\"So, Mr President is really interested in what has happened to the equipment that have supposedly been bought and supplied, some of which might be there on the ground and might not be. Only a thorough audit will actually reveal this. The disclosure has been made about substandard in the Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram\", Shehu said. \nWhile appraising the efforts so far made by the government to contain the insurgency, he said: \"President Muhammadu Buhari wants to urgently end Boko Haram.

And what we are witnessing now; that is, occasional bombings and suicide attacks, characterise only one thing globally. And that is that, the dying days of the insurgency.
