Instead it’s one of two things: you either don’t have enough mental or relationship capital, or you don’t have the right mental or relationship capital.In short, your Value Equation is broken. The Value Equation looks like this:Mental Capital X Relationship Capital = Financial CapitalIf you want more money (i.e. Financial Capital), you have to increase your mental capital, your relationship capital, or both.\nMental Capital Mental capital allows you to create value for others and can simply be defined as what you know. This could include your skill sets, education, experiences, insights, or any other type of knowledge. And it almost always involves specialization.No one person can be an expert on every topic, but you can be a foremost expert on one topic.So I recommend adding to your mental capital every day by spending time reading, watching or learning about your area of expertise.Mental capital is also in the context of our thoughts. Here’s an example in the financial world, since that’s my business: Rich Dad, Poor Dad , written by Robert Kiyosaki, is arguably the most influential financial book ever written. The book and its sequels have sold north of 26 million copies to date.Kiyosaki’s message changed the conversation from accumulation to cash flow. He recommended cash flow investments that make you richer each month as the checks come in. And he removed the golden halo that hovered over 401(k)s and mutual funds--which he did just in time.The DOW hit a record-high on January 14th, 2000, the same year that Oprah featured Rich Dad, Poor Dad . Fifteen years later to the day, the market had returned just 0.54% per year inflation-adjusted. That’s 12-times less than the 6-8% inflation-adjusted returns that mutual-fund peddlers promise.Fortunately for everyone who listened, Kiyosaki changed the context in which people think about investing and business for the better. Therefore he improved the mental capital of millions of people, myself included. Relationship Capital You already know that your business is dependent on your relationship with customers, but relationship capital extends even further than that.All wealth comes from conversations--and that’s why we should pay close attention to the conversations we’re having.There are some people that always seem to bring new insight, ideas, creativity, and support to conversations, while others bring scarcity-ridden complaints and negativity.I’m friends with the former, and friendly with the latter. I spend time with people who energize me and help me live a life of abundance, and I stop saying “yes” to invitations from people who only bring me down.When you protect your conversations like this, new relationships build and new opportunities develop.I’ve been doing this since my early twenties. I’d throw “parties” where I invited friends to come play Robert Kiyosaki’s board game, Cashflow. I knew whoever showed up for a night like that was someone I could learn and talk with and count on for support.For the same reasons, I built the Accredited Network, which is a group of professionals sharing the same wealth philosophy, but each with their own expertise.My knowledge is specialized in finance. Brett is a CPA with specialized knowledge of accounting and taxes. Andrew is an estate planning attorney with specialized knowledge of asset protection. Dale is a cash flow specialist, Ryan is an investment advisor, and so on.When we get together and have conversations, value just spills out. New business ideas and opportunities are constantly flowing. New introductions are always being made.Similarly, Robert Kiyosaki built the Rich Dad Advisors, a group of professionals who all share the same philosophy. There’s a business expert, a tax expert, a stock trading expert and more.If you wanted to build more wealth and financial capital, wouldn’t you want to be in a room with these kinds of people? Financial Capital If you want to be in a room full of people where value and opportunities are overflowing, simply follow the equation.Make sure that you’re always adding to your mental capital. The more you know and the more expertise you have in the correct context, the more value you can provide to others.The more value you can provide to others, the more relationship capital you can build. (Because high-value people are protective of their relationships, just like you want to be, and they typically don’t stick around people who don’t add value).When you do those two things, you’ve changed the inputs in the equation. Your mental capital goes up. Your relationship capital goes up. And as a result, your financial capital is going to explode higher. So your business’s money problem is not a money problem. The problem is in your value equation, and now you know how to fix it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T00:35:07.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
