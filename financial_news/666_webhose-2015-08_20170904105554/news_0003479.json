And these are the companies that influence your stock portfolio.\n\"The combination of Apple's size and price moves, results in an enormous impact on indices,\" says Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. Lately, Apple's influence has been a drag. Since closing at a record $US133 on February 23, Apple has slumped to $US116.53, wiping more than $US120 billion off the value of its stock. Between then and Tuesday's close, the Standard & Poor's 500, the most widely-tracked stock index, was down 0.8 per cent. Without Apple, the decline would have been 0.2 per cent, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, the company behind the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average. Of course, the opposite is also true, when Apple's shares rise, the market can get a lift. The impact of the technology giant is so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices has created a technology index that excludes Apple. That allows investors to separate what's going on with tech stocks from what's going on with Apple because, while they're similar, the two might not be the same. For example, the S&P 500 information technology sector is down 2.3 per cent since Apple's record close. Take out Apple and the group has actually gained 0.7 per cent. History suggests that companies as dominant as Apple don't tend to stay top dog for long. Competitors emerge, new products roll out, and growth can slow. Exxon Mobil, which Apple surpassed to become the biggest publicly-traded company in August 2011, has slumped over the past year along with the price of oil. To be sure, Exxon Mobil is still big, with a market value of $US323 billion, but it has slipped to third in the ranking of S&P heavyweights, behind Microsoft. In the early 1980s, computer company IBM was the stock market's big gun. Personal computers were still a new concept and IBM was one of the industry's dominant players. At the end of 1985, the company's stock made up 6.4 per cent of the S&P 500's total value, much bigger than Apple's current 3.6 per cent. Since then, the company has had to grapple with fierce competition from more nimble rivals. Like Exxon, Big Blue is still powerful, but it now ranks as the 28th largest in the S&P 500, making up 0.8 per cent of the index. Below are the five biggest companies in the S&P 500, ranked by market capitalisation, which is determined by shares outstanding multiplied by stock price. * APPLE Market Value: $US660 billion Weight in S&P: 3.6 per cent. * MICROSOFT Market Value: $US381 billion. Weight in S&P: 2.1 per cent. * EXXON MOBIL Market Value: $US323 billion Weight in S&P: 1.7 per cent. * WELLS FARGO Market Value: $US297 billion Weight in S&P: 1.5 per cent * JOHNSON & JOHNSON Market Value: $US279 billion. Weight in S&P: 1.5 per cent. * GENERAL ELECTRIC: Market Value: $US264 billion. Weight in S&P: 1.4 per cent.
