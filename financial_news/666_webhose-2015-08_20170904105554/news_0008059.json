Scott Barbour by Lucille Keen The union that helped the Andrews' Labor government get elected in Victoria, has backed down from a historical strike that was expected to see Melbourne's train network shutdown for the first time in 18 years.\nDespite the Rail, Tram and Bus Union cancelling Friday's four-hour strike and the two \"free travel days\" on Metro Trains, the strike on the tram network looks set go ahead on Friday.\nThe RTBU are embroiled in a bitter dispute with Metro Trains and Yarra Trams over two separate enterprise bargaining agreements.\nAppearing before Justice Debbie Mortimer in the Federal Court, RTBU lawyer Herman Borenstein, QC, said the union would agree to withdraw the planned \"free travel days\" and open gate days on the city's train network, which were scheduled for Wednesday and Friday.\nMetro Trains sought the interlocutory hearing to stop the free travel days, which would have costs millions of dollars in lost revenue.\nJust before midday on Tuesday, following pleas from the state government, the union announced it would also withdraw the strike action against Metro.\n\"Our client will withdraw the industrial action described as open barrier and free travel days,\" Mr Borenstein said.\nMetro and the Union will return to negotiations on Wednesday.\n RTBU Secretary Luba Grigorovitch said they had received a commitment from Metro that they would be given \"an improved offer\" by Friday.\n\"Mass meetings of the membership will be held next week so we can put the new offer to a vote,\" Ms Grigorovitch said.\nThe threat of the industrial action has placed pressure on the Andrews Labor government after the RTBU was part of the public sector unions who worked hard to put it into power.\nThe cancellation of the strike came after the government begged the union to cease the action and gave them a deadline.\nPublic Transport Minister Jacinta Allan said the decision to call the industrial action off was a \"significant step forward\".\n\"Both parties are demonstrating, as a sign of good faith, that they want to see this matter resolved through negotiation,\" Ms Allan said.\nMs Allan said a union strike would have unnecessarily punished passengers.\nGuy slams government over 'mess' Opposition Leader Matthew Guy labelled the industrial dispute \"a mess of the government's creation\".\n\"This band-aid solution is just a sign of things to come of a government that takes its order from the unions,\" Mr Guy said.\nIn the union's original claim it was seeking pay rises of 18 per cent over three years, it is understood Metro has offered drivers a 14 per cent increase over the next four years.\nThe sticking point for the union is over conditions, especially overtime. Following the decision by the union to end the industrial action, Justice Mortimer raised concern over relaying the message the travel free days had been cancelled to the public.\n\"There might be still lots of people in the community who think they're going to travel for free somehow,\" Justice Mortimer said.\n\"There's been quite a campaign in the media by the union promoting this.\"\nIn a statement Metro spokeswoman Sammie Black said barrier gates would be closed and staffed as normal on Wednesday and Friday.\n\"Our customers should touch on and off as they usually do,\" Ms Black said.\n\"Customers can rely on our services running as normal on Friday with no planned disruption to services.\"\nYarra Trams has separately applied to the national industrial umpire, the Fair Work Commission, to terminate the industrial action on the city's trams.\nThe Fair Work Commission can cancel industrial action if it judges it an excessive threat to public health and safety or to economic well-being.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:32:30.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
