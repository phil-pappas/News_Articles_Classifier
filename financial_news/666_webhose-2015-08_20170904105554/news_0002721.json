Photo: Carla Gottgens\nThe Commonwealth Bank is expected to join rivals in tapping shareholders for billions of dollars in extra funds this week as banks move to strengthen their buffers against financial shocks.\nThe country's biggest bank is forecast to deliver a full-year profit of $9.1 billion on Wednesday, an increase of about 5 per cent. However, a key focus will be any move to raise capital in response to the tighter bank regulation.\nWestpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ Bank have acted to lift their capital in recent months.\nAnalysts say CBA's capital position is falling behind its peers, and there is a case to raise up to $7 billion.\nAdvertisement A move to lift capital this week is seen as inevitable as several analysts argue for a $5 billion raising.\nANZ last week sparked a plunge in bank shares after it raised $3 billion in response to rules forcing banks to hold more capital against mortgages, announced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in July.\nCBA holds the biggest mortgage portfolio, making it the most sensitive to the APRA changes, which will force banks to use more conservative financial models known as \"risk weights\".\nIt is estimated the most recent changes will require CBA to hold $3.4 billion in extra capital.\nAnalysts believe APRA may further lift capital requirements early next year in response to global regulatory changes designed to make banks safer.\nBell Potter analyst T S Lim said a CBA capital raising \"appears inevitable\", estimating its ratio of core equity tier 1 (CET1) capital to assets would be 9.2 per cent in June.\nMany believe the new minimum for the major banks will be a capital ratio of about 10 per cent.\n\"We now expect some form of capital raising from CBA as our numbers indicate they would be short by about $7 billion (maybe $4 billion to $5 billion near term) in total to get to 10 per cent CET1 capital ratio,\" Mr Lim said.\nAside from tapping shareholders, banks can increase their capital by retaining earnings or selling assets.\nHowever, a short APRA deadline and the raisings by other banks may put pressure on CBA to follow suit.\nNAB raised $5.5 billion in May; ANZ announced a $3 billion raising last week, and Westpac raised $2 billion through its dividend reinvestment plan in May.\nHowever, analysts think Westpac will need more.\nThe tougher rules on risk weights come into effect in July next year, giving banks a limited period to raise money through dividend reinvestment plans or asset sales.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Richard Wiles said in a note that if the APRA's risk weight changes were taken into account, CBA and Westpac (WBC) would have the lowest capital ratios of the big banks.\n\"Against this backdrop, we feel that investors will now turn their attention to the prospect of capital management initiatives by CBA and WBC,\" Mr Wiles wrote last week.\nHis forecasts assume both CBA and Westpac will partially underwrite their dividend reinvestment plans.\nThe report added: \"However, for CBA, we see merit in a capital raising of $4 billion to $5 billion at its result next week.\"\nAnalysts estimate CBA will pay a final dividend of $2.22 a share, an increase of 4Â¢ a share.\nAside from capital, banks are also starting to feel the pinch from a combination of rising bad debts and tighter margins because of the fierce competition in home lending.\nMorningstar head of banking research David Ellis said CBA was unlikely to have a short-term problem with bad debts because of its heavy focus on household lending, which tended to be less risky than writing business loans.\nYet, he said the cycle in bad debts, which has helped to power the growth of bank earnings in recent years, appeared to be turning.\n\"The banks have been able to report lower bad debts year in, year out, for the last few years. It's looking like now it might be starting to turn,\" Mr Ellis said.\nANZ last week increased its provisions for bad debts from $278 million in the March quarter to $366 million in the June quarter, a rise of 32 per cent.\nWhile shareholders were wearing some of the cost of tougher capital requirements, Mr Ellis predicted the banks would continue to pass on higher costs to customers by raising their mortgage rates.\nCBA, Westpac and ANZ have increased interest rates on housing investor loans by 0.27 percentage points and NAB has targeted investors with 0.29 percentage points.\nMr Ellis said banks would also look to \"reprice\" their owner-occupier loan books.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/anz-sparks-rout-in-banks-as-asx-suffers-worst-day-in-three-years-20150807-gitps5", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/anz-banking-group-completes-25b-institutional-raising-20150806-gitmh4", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/nabs-capital-and-dividends-in-spotlight-after-55-billion-raising-20150510-ggy63r.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/westpac-dividend-reinvestment-to-boost-tier-1-capital-ratio-20150503-1mz5vv.html"], "published": "2015-08-10T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:50:57.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
