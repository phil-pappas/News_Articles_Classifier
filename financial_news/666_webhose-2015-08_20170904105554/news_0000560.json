The nations are grappling with a 29 per cent drop in raw-material prices. Simon Bosch by Lananh Nguyen A bounce in crude oil and other commodity prices on Tuesday halted a plunge in currencies of countries linked to natural-resource exports. But the respite will be short-lived, according to OppenheimerFunds.\nThe Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars are off to the worst start to a year since the financial crisis. The nations are grappling with a 29 per cent drop in raw-material prices amid swelling supplies and slowing demand in China that may wipe out as much as 14 per cent of the Canadian dollar's value in the next three years.\nNext up, they'll have to contend with the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates this year, which is forecast to boost the US dollar.\n\"Compared to the US talk about raising rates and tightening policy, the commodity currencies are going in the exact opposite direction,'' Alessio de Longis, a money manager in the Global Multi-Asset Group at OppenheimerFunds, said from New York. \"These currencies are not cheap by any means.''\nHow resource currencies have been falling. Bloomberg De Longis, whose company manages $US233 billion ($316.53 billion), projected the Canadian dollar would weaken 14 per cent in the next one to three years. He estimated the Aussie would fall in the same time frame to 60 US cents and the New Zealand dollar to 50 US cents.\nThe Canadian dollar weakened 0.2 per cent Thursday to an 11-year low while the kiwi lost 0.5 per cent.\nEven as the Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates steady and spurred a currency bounce, de Longis said he expected central banks in the commodity-exporting nations to continue easing monetary policy, sending their currencies tumbling versus the greenback.\nThe Bloomberg Commodity Index fell to a 13-year low on Monday after Chinese manufacturing gauges slowed, clouding the outlook for demand. In contrast, the US currency has rallied against all 16 major peers in the past 12 months on signs that the Fed is getting closer to raising rates.\n Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, said in a note: \"Caution is still in order as today's Aussie gains are corrective in nature. It is obvious that RBA policy must remain accommodative.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:04:16.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
