The level of service expected is the same because the training for volunteer firefighters is identical as it is for paid ones. Volunteer fire departments typically exist in communities that have a population of 10,000 or less. \nBrian Pires formerly of the Lake Country VFD in British Columbia, attended one of the top 3 firefighting schools in Texas-North East Texas Fire Academy located in Sulphur Springs Texas. He says when his VFD would go on calls all the training he had kicked in and as a result was able to avoid panic and take control of the various fire emergencies. \nVolunteer fire fighters have full time paying jobs in other sectors and many have families as well. These people are giving their time and sacrifice by doing this most altruistic endeavor. They are on call 24/7 and literally put their lives on the line. \nVolunteer firefighters are sometimes referred to as paid-on-call firefighters due to some compensation they receive. While volunteer fire fighters are a paid a small hourly wage, they are not in it for the money. So to even consider a 'volunteer' fire fighting as a misnomer because they are paid a little bit of money is not applicable. \nThat said, the contribution they are making to their community by helping people is immeasurable. Therefore, while all firefighters whether they work in a paid capacity with a local fire department in a larger urban center, or in a less populated area in a non paid capacity as a volunteer, are helping people in distress. \nBut those who volunteer their time solely to give back to their community are even more admirable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:07:42.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
