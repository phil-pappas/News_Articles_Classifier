Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop has nominated September's Canning byelection as the start of the government's electoral fightback, putting pressure on the Coalition to do well in a contest that is looming as a critical test of Tony Abbott's leadership.\nAs the Coalition sought to rally on Tuesday from weeks of infighting, poor polls and leadership chatter, Ms Bishop told the weekly party room meeting that the September 19 byelection \"was our opportunity to fight back\".\n\"Western Australia has always been a fortress for the Coalition,\" she said. \"This is a fight that we need to have. This is a fight that we need to win.\"\nThe Canning byelection was prompted by the death of Liberal MP Don Randall. He held it by a margin of more than 11 per cent but a Newspoll published on Tuesday showed the Liberals were facing a swing of about 10 percentage points and would struggle to hold the seat.\nMPs growing increasingly frustrated with the leadership believe Canning could be the end of Mr Abbott if the byelection is lost.\nBoth sides engaged in expectation management on Tuesday. Ms Bishop warned the Coalition would suffer a swing in the seat because Mr Randall was such a popular local member.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten, who also has an interest in doing well in Canning, pointed out that swings have been historically low in byelections prompted by the death of a sitting member and none has changed hands for more than 50 years.\n'Read the riot act' For the second time in two months, Mr Abbott told his MPs he had \"read the riot act\" to his cabinet and warned of \"severe consequences\" for wandering off script, after backbenchers complained about the leaking from cabinet and the risk it was posing to marginal seats.\nIt was almost a carbon copy of Mr Abbott's address to the party room in early June , when he said he had \"read the riot act\" to the cabinet the night before after details were leaked about him being rolled on national security.\nMr Abbott was Quote: d as telling Tuesday's meeting the government \"had been untidy and we are making an effort\".\nMPs are anxious that Monday night's cabinet meeting failed to resolve plans for gay marriage. The cabinet is split over whether to put the matter to a referendum or a plebiscite and when to hold the vote.\nAnxiety is also being stoked by continuing poor polling , the disaster enveloping the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, and a general lack of policy direction. On Monday night, cabinet had no policy of significance to discuss.\nThe Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday that jittery MPs were talking among themselves about the leadership, with soundings being taken concerning both Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.\nSupporters of Mr Morrison rejected suggestions they were agitating for change or taking soundings.\nPositioning himself One MP told The Australian Financial Review that Mr Morrison backed Mr Abbott but was simultaneously positioning himself as the alternative conservative candidate should Mr Abbott fall.\n\"Scott's playing a wise, long game,\" he said. \"We're all on the same page on this issue.\"\nA supporter of Mr Turnbull said the Communications Minister was not condoning any leadership destabilisation either.\n\"Malcolm is pretty shitty at the moment but he doesn't want to be seen to be doing anything.\"\nMs Bishop, who would be a factor in any upheaval, defended her refusal to state her views on gay marriage in an interview with Huffington Post Australia.\nShe said she was showing leadership by trying to steer the party towards a plebiscite to stop it fracturing.\n\"I don't want my personal views to become the issue,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-18T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:07:48.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
