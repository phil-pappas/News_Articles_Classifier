A source at the company said the entry had been made by a user who had had permission to list destinations on the map but had now been banned.\n\"I have been in touch with the police and I will file a complaint,\" said Nadia Kinani, principal of the Hand in Hand school, a rare example of co-existence in Jerusalem which was damaged in an arson attack in November.\nAn Israeli court last month jailed two brothers from a far-right Jewish group for two years for that attack, in which a classroom was torched and \"Death to Arabs\" daubed on a wall in the yard.\nWith peace talks with the Palestinians stalled since April 2014, Israel is struggling to contain hate crimes that it fears could spark renewed fighting.\nIn an attack on July 31, suspected Jewish extremists torched a Palestinian home in Duma, a village in the occupied West Bank, killing an 18-month-old child and his father, who died of his injuries on Saturday.
