Stefan Moore Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Luke Malpass When Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke showed up in Ottawa in the mid 1980s, he was surprised to see a New Zealand flag raised in his honour, painfully similar but evidently different to the Australian version.\nFortunately, mix ups of this sort may soon be a thing of the past, as the east antipodes moves closer to a much-needed new standard. A flag committee appointed by the conservative John Key government has released a \"long-list\" of 40 options from a publicly solicited pool of over 10,000.\nUnlike some campaigns to change national symbols, or constitutionally important matters (a la Australian republicanism), the change in the New Zealand standard has not been an elite driven project. The designs were made by the public and will be put to two referendums.\nReferendum The \"flag consideration project\" will shorten the list to four options, which the public will rank in late November. In March 2016 Kiwis will then vote whether to adopt the preferred option from the first referendum, or to retain the current flag. The results of both referendums will be binding.\nUntil that preferred option has firmed, support is difficult to gauge.\n\"Until the firm alternative has been in front of people for a while, there is no useful data on the whether people will be in favour of a change or not\", director of Wellington-based Curia Market Research, David Farrar, said.\nBoth New Zealanders' and the Prime Minister Key's position on the flag will be somewhat of a paradox for Australians. Both are still strongly supportive of the monarchy, yet Mr Key is in favour of changing the flag, and public support is not obviously against it.\n The Flag Consideration Panel has announced 40 possible flag alternatives for New Zealand. New Zealand also also retains two national anthems of equal legal status, God Save the Queen and God Defend New Zealand (the latter bi-lingual, sung in both Maori and English).\nPrime Minister John Key is in favour of changing New Zealand's flag.
