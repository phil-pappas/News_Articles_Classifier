TSLA has gained 9.5% over the last four trading sessions, driven by the announcement of a new common stock offering and later, by a 66% hike in target price by Morgan Stanley. On Aug 13, 2015, Tesla revealed its plans to offer $500 million worth of shares in an underwritten registered public offering, with a 30-day option to the underwriters to purchase another $75 million worth of shares. The company also revealed that CEO Elon Musk would purchase shares worth $20 million at the public offering price. \nIn a SEC filing made on the same day, Tesla revealed that around 2,100,000 shares will be issued (including 83,974 shares to be purchased by Musk), leading to net proceeds of $492.6 million. The quantity could increase to 2,415,000 shares, or $566.5 million, if the underwriters exercise all their options to purchase additional shares. \nHowever, the next day, Tesla made another SEC filing which raised the number of shares to be issued to 2,694,934 (including 82,645 shares to be purchased by Musk), leading to net proceeds of $641.9 million. The quantity could increase to 3,099,173 shares, or $738.3 million, if the underwriters exercise all their options to purchase additional shares. \nTesla plans to use the proceeds from the offering to accelerate global growth of its business, including the expansion of its stores, service centers, Supercharger network and the Tesla Energy business; for the development and production of Model 3 and the Gigafactory and for other general corporate purposes. \nWhile the news of the stock issue raised Teslaâ€™s share price by 2.1% on Aug 13 and 14, the stupendous increase in target price by Morgan Stanley to $465 from $280 led to a 4.9% upside in the price on Aug 17 and another 2.3% on Aug 18. \nTesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked automobile stocks include Advance Auto Parts Inc. AAP, PACCAR Inc. PCAR and O'Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY, all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
