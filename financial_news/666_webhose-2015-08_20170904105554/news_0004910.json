Small players take exit route Shares of public sector banks were in huge demand for the second consecutive session, with some seeing double-digit jump in stock price, after the government announced a slew of reforms to revive their fortunes. Bank of Baroda (BoB) jumped 15% amid heavy volume. Canara Bank surged 13.4% while Bank of India rose 8.72%. Country’s largest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI), gained 4%, pushing the gauge of PSBs, the CNX PSU Banks, up 6.2%. In contrast, the benchmark Nifty lost 42 point or 0.5% from the previous close. Union Bank of India (5.29%), PNB (4.09%), Allahabad Bank (5.66%), Indian Overseas Bank (4.13%) and Bank of Maharashtra (3.95%) were other big gainers on Monday.\nTo revive the fortunes of public sector banks, government on Friday unveiled a seven-point plan encompassing an immediate fund infusion of R20,000 crore, creation of a single holding company and minimising political interference. Experts and banking analysts hailed the move , saying it may lead to re-rating of some PSBs. This is the first time the government has appointed private bankers as heads of PSU banks, which will have a positive impact on a long-term perspective in various areas of the banking industry, they said.\n“We maintain our stance of increasing weights on public sector banks, particularly BoB, SBI and Union Bank. The reforms can usher in structural changes in PSBs, though may not necessarily reflect in earning in near term, but will help improving franchise. This, further supported by cyclical recovery and opex benefits, can spur re-rating of PSBs’ valuations,” said Edelweiss analyst Nilesh Parikh. Announcing the revamp plan named ‘Indradhanush’ that also includes setting up of a Bank Board Bureau (BBB) for broad-level appointments and a performance-based monitoring mechanism, finance minister Arun Jaitley allayed fears of any panic over mounting bad debts at the state-run banks.\nTo professionalise PSBs, the government announced appointment of two private sector bankers to head Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank while also making appointments to three other large state-run banks from within the government sector. The government has decided to inject Rs 70,000 crore into PSBs over a four-year period starting this fiscal with Rs 25,000 crore, of which Rs 20,000 crore would be given within a month.\nThe remaining Rs 5,000 crore would come in the last quarter of this fiscal.\n“While most measures were already announced, front ending the capital allocation of R200 billion is a clear positive and setting up of BBB in a timely manner is positive from a longer-term corporate governance perspective,” said Adarsh Parasrampuria, senior analyst, Nomura India.\n 18, 2015 12:11 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:45:31.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
