More Old Mutual cuts prices \nResearch for the Financial Times found in June that consumers now need an average of £806,000 to invest to access advice from a private client wealth manager, up 48 per cent from a year ago. \nBrewin clients with £10,000 to £200,000 to invest can opt for Brewinsdirect, the company’s new online non-advised service, which like Nutmeg offers ready-made portfolios for investors with different risk appetites. \nBrewinsdirect boasts of a total cost of less than 1 per cent a year, while Nutmeg charges 0.75 per cent plus the funds’ own charges. \n“Been dumped by Brewin Dolphin? Transfer and get 3 months free and a box of chocolates,” says Nutmeg’s ad, which shows chief executive Nick Hungerford proffering chocolates and chief investment officer Shaun Port with a box of tissues. Customers must prove they were previously with Brewin to take up the offer. \nHolly Mackay, founder of the consumer finance website Boring Money, said: “Brewin Dolphin are not the only ones. Costs of advice are being pushed higher — in large part by regulation — and increasingly advice is becoming a game which requires more than £100,000 to pass go. \n“As a customer it doesn’t feel very nice to be told that you’re not rich enough to play, but the economics behind it are pretty black and white.” \nHowever, she added, “Potential investors should be asking questions about Nutmeg’s assets under management, growth, parentage, longevity and most importantly, performance.” \nFour-year-old Nutmeg has not revealed its assets under management but appears to have struggled to gain widespread traction: it made a £3.6m loss in 2013, the most recent year for which accounts are available, on turnover of £103,903. Last year it attracted $32m of investment from Schroders, the FTSE 100 asset manager. \nStephen Ford, head of wealth and investment management at Brewin Dolphin, a FTSE 250-listed company, said: “We have written to a couple of thousand clients with smaller portfolios and offered them various service options.” \nThese clients were told they could invest more to keep a bespoke service, could switch to Brewins Direct or could leave the company. Mr Ford said Brewin was “pleased” with the number that opted for its online service. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
