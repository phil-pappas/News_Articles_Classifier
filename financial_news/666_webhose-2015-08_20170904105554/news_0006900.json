One problem is that TIPS pay miserably small coupons. Another is that those tiny yields are chewed up by fund overhead. The third is that TIPs with maturities beyond five years can crash in price when interest rates shoot up.The funds at the top of this ranking are reasonably cheap, as bond funds go: Schwab U.S. TIPS ( SCHP ), iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ( STIP ), and Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ( VTIP ).But don’t expect much of a return. And don’t put too much stock in the official yield numbers published by the funds, which follow Securities & Exchange Commission guidelines that give flaky results. Go to the Treasury’s yield curve page to see what TIPSs are yielding. Select the maturity column that corresponds to the average maturity of your fund’s portfolio, and subtract the fund’s expense ratio. You’ll probably get a real return not much above zero.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 SCHP Schwab US TIPS 742 0.07 126 STIP iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond 567 0.1 143 VTIP Vanguard Short-Term Infl-Prot Secs 1,798 0.1 169 IPE SPDR Barclays TIPS 648 0.15 258 TIP iShares TIPS Bond 13,914 0.2 274 STPZ Pimco 1-5 Year US TIPS 1,183 0.2 334 TDTT FlexShares iBoxx 3Yr Target Dur TIPS 2,116 0.2 344 TIPZ Pimco Broad US TIPS 73 0.2 345 TDTF FlexShares iBoxx 5Yr Target Dur TIPS 436 0.2 348 LTPZ Pimco 15+ Year US TIPS 91 0.2 348 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
