The voter display exercise, which begun on July 22, 2015 ends on August 11, 2015. \nDuring the display, voters verify the correctness of their particulars on the voter register, including the photographs appearing against their names. \nThe exercise also enables the display officer to delete the dead, non citizens, those under 18 years of age, those who belong to another parish and voters who appear more than once on the register. \n\"After the display exercise, the lists of all persons recommended for deletion from the national voters' register, shall also be displayed for a period of 11 days, that is from 14- 24 August 2015 at each respective parish or ward headquarter,\" he explained. \nThe purpose of the extended display is to enable any person who may have been wrongly recommended for deletion to raise an objection. Kiggundu said EC will announce the final tally of registered voters for the 2016 general election after the display exercise. Recently, EC put the tally at 15 million voters. \nKiggundu complained that Ugandans are not eager to check the voters' register. He said EC was sending out messages to further publicize the display exercise. The messages go straight to individual phone lines. \n\"All these innovations are aimed at increasing voter awareness and enhancing transparency for the display exercise in preparation for the coming elections,\" he said. \nNEW CONSTITUENCIES \nHe ruled out seeking additional funding for the newly-created constituencies. Recently, parliament approved 43 new constituencies and cabinet approved 11 new municipalities. \n\"We are ready for them. The number of polling stations, villages, parishes and sub-counties will remain the same. It is only the number of ballot papers for constituencies that will increase. That is small, we shall just absorb them in the overall budget,\" Kiggundu said. \nROAD MAP \nEC also issued a road map for the elections of special interest groups. According to the road map, nomination of candidates, campaigns and elections for youth, people with disabilities and older persons from the village to district level will be conducted between August 23, 2015 and November, 25, 2015. \nKEY DATE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:57:39.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
