In a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange where SoftBank is listed, the heir apparent to founder & CEO Masayoshi Son said the investment is a reflection of confidence in the prospects of the company. \"This is a large transaction for me, and involves taking an enormous risk in my life once again,\" Arora, 47, was quoted as saying in the statement. \"However, I am extremely confident about the future of the SoftBank group and the long-term objectives that we have set out. I intend to work closely with Son to make the vision a reality.\" Arora's purchase would be in a personal capacity and board members are fully supportive of his decision, the Japanese telecoms group said in a statement. The money for the transaction, which will happen over six months, comes from his personal savings and borrowing. Arora, who moved from Google in October 2014, was disclosed as having an annual compensation package totalling $135 million at SoftBank. He became president of Softbank in May. SoftBank has a market capitalisation of about $72.2 billion.
