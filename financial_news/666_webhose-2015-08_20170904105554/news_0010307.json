It cautioned that without action by lawmakers, a graying population and growing healthcare costs will push annual federal deficits upward again later this decade, spiking back above $US1 trillion in 2025.\nThat would push the government's total debt, accumulated over decades, to $US21 trillion by 2025, or 77 per cent of the country's projected economic output that year. Economists say such amounts could drive up interest rates, boost government debt costs and hinder lawmakers from using tax and spending changes to ease the impact of future recessions. \"The growth in debt is not sustainable,\" budget office chief Keith Hall told reporters. \"You can't predict tipping points, but at some point this becomes a problem.\" The budget office released its figures two weeks before lawmakers return from a summer break steering toward a budget clash. The Republican-led Congress has approved a blueprint that uses spending curbs on Medicare, Medicaid and other programs to claim a balanced budget in a decade, a plan Democrats have derided as harsh and unrealistic. \"I would caution those who would use this report as an opportunity to take these short-term savings and push for more spending,\" said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, Republican-Wyoming. He said \"real, substantive budget reforms and savings will have to be on the table during any spending negotiations\". Maryland Representative Chris Van Hollen, top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the report shows that Congress has made \"important progress on rebuilding our economy and reducing our deficit\". He said Congress should make \"necessary investments\" in education and other programs and said serious negotiations will be needed to avoid a government shutdown this northern autumn. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican-Kentucky, has repeatedly said partisan spending clashes will not lead to a government closure. But it could be hard for GOP leaders to win conservative votes for spending bills unless they cutting federal payments to Planned Parenthood.

In March, the budget office projected a $US486 billion deficit for this fiscal year, which runs to September 30. The analysis said the $US60 billion reduction was largely because collections of individual and corporate taxes have been higher than expected. Annual deficits peaked at a historic high of $US1.4 trillion in 2009 as the Great Recession reduced federal tax revenue and drove up government costs for helping low-income and jobless people. Deficits have dropped since then, falling to $US485 billion last year. This year's $US426 billion projected deficit, if realised, would be the government's smallest since it was $US161 billion in the red in 2007. It would also mean that this year's shortfall would be 2.4 per cent the size of the overall economy, a proportion that many economists consider acceptable. On average over the last 50 years, annual deficits have been 2.7 per cent of the economy's size. The record 2009 deficit was 9.8 per cent the size of the economy. The budget office report lowered its projection for 2015 economic growth to a modest 2.3 per cent, down from its 2.8 per cent forecast in January and reflecting a weak first quarter performance by the economy. But it said the economy \"is now on firmer ground,\" and projected that growth will return to around three per cent annually in 2016 and 2017 before dipping again. The analysis also said that even though the government had reached the legal limit of money it can borrow, the unforeseen extra revenue meant the Treasury Department should be able to use accounting manoeuvres to free up cash and avoid breaching that limit until mid-November or early December. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in July told Congress that he could take steps to prevent breaching the borrowing limit until late October or early November. Treasury can use bookkeeping manoeuvres such as temporarily taking cash out of certain federal pension funds, money that is restored once Congress enacts a new debt ceiling. Congress has fought frequently over extending the debt limit, with an unprecedented federal default a potential consequence should the parties deadlock.
