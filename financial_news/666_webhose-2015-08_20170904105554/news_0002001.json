FB, -1.26% founder and chief executive announced Friday that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are expecting a baby . The biggest social network on the planet offers four months of paid leave to both new moms and dad and a $4,000 “new child benefit” for each child born or adopted — generous by U.S. standards — but even people at companies that do offer a chunk of time off are sometimes reluctant to take it.\nAmericans appear reluctant to take time off from work without pay when they are starting a family — primarily because they’re worried about keeping their jobs. Nearly two-thirds of full-time employees (63%) who are parents did not take paid parental leave in the U.S. and over three-quarters of women (77%) indicate their spouse/partner is not eligible for paid parental leave, according to a recent survey by EY, a global provider of financial services. Millennials — those born roughly between 1981 and 1996 — are much more likely to take paid parental leave compared with parents of older generations when they had children: 48% versus 35% for Generation X — born between 1965 and 1980 — and 24% for baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1964.\nPerhaps less surprisingly, new mothers are more likely to take paid parental leave than new fathers (46% versus 30%), according to the EY survey of more than 1,000 people. On average, women took 4.5 weeks of paid parental leave while men took 2.3 weeks. Millennial and Gen X took 3.3 weeks of paid parental leave on average compared with 2.3 weeks for baby boomers. The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations in the world that does not require employers to offer paid maternity leave, even though companies are mandated to offer 12 weeks unpaid leave for new mothers.\n“In the vast majority of countries offering paid time off, the government is footing the bill, though in some cases employers are required to pony up, as well,” says Gretchen Livingston, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington, D.C.\nRead: 6 of the best countries for new moms\nOf 186 countries examined in an analysis of the World Policy Analysis Centre Adult Labor Database, 96% provide some pay to women during maternity leave, a 2013 study by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research in Washington, D.C., found. Estonia is one of the most generous countries in the world, offering 108 weeks paid leave and 180 weeks of protected leave.\nHow to make a GIF WSJ's Joanna Stern gives tips for making those crazy looping animations that are plastered all over the Internet. Photo/video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal.\n“The U.S. is the only high-income country and one of only eight countries in the world that does not mandate paid leave for mothers of newborns,” the report said. “Nearly every member of the European Union provides at least 14 weeks of job-guaranteed paid maternity leave, during which workers receive at least two-thirds of their regular earnings.” The 1963 report of the President’s Commission on the Status of Women, created by John F. Kennedy in 1961, recommended that, “Paid maternity leave or comparable insurance benefits should be provided for women workers; employers, unions, and government should explore the best means of accomplishing this purpose.” Fifty years later, not much has changed.\nAround five U.S. states and Puerto Rico have enacted policies to provide workers with family leave benefits that are more generous than those required by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, including California, Rhode Island and New Jersey, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found. In California, the weekly benefit amount is 55% of the earnings shown in the highest quarter of a worker’s base earning period up to a maximum of $1,075 per week. In addition, some states provide partial wage replacement for eligible workers who take time to care for a new baby, an adopted child, or an ill loved one.\nThe upshot: More American women are working further into their pregnancy, even those who do have paid leave with their company, according to data released in April by the Pew Research Center . In the early 1960s, 65% of working women who were pregnant with their first child stopped working more than a month before the birth, while just about a third (35%) continued working into their final month. By the late 2000s, that trend had completely reversed: Nearly 20% of women stopped working before then, while 80% continued in the workplace until less than a month of their first birth.\nRead: 10 reasons to quit the U.S. for Europe\n(This story was updated on July 31, 2015.)\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/paid-parental-leave-in-the-united-states-what-the-data-tell-us-about-access-usage-and-economic-and-health-benefits"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T07:37:14.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
