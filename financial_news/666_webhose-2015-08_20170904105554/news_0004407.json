Owner occupiers borrowed $11.8 billion (excluding refinancing). Investors borrowed $13 billion.\nDr Ellis said the investor boom was being fed by both very low interest rates and the prospect of concessionally taxed capital gains.\nSince late 1999, only half of each capital gain has been taxed, making negative gearing much more attractive. Investors are allowed to write off all of any losses they make renting properties against their wage incomes, while paying tax on only half of each capital gain they make when selling those properties.\nA Parliamentary Budget Office analysis prepared for the Greens finds that limiting negative gearing to properties already purchased and trimming the discount on capital gains tax from 50 per cent to 40 per cent would save the budget $9 billion over four years, with the saving rising over time .\nThe Business Council of Australia, accounting firm KPMG, former banker David Murray and the head of the government's audit commission, Tony Shepherd, have all come out in favour of a review of the capital gains tax discount.\nDr Ellis stressed that the RBA was not suggesting getting rid of negative gearing, but wanted it examined in the context of a review of the capital gains tax discount.\nShe said the United Kingdom and the United States allowed investors to deduct interest expenses against their property income but not their wage income. Corporations could deduct interest expenses only against their business income, but individuals who ran what was in effect a business renting out properties were allowed to deduct their expenses against their pay cheques from other employers.\nShe was less keen on removing stamp duty as has been suggested by the Treasury in its tax discussion paper, saying it wasn't that big an impediment to buying houses.\n\"The cost of stamp duty is a low single figure per cent of the price,\" she said. \"You've also got to add in the cost of buying and selling homes; the legal fees, the real estate agent fees and so forth. I think it's the case everywhere that buying and selling real estate involves considerable transaction costs.\n\"One of the things I have observed in the 15 or 20 years I have spent watching the housing market is that typically in Australia a real estate agent fee is about 2 per cent of the sale price. As best as we can tell in the UK and Canada it is a number more like 5 or 6 per cent, so you are still paying the same amount of transaction cost, but you are paying it to a real estate agent rather than a state government.\"\n\"It's also worth noting that the disincentive to buy or sell imposed by these transaction costs is a disincentive to flip. From a financial stability point of view. That's a good thing. We saw a lot of flippers, people who bought and sold quickly, in the United States.\"\nFollow Peter Martin on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Martin/713739465438660", "http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-so-2015-08-06.html"], "published": "2015-08-06T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:56:31.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
