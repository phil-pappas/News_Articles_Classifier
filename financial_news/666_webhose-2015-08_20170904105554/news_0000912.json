Reuters by Vesna Poljak The Chinese yuan may have pushed the S&P/ASX 200 Index into correction this past week, but it was a series of mostly lower than expected earnings that created unrelenting havoc with share prices.\nThe profit season's first big week proved a largely ugly affair for investors, but for a few exceptions where the so-called expensive defensive stocks delivered reliably robust dividends.\nTelstra and Transurban hit their marks and were rewarded with muted share price reactions, avoiding the carnage playing out elsewhere.\nIt was nail-biting affair for shareholders of market darling Domino's Pizza Enterprises who endured a sharp 7 per cent sell-off upon the release of its earnings, but recovered to post some steady gains on the allure of future earnings-accretive acquisitions.\nDomino's chief executive, Don Meij, said the company was active and expected to deliver, but softened hopes by emphasising \"that's not in our guidance\". The market saw it differently, and the pressure is on for the trailblazing pizza delivery group to take its technology-focused model to new markets.\nCochlear endured a 15 per cent share price dive when its results and outlook disappointed. The company's dividend was reduced too, but that was conveyed to investors well in advance.\nOutgoing chief executive Chris Roberts hinted at his bewilderment with sell-side brokers and the integrity of their forecasting, saying the analyst with the highest profit estimate also carried a \"sell\" recommendation. Cochlear's net profit guidance for 2015-16 is $165 million to $175 million, but brokers were looking for around $189 million.\nCSL, having broken through the $100 a share mark, found itself down 6 per cent after investors took a cooler view on its growth prospects, the impact of currency volatility and costs.\n Ansell shed 15 per cent of its market value after revealing that currency swings could wipe out $55 million from its top-line this fiscal year. Computershare was similarly battered for missing expectations and admitting the company sees 7.5 per cent lower earnings.\nThe spectacular price action, more consistent with times of crisis, is being exacerbated by the capital drain on the Australian market where banks seeking to top up their reserves through capital raisings have soaked up around $15 billion.\nThis is thought to be behind some of the sharpest selldowns as companies delivering soft results bear the brunt of the cash call.\nPaul Taylor, who manages the Fidelity Australian equities fund, said capital raisings and the confluence of other macro events led by China were distorting conditions. This would fade once all four banks had the equity they need.\n\"The banks raising capital has maybe created a bit of fatigue in the market,\" he said. \"When you've got big short positions on stocks they get caught up in the animal spirits of the market a bit more. Noise is really what's impacting the market at the moment.\"\nMr Taylor said the focus on results would deepen soon enough and for investors; the profits were more about testing their own investment theses.\n\"You always want to know what you own and why you own it. You're often looking to the results to confirm whether that investment thesis is on track.\"\nSirtex Medical was a rare bright spot, with shares in the liver cancer treatment company bid up 10 per cent on a record profit that grew 69 per cent to $40 million. Sirtex also set the scene for a more optimistic 2015-16 by committing to matching the pace of its growth.\nSebastian Evans, chief investment officer at NAOS Asset Management, has been a holder of Sirtex this year since a perceived disappointment around clinical trial results wiped around $1 billion of its market capitalisation back in March.\nMr Evans said that not only were the company's results better than the $36 million profit forecast, but Sirtex was in possession of the kind of growth becoming impossible to find in the ASX 200.\n\"The market said they're happy with the fact they should maintain their historical growth rate, increasing off a higher base that's quite meaningful,\" he said. \"The market likes the fact there's still such a big opportunity for this.\"\nNews Corporation delivered a full-year loss of $US149 million ($203 million), but its market value swelled on strong numbers out of its digital real estate and book publishing division, in spite of lower advertising revenue during the period. Investors responded favourably to News' plans to reconsider the future of its education business, Amplify, which was the target of a write-down.\nA theme for the next reporting season will be the impact of the lower Australian dollar on consumer behaviour, according to Mr Taylor.\n\"A lot of the consumer goods are imported so they're probably going to go up in price in the next year or so,\" he said. \"Whether the consumer will be happy paying higher prices for the their fridges and TVs, that's an interesting aspect as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:07:40.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
