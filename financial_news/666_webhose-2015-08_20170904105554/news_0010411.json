Emerging market productivity soared while Western productivity flattened. \nRich Westerners have consistently bought Chinese-manufactured goods and paid for them in dollars. Many of those dollars were reinvested in Western government debt and now increasingly in real assets including London property allowing the cycle to continue. Wealth generated in China was used to over-invest in infrastructure, as it was in the US and UK in the 19th century. China built 50 airports while we agonised over one runway . \nOccasionally this process got out of hand the scale and quality of Western indebtedness versus Chinese investment was a contributory factor to the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. \nBut the direction of travel in the West has been consistent. Capital expenditure as a share of GDP has fallen, current account deficits have risen, corporations have piled up cash and share buy-backs have soared. \nAnalysing trade data has become unfashionable since markets became obsessed with Fed-watching. The focus was on interest rates: “little i” as opposed to the “Big I” Investment. \nBut it was no surprise that the immediate trigger for last week’s falls was a poor set of trade data from China and a corrective, but modest, 3pc devaluation of the renminbi. Global trade is not growing. \nOur challenges are complex. China needs to become a more consumer-driven economy to grow into its new infrastructure. We in the West need to do the opposite: investing in infrastructure and physical and intellectual capital to improve productivity and put our growth back on a more solid footing. \nThis will be bumpy and will require constructive collaboration and co-ordination among the major economies. \nPolicymakers have to make key decisions as real growth, inflation, productivity, trade growth and interest rates are all trending towards zero. Many commodity prices oil, iron, copper have fallen by 40pc or more and deflation is a threat. Governments, corporates and regulators have to work more closely together at present they do not. \nThe quantitative easing miracle cure was applied early in the US, but more slowly elsewhere. In America, it was rightly used as a defensive, emergency medicine, alongside the rapid recapitalisation of banks, to get the economy back on its feet. Elsewhere it became a way of life : central bank balance sheets have ballooned by over $10 trillion (£6.5 trillion). Too much is expected of QE in Japan, the eurozone and now China it cannot become a substitute for real economic activity. Recent collapses in commodity, currency and equity markets are evidence of the need for a co-ordinated structural correction at a global level. \nFortunately there are measures that can be taken to smooth the transition. \nFirst (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , we need to increase our own investment in the UK. That means taking a longer-term view than the City has come to expect. So investors, like Legal & General , should de-emphasise quarterly reporting by the companies we invest in. \nInstead of short-term, share-price fixes such as buy-backs and mega-mergers, we should be supporting genuine investment plans which deliver returns over many years, not months. It also means investing more in our infrastructure road, rail, healthcare, energy and housing. Interest rates have never been so low, money has never been so abundant, yet so little of it has been invested in growth. \nMoney needs to be put to constructive use: Jean-Claude Juncker has the right idea on this with the European Commission’s €350bn (£255bn) stimulus plan , and we too need to accelerate George Osborne’s Northern Powerhouse plan from concept to a reality. \nThis in turn means supporting a gradual shift from tax-favoured debt to equity. Funding with debt and globally there is $200 trillion of it at present means extracting a rent from future economic activity: borrowing from our children. Equity finances growth in the present, and creates upside for future generations. We need to use equity more to grow our small-cap companies from start-ups to grown-ups. \nThere are many exciting sectors including healthcare diagnostics, graphene, 3D-printing, big data analytics and modular housing. I wholly support the efforts of the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) , for example through its outstanding Elite programme, to deliver this. \nSecond, we need to become once again a great exporting nation. I am encouraged to see high-profile trade missions, but our trade infrastructure lags far behind many of our competitors, notably Germany. A real drive for export credits and trade finance would be a good start, plus we need to punch our weight at international trade fairs, rather than settling for the small stall in the corner, too often sitting in the shadow of the German pavilion. \nThird, a critical effect of QE was to push up the price of existing assets including traded equity, bonds and commercial property. We need to build new asset classes aggregated small company financings, private rental housing, specialist accommodation for retirees and students, and local infrastructure and regeneration funds to grow real economic value. \nI hope we see co-ordinated G20 policies to meet the global rebalancing challenge, the rebuilding of an equity culture in the West and more consumerist economies in Asia. \nBut we cannot simply go on as before: the UK can help by becoming an investing economy: we need to start now. \nNigel Wilson is group CEO of Legal & General", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T16:27:55.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
