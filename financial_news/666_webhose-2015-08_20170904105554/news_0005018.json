These objectives are repeated here to contextualise this discussion and to remind Zimbabweans how citizens are always taken for a ride by that party. \nThe Zim Asset, spanning the period October 2013 to December 2018, was put together to, among many \"lofty\" objectives, ensure: \n- Accelerated economic growth and wealth creation in Zimbabwe, \n- Sustainable development and social equity anchored on indigenisation, empowerment and employment creation. \n- A result based agenda which was to reposition the country as one of the strongest economies in the region and Africa. \n- A commitment to evolve \"robust and prudent fiscal and monetary policies to buttress and boost the implementation of the programmers\" \n- The attainment of a people centred government which would promote equitable development and prosperity for all Zimbabweans, and finally, to ensure that \n- The country becomes \" a growth leader in Sub-Saharan Africa towards 2020\" \nFailure To Achieve The Critical National Growth Targets \nAs a strategy to achieving the above objectives, the government stated that the budgetary process would be aligned to the programming requirements ZimAsset. In addition, the economy would be cajoled to achieve an average GDP growth rate of 7,3 % per annum with all sectors attaining positive growth rates during the plan period. As history has it, this growth rate the ZANU PF government has persistently failed to attain as it has garnered only a GDP growth rates of 4,5 % in 2013, 3,5 % in 2014 and is, by their own admission, forecasting a growth rate of a mere 1,5 % by the end of 2015. Such a performance compares very poorly with Sub - Saharan growth rates of 5 % in 2014 and 4,4 % in 2015. Nearer home the average growth rate in SADC countries (which is weighed down by Zimbabwe's poor performance) was 3,4 % in 2014 and is forecast to grow at 3,8 % in 2015. \nIn view of the fact a resource rich Zimbabwe is in the same geo-political environment as the other less resource endowed SADC countries, these statistics emphasize the point Zimbabwe is being left behind by the entire world because of its unavailing policies which they have persistently followed since independence, policies which do not grow the economy or resolve the fundamental structural problems facing it. \nZANU PF's failure to grow this economy is due to its prime preoccupation with its pre-independence programmes of wealth redistribution which has been done at the expense of the need to create centres for sustained growth in the economy. As a result the major thrust of its policies continues to focus on the redistribution of the little resources inherited at independence particularly to its cronies at the expense of the rest of the population. This policy is not an economic growth model and has led to stagnation and worsening poverty for the masses as it overemphasizes current consumption vis a vis productive investment for present and future generations. \nIt must be pointed out that the dwindling productive capacity experienced throughout the economy today is not a coincidence but a direct result of little or no investment in productive infrastructure over the years. It is a truism that ZESA has no capacity to meet the energy needs of this underperforming economy, that ZINWA cannot provide the much needed water for irrigation, that NRZ is unable to move the volume of goods demanded by all sectors of the economy, that ARDA has almost mothballed its operations, and that the CSC is having little or no contribution to the cattle industry in the country. \nThese are just a few examples in the litany of public institutions which are failing to deliver to their mandate as a result of ZANU PF's failure to place sufficient balance on investing for the improved welfare of the population of Zimbabwe. Consequently the 1,5 % growth GDP envisaged for 2015 fiscal year is a direct result of that party's shameful failure not only to plan for investment in increased capacities in all sectors of the economy but also its refusal to allocate adequate resources for the maintenance of the inherited infrastructure. Statistics posted elsewhere attest to the fact that the productive capacity of the country is well below that achieved in 1972. Hence the 1,5 % growth in GDP must necessarily be considered in the context of a failed economy which is going nowhere and whose drivers have either, at best, no intention to steer it in the positive direction, or, at worst, are only interested in obtaining the most they can salvage from it. \nIn view of the above, we contend that the ZimAsset goal of accelerated economic growth and wealth creation is a pipe dream, never to be achieved in the context of the current crop of socio-economic and political policies employed by ZANU PF. \nNo Sustainable Development \nThe Mid-Term Fiscal Statement does not attempt to assess to what extent it has addressed the second fundamental ZimAsset policy objective of engendering \"a sustainable development and social equity anchored on indigenisation, empowerment and employment creation\" through the judicious exploitation of the country's abundant human and natural resources. \nNowhere in the said statement is there mention of what progress has been achieved in the indigenisation process and what specific targets are attainable. In addition, there is no mention of an overt process towards the equitable distribution and development of resources the country has. We have pointed out in the past and also do so now that the indigenisation act has to be repealed because it is indeed the stumbling block to the very development Zimbabwe is after. Any indigenisation programme has to be based on the nation's ability to access technology and the requisite human and material resources needed to implement the development programme. To the extent that Zimbabwe does not possess the full complement of these critical inputs, such a policy must be discarded at the earliest opportunity. \nThe ZANU PF government cannot, in the context of the current economic environment punctuated by inadequate development infrastructure, policy inconsistences, liquidity challenges, shrinking markets, and the unacceptable shortage of skills occasioned by the brain drain, hope to attract meaningful foreign direct investment needed to shore up the economy. \nZimbabwe one of the weakest economies in Sub-Saharan Africa \nFurther to the above, the Mid - Term Fiscal Policy Statement has shied away from assessing the progress achieved in \"repositioning the country as one of the strongest economies\" in Africa by 2020. As indicated earlier on in this discussion, Zimbabwe is fast losing even its precarious position as the second poorest economy on the continent as it continues to underperform and is lagging badly behind other countries in Africa and in the SADC Sub-region. \nBy its own admission, the Government acknowledges its failure to influence growth in the critical sectors of manufacturing and agriculture. These sectors are suffering from decades of under-investment, adverse policy prescriptions, and brain drain that to hope for a sustained economic growth without implementing robust and internally consistent economic policies which address the structural problems debilitating these sectors borders around fool hardiness. In the absence of adequate amounts of working capital and investible funds, in the absence of production technology which makes them competitive at home and abroad, in the absence of the requisite infrastructure (energy, water, telecommunications, and transport) needed to support production, in the absence the skills, and in the absence of a conducive policy environment, no significant growth in output can ever eventuate. The agricultural sector, for instance, is beset with intractable problems that sustainedgrowth is impossible in the absence of fundamental policy prescriptions. \nThe lack of sufficient long term investment funds, difficulties in accessing viable markets, cost of capital, lack collateral security, inadequate research and development, and inability to access utilities, are the major impediments to the growth and development of the sector. Accordingly, the repositioning of the agricultural sector as one of the strongest sectors in Africa is a dream which can never be realised unless and until Zimbabwe resolves these fundamental problems militating against production and productivity. \nPublic Finances \nConsistent with its appetite forconspicuous consumption, the ZANU PF government has continuedto spend excessively on current consumption at the expense capital investment. Whilst sanity would have dictated that government allocates a significant proportionof itsrevenues towards infrastructural development, only $31,4 million was disbursed towards capital projects. This is a paltry 1,5 % of total government expenditure. Given the serious need to address the infrastructural deficit that is militating against the growth of this economy and the fiscal space problems confronting the fiscus, this paltry allocation for capital expenditure more than demonstrates the serious lack of political will, at the highest level, to address the underdevelopment problems facing the entire nation as national poverty levels deepen. \nThe unbridled expenditures pertainingto the presidential office illustrate this as the travel expense in this department alone during the period under review far exceeds the capital expenditure for the whole nation. Further, it is instructive to note that government borrowed heavily on the domestic financial markets for current consumption amounts which are far in excess of ten times the amount expended on capital projects. This tendency, unfortunately, clearly illustrates the utmost insensitivity to the welfare of the poverty stricken people of Zimbabwe, and crowds out the private sector in the financial markets. \nFurther to the above, the paltry allocations to capital expenditures and other development needs underscore the serious excess capacity utilisation of in the civil service at a time when employment costs continue to chew a disproportionate 74,5 % of the total expenditure. \nCredit must, however, be accorded to government for acknowledging this in its fiscal policy review, but the resolution of the problem is not just to cut down on employment numbers but also the disproportionate allocations to non-productive expenditures which assumedly remain unaffected. More importantly, the problem of ghost workers has been a creation of government over the years. Hence the serious question government has to answer is why it has failed to deal with this unacceptable mismatch of expenditure almost three years into its Zim Asset programme. \nThe perennial problems of poor public finance management practices and the leakages which result therefrom continue unabated. Year after year reports of the Auditor General attest to a growing culture of public funds mismanagement which go unpunished. Both the police and the Anti- Corruption Commission cast a blind eye to these frauds and as a result the volume of crimes related to abuse of public funds continues to grow at the expense of the suffering masses of the country. It is not enough for government to recognise the problem but to stop the practices forthwith and bring to book all perpetrators of these crimes without further delay. \nPublic Debt \nZimbabwe's debt overhang continues to be a serious impediment to the growth of the economy as the failure to service debt necessarily inhibits the inflow of new cheap loanable funds from abroad. Such funds are desperately needed for investment in the productive sectors of the economy and to unlock productive capacities in industry and commerce. A loan repayment of $183,6 million in a six month period represents 2,2 % of the $8,4 billion public and public guaranteed debt and a paltry 8,9 % if total expenditures for the period. It is in the context of the urgent need to unlock the structural problems militating against improving the liquidity situation in the country at the earliest opportunity that the priority placed on repayment of loans is found wanting to say the least. The time it is taking to flush out ghost workers who continue to drain the fiscus at the expense of the majority is inordinately long and can only be sustained in order boost the political fortunes of the ruling party during elections. \nFurther to this, the time it is taking for government to decide on which parastatals to commercialise or sell off is a policy which is weighing down the prospects of economic recovery as the revenues generated in the process could have a telling impact on both the debt overhang and on speeding up infrastructural development. This would increase inflows into the consolidated revenue fund, create opportunities for higher debt repayments, and reduce government loanobligationsto the creditors outside the country. \nAs indicated elsewhere in the fiscal policy review, government is aware that the debt reported officially by it understates the quantum figure that is owed on the domestic market due to the fact that ministries and government department continue to contract services in the absence of funds needed to pay for them. This not only creates financial difficulties to the service provider from a cash flow point of view but also to the nation at large because the funds required to pay for such expenditures may not be available in the consolidated revenue fund. Such practices show lack of adequate expenditure controls on the part of the central ministry of Finance which must be exhorted to exercise its mandate. \nNew Revenue Measures \nThe Minister of Finance failed to quantify the expected impact of each of the policy revenue measures he introduced in his mid - year statement. This is essential to inform policy and strategies to ensure that targets are met. More importantly, the banning of imports of second hand clothing and shoes is inhuman when full cognisance is taken of the volume of vendors who were eking a living out of this. Moreover, the fact that these vendors had a ready market for their wares is evidence enough that a market existed especially in the context of the unacceptably high levels of unemployment and the non- availability of a reasonable disposable income. To assume that banning such imports will help to substantially improve the fortunes of the textile and shoe industries is being far- fetched indeed. \nWebber Chinyadza", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T09:10:53.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
