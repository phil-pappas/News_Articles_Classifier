Several others complained that the computer had to be replaced to fix the problem and they were charged around $500.\n\"This also means that the safety of the vehicle passengers and operators are in jeopardy and potentially face serious injury or death,\" another complainant wrote. People filing complaints are not identified in the agency's database.\nThe agency says the malfunction causes the air bag warning light to illuminate on the dashboard and disables the air bags until repairs are made. Investigators will look into how often the problem happens and decide if a recall is needed.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
