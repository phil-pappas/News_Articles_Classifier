Photo: Philip Brown\nOne place Australians are beating the English this year is in the sovereign bond market.\nWhile the Aussie cricket team has gone down on British soil to lose the coveted Ashes urn, the divergence of policies between the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia means fixed-income investors are reaping better gains Down Under. Australia's debt returned 1.8 per cent this year, while UK gilts rose 0.4 per cent, Bloomberg bond indexes show.\nThe outperformance is a symptom of the economic malaise that has driven the RBA to cut interest rates to a record and say it may reduce them further amid a slowdown in China and a collapse in commodity prices. Increases in the UK benchmark are coming \"pretty soon,\" and will reflect strength in the economy, Bank of England policy maker David Miles said in a BBC interview this week.\n\"Bonds will probably hold in pretty well here compared to gilts,\" said Roger Bridges, the chief global strategist for interest rates and currencies at Nikko Asset Management Australia in Sydney. \"Rates are probably on hold here for some time. Interest rates are likely to go up in the UK\" The company has the equivalent of $US16.9 billion in assets.\nIn the Ashes series being held in the UK, England has won three of the matches so far while Australia triumphed in one. The result is that England has won back the Ashes it lost Down Under less than two years ago.\nAustralia will be seeking a consolation win in the last of the five-game matchup that starts Thursday in London. The nations have been playing cricket tests since 1877 in the game's longest-running rivalry.\nThe two countries also compete in the bond market for money, among a limited number of highly ranked markets.\nAustralia holds AAA status from the three major rating companies. The UK carries the top grade from Standard & Poor's and the second-highest at Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.\nThe only countries outside Australia ranked AAA at all three firms are Canada, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The US has the highest designations from Moody's and Fitch.\nAustralia's 10-year bonds yielded 2.74 per cent and the U.K.'s 1.88 per cent as of Wednesday. Demand for the South Pacific nation's debt has narrowed the difference between the two to less than 90 basis points, about half of what the spread was five years ago.\nBenchmark interest rates are 0.5 per cent in the UK and 2 per cent in Australia.\nAustralia's economy grew 2.7 per cent in 2014, versus 3 per cent for the UK It was the first time the Aussies lagged behind the British since 2006.\nFor the BOE, rate increases will happen \"pretty gradually\" and the normal level will be around 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent, Miles said in the BBC interview broadcast Tuesday.\nEconomy improving In a sign the UK economy is improving enough to withstand higher borrowing costs, the inflation rate unexpectedly rose in July and price growth excluding volatile food and energy costs climbed to the highest level in five months, government data showed this week.\nAustralia's central bank said this week that a weakening currency is assisting a transition away from mining investment, while adding that accommodative policy remains appropriate to support growth.\nInvestment in mining has fallen for six straight quarters, as manufacturing in China, Australia's biggest customer, slows. The price of iron ore, the South Pacific nation's biggest export has tumbled about 38 per cent in the past year.\nRBA governor Glenn Stevens has called for a weaker Australian dollar this year to maintain income from exports, and it has fallen 8 per cent against the pound in the past three months. The result would be a currency loss for British investors holding Australian assets unless they hedged the position.\n\"The RBA will most likely be sitting on their hands at least through 2016, so that doesn't give yields much room to move higher,\" said Anthony Kirkham, who helps oversee the equivalent of $US15 billion in fixed income as the Melbourne-based head of investments and Australian operations at Western Asset Management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:41:27.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
