Photo: Supplied\nWhen our navy, army and air force are defending our coastline from potential intruders, you can be comforted by the fact that they are comforted, by wearing woollen underwear.\nThat's right, our men and women soldiers who risk all for our right to live in a democratic country, wear 100 per cent Australian-made woollen jocks and thongs – known as Wundies – wherever they are fighting.\nThe Victorian Police too have been wearing Wundies since 2003.\nThe Defence Department is one of Wundies' biggest clients. Photo: Supplied\nKerrie Richards, founder and designer of Merino Country, came up with the idea after a few red wines.\nAdvertisement \"We were sitting around thinking, 'Wouldn't people be comfortable in woollen underwear', and then as the evening progressed I decided to make the idea a reality,\" Richards says.\nShe came up with the name Merino Country, as three-quarters of Australia's 71 million sheep are merinos, which produce finer wool than any other Australian breeds.\nWundies: warm in winter. Photo: Supplied\nMerino wool has a high degree of absorbency and breathes, allowing air to circulate which helps minimise body odour and chaffing. It is also environmentally friendly and biodegradable.\n\"We decided to call it 'Wundies' for the obvious reasons and that was back in 1998 but it wasn't until 2009 that we landed the Department of Defence contract, which changed our business dramatically,\" Richards says.\n\"We went from working in a 100-square-metre shed hiring three people to working in a 1000-square-metre shed hiring 20 people.\"\nRichards who grew up Richmond, western Queensland, located on the Flinders Highway, was awarded the Lord Nuffield Scholarship to study farming, with a specialisation in wool production back in 1998 and travelled throughout Europe to experience firsthand the different methods used around the world.\n\"It was an invaluable experience and has helped me expand the business,\" Richards says.\nNot one to rest on her laurels, Richards has now developed the \"Baa Bra\" which she has made in conjunction with breast cancer patients.\n\"We have a lot of people with health problems approach us, especially those with skin conditions, to design underwear that is comfortable,\" Richards says. \"I do my best to develop new products all the time that will make their life a little bit easier.\n\"We have also developed new combat undershirts for the Department of Defence – now being used by police dog squads – that have no underarm and side seams, which they can wear under ballistic and load-bearing vests.\"\nRichards, who closed Merino Country's only retail shop in Brisbane back in 2008, is heavily reliant on big contracts to keep the company going.\n\"We are tendering again at the moment for a few big contracts and fingers crossed that they go our way,\" she says. \"It is tough in the wool business – no pun intended.\"\nPhilip Endersbee​ bought the \"bare bones\" of a textile manufacturing company in May 1989. The company was in receivership but Endersbee saw a future in wool manufacturing and retailing.\n\"I thought that my prospects for success would be better if I pursued products made from wool so I started Wilderness Wear,\" he says. \"I believed at the time that we had a comparative advantage in this fibre and I also went for the outdoor/leisure market because I just felt this would only grow in my lifetime.\"\nEndersbee was right about both areas and decided to make the company 100 per cent Australian owned and operated, only using Australian wool.\n\"We have always been ecologically orientated but in more recent times we have upped the ante by putting it on our suppliers as well,\" he says.\nWilderness Wear now employs 20 people and has a centralised dye house rather than making everything in-house for cost efficiency.\n\"This allows those in these specialist areas to become more efficient in what they do and be right on top of the technology in their space – something which was not possible when our in-house specialists in these areas could not be fully utilised,\" Endersbee says.\n\"This does also mean that some of our ex-staff now run their own business and form part of our supply chain.\"\n Wilderness Wear's bestselling product is merino fleece socks and Endersbee is working on developments in the wool thermal area too that are fire retardant, which are being taken up by employees and companies in the mining and petrochemical industries.\n\"We are now selling online in China where a Chinese online company has taken our product and presented it all in Chinese,\" Endersbee says. \"Exciting times lie ahead especially if the Australian dollar continues to fall.\"\nBut small companies such as Merino Country and Wilderness Wear face difficult times in the manufacturing and retailing game, often living and dying by one big contract.\nThey rely more on word of mouth sales than any advertising or marketing campaign while labour costs in Australia are generally much higher than in a lot of our counterparts.\n\"The two key challenges I see are firstly sourcing of materials, which includes quality, location, costs and lead times,\" David White, Deloitte partner and retail industry leader, says.\n\"Secondly, and most obviously, is the local labour cost. Cost is the ultimate challenge and therefore where companies are competing at the lower price range, so it is very challenging to manufacture in Australia and be able to compete with cheaper overseas sources.\"\nBut White says that despite the difficulties presented there are definitely advantages to having manufacturing control when producing a product on your own shores.\n\"To this point, local manufacturing can also give greater control over quality,\" he says. \"With so much production now outsourced to developing countries, maintaining control over quality and reliability of supply remains an important factor for clothes manufacturers and retailers.\"\nLet's hope Merino Country and Wilderness Wear can continue to manufacture Australian wool in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T02:59:55.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
