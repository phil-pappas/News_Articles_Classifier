Owners of these kinds of patents typically commit to licensing them to competitors at a reasonable rate and on fair terms.\nMicrosoft alleged InterDigital's \"abusive licensing practices\" over its standard, essential patents violate federal anti-monopoly laws.\nInterDigital \"falsely promised\" to license these patents on reasonable terms so they would be accepted as industry standards but then charged exorbitant rates, Microsoft said in the complaint.\nA Microsoft spokesman said this \"violates its commitments and hurts consumers and competition.\"\nA representative for InterDigital had no comment.
