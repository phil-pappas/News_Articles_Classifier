If the economy grows above a certain level, they get more money back from their bonds.\nThe warrants included in a debt deal reached between Ukraine and its biggest creditors on Thursday offer bondholders annual payments for 20 years if economic growth crosses certain thresholds, Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko said at a briefing with journalists late on Thursday.\nHow are payments determined?\nNo payment will be made if growth is less than 3 percent For growth between 3-4 percent, the payment will be 15 percent of the real GDP growth exceeding 3 percent For growth faster than 4 percent, Ukraine will pay holders 40 percent of the expansion beyond 4 percent, in addition to amount for 3-4 percent growth\nWhat are the limitations to payments?\nUkraine won’t pay anything to warrant holders if annual real GDP growth is slower than 3 percent for a year\nThere will be no payments until GDP reaches $125.4 billion, compared with GDP of about $80 billion-$84 billion now, according to Jaresko Payments will be capped at 1 percent of GDP from 2021 to 2025\nWhat are the terms on the warrants?\nThe first payment may be made on Jan. 15, 2021, calculated on growth in 2019 Holders will be eligible for a refund of the 20 percent face value write-off in the restructuring deal, should Ukraine fail to make payments due on the warrants\nThey will carry cross-default clauses on new bonds issued in the restructuring\nWhat are the warrants worth?\nThe country’s IMF program sees 4 percent real growth rate from 2019, making some payments likely even as there’s significant uncertainty on Ukraine’s economic future amid a separatist conflict in its easternmost regions\nThe maturity of the warrants are relatively short compared with other debt overhauls: Argentina gave creditors 30-year instruments while Greece’s is 27 years Barclays sees the warrants adding 3-6 cents to the recovery value in Ukraine’s bond restructuring, assuming 3.5-4 percent growth rate over the long term and a 12 percent exit yield That takes the recovery value for the Eurobonds to 65-70 cents on the dollar, according to Barclays Bank of America values the warrants at 5-10 cents per dollar, assuming 4 percent growth", "external_links": ["http://www.minfin.gov.ua/file/link/425540/file/TS_full.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-08-28T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T16:29:22.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
