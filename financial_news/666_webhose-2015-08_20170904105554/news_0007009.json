AP Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith The slew of energy profit reports this week are set to lay bare major hits to earnings at Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Origin Energy from lower oil prices, while any hopes for an early recovery have faded, increasing pressure for further cuts to spending and costs.\nLast week's further drop has taken prices for US benchmark crude to $US42.50 a barrel , the lowest since early 2009. Brent crude is faring only slightly better, and at just over $US49, is hanging on above the lows it reached in January.\nThe International Energy Agency last week warned that oil markets would likely remain oversupplied until late 2016 or early 2017 as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the US continuing pumping out crude and prospects of an additional 1 million barrels a day coming from Iran.\nResponding to the forecasts, Macquarie Capital said it now believed it would be difficult for prices to sustain any rallies based on fundamental factors for the rest of the year and potentially right through to mid-2016.\nAnalysts are foreshadowing a sharper focus on cost cuts by the local producers as they dig in for the prolonged downturn, with some capex budgets likely to be pared back further while productivity targets could be increased. Some write-downs have already been advised by Origin but analysts are not ruling out further impairments from other companies, on top of those advised in February.\nAt the same time, those with stretched balance sheets – Santos in particular – are coming under huge pressure on the sharemarket, with Santos shares dropping 11 per cent last week amid heightened concerns it will have to buckle and raise equity after all.\nThe \"lower for longer\" oil price outlook means the focus of investors \"will be squarely on the steps each company is taking to reduce expenditure in the face of a declining revenue outlook,\" said UBS energy analyst Nik Burns, who suggested Woodside may increase its cost targets.\nUBS estimates Woodside first-half underlying profit will slump 45 per cent to about $US624 million ($844 million), while Macquarie estimates a more modest decline to $US680 million and Citigroup is at $US673 million.\n Lag won't save profits The lag between changes in oil prices feeding through to liquefied natural gas prices, which protected earnings reported in February from the worst of the decline, will not save profits this season.\nWoodside, which already reported a 28 per cent drop in first half revenues, to $US2.556 billion, will also be closely watched for its commentary around its Browse floating LNG venture, amid challenges both around construction costs and marketing the gas into an oversupplied Asian market.\n\"We are confident of Browse moving forward but the market needs convincing in the project rate of return and offtake,\" Citigroup analyst Dale Koenders said.\nSantos is expected to see its first-half profit hit harder than its larger rival, with Macquarie estimating an 84 per cent slump to just $41 million on an underlying basis. Citi's estimate is $44 million, while UBS has $70 million.\nBut overshadowing the weak numbers will be the issue of whether chief executive David Knox will have to cave in on an equity raising, despite his adamance until now that Santos's balance sheet can see it through the downturn.\nUBS analyst Nik Burns said that with an estimated $8.2 billion of net debt and no control over the oil price, Santos would have been better off raising equity earlier in the year even if it felt it could \"scrape through\".\n\"Because of the reduction they have made in capex and operating costs it looks like they have done enough on our numbers to avoid doing a dilutive equity raise but then it does raise questions around growth in the medium to long term,\" Mr Burns said.\nAt Origin, its core electricity and gas retailing business is set to protect its earnings from some of the oil price effects , although its bottom line for the full year will be hit by $337 million of write-downs on oil and gas assets advised last week, in addition to $53 million announced at the interim results. Citigroup is estimating reported profit for the full 2014-15 year of just $45.5 million, down 92 per cent, while core profit could be 3.4 per cent softer at $733.8 million.\nBut more important will be the update on progress towards the start of production at Origin's $24.7 billion Australia Pacific LNG project in Queensland, with Santos's GLNG venture under similar scrutiny. First production from both mega-ventures is scheduled to get under way this half.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/angelamacd"], "published": "2015-08-16T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:07:16.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
