They come with risks, though.All of them would suffer principal losses if interest rates rose. Some of them (the ones with “corporate” or “credit” in the name) would suffer in a recession that creates a fear of defaults.If you are confident that rates will not rise, go way out on the maturity spectrum with Vanguard Extended Duration ( EDV ). This fund did well in 2014, when rates declined. It’s not doing well in 2015.Another long-maturity product is the Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury fund ( ZROZ ). Typical of this fund family, it’s not particularly cheap.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 IEF iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond 6,237 0.15 184 BLV Vanguard Long-Term Bond 1,158 0.1 185 TLH iShares 10-20 Year Treasury Bond 392 0.15 191 TLT iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond 5,133 0.15 195 TLO SPDR Barclays Long Term Treasury 169 0.1 202 VCLT Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond 962 0.12 216 EDV Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury 363 0.12 222 ILTB iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond 126 0.12 225 VGLT Vanguard Long-Term Government Bond 233 0.12 243 LQD iShares iBoxx $ Invst Grade Crp Bond 21,735 0.15 244 LWC SPDR Barclays Long Term Corp Bd 270 0.12 272 ZROZ Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon US Trs 152 0.15 313 IBCC iShares iBonds Mar 2018 Corp ex-Fincls 173 0.1 326 IBDD iShares iBonds Mar 2023 Corporate 62 0.1 333 CLY iShares 10+ Year Credit Bond 771 0.2 355 CORP Pimco Investment Grade Corporate Bd 235 0.2 357 PLW PowerShares 1-30 Laddered Treasury 281 0.25 422 BAB PowerShares Build America Bond 667 0.27 480 PFXF Market Vectors Pref Secs exFincls 285 0.4 679 BABS SPDR Nuveen Barclays Build Amer Bd 54 0.35 715 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
