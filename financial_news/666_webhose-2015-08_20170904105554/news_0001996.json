Photo: Jessica Hromas\nBoeing's Australian operations set the \"gold standard\" for manufacturing in its global portfolio because of ongoing innovations by the local team that have resulted in more efficient products, Boeing International president Marc Allen has said.\n\"I'm down here seeing how [our Brisbane and Melbourne operations] are doing, but frankly also trying to take a measure of counsel from the success that they have as we think about what it means to accelerate our international process globally,\" the US-based executive said during a visit to Sydney on Wednesday. \"We see that as the gold standard.\"\nI'm down here seeing how [our Brisbane and Melbourne operations] are doing but frankly also trying to take a measure of counsel from the success that they have as we think about what it means to accelerate our international process globally.\nMarc Allen, Boeing International president In Australia – Boeing's largest footprint outside the US, with $1 billion in annual turnover and more than 3000 employees – the company has co-located its research arm at its manufacturing sites to create an environment where it is easy to make incremental improvements to the production process. The aerospace giant also has a deep partnership with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and Australian universities.\nBoeing has 3000 employees in Australia, its largest footprint outside of the US.

But fundamentally it is about the commitment by the government to help us to build and improve the ecosystem we are looking for.\"\nBoeing and CSIRO have jointly invested $120 million in various projects, with one recent success being the development of a lighter top coat for the paint on aircraft.\n\"If you are an airline, you have a lot of weight in your paint,\" Mr Allen said. \"That drives fuel [burn] and that drives emissions. The research done to improve the top coat and reduce weight gives airlines a more competitive airplane to fly and it puts less emissions into the Australian sky .\"\nBoeing's Melbourne operations manufacture products for several of its key commercial aircraft models, including the 737, 747, 777 and 787. It will continue to produce cove lip doors, elevators and rudders for the 777 freighter, however it will not produce those components for the planned next generation 777X passenger aircraft because Boeing last year decided to consolidate that future work in the US .\nFocus outside US Mr Allen said Boeing remained open to expanding its Australian manufacturing and was focused in general on opportunities outside the US, given the majority of its aircraft were now sold outside its home market. \" There are always going to be opportunities over the next five to 10 years for partners around the world to make a compelling case for why they can accelerate our efforts to enhance our market competitiveness,\" he said.\nBoeing already uses Australia as a base for Insitu Pacific, which provides a full range of drone systems for commercial and military applications. The unit sells products as far north as Japan and across south-east Asia. \"That is plainly a model important for continued growth here in the next five to 10 years,\" Mr Allen said.\nThe Australian dollar is now lower than it had been in recent years, but Mr Allen said that was unlikely to by itself make Australia a more attractive destination for Boeing. \"We plainly focus on cost,\" he said. \"But the question isn't where the currency is today. It is where is currency in 12 years? We have to place bets on capability. There are other places where you might look and say I see a clear cost advantage that will hold in 20 years, whether it is a wage structure or something else. Currency is not that kind of effect.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/transport/aviation/boeing-australia-to-miss-out-on-work-for-new-777x-20141007-11bkt7"], "published": "2015-08-06T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:44:07.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
