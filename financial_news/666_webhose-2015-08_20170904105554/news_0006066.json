This followed a Monday report showing homebuilder sentiment in August rose to a near decade-high. \nHousing stocks such as D.R. Horton, Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL - news ) , Lennar, PulteGroup (NYSE: PHM - news ) and KB Home (NYSE: KBH - news ) all rose between 1 and 3 percent following the data. \n\"The good data on housing is certainly helpful since its 4 percent of the U.S. GDP,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's something we know the Fed looks at relative to not only its impact on employment and things residual to the housing market but as well as to the wealth effect of homeowners.\" \nAt 10:59 a.m. ET (1459 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.92 points, or 0.06 percent, at 17,535.26. The biggest drag on the index was Wal-Mart, which fell as much as 3.3 percent to a nearly 2-1/2 year low of $69.55 after its weak results. \nThe S&P 500 was up 0.42 points, or 0.02 percent, at 2,102.86 and the Nasdaq composite was down 8.18 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,083.52. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) on the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the gains in consumer stocks such as Amazon.com (NasdaqGS: AMZN - news ) , up 0.7 percent, on the index, helped lessen the impact of a slump in technology stocks. \nSeven of the 10 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.48 percent fall leading the decliners. \nU.S. oil prices and industrial metals, including copper, traded near six-year lows, amid worries over China's outlook. \nChinese stocks plunged again, reigniting fears that Beijing may be intent on a deeper devaluation of the yuan. A near 2 percent devaluation last week triggered an avalanche of selling by investors across the world who feared Beijing wanted to engineer a much sharper decline to support weak exports. \n\"The problem in China is that the markets haven't been released for free and open trading and until that happens there is going to continue to be downside pressure,\" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. \nIn corporate news, TJX, jumped 6.7 percent to a lifetime high of $76.43 after it reported higher quarterly sales. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,773 to 1,093. On the Nasdaq, 1,564 issues fell and 981 advanced. \nThe S&P 500 index showed 36 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 53 new highs and 47 new lows.
