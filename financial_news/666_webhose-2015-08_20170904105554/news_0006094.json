Photo: Bloomberg\nTwo California district attorneys said Wednesday that background checks by the ridesharing service Uber failed to uncover the criminal records of 25 drivers in two US cities, including several convicted of murder, sex offenses, assaults and various property crimes.\nThe charges were made in a 62-page amended complaint to a civil suit, originally filed in December by the district attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles, that claims Uber has continually misled consumers about the methods it uses to screen drivers.\n\"Most of this complaint, these amendments, are coming as a result of additional discovery,\" said George Gascon, the district attorney in San Francisco. \"In the discovery we are learning increasingly that a lot of the information that Uber has been presenting the consumer has been false and misleading.\"\nThe amended filing also asserts that Uber representatives continually changed their description of Uber's screening methods.\nAn Uber representative said in a statement that the company's background check method was no worse than Livescan, a process used by taxi companies.\n\"The reality is that neither is 100 per cent foolproof - as we discovered last year when putting hundreds of people through our checks who identified themselves as taxi drivers,\" the Uber statement said. \"That process uncovered convictions for DUI, rape, attempted murder, child abuse and violence.\"\nUber, which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary, is valued at around $US50 billion ($68 billion) by investors. The company has raised a multibillion-dollar war chest to finance a global expansion and move into areas like food delivery. But government officials say that in its pursuit of breakneck growth, the company is cutting corners on background checks.\nThe company and its competitors use background check companies that can turn around requests in a day or two. And in states across the USy, Uber - along with rivals Lyft and Sidecar - has continuously fought proposals that would require it to have background checks that would match the checks required of traditional taxi drivers.\nIn California, for instance, Uber and other companies successfully lobbied to kill a law that would have required drivers to undergo a background check by the state's Justice Department, as is required of taxi drivers.\nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:34:06.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
