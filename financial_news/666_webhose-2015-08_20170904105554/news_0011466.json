Here, first home buyers and The Sunday Times reporters Claire Bickers and Kristy Symonds share their stories.\nCLAIRE: First home buyer options in Perth have come a long way since my grandparents bought their first home in 1952 for 190 pounds.\nIt was a 983sq m block in Bedford, which would go for something like $750,000 these days.\nThey lived in a shed on the property while waiting two and a half years for bricks. T he Sunday Times journalist Claire Bickers Source: News Corp Australia\nMy grandparents had to wheel their push bikes through sand to Beaufort St before they got to an established road.\nBut our generation’s struggle is a bit different.\nIt has more to do with affordability and the toss-up between whether to live in a shoebox in the inner city, a smaller or slightly run down home in the middle ring, or a new home in the outer suburbs.\nThere are pros and cons to all these options but an inner city apartment or villa checks nearly every box on my must-have list.\nI was initially torn between a property that would make the best investment in the long term, and picking something with more “lifestyle” appeal.\nBut a new home in the outer suburbs wasn’t for me.\nI don’t need the space for a growing family or pets, and the added travel time — which can be an hour both ways in soul-sucking traffic these days — would cut into exercise or leisure time.\nThe amount of housing supply still to come in many of the fringe estates also means there’s less competition, and as such, less potential for capital growth.\nSo I looked at areas with big blocks, established properties, lots of amenities and the potential for capital growth.\nAreas like Craigie and Coolbellup had a few affordable properties with potential.\nI found they could be great renovation projects and had the space for a family somewhere way down the line.\nAnd if I wanted to rent it out, these places would appeal to families for the same reasons I wanted to live there. Claire opted for a villa with a few rooms and small courtyard over a house. Source: News Limited\nBut ‘lifestyle’ won in the end.\nI’d rather spend my weekends catching up with friends and family, playing sport or chilling out than looking after a big backyard or cleaning and fixing up a home.\nSomething with a few rooms and a small courtyard or balcony just 10 to 15 minutes from work would be perfect.\nThe near-city suburbs also have more things within walking distance, so I’ll happily compromise on floor space and appearance for this.\nBut real estate industry experts warn buyers to be careful when checking out a strata complex’s age and mix of tenants.\nShoebox-sized one-bedrooms or studios are out — experts say most of the Perth market still prefers two bedrooms, so for resale or potential rental prospects after I move out, a minimum of two bedrooms would be non-negotiable.\nUnfortunately, this rules out many of the gorgeous new off-the-plan apartments.\nThere’s plenty of them going up at the moment and a lot of them are in the nicer areas.\nBut they can be pricey for a studio, let alone a one-bedroom.\nSo, with a property type decided and a decent amount of savings, I saw a mortgage broker to help me crunch the numbers on what I could afford.\nThe first time I went, nearly 18 months ago, he said I was in an ‘ok’ position to buy.\nBut he recommended I wait a year to boost my savings.\nAt that stage, I would have been able to afford a property about $320,000, which was not ideal considering anything below $350,000 is pretty rare in the market.\nWhen we met again in April this year, we decided I could now look for properties about $360,000 without the repayments becoming uncomfortable — about $400 a week. Dianella, the suburb Claire now calls home Source: News Limited\nMaylands, Joondanna, Yokine, Dianella and Inglewood were my main hunting grounds, with a good mix of townhouses, apartments and villas near parks, cafe strips and the city.\nThere were some great affordable areas in the eastern suburbs and south of the river, but I wanted to stay near family.\nI looked for months but there was nothing just right.\nWhen the May Budget revealed the State Government was going to cut the First Home Owner Grant for established properties entirely, I decided to ramp up the search.\nThe $3000 might not seem like much, but it all helps when you consider fees, furniture and everything else it takes to set up a house.\nIt seems strange that the government is promoting the benefits of a higher density Perth with Directions 2031 on the one hand, and then introducing measures that will push first home buyers to build in the outer suburbs on the other.\nWe might not be pushing our bikes through sand to reach the nearest established road any more, but the first home buyer journey still has its challenges.\nIn June, I found my new home.\nIt’s a two-bedroom, one-bathroom villa with a little courtyard in a small complex in Dianella, which I picked up for $345,000.\nIt might not be shiny and new — the kitchen and bathroom will need a bit of work — but it’s got good bones and it’s mine.\nIt’s not something I’ll hold onto for 60 years, but imagine the property prices then.\nKRISTY: For as long as I can remember, I have romanticised the idea of living in the suburbs.\nSo when it came to buying my first home, a 4x2 in ‘the sticks’ seemed like a no-brainer. The Sunday Times journalist Kristy Symonds Source: News Corp Australia\nI spent the first several years of my childhood roaming around on more than 1000sq m.\nWith a pool, a swing set, two walk-in bird aviaries — where I indulged in my dreams of being a young Dr Dolittle — fig trees to climb and a banana palm jungle to get lost in, it felt like my own little slice of kid’s paradise.\nWhen we ‘downsized’ to a 780sq m block in the Bibra Lake area, where the house consumed more of the land to accommodate our growing family, there was still room enough for plenty of grass and a cubby house in our younger years and a pool and patio — perfect for parties — in our teenage years.\nBut things have changed now — both when it comes to my personal preference and the reality of what options are available to me.\nWorking as an entertainment reporter in the city, a huge part of my job means going out a handful of nights a week to concerts and stage shows in the Perth CBD and immediate surrounds.\nThis means I had to weigh up the impacts of extended travel time on my work activities against my ability to accommodate my fur family.\nI currently rent in the southern suburbs and getting into the office early for an interview or home after dinner or a show with friends is difficult and sometimes impossible thanks to peak hour traffic and a bus service which ceases at 7.15pm.\nI don’t deny the utter inconvenience of having to factor in more than an hour’s travel time to weekday plans and the frustration of living so far from friends I’ve made since working in this job.\nBut living in a small, inner-city apartment was still off the cards for me. Kristy decided she’d rather spend weekends removed from city life Source: News Corp Australia\nThe government is nudging first home owners down the building path, with the First Home Owner Grant for those purchasing or building a new home increasing to $10,000 in September 2013, while the grant for those buying pre-established has been slashed.\nAt the risk of sounding uncool, going out so much as I do for work means I’d rather spend my weekends removed from the hustle and bustle of city life, having a barbecue and drinks with friends in my alfresco, playing with my dog in the backyard and going for a stroll through the quiet streets and parks.\nMost of my childhood friends live in the southern suburbs, too, so when we catch up, we’re big on dinners at home, movie nights or venturing to one of the many local pubs or cafes still available to us.\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I’m a bit of a collector and I love my space and alone time.\nI like the idea of having plenty of rooms to decorate and chill out in — a home office and a theatre room are hugely appealing to me.\nWith all this in mind, I started scoping out potential areas to buy in and what kind of house and land packages were available there, which for me, with relatively little knowledge about the property market, meant starting out with a general scan of real estate.\ncom.au and the main first home buyer companies such as Homebuyers Centre and Easystart Homes.\nI initially liked the look of areas like Harrisdale and Byford but, while these areas had beautiful amenities and a huge pool of fellow first home buyers, my heart very quickly became set on Wellard.\nThe suburb is practically built around the Mandurah train line, which would make getting into work a cinch.\nDriving through Wellard to get acquainted with it, I was particularly taken by The Village at Wellard, a blossoming and picturesque estate with a family friendly vibe.\nThe shopping district, Wellard Square, recently went up and features a mix of shops, food outlets, a medical centre and a cafe.\nWith a proposed tavern and couple of schools already up and running nearby, I felt like this wasn’t just a great place for me but an excellent investment opportunity. The Village estate at Wellard, where Kristy decided to build. Source: Supplied\nHaving already reached out to a mortgage broker to help guide my search, I knew a block in The Village was roughly within my reach so I put down a $2000 deposit and joined the Aussie Living waiting list for the next land release late last year.\nUnfortunately, I joined a queue behind people who had been in line for months and, as the blocks were allocated on a first come, first served basis, I missed out on getting a squat block, which is basically a short, fat block between 330 and 360sq m, big enough to fit a 4x2 on.\nNot satisfied with the idea of owning a cottage block, I decided to leave my deposit with Aussie Living for the next release and keep looking with other companies for house and land packages in the surrounding areas.\nMany tried to push me further south into areas such as Baldivis and, while I had family and friends building there and it would have been less of a stretch financially, I had my sights firmly set on Wellard and the prime location of land next to the train station.\nFeeling disillusioned with the whole home buying situation and just as I was starting to accept I would have to readjust my expectations, I finally got the call from Aussie Living in May last year about the next release.\nI was first on the waiting list and this is where the real decision-making came into play.\nBeing at the top of the lot list meant I got to choose between the two squat blocks in the release.\nSince the smaller one would save me less than $10,000, I decided the extra land was worth the extra pennies and went with the 360sq m block — not quite the kids’ paradise I grew up on, but enough for my animals and I to enjoy.\nSince then, I met my partner and we got engaged.\nThis means I’ve had someone to bounce ideas off and share the stress with during the ‘fun’ parts such as pre-start.\nAlthough I’m not exactly eager to start this whole process again any time soon, we’ll probably look at investing in another property or even upgrading in a few years’ time.\nBut, for now, we’re just enjoying watching our house go up.\nWith roof carpentry now completed, it shouldn’t be too long before we’re in.\nWish us luck!\nClick here to download the full guide\nRead More\nOriginally published as Perth’s established homes v new builds ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-would-you-buy-an-established-perth-home-or-a-new-build/story-fndbaln9-1227498350401?sv=674dd902a7b58e05a7ae4f263c7bf5b3", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-would-you-buy-an-established-perth-home-or-a-new-build/story-fndbaln9-1227498350401?sv=674dd902a7b58e05a7ae4f263c7bf5b3&title=Perth%26%238217%3Bs+established+homes+v+new+builds", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-would-you-buy-an-established-perth-home-or-a-new-build/story-fndbaln9-1227498350401?sv=674dd902a7b58e05a7ae4f263c7bf5b3", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Perth%26%238217%3Bs+established+homes+v+new+builds&c=URBAN+shoebox+or+urban+sprawl%3F+Here%2C+first+home+buyers+and+%3Ci%3EThe+Sunday+Times+%3C%2Fi%3Ereporters+Claire+Bickers+and+Kristy+Symonds+share+their+stories.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-would-you-buy-an-established-perth-home-or-a-new-build/story-fndbaln9-1227498350401?sv=674dd902a7b58e05a7ae4f263c7bf5b3", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-would-you-buy-an-established-perth-home-or-a-new-build/story-fndbaln9-1227498350401?sv=674dd902a7b58e05a7ae4f263c7bf5b3&h=Perth%26%238217%3Bs+established+homes+v+new+builds", "http://media.perthnow.com.au/fe/2015/pdf/FirstHomeBuyer_MegaGuide.pdf", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/realestate/news/first-home-buyers-would-you-buy-an-established-perth-home-or-a-new-build/story-fnhlgriw-1227498350401", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/first-home-buyers-would-you-buy-an-established-perth-home-or-a-new-build/story-fndbaln9-1227498350401?sv=674dd902a7b58e05a7ae4f263c7bf5b3&title=Perth%26%238217%3Bs+established+homes+v+new+builds"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:37:58.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
