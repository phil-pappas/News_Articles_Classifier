Wind also has high debt. \nGOVERNANCE \nIt remains to be see how the joint ownership will work, especially since Hutchison and Vimpelcom are backed by powerful billionaires. \nHutchison Chairman Li Ka-shing and Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman -- whose LetterOne fund holds 47.9 percent of Vimpelcom's voting rights -- have held on-off talks for years on a deal in Italy and came close a few times before scrapping it at the eleventh hour over control. \n\"This is a true and well-balanced joint venture with Hutch and Vimpelcom sharing equal power,\" said the person close to the deal, adding the six-person board would be evenly split. \nMaximo Ibarra, chief executive of Wind, will become CEO of the new entity. Stefano Invernizzi, finance chief of 3 Italia will serve as chief financial officer of the combined group, and Hutchison will name the first chairman. \nThe companies expect the deal to close in 12 months, and said they would begin discussions towards regulatory approval as early as September. \nAs in other mobile deals in Europe, regulators are expected to demand concessions to protect consumers from higher prices, such as requiring the new company to rent out space on its network to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). \nBut since European and national regulators have already given the green light to similar deals in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) , Germany and Austria, Italian consolidation is expected to get approval. \nVimpelcom's CEO Jean-Yves Charlier said the agreement with Hutchison allowed both parties to walk away from the deal if regulators demanded concessions that made it unpalatable. \nHutchison has considerable experience dealing with antitrust regulators since it was involved in similar transactions in Austria and Ireland. It is also now in the process of seeking approvals for acquisitions in Denmark and Britain. \nPaul Marsch, a telecoms analyst at Berenberg Bank, said it remained to be seen how European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager would approach the negotiation over remedies. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) put European telecom companies, which have been in a frenzy of dealmaking in the past two years, on notice in June by saying consolidation could be bad for consumers and innovation. \n\"We will know pretty soon whether Vestager's tough words translate into tough action,\" said Marsch. \nHutchison was advised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and law firm Freshfields. Vimpelcom was advised by HSBC and Morgan Stanley, and law firm Allen & Overy. \n($1 = 0.9186 euros) (Editing by Jane Merriman and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T07:14:21.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
