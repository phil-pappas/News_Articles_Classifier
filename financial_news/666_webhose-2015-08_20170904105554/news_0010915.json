Or as they're referred to by many in the industry - the strategic partnerships. \nThose partnerships provide private jet customers with a long list of cushy benefits above and beyond the actual flying experience, including such things as VIP access to concerts and sporting events, free nights at some of the world's top resorts, exclusive shopping opportunities at leading jewelers and fashion houses, complimentary meals and spa treatments and the ability to rub elbows with celebrities at specially curated members-only events. \nProviding such benefits or perks to fliers is a trend that's growing more commonplace and in some cases, over the top, with each passing day \nAlthough many of the industry's executives stress that their first priority is providing an outstanding flying experience, it's hard to downplay the allure of such fringe benefits. While others in the industry have no qualms about acknowledging the incredibly luxurious benefits of being among the private jet flying elite. \n\"Even though our core service is getting members to where they want to go, we don't look at ourselves as just a private aviation or transportation company, but more as a lifestyle membership club,\" says Mark Sage, chief brand officer for Wheels Up , a membership-based private aviation company. \"And we've established a robust set of member benefits. It ranges from jewelers to resorts to luxury retreats. We have really created, and continued to add A-list partners...We've negotiated such incredible deals with our partners that they don't want the general public knowing about these deals.\" \nSounds pretty great right? And upon closer inspection of the details, it gets more enticing. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T19:03:08.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
