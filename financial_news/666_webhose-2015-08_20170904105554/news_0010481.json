The result is mortgage rates took another dip as reported by the weekly rate survey published by industry secondary giant Freddie Mac (Federal National Home Loan Mortgage Corporation). The benchmark 30 year mortgage dropped nearly 10 basis points in week over week reporting to wind up at 3.840% . That rate hasn’t been seen in nearly three months. \nThe Fed’s decision \nMany had factored in China’s money woes as the reason on why the Fe d would increase rates and the impact would be higher cost to consumers for durable goods as well as mortgage loans. Wall Street took notice and rates plunged across the board. However the last couple of trading days have given hope as the market has recovered while posting some above market increases. \nThe Fed’s decision as well as home sales data which shows buyers snapping up properties at impressive levels which point to the real estate industry is experiencing a seller’s market.

Interest rates also rocked up and down -- although to a lesser extent than equities -- as investors alternated between flights to quality and bargain hunting among beaten-down stocks. Amidst all this confusion, the 30-year mortgage rate dropped to 3.84 percent, the lowest mark since May and the fifth consecutive week with a rate below 4 percent.\" Sean Becketti, Chief Economist, Freddie Mac \nThe 10 basis points drop for the 30 year mortgage is within typical range movement. The 15 year mortgage dropped to 3.060% and adjustable rate mortgages are as low as 2.620%. \nThe rate survey is published weekly by Freddie Mac. The data is comprised from its nationwide network of approved lenders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T08:53:18.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
