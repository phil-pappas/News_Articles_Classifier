One of Comes’ co-authors sees big opportunities in the market today. ‘That is the one space that hasn’t cured from the financial crisis for a variety of reasons,' said David Kotok, Chairman and Chief Investment Officer at Cumberland. ‘Munis are cheap, therefore, and all it takes is a little good research and work, and you can pick ones and they will pay you a tax-free return and that’s super.’ Comes and Kotok spoke at Camp Kotok, an annual gathering of economists and money managers held in Maine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:32:57.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
