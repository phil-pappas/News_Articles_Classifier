However, people aged between 14 and 31, using the internet was their No. 1.\nAdvertisement Forty-four per cent of viewing was on linear broadcast, however, the impact of subscription video on-demand (SVOD) services such as Netflix, Presto (a joint venture between Seven West Media and Foxtel) and Stan (a joint venture between Nine Entertainment and Fairfax Media, publisher of The Australian Financial Review and BusinessDay on the younger generation.\nTrailing millennials, those aged from 14 to 25, only 26 per cent of viewing was through linear broadcast, and 31 per cent was streamed.\nOverall, streaming made up 18 per cent of viewing.\n \"Education in, and familiarity with, the SVOD offerings will be key to enticing more subscribers, with many consumers in Australia not yet familiar with video streaming. Nineteen percent of current subscribers' primary reason for purchasing was because they 'wanted to see what it could offer',\" the report said.\n\"As such, SVOD platforms will need to find ways to convert these short-term experimentalists into long-term enthusiast subscribers. Where this has been achieved in other markets such as the US and UK, it has been a function of comprehensive content libraries, original programming and price points that compare favourably to renting or purchasing alternatives\"\nHowever, linear broadcast still retains its importance in helping people discover new content. 62 per cent of respondents said that television commercials were in their top three ways on learning about new shows, movies and online content.\n\"However, as we are bombarded with choice (in what we watch, when, how and where) and as our media habits shift, our means of discovering new content will also need to change,\" said the report.\nWith an average of two TVs, two laptops, two tablets and two smartphones in each household, it's no surprise 85 per cent of respondents multitask while watching TV, up from 79 per cent in 2014.\nA total of 31 per cent used social media while watching TV, however that jumped to 49 per cent for millennials. 57 per cent of people used their smartphones was watching television.\nConsumers are becoming more open to monthly low-cost subscription services, but that doesn't mean Foxtel will lose out. 39 per cent of respondents have pay television, which has been stable for the last four years, with only 4 per cent thinking of cancelling.\n\"Furthermore, the proliferation of SVOD entrants could lead to an uptick in pay TV subscribers as consumers embrace paid content models, respond to innovative price points and channel unbundling, and look for depth of content that may not yet be offered in a SVOD environment.\"\n\"There remains room in the market for ad-funded streaming â€“ 58 per cent strongly agree or somewhat agree that they would be willing to view advertising with their streaming video programming if it significantly reduced the cost of the subscription.\n\"This provides the opportunity for current catch-up ad funded models to position themselves more aggressively in (and against) the SVOD market with a 'premium and free' proposition,\" the report said.", "external_links": ["http://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-consumer-survey-2015.html"], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:35:01.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
