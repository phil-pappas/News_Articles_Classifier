The metal fell as low as $1,079.50 on Friday, near last month’s trough of $1,077, its weakest since February 2010.\nBullion lost almost 7 percent in July, its deepest monthly fall since June 2013. It fell for a sixth straight week last week, its longest retreat since 1999.\nInvestors are eyeing the next monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, and a strong print could mean further weakness for gold, said Gan.\n“If indicators show the U.S. economy is improving very strongly, it does give a cue that gold may breach the $1,000 support,” he said.\nUS gold for December delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $1,093.60 an ounce.\nHedge funds and money managers kept their first bearish stance in COMEX gold in at least a decade during the week ended July 28, suggesting the recent mass exodus from bullion was more than a knee-jerk reaction.\nThere is unlikely to be strong technical support for gold until it hits the February 2010 low of around $1,044, said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir, who expects the metal to trade between $1,050 and $1,131 through this month.\nAmid waning interest in bullion, holdings in SPDR Gold Trust , the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped again, to 21.63 million ounces on Friday, the lowest since September 2008.\nSpot platinum dropped 0.4 percent and palladium gained 0.5 percent, with both not far off multi-year lows. INTL FCStone’s Meir expects continued weakness in August on more South African supply and slower Chinese car sales.\nSpot silver eased 0.2 percent to $14.74 an ounce.\nFirst Published on August 03, 2015 10:02 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T08:24:11.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
