That took the euro to a two-week low of $1.0847, with a rise in short-dated Treasury yields adding to the dollar's allure as rate differentials moved in its favour.\n\"More (dollar) gains are dependant on how payrolls data is on Friday and whether earnings are picking up,\" said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea. \"A good payrolls number will no doubt support Lockhart's view and help the dollar gain more ground.\"\nLockhart, a voter this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, told the Wall Street Journal that it would take \"significant deterioration\" in the U.S. economy for him to not support a rate hike in September.\nBut with the fed funds rate - which enables investors to bet on when U.S. rates will rise - indicating only a 50 percent chance of liftoff in September, the odds of a hike then are still seen hinging on Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls data.\nBefore that, the ADP employment and ISM non-manufacturing surveys will be in focus to give investors an idea about whether the economy and employment growth was picking up. Robust numbers will make the Fed more comfortable over the prospect of starting to raise interest rates in a gradual manner.\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar saw profit takers chip away at some of the big gains it made on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia toned down its call for a weaker currency. The Aussie dipped 0.4 percent to $0.7350 after surging 1.3 percent on Tuesday to a two-week high of $0.7428.\n\"There is little reason to buy commodity currencies like the Aussie right now, and its gains were fuelled mostly by short covering,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.
