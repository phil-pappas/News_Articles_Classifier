The company has worked for clients including the Financial Times and European Parliament, but is seeking a profile boost from a new video created for the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism organisation with strong links to the Government. \nThe video, #NotAnotherBrother, was published online last week via social media without declaring its links to Quilliam. It is meant to deter British Muslims from being drawn into Isil ideology and depicts a young man apparently imprisoned or hiding in Syria, reading a letter from his brother at home in the UK. \n“I wish I could see your face,” an emotional voiceover says. “I’d tell you I was sorry. I wish I could take back every time I sent you a tweet or got all gassed up saying that the West has turned its back on us.” \nSven Hughes, founder of Verbalisation, a former British Army psyops reservist, who served in Afghanistan, said the script had been written by the company’s team of psychologists “to take the fight to Isil in verbal space”. \nThe company is also understood to count former MI6 officers and members of the special forces among its staff. \nMr Hughes said: “The moment you have psyops mentioned in the background there are all sorts of connotations that are not justified. But I don’t see anything sinister in it.” \n“We have just been looking at the way Isil uses language and how we can better intervene. This is much more advanced than NLP or anything like that but its not as spooky as it might seem. It is marketing.” \nJonathan Russell, political liaison officer at Quilliam, said the film was part of the foundation’s recent effort to be more directly involved in counter-radicalisation. Previously it focused on advising the Government. \nHe highlighted the fact that although most of the Isil material seen in the mainstream in the West is designed to terrorise, the majority of what it produces is meant to entice muslims with “a sense of belonging and creating a utopian so-called caliphate”. \nMr Russell said: “We want to promote the idea that a strong counter-narrative to that is a way to go.” \nThe film, now posted to YouTube, was paid for by donations. Verbalisation is aiming to spread its brand of psyops into more commercial spheres, arguing that \"nobody is focused on the verbal side of things\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:58:56.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
