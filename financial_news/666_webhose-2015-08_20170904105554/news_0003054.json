Mutual fund companies managed $1.2 trillion worth of assets at the end of June, compared with $84.7 billion worth of exchange-traded funds, according to figures compiled by the Investment Funds Institute of Canada and the Canadian ETF Association.\nBrox says ETFs have their place, but that most Canadians want the simplicity of mutual funds as part of a holistic financial plan developed in partnership with a professional.\n\"Most people don't have the time to do their own market research, and the majority of people want to discuss their goals,\" she says.\nJeff Kaminker, president of Frontwater Capital, said the enduring popularity of mutual funds is a reflection of conservative Canadian investing strategies.\n\"When it comes to investment, Canadians go with what's comfortable,\" he says, adding that while mutual funds generally come with higher fees, there's a reason for that.\n\"Mutual funds have to make up a lot of territory to offset the higher expense ratios.\"\nSandeep Gosal, an associate consultant at research firm Investor Economics, says it's not easy to do an apples-to-apples comparison between mutual funds and ETFs because the prices for each can vary.\nData from Investor Economics shows that stock-based mutual funds often charge more than two per cent to manage your money, while pricing for stock-based ETFs can be as low as 0.2 per cent.\nWhile mutual funds can have fees for buying in, buying out and extra commissions, ETFs can also bring extra costs, Gosal said. Because they are traded on exchanges, investors often need to pay trading fees, and Gosal said that some ETFs are now adding commissions, known as trailer fees, of up to 0.75 per cent.\nFinancial planner Shannon Lee Simmons says there's no right answer in choosing between ETFs and mutual funds.\nWhile mutual funds can bring higher fees, they also come with a lot more personal attention and a much higher level of service, she says.\n\"It's not a matter of one being better for the other. It's a matter of what's best for the individual.\"\nFor people who don't need any advice, she said, buying an ETF on an exchange is a more cost-effective way of investing.\nFor everyone else, it's important to know what fees you're paying and what they're buying, Simmons says.\n\"You need to make sure there's value there.\"\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:55:05.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
