BEN MACMAHON Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Liberal MPs fuming over the fallout from Prime Minister Tony Abbott's \"captain's pick\" of Bronwyn Bishop for Speaker are warning him to stay away from the process to select a replacement.\nWith Mr Abbott's leadership diminished by the episode and all politicians tarnished, MPs and ministers put their foot down Monday and said the Liberal Party room would decide who would replace Ms Bishop. They would hold a ballot if necessary.\nAs jostling for the job began in earnest following Ms Bishop's resignation , the two early frontrunners were Victorian MP Tony Smith and South Australian Andrew Southcott.\n\"This has been a shocking three weeks,\" said one minister who agreed Mr Abbott needed to let his MPs take charge of the process.\nDavid Rowe Another said \"the backbench is saying 'no more captain's picks'.\"\n\"The management is crucial. Let the backbench have lead role in this . If you've got no option, embrace democracy.\"\nMr Abbott secured Mrs Bishop's resignation on Sunday but sources told the The Australian Financial Review the Prime Minister only shifted at the very end, despite Mrs Bishop's largesse wreaking havoc on his government for three weeks.\nAbbott held fast They said as late as Saturday, Mr Abbott was still refusing overtures from ministers and MPs to push out Mrs Bishop.\nBut he changed the next day only after Mrs Bishop received another belting from the Sunday papers and MPs began threatening to abstain rather than vote in Parliament next week against a no-confidence motion in Mrs Bishop which Labor and the independents were going to move.\nIt is unlikely enough MPs were going to revolt to allow the motion to pass but the spectre of abstentions would have been humiliation enough for Mr Abbott.\nThere was residual anger that Mr Abbott had let the episode drag on for three weeks and when, on Sunday, he cleared Mrs Bishop of any wrongdoing by blaming her downfall on the nebulous nature of the expenses system.\nHe ordered a root-and branch review of the rules to be led by former bureaucrat David Tune and Remuneration Tribunal chief executive John Conde.\n\"They're mates, he didn't want to turn on her,\" said one Liberal MP.\n\"With the public, it's like we're showing no contrition here. No-one did anything wrong, yet the Speaker lost her job.\"\nReview will help Malcolm Turnbull challenged the rationale, saying while a review would help, the rules would always involve a degree of ambiguity and only common sense and personal judgement would make them work.\nHe said Mrs Bishop should never have taken a helicopter from Melbourne to Geelong for a Liberal party fundraiser last year.\n\"There are some areas of ambiguity in the entitlement system but I really think … the fundamental principle is often one of common sense,\" he said.\n\"It was Bronwyn's decision, the helicopter was her call. She didn't have to get a helicopter to Geelong, that's what set this thing off.\"\n﻿\nOn Monday, Mr Abbott admitted Mrs Bishop had erred.\n\"While she obviously had done the wrong thing in a number of significant respects, she abundantly did the right thing yesterday,\" he said.\nHe said she had not been offered any deal to resign.\nLikely candidates Apart from Mr Smith and Mr Southcott, other potential candidates include Victorian MP Russell Broadbent, South Australian Rowan Ramsey, NSW frontbencher Bob Baldwin, WA's Nola Marino and Queensland's Teresa Gambaro.\n​The victor will be chosen by a ballot of the party room when Parliament resumes next week.\nThere was no support for veteran Philip Ruddock, nor for giving the job to deputy Speaker and Nationals MP Bruce Scott.\n\"We don't give anything away,\" said one Liberal.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten said Labor would be happy with anyone as long as they were not a political warrior like Mrs Bishop.\n\"I just think we need people who are not fierce, right-wing political extremists,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/choper_race_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-03T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:25:14.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
