He said Zimbabwe had all-weather-friends like Russia, China and Belarus which he said were willing to lend millions of dollars towards economic recovery. \nVP Mnangagwa said Government was now working on investment packages as it moves to attract more investors. \n\"President Mugabe set up a team which I chair to spearhead economic recovery. Under the guidance of President Mugabe we have been to China and that country is in the next 10 years going to avail $10 billion to the African continent. We are working on having bankable projects to access those funds. \n\"A team of Chinese experts was here to evaluate each of the mega deals signed by President Mugabe when he visited the Asian country last year to enable the financing of the projects to start,\" he said. \nVP Mnangagwa urged Zimbabweans to remain resolute and support President Mugabe and his pro-people policies. \n\"President Mugabe is a visionary. He said people must get back their land and while the decision was not popular with Britain and her allies, he was resolute and now we are proud owners of our natural resources. Yes, we have been down, but certainly not out. We are now up, we are moving forward towards a brighter future,\" said VP Mnangagwa. \nTurning to his prepared speech, VP Mnangagwa commended the owner of Dazzle Superstore, Brennan De Bruyn for investing $4 million in the project. \nHe said he was delighted to note that Cde Bruyn, a member of the ANC in South Africa, wanted to invest in property and textile industry in the country. \nVP Mnangagwa said Government was actively involved in the 'Buy Zimbabwe' initiative and encouraged the retail sector to support the initiative by buying their goods from local producers. \n\"Government is therefore committed to make Zimbabwe a more attractive investment destination,\" he said.
