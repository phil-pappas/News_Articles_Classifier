The report found widespread employment of asylum seekers and other cheap foreign laborers from Africa and Asia.\nThose workers complained of working conditions that included lower wages than Japanese laborers doing equivalent work, a lack of safeguards and abuses at the hands of labor brokers who charge up to a third of their wages to place them in Subaru-related jobs, Reuters found.\nFuji Heavy said it \"expects all employees to be treated fairly, with dignity and respect and to be provided with appropriate workplace protections.\" It said its policies called for respect for \"human rights and international standards of behavior and the ethical standards of our stakeholders.\" (Reporting By Kevin Krolicki ; Editing by Sandra Maler )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T22:10:43.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
