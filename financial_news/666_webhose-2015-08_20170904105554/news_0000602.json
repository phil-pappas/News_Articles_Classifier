It gained 1 percent in the previous session, boosted by better-than-expected results and a rebound in the mining sector. \nBP and Anglo American contributed to Thursday's falls as they traded without the attraction of their latest dividend payouts. \nBP was the faller, down 3 percent, while Anglo American shed 2.6 percent. The two combined to take nearly 10 points off the index. \nAlso in focus for equity investors, the Bank of England is releasing a slew of data at 1100 GMT, and is likely to reveal its policymakers have split over interest rates, adding to expectations that the central bank is heading for its first increase in borrowing costs in nearly a decade.
