That equates to a value of $US66.36 per Cameron share. That's a 56 per cent premium to the Houston company's Tuesday closing price of $US42.47. Schlumberger and Cameron put the acquisition's total value at $US14.8 billion. The combined company had 2014 pro forma revenue of $US59 billion. \"We believe that the next industry technical breakthrough will be achieved through integration of Schlumberger's reservoir and well technologies with Cameron's leadership in surface, drilling, processing and flow control technologies,\" Schlumberger chairman and chief executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a written statement on Wednesday. Cameron shareholders will own about 10 per cent of Schlumberger Ltd's outstanding stock once the transaction closes. The deal is expected to add to Schlumberger's earnings per share in the first year after closing. Both companies' boards unanimously approved the acquisition, which is expected to close in 2016's first quarter. It still needs approval from Cameron shareholders. Schlumberger has principal offices in Paris, Houston, London and The Hague. Cameron shares jumped $US17.46, or 41 per cent, to $US59.93, while Schlumberger shares fell $US2.43, or 3.4 per cent, to $US70.09.
