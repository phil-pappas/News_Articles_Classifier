The project is aimed at preventing weevil infestation on cereals. \nProf. Fulton said the project would cover one thousand communities in five regions in Ghana and would be implemented between August 2015 and June 2016. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T01:31:23.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
