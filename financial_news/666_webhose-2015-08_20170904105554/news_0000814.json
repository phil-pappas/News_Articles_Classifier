Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.\n\"It's position-squaring,\" said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital in Stamford, Connecticut. \"There's no one taking serious bets here for non- farm payrolls.\"\nAnalysts said a dip in oil prices to multi-month lows also boosted 30-year Treasury prices. Declining oil prices suggest lower inflation, which benefits longer-dated Treasuries prices since it preserves the value of interest payouts.\n\"The TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) market is very skeptical on whether the Fed will reach its 2 percent inflation target well into the future,\" said Shyam Rajan, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.\nHe said the 30-year inflation breakeven rate, currently at about 1.83 percent, suggested that inflation was running well below the central bank's target. The 30-year inflation breakeven rate is the yield difference between 30-year TIPS and regular 30-year Treasury bonds.\nWeakness on U.S. stock markets also fueled some safe-haven bids for Treasuries, analysts said. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index was last down 0.75 percent.\nU.S. 30-year Treasuries prices were last up 25/32 in price to yield 2.90 percent compared with a yield of 2.94 percent late on Wednesday. Benchmark 10-year notes were last up 10/32 in price to yield 2.23 percent, compared with a yield of 2.27 percent on Wednesday.\nThree-year notes were last up 2/32 in price to yield 1.06 percent, down from a yield of 1.08 percent on Wednesday.
