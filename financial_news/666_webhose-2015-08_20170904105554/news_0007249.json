Subway came in second place (33.8%) and IHOP came in third place (32.1%) as restaurant chains at which these so-called breakfastarians would consider eating their next meal. Starbucks SBUX, -0.42% which has expanded its food menu and set a goal of doubling food sales in the U.S. over the next five years , came in fifth place but also saw its rating jump from six months ago.\nRank Fast casual restaurant % of consumers who say they would consider this restaurant for their next meal (survey respondents could check multiple answers) 1 McDonald’s 40.5% 2 Subway 33.8% 3 IHOP 32.1% 4 Burger King 26.6% 5 Starbucks 26.2% Source: YouGov BrandIndex The survey results likely bode well for McDonald’s, which has announced plans to launch all-day breakfast nationwide as soon as October. McDonald’s has already begun adding food-preparation space and testing the breakfast-all-day options in San Francisco and Nashville, Tenn.\nCustomers had frequently asked McDonald’s to serve its McMuffins and pancakes beyond the late-morning cutoff of around 10:30 a.m., but the company held off because of the operational challenge to prepare breakfast items alongside hamburgers and chicken nuggets, according to the Wall Street Journal .\nBreakfast is a hot commodity not only at McDonald’s but also at many restaurants nationwide. Breakfast sales rose over 5% to $27.4 billion in 2013 at quick-service and fast casual restaurants, according to research firm Mintel .\nHere are the restaurants that saw the greatest improvement in purchase consideration among breakfastarians:\nRestaurant % of consumers who say they would consider restaurant for their next meal in August 2015 % of consumers who say they would consider restaurant for their next meal in February 2015 Change in score Chick-fil-A 21.8 12 9.8 IHOP 32.1 24.9 7.2 Taco Bell 20.1 13.8 6.3 Starbucks 26.2 21.3 5 Caribou Coffee 6.9 1.9 5 Source: YouGov BrandIndex Of course, being a breakfastarian doesn’t mean eating healthier. Breakfast items — especially those at fast-food restaurants — usually pack just as much of a caloric punch as lunch and dinner items. In fact, the worst trans-fat offender in fast food may just be the breakfast biscuit sandwiches from Carl’s Jr., which have the most amount of trans fat on the entire Carl’s Jr. menu. In contrast, McDonald’s Steak, Egg & Cheese Biscuit has just as many calories as the Biscuit ’N’ Gravy, but zero grams of trans fat.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-starbucks-has-bulked-up-its-menu-to-255-items-1417630913", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/starbucks-aims-to-double-u-s-food-sales-in-five-years-1417709027", "http://www.brandindex.com/article/mcdonalds-1-purchase-consideration-breakfastarians"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:29:53.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
