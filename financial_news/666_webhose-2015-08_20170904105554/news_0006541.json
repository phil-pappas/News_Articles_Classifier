Photo: Janie Barrett\nLife insurance commissions will be scrapped and financial advisers paid purely on a fee-for-service basis in the future, as the life industry cleans up its image and ditch conflicted remuneration practices.\nThat is the view of Craig Meller, chief executive of wealth giant AMP, which was the first large company to slash expensive up-front commissions to 80 per cent of the first year's premiums.\n\"In the long term I think we'll be moving to a fee for service [structure] for life insurance, the same as superannuation and assets under management businesses,\" he said.\n\"It [adviser commissions] is not one where you can flick a switch. A staged approach is appropriate,\" he said, pointing to government-endorsed changes including the capping of advanced commissions to 60 per cent of a policy's premiums in the first year by 2018.\nAdvertisement AMP, which owns one of the largest financial advice distribution businesses in Australia with more than 3700 advisers, has been busy tackling the problems permeating its wealth protection division, including expensive claims and high lapses.\nSector under pressure The sector as a whole has been under pressure from regulatory changes, increasing lawsuits and low investment yields.\nFinancial advisers and expensive commissions have been a key focus in the insurance industry and government as the sector seeks to clear conflicts of interest.\nLast year, the corporate regulator found that nearly one in two pieces of advice given by financial planners working in the life industry failed to comply with the law. Advisers are paid up to 120 per cent of a first year's premiums in advance commissions for their work.\n\"If an adviser goes straight from upfront commissions to a fee for service arrangement, they're going to be out of pocket,\" Mr Meller said.\n\"[It is] one of the challenges with moving life insurance from commissions to fee for service … unlike the investment business where broadly the same level of fees were paid as the commissions that were charged previously.\"\nMr Meller's comments come after AMP posted a 12 per cent rise in first-half underlying profit to $570 million, but warned there was \"more to do\" to tackle the problems facing its life insurance arm.\nAMP reported a 33 per cent rise in statutory net profits to $507 million from $382 million in the year-earlier period. The underlying profit result came in just below IBES consensus expectations of about $576 million.\nWealth protection, which includes the group's life insurance business, recorded operating earnings of $99 million or up 9 per cent from 2014. AMP warned that the environment \"continues to be volatile, however claims and lapse outcomes remain in line with best estimate assumptions\".\n\"The wealth protection business continues to stabilise and is delivering improved results; however, we have more to do,\" Mr Meller said.\nCost cuts AMP will pay a 14¢ partially franked interim dividend on October 9, an improvement from the 11.9¢ payout in the year-earlier period.\nAMP, which has a market valuation of $18.3 billion, said it had reduced costs and cashflows during the half. The group said it was on track to deliver $200 million of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2016.\nAMP Capital, the group's investment arm, posted a 26 per cent in operating earnings and its North platform grew by 16 per cent to $18.6 billion. AMP Bank, which recently said it would stop writing new loans to property investors, delivered $50 million in operating earnings – a 19 per cent improvement.\nRoss Curran, diversified financials analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said AMP's results were in line with results, and told investors \"don't expect much change to expectations today\".\n\"The standout performers were Contemporary Wealth Management [the platform business], up 7 per cent in the half,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\n\"The group is flagging some revenue compression in this business, mainly competition driven but MySuper should result in 4.5 per cent compression each year for the next two years,\" he said.\nKieren Chidgey from Deutsche Bank said AMP benefited from higher performance fees from the AMP Capital business, but this was partly offset by ongoing higher mortality losses in wealth protection.\n\"However, key drivers continue to track well, with stronger fund flows in AWM [Australian Wealth Management] and from external AMP Capital clients and improved claims/lapse trends in AWP [Australian wealth protection],\" he said.\nAMP's shares have risen 12 per cent in the past year to $6.17, compared with the 4.5 per cent losses of the benchmark S&P/ASX200 Index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:30:50.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
