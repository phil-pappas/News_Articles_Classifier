Magazine , Quick Bridge Funding \nQuick Bridge Funding announced it ranked No. 5 on the Inc. magazine exclusive 2015 list of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies – the Inc. 500. Quick Bridge Funding achieved its rank by attaining a three-year growth rate of 24,138 percent with 2014 revenue at $44.6 million. In addition, Quick Bridge Funding placed No. 2 out of the 247 other top financial services firms on the Inc. 5000 list. Based in Irvine, California, the alternative lending firm ranked No. 3 out of 277 Los Angeles Metro area firms and No. 5 of the 681 Inc. 5000 California fastest-growing companies. According to Inc., firms must be U.S.-based and privately owned to qualify for inclusion. Revenue requirements for the newly released ranking were at least $100,000 in 2011 and at least $2 million last year. According to Leigh Buchanan, Editor-at-large, Inc. magazine, this year's Inc. 500 achieved a median growth rate of 1,772 percent and collectively created 57,822 jobs. Buchanan added most of the founders with companies on this list had the right idea at the right time. President Ben Gold shared that timing was indeed a key factor when Quick Bridge was founded in 2011. After the “Great Recession” there was a strong demand for an alternative to using commercial banks for short-term working capital loans. The firm’s niche focuses on $5,000 to $200,000 loans with terms averaging four to 10 months. By identifying this need early on, the founders pooled their extensive experience in equipment leasing with a trusted network of professional sales partners to create an ideal lending business model for business owners who may not qualify for a traditional loan or need the funds more quickly than banks can provide. “We’re thrilled to be in the top 5 of the Inc. 500,” said Vice President Jason Osiecki. “Our team at Quick Bridge works with enthusiasm to provide smooth, consistent and timely processing of our loan products. Each is keenly focused on improving and optimizing our trusted partners’ and customers’ experience. Whether a business needs cash to purchase inventory, increase cash flow, support expansion, bridge seasonality, or purchase another business, our working capital program is designed to help a business grow. We look forward to continuing to be an innovative leader in the alternative lending space.” When asked why Quick Bridge Funding has experienced its exponential growth, Gold said, “A combination of well-versed business-to-business lending experience and strong capitalization has helped us grow fast, but not too fast. Early on we built out our C-suite with 20+ year finance industry experts. We set up processes and systems that specifically focus on user experience for both our broker partners and the business owner end-user. What continues to set us apart from other alternative lenders is how transparent our process is and how easy it is to work with us. Achieving the No. 5 position on the Inc. 500 is a distinct honor, but more importantly, it is an inspiration to drive further excellence throughout every aspect of our business.” Today's Other News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:13:57.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
