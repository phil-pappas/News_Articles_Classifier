Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg \nBorsa Istanbul has reported its monthly metrics and volumes for the month ending July 2015, having shown a slight downtrend across a few key indicators, according to a Borsa Istanbul report. \nIn particular, Borsa Istanbul revealed its total value of all trading instruments for July 2015 at $367 billion, down -3.7% MoM from $381 billion in June 2015. This figure includes all trading volumes of Borsa Istanbul’s fixed income, equity, and derivatives markets. \nFor the month ending July 2015, monthly traded value at Borsa Istanbul was hardly uniform. Of the $367 billion in traded assets, $322.6 billion was attributed to its fixed income market, $27.5 billion to its equities market, and only $15.4 billion to derivatives – a further $1.1 billion was traded in the exchange’s commodities market. \nMarkets Overview \nBorsa Istanbul saw its strong June rally snapped after reporting just $322.6 billion in July 2015, down -1.85% MoM from $329 billion in June 2015. While the figure was unable to overtake last month’s, the robust trading volume across fixed income markets represents the third highest total in 2015 at the exchange. \nAlternatively, equities at Borsa Istanbul have seen a downward decline since the start of the 2015 year, with July being no exception. Equities markets recorded only $27.5 billion in July 2015 by volume, which dropped -14.0% MoM from $32 billion in June 2015. The latest figure is sitting roughly -34.5% below a peak of $42 billion in equities markets trading, set back in January. \nFinally, derivatives trading has also been unable to mount any sort of comeback, underpinned by a weakness seen in the rest of Borsa Istanbul’s markets. July 2015’s $15.4 billion figure constitutes a loss of -19.8% MoM from $19.2 billion marked in June 2015. Got a news tip?
