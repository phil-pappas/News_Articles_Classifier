Louie Douvis It's also evidence of the widespread frustration that the political system is failing to deliver anything like the necessary reform (growth) – with little likelihood of that Canberra dynamic changing.\nThat's why the summit tried to look at four key areas of productivity growth and participation, fiscal policy, tax reform and retirement incomes. The idea is to come up with proposals that have broad support rather than the fiercely partisan nature of today's political debate based on a series of 'gotcha' moments and ruling things out.\nA core group involving the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU and the Australian Council of Social Service produced a statement on topics which the summit then gathered to discuss.\nEverything's connected to everything else, of course. So that makes it harder to take specific steps without fitting them into a much wider – and necessarily controversial – policy agenda.\n Take tax. An efficient national tax system that encourages growth and investment and innovation rather than curbing it is clearly fundamental – more so now than ever.\nBut for all Joe Hockey's rhetoric on bracket creep and the tax white paper, the current political impasse seems to preclude any substantive changes to the tax system. The immediate focus includes the hot topic of increasing the GST.\nIn a generally well-considered speech about dealing with future challenges in a more sophisticated way, Bill Shorten was still ruling the GST option out absolutely.\n\"If reform was just increasing taxes, if reform was just about increasing the GST, we should all go home,\" he declared. \"Increasing tax is not tax reform.\"\nReform not about revenue But given the growing and structural budget deficit, tax reform does mean figuring out how to get more tax revenue from somewhere – as well as reducing revenue from the taxes that do most to impede growth. Those inefficient taxes include Australia's reliance on current high income tax rates, whether for individuals or companies.\nThe summit heard evidence, yet again, that Australia's corporate rate is increasingly uncompetitive internationally and damaging to investment – and therefore to jobs and growth. Nothing doing – beyond the budget reduction for small business.\nYet the summit communique agreed that \"doing nothing, or tinkering with piecemeal reforms, is not an option.\"\nSo the summit agreement is that everything is supposed to remain on the table for further discussion, including \"a competitive corporate tax system\". That's obviously going to require trade-offs.\nBut beyond the need to maintain \"fiscal credibility and the AAA credit rating\", there was far less discussion on how to also cut spending more generally – at least beyond the familiar target of superannuation tax concessions.\nParkinson, who has a knack of using figures to back him up, drily noted the tendency for spending to ratchet up as a percentage of GDP in times of difficulty – just not to go back down again.\nBut the key theme was the need to boost growth, given its absence makes all those arguments about spending, sustainability and fairness so much harder.\nJennifer Westacott from the BCA said it was important not to underestimate the degree of agreement as well as the urgency of the challenge in areas such as innovation and productivity. She called on political leaders to articulate a vision and a direction for the future.\n\"We are not going to stand by and let this election be another race to the bottom of what we are not going to do,\" she said.\nCheers all round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:03:48.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
