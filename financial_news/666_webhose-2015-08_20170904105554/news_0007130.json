The employees will still be paid their full salary in that time. \nParents will be allowed to return part-time, full-time or temporarily. \nThe employee benefit is particularly generous for the US, where women are only entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. \nShows like Orange (Taiwan OTC: 4554.TWO - news ) is the New Black have been hits for Netflix online (Netflix) \nNetflix, which has produced hit shows House of Cards and Orange is the New Black , said the policy fitted with the company’s “freedom and responsibility culture” and would help attract and retain the best talent in Silicon Valley. \n“Each employee gets to figure out what’s best for them and their family, and then works with their managers for coverage during their absences,” Ms Cranz said. \nPeople tend to “perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home”, she added, saying employees would “return to work more focused and dedicated” as a result. \nThe move follows the decision by Netflix and other companies like Virgin to let workers take as much holiday as they want. \nBut the seemingly generous offers have been criticised by some. \nVirgin allows staff to take as much time off as they want - provided they “feel a hundred per cent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project and that their absence will not in any way damage the business”, which some argue could make employees actually take less time off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T12:26:45.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
