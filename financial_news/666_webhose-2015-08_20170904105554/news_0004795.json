Consumer prices rose an unexpected 0.1% in July, up from 0% the previous month. Core inflation rose 1.2% in July compared to a year ago, more than the 0.9% growth predicted, and up from the prior month's 0.8% gain. Miners were the biggest fallers on the FTSE as copper prices reached a six-year low. BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGY - news ) declined. 1553: US stocks are broadly flat on the back of worse-than-expected US data on housing starts and building permits. The Dow is up 0.1% while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down 0.29% and 0.07% respectively. Wal-Mart is also providing a drag after cutting its full-year outlook. \n1330: US housing starts rose 0.2% in July, missing expectations of 0.5% growth and marking a slowdown on the previous month's 12.3% increase. Building permits dropped 16.3% in July, worse than the 8.2% fall predicted and following a 7% rise in June. \n1224: Wall-Mart has cut its full-year profit outlook after reporting second quarter earnings that missed expectations. The company posted earnings of $1.08 per share, down from $1.21 a share a year ago, less than the $1.12 that was forecast. \n1040: German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reportedly planning to urge lawmakers today to vote in favour of a third â‚¬86bn bailout package for Greece. \n0933: The UK headline consumer price index (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) rose 0.1% year-on-year in July, better than the flat figure expected. Core CPI was also above forecast at 1.2% versus the 0.8% consensus forecast and 0.8% the previous month. \n0819 : Predictably, the FTSE 100 has crawled out of bed sideways ahead of the UK inflation releases later. With a number of Bank of England rate setters recently coming forward with pro-lift off comments and Governor Mark Carney's belief that rates will rise not long after the New Year, the consumer, producer and retail price index data will be released at 0930 BST, with forecasts from the BoE (Shenzhen: 200725.SZ - news ) and analysts for the figure to remain at zero for the next two months. Sterling will certainly shoot off if the CPI data surprises. \"Sterling could well be more sensitive to the numbers given the greater focus on the potential for higher rates, so a firmer number could well line cable up for a re-test of yesterday's highs,\" says Simon Smith, chief economist at FXpro. \n0745: European stocks look to open lower due to sharp falls in Shanghai equity markets after short selling and margin financing by large Chinese brokers resumed and the bomb blast in Thailand weighed on sentiment. The selloff in the Shanghai composite index accelerated towards 6% as the close of the session neared. The People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) has injected liquidity to the market which has dampened rate cut hopes. July property prices data out of China this morning showed an improving trend after prices rose in more cities than declined for the first time in 16 months. \nOvernight : US stocks reversed early losses to eke out modest gains on Monday, despite some disappointing manufacturing data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 67.78 points to 17,545.18, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 11 and 43 points respectively. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the Empire State general business conditions index plummeted to -14.9 from 3.9 in July, way below analysts' expectations for a 4.5 reading and to its lowest level since the recession.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:32:59.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
