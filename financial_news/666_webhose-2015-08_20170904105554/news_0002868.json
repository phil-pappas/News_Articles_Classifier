Paul Sanford of Huntsville, said Tuesday he started the GoFundMe account called \"Fund the Alabama State Government\" as the state faces a budget shortfall. \nSanford, who owns a barbecue restaurant, says he started the tongue-in-cheek account to highlight \"hypocrisy\" over tax increases. Sanford said people suggest tax increases but want someone else's taxes raised, not their own. \nThe account has a fundraising goal of $300 million, about the same amount Alabama's governor is seeking in tax increases. \nHe has raised $598 over four days. Sanford says he plans to turn the money over to the state. \nAlabama lawmakers are at a stalemate over tax increases versus cuts in a special session over the budget shortfall. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T19:36:44.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
