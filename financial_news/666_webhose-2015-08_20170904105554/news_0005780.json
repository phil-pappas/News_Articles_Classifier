The price increase has not yet been announced.\nThe Hellcat cars created marketing and Internet buzz for Dodge — very welcome for a brand rebuilding its high-performance credibility. But dealers who accepted more orders than they could fill or put huge market adjustments on the cars sowed some ill will. For example, one dealer in a northeast Ohio town of 6,000 took deposits and put in orders for more than 200 Hellcats — many more than the dealer would ever receive.\n“For the 2016 model year, we’re starting fresh,” Tim Kuniskis, Dodge brand head, told Automotive News. Canceling customer orders “is probably not what they want to hear, but we’re going to do it so that we have a fresh, clean slate going forward with everything that we learned in 2015.”\nDodge also is changing the way dealers receive Hellcat allocations and place orders, Kuniskis said.\nThe number of Hellcats dealers receive still will be based on the total number of Dodge vehicles they sell in a given period. But dealers will be told exactly how many Challenger and Charger Hellcats they will receive between the start of 2016 production in September and February, as well as their total potential allocation for the year.\nAnd, in another big change, dealers won’t be able to place orders above their allocation. And if they don’t sell the cars quickly when they receive them — which can happen, for example, if a dealer jacks up the price with a large market adjustment — the dealers could lose some of their future Hellcat allocation, Kuniskis said.\nDodge started taking 2016 orders last week.\nTo explain all of this, Dodge will call the hundreds of consumers with unfilled orders for 2015 Dodge Challenger and Charger SRT Hellcats that Fiat Chrysler U.S. has on file, Kuniskis said. The calls began July 27.\nKuniskis estimated the order number as “around 900” but said there likely are duplicates from individuals who placed orders at as many as three dealerships in hopes of getting a car. Some 2015 orders still will be filled because 2015 production is continuing.\nThe consumers will be informed that their factory orders are being canceled, but if they are still interested, they will receive a voucher — usable by that individual only — that will hold the 2015 pricing, at least from the factory.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:33:16.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
