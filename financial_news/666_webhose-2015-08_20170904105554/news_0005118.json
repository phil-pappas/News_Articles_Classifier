Spectra254’s finance program, in partnership with Americorp Financial, offers a variety of solutions to meet most budget requirements with flexible terms and payment schedules. “One of Spectra’s core missions is to make it easy for our customers to acquire the latest technology in infection control. The launch of our alternative financing programs relieves our customers from the typical capital budget challenges by allowing them the opportunity to acquire systems under existing operating budgets,” says Sanford Green, senior executive of Spectra254. “As is our standard practice, all Spectra254 products acquired under these programs include our industry exclusive three-year warranty.”Mark Johnson, national sales manager for Americorp Financial, notes that the rental program is designed to meet FASB-13 Guidelines, which allows a rental to be viewed as a monthly operational expense. More and more healthcare facilities have begun to implement UV-C light disinfection solution systems to complement their terminal cleaning process to eliminate pathogens such as MRSA, C. difficile spores and CRE. Independent laboratory tests show that Spectra254 systems are 99.9 percent effective at killing superbugs and other pathogens.Americorp Financial provides healthcare equipment financing in partnership with healthcare manufacturers by providing creative and flexible finance solutions to their customers.
