Some of sector's biggest names -- Disney ( DIS - Get Report ) , 21st Century Fox ( FOXA - Get Report ) , Viacom ( VIAB ) and Discovery Communications ( DISCA ) -- suffered double-digit declines over the past three days, after reporting their most recent quarterly results. \n\"The overall value of television media is decreasing,\" said Art Muldoon Jr., chief executive and founder of programmatic media marketing company Accordant Media . \"Today's consumer is a much more fragmented consumer, in a non-linear way, and TV has been built on a very linear advertising model.\" \nThe culprit, of course, is digital ad spending, which the industry's monitoring group eMarketer forecasts will overtake TV ad spending by 2018. By 2018, total digital ad spending is likely to reach almost $83 billion in the U.S., while TV ad spending is expected to reach only $78.6 billion. \nMust Read: George Soros' Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks for 2015 \nTo be sure, many of these same media companies will receive some of that digital advertising on their own online platforms -- but not all of it. The proliferation of digital video sites led by Netflix ( NFLX ) and Google 's ( GOOG ) YouTube have produced a fragmented media advertising spending environment that is shaking the foundation of the largest U.S. media companies. \nCBS ( CBS ) , which has generally withstood these changes better than its rivals, reported a 3% decline in advertising revenue for the quarter ended June 31. Fox, meanwhile, took a 14% hit on ad sales, while Viacom, owner of MTV and Nickelodeon, dropped 9%. Disney said its ESPN ad revenue dropped 3%. \nTelevision advertising has been on a steady downward trajectory for more than two years. But this week, the long-term view appeared to worsen. Disney CEO Robert Iger's admission that ESPN, the sports powerhouse that commands the highest pay-TV fees, was starting to show signs of subscriber losses, exacerbated those concerns. If ESPN is starting to weaken, investors claimed, then other networks must be hurting even worse. \nWith data like that, investors sold off. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:40:46.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
