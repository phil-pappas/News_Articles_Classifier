A daily close above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 0.7438 exposes the 38.2% level at 0.7577. Alternatively, a reversal below the 23.6% Fib expansion at 0.7219 clears the way for a test of the 38.2% threshold at 0.7084. Positioning is inconclusive at this point, with prices offering no clear-cut and actionable signal to initiate a long or short trade. We will continue to remain on the sidelines for the time being, waiting for a compelling opportunity to present itself.
