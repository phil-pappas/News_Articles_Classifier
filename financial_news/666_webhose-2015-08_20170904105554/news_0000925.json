By comparison European banks as a whole are down 2.3 percent. \nThe relatively muted reaction is because a rise in bad debts had already been forecast at StanChart (HKSE: 2888-OL.HK - news ) and there were concerns about China's slowdown, analysts said. The impact of weaker Asian currencies on revenue is also partly offset by a reduction in local expenses, such as wages, in dollar terms. \nCREDIT QUALITY \nBut some say worse is to come. \n\"We believe ASEAN credit quality is set to deteriorate further, as existing trends are exacerbated by yuan devaluation,\" said Joseph Dickerson, analyst at brokerage Jefferies. He rates Standard Chartered \"underperform\" and has cut his price target on the stock to 602 pence from 656p. \nOther analysts have also downgraded this week, with Nomura for instance cutting its target to 1055p from 1170p with a \"neutral\" rating. \nChina's yuan depreciation has sparked jitters its economy is slowing and it could start a \"currency war\", which dragged other Asian currencies to multi-year lows. \nStandard Chartered reports in U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . dollars so earnings are hit when local currencies weaken against the dollar. Weak local currencies reduced its income by $277 million in the first six months of this year, representing more than one-third of its 8 percent income drop. \nRival HSBC is also heavily exposed to Asia, but is more diversified in Europe and the United States. Its core Hong Kong market also appears less affected by the recent turmoil, analysts said. \nStandard Chartered acknowledged moves in the yuan-dollar rate would have a direct impact as it reports in dollars. \"The second-order impact on the Chinese economy and therefore our China-related business is obviously more of a macro (economic) conversation,\" said a spokeswoman in an email, declining further comment. \n(Additional reporting by Sinead Cruise; Editing by David Holmes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T15:18:41.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
