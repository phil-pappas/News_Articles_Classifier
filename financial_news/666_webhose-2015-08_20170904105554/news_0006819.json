Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle As the government has reeled through one crisis after another in recent times, its members have reassured themselves with a simple thought: \"However bad we look, voters will not cop Bill Shorten and Labor.\"\nThe polling until now has tended to confirm that view: no matter how badly the Prime Minister might have been travelling, the Opposition Leader has often been in the same territory.\nSo beyond the (not unexpected) grim news on the party vote in the latest Fairfax Ipsos poll lies the germ of a reason for new nervousness within Coalition ranks: Shorten has been bouncing back.\nPoliticians can be dismissive of bad party polling numbers this far out from an election. But they are less dismissive of trends that upset their working presumptions about the political environment in which they are working.\nThis latest poll will give them reason to wonder.\nShorten's approval rating has jumped 4 points since July and his disapproval has slumped 6 points, meaning his net approval is up 10 points to (a relatively loved) -10. By comparison, Tony Abbott's net approval remains in the serious doldrums at -24.\nShorten now leads as preferred prime minster 45 to 39.\nConsidering that the period since the last poll includes the Opposition Leader's appearance before the royal commission – which the Coalition thought had started his political death march – and the ALP National Conference, this is not good news.\n Internal shambles It reflects how the internal shambles of the Coalition has spectacularly derailed Abbott's perpetual political strategy of making Labor the issue of the day.\nMaybe it is impossible for voters to mark TAbbott and the government down any further than they already have.\nMaybe things have got so bad that voters have actually started to reassess Labor and its leader.\nRoyal commission aside, Labor has begun to construct more of a persona for itself than it previously had. Its push to put renewable energy at the centre of its climate-change strategy, to resolve asylum seeker policy and to (miraculously) end up on the right side of the same-sex marriage debate give it more room to talk than it has had for months.\nAt the same time, the Prime Minister has been painting himself into a corner. He has closed down so many debates on the first-order issues that matter to voters around the economy and jobs – and now has so little room for manoeuvre that it is difficult to see how he extracts himself.\nThe Coalition party room choked at the idea of removing a first term prime minister in February because they did not want to repeat Labor's mistakes. MPs have believed that voters would not thank them for that uncertainty.\nBut that was before things became wild and erratic even without a change of leader.\nThe government will make yet another tempt at steadying the ship this week. But the Canning byelection looms now as a real test for both sides of politics.\nPresuming Shorten is unelectable means refusing to acknowledge that unelectability is relative. No one should know that better than the Abbott-led Coalition.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/Ipsos_Aug16_extra_hype/index.html", "https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/2015/08aug/IpsosAug2015%E2%80%93hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-16T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:05:26.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
