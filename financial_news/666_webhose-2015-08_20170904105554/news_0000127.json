Photo: James Cottam\nQueensland workers banned from attending a union-organised rally against the China-Australia free trade agreement have taken their case to the Federal Circuit Court.\nThe Electrical Trades Union filed papers in Brisbane on Wednesday challenging the decision by US company Bechtel's Gladstone LNG construction site to prevent its workers attending a local rally – one of several to be held across Australia – on Monday. *\nPre-approved rostered days off for Monday had been cancelled and the ETU's court action sought to have the protest participation ban lifted.\nETU national secretary Allen Hicks said Bechtel had deliberately sabotaged a \"legitimate political protest\" against the China-Australia FTA.\nAdvertisement \"It is totally inappropriate of a company to pursue its political aims by preventing workers from exercising their rights of freedom of speech and assembly in their own time,\" he said.\n\"It would set a dangerous precedent if Bechtel was allowed to silence its workers in this underhanded way.\"\nAn email to staff from Gladstone deputy site manager Rod Beach, obtained by Fairfax Media, explicitly outlined the restrictions it placed on staff.\n\"In the best interests of the GLNG Project we do not sanction or authorise any such activity, require normal full attendance to get stuff done and accordingly any RDO or leave request for this day outside of those employees scheduled to take an RDO is to be denied,\" he said in the August 7 email.\n\"…All previous RDO requests that you have already approved for this day have since been unapproved by me.\"\nHowever, Bechtel Gladstone general manager Kevin Berg said the company never had a position on the China free trade agreement and hinted Mr Beach's email may have been poorly worded.\n\"Our approvals process is designed purely to keep the workplace staffed to meet our operational requirements,\" he said.\n\"There is no blanket ban. Leave is being approved as normal.\n\"Our approach to managing leave requests is the same as any other work day.\n\"We understand there is some confusion in how this has been communicated on one of the projects, and we will be taking steps in the next 24 hours to ensure this is clarified with our employees.\"\nMr Hicks said Bechtel had attempted to sabotage a legitimate political protest on an issue that affected workers across Australia.\n\"This agreement represents a significant threat to the conditions and safety of workers at Bechtel and elsewhere,\" he said.\n\"It undermines their wages, weakens their workplace safety, and enables companies to exploit guest workers.\n\"The company must not be allowed to prevent them expressing their concerns.\"\nThe case was due to be heard in court on Wednesday.\n* CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the rally would be held on Friday. It has been changed to reflect that the rally will be held on Monday, August 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T04:36:54.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
