He said he would also put National Grid back into public hands. \nThe veteran left-wing politician has made no secret of his admiration of Karl Marx and his plans to bring the gas and electricity supply back under government control. \n\"Mr Corbyn suggests that the Government could take a majority equity stake in the utility companies,\" said Mr Atherton. \n\"However, under stock exchange rules, once a stock holding hits 30pc an offer for the whole company must be made. Therefore, we assume that all of the equity would be acquired.\" \nLondon-listed energy group National Grid is the largest UK utility company with a market capitalistion of £32bn. It owns large gas and electricity supply assets along the US Eastern coast. \nShares in the company, alongside the wider energy sector, fell today after the details of Mr Corbyn's plans were revealed in the Financial times. \nMr Corbyn is rapidly gaining support to become the next Labour leader, but his radical, left-wing views have also put off many MPs and party members. \nAs well as calling for the UK's assets to be nationalised, he has suggested printing money to pay for welfare, pushing up national insurance and corporation tax to fund free university education and grants and supports higher tax rates for the rich .
