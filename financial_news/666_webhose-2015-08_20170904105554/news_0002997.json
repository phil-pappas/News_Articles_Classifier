Bobby Jindal 's administration, payments were cut. Superintendent of Education John White , whose department took over management in July, said the number of children served has dropped from 40,000 to 15,000. \nThe program is designed to help poor parents afford day care so they can work or go to school. \nThe maximum annual subsidy per child will grow from $1,700 to $4,000. Co-pays for the poorest parents will disappear. Families will remain eligible for a full year even if work or school status changes. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T20:23:11.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
