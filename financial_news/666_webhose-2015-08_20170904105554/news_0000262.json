The most highly anticipated are for deep-water sites, which will take place at the start of 2016. \nLast year, President Enrique Peña Nieto approved controversial reforms to the petroleum sector, breaking up a state monopoly that had dated to 1938, with the goal of revitalizing oil production and stimulating the country's economy after years of declining production.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T01:00:28.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
