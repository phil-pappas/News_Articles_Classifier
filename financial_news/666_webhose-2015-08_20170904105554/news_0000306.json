We think it will bounce back over what remains of this year, nothing to worry about,\" said Gomez. \nChile's copper industry, the world's largest, is struggling with multi-year lows in the copper price, on top of ongoing difficulties such as low ore grades in tired deposits, floods, water scarcity and labor disputes. New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) projects are helping to boost output, however.
