Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith Glaringly evident from this reporting season is how the dive in oil prices has split the energy sector into predators and prey.\nThe latter are being forced to look to asset sales and restructuring to weather what now looks almost certain to be an extended weakness in oil prices.\nThe former are carefully scanning what may be on offer, knowing that prices for decent quality assets will be much less than would have been demanded in a stronger market.\nIn the past two weeks of earnings reports, \"lower for longer\" has been echoed by one chief executive after another when assessing the market outlook. With Brent crude oil prices crashing through the $US45-a-barrel mark earlier this week, a floor not breached since March 2009, the pressure is on.\nEven with the weaker Australian dollar, oil prices are getting uncomfortably close to some of the break-even prices cited by Santos and Origin Energy for their respective big-ticket LNG projects in Queensland that have put their balance sheets under so much pressure. Origin has cited $55 a barrel in local currency terms, for example, compared with current prices of about $62.\nDeloitte senior oil and gas partner Geoffrey Cann cites five key questions that the boards of LNG companies should be asking in this environment, among them how to position for consolidation. Cann points to some material combinations already formed or in the works, on all sides of the industry: Shell-BG Group on the supply side, Baker Hughes-Halliburton in services, and on the purchasing side, the powerful Jera combination between Tokyo Electric Power Co and Chubu Electric Power Co.\nLocally, major deals so far have been scarce, save the Apache transactions with Woodside Petroleum and Brookfield/Macquarie and BG Group's $US4.6 billion ($6.4 billion) sale of the gas pipeline from its Queensland LNG venture to APA Group.\nBut that looks set to change, with Santos looking most exposed. Citigroup has identified some $2 billion of undeveloped resource assets in the portfolio that are not contributing cash flows, plus $8.3 billion in the \"infrastructure\" category that could potentially be sold and leased back. The latter category includes the pipeline, terminal and upstream infrastructure related to its GLNG venture in Queensland, though it regards the pipeline and upstream divestments as \"less likely\".\n Deloitte's Cann also suggests it may be wise for some boards to be asking whether their companies necessarily have to own and operate all the infrastructure involved in their gas export supply chain. While that model is the norm in Australia, the US is otherwise, with different: players owning the mid-stream assets and terminal owners supplying tolling services to customers, who may take responsibility for sourcing gas and marketing LNG.\nSuch infrastructure deals are also being contemplated elsewhere in the oil and gas sector outside LNG. Beach Energy chief executive Rob Cole earlier this year suggested a sale of infrastructure – processing plants and pipelines – may also be the way to go in the Cooper Basin, although was thought to be finding it hard to convince partners of the case.\nThat resistance may lessen, especially with infrastructure investors queuing up and the assets exposed to a lesser extent to commodity prices than outright oil and gas resources.\nAs for the predators within the sector, \"discipline\" in acquisitions is the oft-repeated mantra. While Woodside Petroleum and Oil Search have the capacity to consider asset purchases, the considerable uncertainty around the future of prices is demanding caution, which would apply for even Santos' most attractive assets, its stakes in the producing and therefore low-risk Papua New Guinea and Darwin LNG ventures.\namacdonald-smith@afr.com.au\nTwitter: @angelamacd", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@angelamacd", "https://twitter.com/angelamacd"], "published": "2015-08-27T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:06:33.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
