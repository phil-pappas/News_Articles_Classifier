Photo: Michel O'Sullivan\nKathmandu Holdings' newly installed chief executive Xavier Simonet has flagged an immediate review of the outdoor company's head office, resulting in the culling of up to 10 per cent of its staff.\nThe takeover target said on Wednesday it will review costs and structures following a significant reduction in profitability in the 2015 financial year, compared to years prior. The company revealed a 53 per cent slide in profits in 2015.\nKathmandu, which is fending off a $324 million bid by Kiwi-based Briscoe Group , said it expects the review may result in reduction of up to 10 per cent of employees in its Australian and New Zealand head offices. It is understood there are about 250 people working at both offices.\n\"I am confident the outcome of the review will enable us to continue to invest in our growth strategies and deliver improved results for our shareholders,\" Mr Simonet said in a statement to the ASX.\nAdvertisement He outlined several key areas to improve performance, including cost reductions in all areas of the business, increased focus on innovative and distinctive products, optimisation of the existing store network, leveraging its Summit Club members, and improved digital and social media communication.\nWhile the review is tipped to be completed by the end of September, New Zealand rich-lister Rod Duke continues to pursue the company. He wants to create a $900 million trans-Tasman clothing, homewares and sporting goods retailer by merging Briscoe with Kathmandu, although several of Kathmandu's major shareholders have stated they will reject his offer.\nAn independent assessment by Grant Samuel valued Kathmandu shares at $NZ2.10 to $NZ2.41, well above the implied $NZ1.80 value of Briscoe's offer. Mr Duke is offering five Briscoe shares for every nine Kathmandu shares plus NZ20Â¢ cash.\nMr Duke, who recently met with local fund mangers, said Kathmandu's target statement provided little confidence it will deliver a turnaround and achieve its earnings forecasts given its disaster 2015 financial year.\nHe recently accused the board and senior management of being \"asleep at the wheel\" over the past five years, noting the decline in same stores sales growth from 12.9 per cent in 2011 to negative 1.9 per cent in fiscal 2015.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/retail/clothing-and-accessories/more-kathmandu-investors-knock-back-briscoe-group-takeover-bid-20150807-giu33e"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:19:44.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
