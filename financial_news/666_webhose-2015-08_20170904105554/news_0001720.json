By Alessandro Pasetti | Fool.co.uk – 19 minutes ago 282.425 -5.7750 \nI received a note from a broker last week following a call between John Cryan, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, and analysts, which read: \" The new CEO of (Deutsche Bank) was bullish and categoric and specific on capital. (There are) no plans to raise (equity capital) unless there are external events - larger than expected litigation. \" \nAnalysts tend to monitor closely the relative performances of Deutsche Bank and Barclays (LSE: BARC) -- in fact, their fortunes are similarly tied, as their recent trading updates show. My quick take? Their shares are expensive, based on growth projections and their price to tangible book value ratios. \nThat said, Mr Cryan's remarks are very important: a huge rights issue could materialise only under extreme circumstances -- and this is great news for Barclays, too, as it confirms that a large cash call should be ruled out at present. \nHow about other risks, though? Provisions & Litigation \nIn its interim results published last week, Barclays reported \" credit impairment charges and other provisions \" at £496m in 2Q15, up 4% from £477m in the 1Q15. \nThese items currently hover below £500m on a quarterly basis, yet they were well above £500m in each quarter of 2014 and in excess £1.4bn in the second half of 2013, or about £720m quarterly for that year. \nMost of Barclays's core and non-core operations are faring better on this front, while another problematic line of the income statement, \" litigation and conduct\" expenses -- which also have to be deducted from the total income of the bank -- also showed encouraging trends. \nLitigation and conduct stood at £77m in the second quarter, up 50% from £51m in 1Q15, but they were well below the average for the last eight quarters. Only A One-Off? \nAs a one-off, however, Barclays reported $850m of non-recurring provisions for UK customer redress, which were based on an updated estimate of future charges and associated costs. This is cash that must be set aside for the bank's bad behaviour with regard to payment protection insurance. \nWhat concerns me is that these provisions came in only £50m below £900m of non-recurring provisions that Barclays recorded in 2Q14 -- that's the highest level of additional, non-recurring provisions during the 2Q15-3Q13 period. \nConsider that the aggregate value of provisions over the last eight quarters stands just above £2bn, and has been rising since 4Q14, when they stood at £200m. Now, this quarterly amount is surely manageable, and even more such provisions combined with mildly higher litigation costs, won't kill the investment case. \nSo, I am happy to up my personal price target for BARC to 230p a share from 220p, but I invite you to consider that: Its current share price of 280p is very close to its 52-week high of 289.9p, inspite of a low growth rate and a cost-income ratio that is several percentage points above the stated target (\" mid 50s \"). Barclays does not make its cost of equity (\" group return on equity is 5.9% on a statutory basis, well short of our cost of equity \"), which is rarely a good sign for value hunters. \nIn short, there are better alternatives than Barclays, which is no longer a recovery play at this price. \nThat becomes evident when you consider how much value and growth less cyclical stocks offer for a lower level of risk .
