Bloomberg Share on twitter by James Chessell Greeks are headed for yet another election and markets are bracing for more uncertainty with prime minister Alexis Tsipras triggering a snap poll in a bid to silence rebel MPs and shore up public support for the country's €86 billion bailout package.\nOn the same day Greece received the first chunk of the massive rescue deal struck with its international creditors in mid-July, Mr Tsipras gave a televised address on Thursday evening in which he announced the resignation of his coalition government after just seven months in office.\n\"I'm putting everything I've done to the judgment of the Greek people,\" Mr Tsipras said.\nThe prospect of a sixth Greek election in less than eight years will do little to convince markets Athens is willing and able to implement a series of tough economic reforms known as austerity measures that form part of the bailout agreement. Although the official announcement was made after European markets closed, speculation about the snap poll sent Greek equities down 3.5 per cent during the day.\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has told Greek voters he secured the best deal possible to keep the debt-laden country in Europe. InTime News/AP Ratings agency Moody's was one of many observers worried the election will reduce the likelihood of a Greek economic recovery by making it harder for Athens to push ahead with implementing the reforms attached to the bailout agreement.\n\"The Greek Prime Minister Tsipras's move to step down and call snap early elections on 20 September could elevate programme implementation concerns and, potentially, puts future official sector disbursements at risk,\" Moody's said.\nBid for stable government However, Mr Tsipras hopes a strong showing in the general election will produce a more stable government. While Mr Tsipras won parliamentary backing for the rescue deal last week with the backing of centre-right opposition MPs, his ruling Syriza party been split by hard-left rebel MPs who oppose the bailout reforms such as spending cuts, tax hikes and cuts to public sector pensions.\n Swift elections in Greece can be a way to broaden support for ESM stability support programme just signed by PM Tsipras on behalf of Greece.\n— Martin Selmayr (@MartinSelmayr) August 20, 2015 My Tsipras, who swept to power in January after promising to oppose further European austerity, was expected to face a difficult censure motion in the 300-seat Athens parliament in the next fortnight. Around a third of Syriza's 149 MPs believe their leader betrayed the party by agreeing to a new round of economic reforms in order to secure Greece's third bailout agreement since the financial crisis.\nBy calling an early election, Mr Tsipras will be hoping he secures a mandate to implement the terms of the bailout deal before the impact of the spending cuts and tax hikes are widely felt by most voters. He is also banking that his own personal popularity - opinion polls suggest the majority of Greeks believe he fought hard to secure a good deal - will outweigh concerns voters might have about the viability of the bailout.\nMr Tsipras has maintained that he had no choice but to accept the demands of Greece's bailout monitors - the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission - because the alternative was to the leave the eurozone and, possibly, the European Union altogether. While many Greeks oppose further austerity measures, the majority of voters also want to avoid a \"Grexit\".\nIn his address, Mr Tsipras appeared to recast himself as a moderate by appealing to the political centre. He conceded his government was forced to accept some unpopular reforms but argued he resisted some some of the bailout monitor's more draconian demands including the privatisation of Greece's electricity utility.\nGreek PM @atsipras is now submitting his resignation to the President of the Republic Pavlopoulos #GreeceElections pic.twitter.com/sbCxETfc0N\n— Efi Koutsokosta (@Efkouts) August 20, 2015 Mr Tsipras did not nominate September 20 as the new election date but widespread local media reports Quote: government officials saying this was the most likely time for the poll.\nSyriza split looms ﻿ Syriza is now expected to split. The leader of the party's hard-left faction, former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, last week declared he would create an anti-bailout group and accusing the government of giving in to the \"dictatorship of the eurozone\".\nCurrent energy minister Panos Skourletis said on Thursday that tensions within Syriza were unsustainable. \"The political landscape must clear up,\" he told state televisoin. \"We need to know whether the government has or does not have a majority.\"\nMr Tsipras visited Greek president Prokopis Pavlopoulos on Thursday to inform him of his resignation. Mr Pavlopoulos cannot call an election until after he has asked the other major parities if they can form a government. However, this is considered highly unlikely given non of the minority parties have enough MPs to forms the basis of a stable coalition.\nThe latest Greek political drama came as the finance ministry announced that the European Stability Mechanism, an EU rescue fund, had allocated €13 billion in funds from the new bailout package.\nThis first tranche is enough to cover Greece's funding needs for two months although some observers worry the decision to call the snap poll will slow down the pace of economic reform.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreeceElections?src=hash", "http://t.co/sbCxETfc0N", "https://twitter.com/Efkouts/status/634429310800142336", "https://twitter.com/atsipras", "https://twitter.com/MartinSelmayr/status/634401708131643392", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T02:03:34.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
