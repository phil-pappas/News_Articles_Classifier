Photo: Louise Kennerley\nThe gloves have finally come off in New Zealand rich-lister Rod Duke's $324 million hostile takeover offer for outdoor clothing chain Kathmandu.\nMr Duke has hit back after the Kathmandu board and the retailer's largest institutional shareholder, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, vehemently rejected his scrip-and-cash offer as \"grossly inadequate\".\nMr Duke, who wants to create a $900 million trans-Tasman clothing, homewares and sporting goods retailer by merging Briscoe Group with Kathmandu, has accused his target of being overly optimistic about its growth prospects after a 53 per cent slump in profits in 2015.\nKathmandu chairman David Kirk has blamed the worse-than-expected profit slump on a series of errors and one-off costs, and has forecast a 43 per cent improvement in earnings in fiscal 2016.\nAdvertisement \"It was an isolated period of poor performance largely market driven but to a significant extent we shot ourselves in the foot,\" Mr Kirk told Fairfax Media after the Kathmandu board urged shareholders to reject the \"manifestly inadequate\" offer.\nHowever, Mr Duke questioned the assumptions behind the profit forecast, which was included in Kathmandu's 140-page target statement, saying Kathmandu's response was \"high on rhetoric and low on substance\".\n\"There is a lot of blue sky in their 2016 forecast,\" he said. \"Kathmandu's catalogue of excuses and ambitious assumptions highlights the enormous execution risks inherent in achieving the company's forecast targets in contrast to the certainty, experience and track record of delivery which are available to Kathmandu shareholders by accepting the Briscoe offer.\"\nMr Duke, Briscoe managing director and controlling shareholder, is under pressure to lift his offer after the largest institutional shareholder, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said it had no intention of accepting the Briscoe offer for its 13 per cent stake.\n\"The Briscoe bid is highly opportunistic,\" said Goldman Sachs Asset Management head of Australian equities Dion Hershan. \"We understand why they are interested in the company but the bid price and structure we'd characterise as being grossly inadequate – we didn't have to review the 140-page target statement to arrive at that conclusion.\"\n\"We'll be rejecting the offer,\" he said as Kathmandu shares jumped 12.5¢ or 8.3 per cent to a five-month high of $1.63 on the ASX.\nGoldmans could block the bid, preventing Briscoe from achieving 90 per cent minimum acceptance and integrating Kathmandu into its business.\nMr Kirk said the offer was \"highly opportunistic\" and timed to exploit Kathmandu's recent share price weakness and the \"isolated\" issues that contributed to a slump in net profit from $NZ42.2 million in 2014 to $NZ20 million ($17.8 million) in 2015.\nAn independent assessment by Grant Samuel valued Kathmandu shares $NZ2.10 to $NZ2.41, well above the implied $NZ1.80 value of Briscoe's offer. Mr Duke is offering five Briscoe shares for every nine Kathmandu shares plus NZ20¢ cash.\nMr Duke said last month he would not have snapped up a 19.9 per cent stake in Kathmandu from disgruntled shareholders if he were not confident the offer would succeed. If the offer succeeds Mr Duke, who owns 72 per cent of NZ-listed Briscoe, will end up with 55 per cent of the merged group and will seek to list it on the Australian stock exchange.\nHowever, Mr Kirk said Kathmandu's largest shareholders were \"consistently not attracted\" to the offer due to the low valuation and the scrip-based nature of the offer.\nHe raised doubts about whether Briscoe would secure an ASX listing for the merged group and questioned whether it would have sufficient liquidity to be included in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index or the S&P/NZX 50 index.\nKathmandu shareholders could end up holding shares in a low-growth, non-branded, non-vertically integrated retailer with a focus on homewares and sporting goods and little capacity to expand outside New Zealand.\n\"There's a high likelihood that if they tried to turn those Briscoe shares into cash they wouldn't be able to do it at that price ($NZ1.80) - there would be a big overhang because of all the people trying to get out,\" he said.\nWhile Kathmandu's profits halved in 2015, Mr Kirk expects earnings to rebound about 43 per cent in 2016, underpinned by 11 per cent sales growth, stronger gross margins and fewer one-off costs.\nMr Hershan, who rarely speaks about companies in which he holds shares, backed the Kathmandu board and the strategy outlined by new chief executive Xavier Simonet, who took the helm on the same day Briscoe lobbed its offer.\n\"We think Kathmandu is a great brand, it's a good business, but it's volatile,\" he said. \"By their own admission they have had a very difficult fiscal 2015 and there were a variety of factors, none of which we'd consider would be permanent.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:45:51.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
