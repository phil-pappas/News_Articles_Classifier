Lenders will be able to earn revenue from the use of their shares and NBAD, as the borrower, will be obliged to return the securities to the lender at an agreed date, on demand. \n\"The combination of these capabilities will allow NBAD to offer its institutional clients a distinctive opportunity to earn incremental revenue on share positions which would have otherwise remained dormant and likely add liquidity and efficiency to the market,\" Jonathan Titone, executive director and head of product development of global wealth at NBAD, said in the statement. \nNBAD is also the UAE's first licensed custodian bank and the first and only official market maker since April 2014. \nUAE regulations allow market makers to sell borrowed securities in order to maintain liquidity in those stocks, but other investors are not allowed to sell short.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T17:20:03.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
