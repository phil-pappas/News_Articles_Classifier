Photo: supplied\nBendigo and Adelaide Bank is looking to claw back market share by sitting out the recent hikes in landlord interest rates by its competitors, but add to profits with further alliances or acquisitions.\nThe bank just beat consensus forecasts with a cash profit for 2015 of $432.4 million, up 13 per cent on the previous financial year, announced on Monday morning.\nThis got a big boost from the acquisition of Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria in June 2014 and another big jump in income from its unique Homesafe product, which added more than $63 million to revenue, up 26 per cent on 2014.\nIncome from operations totalled $1.55 billion, up 7.4 per cent. Rural Finance Corporation provided most of the rise in interest income, adding $47 million of slightly more than a $59 million rise in total to just top $1.1 billion in total interest income.\nAdvertisement Managing director Mike Hirst said recent credit union \"alliances\" were also helping boost growth in lending and earnings, and he was keen on more alliances or acquisitions in NSW, where the bank had a low profile.\n\"I think NSW is a weakness in our distribution network, so if there is anything there that might pique our interest, I wouldn't rule out anything that made sense for us in the wealth space and other portfolios,\" Mr Hirst said.\nBut it would not buy anything unless \"invited\" do so, he said. \"The alliance model we are making investments in would make sense.\"\nMr Hirst said Bendigo had interest from 44 mutual lenders, but the bank did a deal with only four and there is scope to go back to the remaining 40.\nHomesafe allows the bank to help a home buyer pay for a house by taking a discounted part-share in it. Bendigo gets income from the sale of the house and so earnings from this product rise when house prices rise.\nHowever, the bank expects its contribution to earnings growth to fall in future as house price rises ease.\nMr Hirst said he expected more of its competitors to raise investor interest rates, but the bank would \"sit it out\" until most of those are complete before deciding whether to make any move itself. He argues the other banks are now returning to the rates Bendigo is charging, which should naturally improve its ability to compete on things other than price.\n\"We are seeing a repricing work its way through the market back to prices that we see as more appropriate – all of those things augur well for us for the medium-to-longer term,\" he told investors.\nBut some analysts questioned this strategy, with one arguing it was \"irrational\" not to at least raise rates on investor loans because pressure on margins in owner-occupied lending – which is most of Bendigo's loans – would now increase.\nChief financial officer Richard Fennell, however, said excluding recent acquisitions, its investor loan growth was well below system growth, so it should now get some share back as other banks raised rates, and then look to improve margins on loans with rate rises.\n\"We have been growing below system in that space, but we will monitor that very closely from a volume perspective to make sure we stay below 10 per cent growth,\" he said.\n\"What we would rather do is sit back and see how things settle and see if that gives an opportunity to grow margins on investor lending.\"\nAccording to Rate City, however, excluding credit unions and non-bank lenders, Adelaide Bank has the two cheapest variable investor lending rates starting at 4.19 per cent, followed by Commonwealth Bank, its subsidiary BankWest and Bank of Queensland. Bendigo Bank on its own has among the highest at 4.66 per cent. Commonwealth Bank's rate should soon increase to about 4.66 per cent.\nThe banking regulator's move to raise the risk-weighted capital the major banks hold against mortgages to a minimum average of 25 per cent compared with 16 per cent now will also make Bendigo – which has risk weights averaging about 39 per cent – more competitive. In addition, the bank has completed a major overhaul of its risk systems to enable it to become a so-called \"internal ratings-based\" bank, allowing it to offer cheaper loans at lower cost to itself once approved by APRA.\n\"[Lower growth] is the outcome of taking that approach of not writing non-profitable business,\" Mr Hirst said. \"In a more even playing field our growth will improve over the next 12 months.\"\nThe bank's net interest margin – an important measure of profitability – fell a further 0.7 per centage points, to 1.89 per cent after tax for the year. This is despite maintaining a relatively high interest rate compared with the majors and other regional banks and non-bank lenders.\nThat is in part due to Bendigo having 80 per cent of its funding – the highest among major and regional banks – coming from deposits. Even though interest rates have been falling, that hasn't been translating into lower rates on term deposits because the rates are so low that if the bank reduced them further, customers would just switch to other types of investment.\nIn fact, many have been switching to \"at call\" no-interest accounts, and this is slowly helping improve net interest margins for the bank.\nIts higher rates also mean Bendigo's lending growth and market share have been low compared with other banks.\n\"Total lending growth for the year is at 5.3 per cent,\" said Mr Hirst. \"A lot of that came through [the acquisition of Rural Finance Corporation] and through the alliance bank models.\"\nMortgage loan growth rates were the slowest among the majors and regional banks at 3.6 per cent. Deposit growth rates were also the slowest at 2 per cent.\nBendigo's share price had fallen 4 per cent by noon on Monday to $12.44.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:46:40.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
