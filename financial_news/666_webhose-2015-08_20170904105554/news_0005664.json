The federal and NSW governments have completed discussions about the scheme's funding agreement. State officials are mystified why the federal government has not yet signed it, given an August deadline for the deal.\nSenior sources insist the NSW deal will proceed as planned. Sources argue the Abbott government \"owes Baird big time\" and could not afford to back out of the agreement at this late point.\nBut there still appears to be a question mark hanging over the speed of the rollout in other states and territories.\nIt is understood that the most powerful bureaucrats in Canberra – the heads of the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Michael Thawley, Treasury, John Fraser, Finance, Jane Halton and Social Services, Fin Pratt –met last Tuesday to scrutinise the scheme ahead of a meeting of the expenditure review committee.\n 'Fractious' and 'divided' A number of sources have variously described the meeting – which also discussed a range of other budget measures – to T he Australian Financial Review as \"unbelievably fractious\" and \"very divided\".\nIt is believed the meeting was supposed to sign off on the NSW agreement but that no decision was ultimately made.\nThe agreement confirms final figures for the financial contributions to be made by both levels of government, the pace of the rollout and also details about the inclusion of different cohorts of disabilities.\nApart from its significant cost, the NDIS remains vulnerable to Coalition suspicions, partly because it was a scheme commenced by Labor, and partly because of concerns about its capacity to keep costs constrained.\nA number of sources said that the complexity of the scheme meant that ERC ministers have to constantly go back and refresh their minds about the genesis of the scheme.\nThe Gillard government announced the NDIS after commissioning a report from the Productivity Commission which found that it would deliver better outcomes for both disabled people and national productivity than current arrangements which were rapidly becoming financially unviable.\nWith the significant turnover that has taken place in the top ranks of the bureaucracy in the past 12 months, there is also little institutional memory of the history of the scheme across departments.\nAssistant Social Services Minister, Senator Mitch Fifield, released the latest quarterly report on the scheme on Monday which he said showed \"more than 17,300 people are now benefiting from the NDIS\".\nThe report showed the cost of the average package (excluding residents of large institutions) was $33,597 which \"remains below the expected full scheme average of $36,750\", he said.\nSenator Fifield said this year's budget \"demonstrated this government's commitment to the NDIS, both now and into the future\".\n\"Governments are working on detailed schedules of how and when each state and territory will transition to the NDIS\", he said.\n\"I look forward to working with my state and territory counterparts as we lay down the framework through which the NDIS will be rolled out to people with disability.\"\nOpposition disabilities spokeswoman Jenny Macklin said that Labor had fully funded the NDIS into the future while in government.\n\"Labor urges the government to finalise the bilateral plans on the transition to full rollout of the NDIS to end the uncertainty and ensure Australians with disability across the nation can access the benefits of the scheme\", she said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-17T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:53:19.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
