ADVERTISEMENT The change represents 40 months of consecutive year-over-year increases in home prices.\nStill, prices nationwide remain 7.4 percent below their April 2006 peak. \n“The current cycle of home price appreciation is closing in on its fourth year with no apparent end in sight,” said Anand Nallathambi, president and CEO of CoreLogic. \n“Pent-up buying demand and affordability, together with higher consumer confidence buoyed by a more robust labor market, are a potent mix fueling a 6.5 percent jump in home prices through June with more increases likely to come,” Nallathambi said. \nNationwide there was a 4.8-month supply of homes on the market but inventory varied widely from city to city. \nIn San Jose and Denver, there was only a 1.6-month supply, while Philadelphia had seven months of inventory. \nOverall, 35 states and the District of Columbia were at or within 10 percent of their peak prices in June when including distressed sale. \nFifteen states — Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming — plus the District of Columbia reached new price peaks. \nExcluding distressed sales, home prices increased 6.4 percent in June compared with June 2014 and increased by 1.4 percent over May. \nCoreLogic's forecast shows that home prices, including distressed sales, are projected to increase by 0.6 percent from June to July and by 4.5 percent on a year-over-year basis through June 2016. \nThe five states with the highest home price appreciation were: Colorado (+9.8 percent), Washington (+8.9), New York (+8.3), South Carolina (+8) and Nevada (+8). \nWithout distressed sales, only four states had home price depreciation: Massachusetts (-5 percent), Connecticut (-0.6), Louisiana (-0.4) and Mississippi (-0.3). \nPast: 1 day Bush drops 40 pounds on Paleo diet Bush talked about his weight loss in an interview at an Iowa Dairy Queen.
