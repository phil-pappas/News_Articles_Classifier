If there is an auditor’s report it requires everybody who is incorporated, and so a small business whose capitalization is so low mostly cannot afford the cost of getting an audited financials,” he stated. \nHe said can we create a threshold where the requirements are lowered for some companies, like we have in the stock market where we have alternative markets, over the counter trading etc. \nAccording to him, the exercise is to get the private sector to understand that a document that is going to guide their operations must be in line with the 21 st century of business operations and must support SMEs so it doesn’t become a constrain in their business operations. \nSignificant to this exercise, PEF has engaged Chartered Accountants to examine various options of financial accounting that will enable especially small companies to operate freely without any hindrances. \nNana Osei-Bonsu added that the experts will make their recommendations upon inputs that participants have registered and finally arrive at the condition that “lets segregate, lets create a threshold, if your capitalization is less than maybe GHc100,000 then you should not be required to, but as of now its generalized and once you are an incorporated business, you have to have a Secretary, audited finance, Director and many more. So it’s very difficult for some of our SMEs to comply.” \nFardinand Adadzi, Partner, Lawyers for Business and Projects in Africa, [AB & David] said the main issues is how to review the former structure or types of companies that were adopted in the 1963 companies code and the question is whether they still want to maintain that in 2015 [Companies Bill 2013]. \nHe added that there are varied arguments about how to move the informal sector to the formal sector and the question is, does the companies bill provides that opportunity to achieve that quest. \nFardinand Adadzi indicated that the new companies bill have also reduced the age of an individual who wants to set up a company from 21years to 18years. \nAccording to him, this is herculean in the sense that can individuals on their own at age 18, something that he/she cannot do, circumvent the process by setting up a company to do it simply because the law requires it. \nHe noted that, going forward, the private enterprise and the private businesses should take a second look at the new bill and how their own past experience and the manner and way they are able to comply with companies Act 1963. \n“Because substantially, the provisions in the companies Act 1963 has been repeated in the new companies bill and therefore must be reviewed further through a wider consultation,” he posited. \nHe concluded that the new bill currently as it stands does not have any drastic impact, “maybe people may appreciate some of the things but I have not seen the policy perspective where it encourages the informal sector to get to the formal sector.” \nIt is expected that the consultations processes will generate and collate a comprehensive input to make a position paper of private sector and then submitted to the Speaker of Parliament and the Parliamentary Select Committee. \nSubsequent to that, PEF will engage other stakeholders, legal and Parliamentary Committee to fine tune its input to see the justifications and rational for some of the outstanding issues in the companies bill 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:35:55.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
