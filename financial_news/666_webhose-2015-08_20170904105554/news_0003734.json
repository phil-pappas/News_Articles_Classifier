That is, change is the only constant in life.\nMany people expected it to stop there. After all, what else could go digital? Plenty, is the uncomfortable answer.\nSubscribe to Money’s weekly newsletter , delivered to your inbox every Wednesday In business and investing, the process of ongoing change (and improvement) is known as creative destruction. That is, new and improved products, services, processes and approaches replace the old, and our economy – and society – are better for it. Sometimes, the changes are brought about by a new way of thinking, or a new invention or technology.\nAdvertisement More often than not, especially in recent times, it's been both.\nThe shrinking moat When you're investing, one of the best ways to find great companies is to look for those with a competitive advantage over their rivals. Maybe it's a geographical monopoly, regulated protection, a powerful brand or a network effect (where more sellers attract more buyers, who attract more sellers… think Realestate.com.au or Seek.com.au).\nThe problem for investors recently is that many old \"moats\" as they're called, are being rapidly filled in by competitors, using a combination of technology and a new way of thinking about serving customers.\nWe all know the story of the dominant book sellers and music stores being swept away by the tsunami of online digital media. Amazon.com in books and Apple in music completely rewrote the industry in a matter of years.\nMany people expected it to stop there. After all, what else could go digital? Plenty, is the uncomfortable answer.\nChange on the horizon You might have seen the threat to video stores when pay TV started here in Australia. Or maybe even when Netflix started mailing DVDs to its American customers. But the real revolution is television streaming. Netflix is the big daddy of them all, but the Fairfax/Nine joint venture, Stan, and Foxtel's Presto are also in the fight. This is a quickly fragmenting industry and that's bad news for the \"bundled\" networks such as Seven, Nine and Ten, and it puts Foxtel squarely on notice.\nMoving out of the media space, who'd have imagined that technology could upset the taxi industry? After all, you need a car and a driver – that's hard to digitise.\nWhat most didn't see coming was Uber, which competes with the regulated taxi networks, like our own Cabcharge, and threatens the profits of those who own taxi licences.\nTesla's electric cars are threatening to reshape the automotive industry. Distributed power (think household solar panels) combined with cheap, on-site battery storage will challenge the very business models of our energy generators and retailers. New winners can also create new losers...\nThe internet continues to change how and where we shop, and from whom we buy. The world's retailers are at our doorstep with a range and prices that previously were unavailable here in Australia, much to the chagrin of brand owners who happily charged Australian customers more.\nOnline classifieds have already dammed the infamous \"rivers of gold\" that the newspapers used to enjoy. Once rare, 3D printing is becoming mainstream. Mobile phones have greater processing power than a room full of 1960s computers.\nFor investors, the internet has enabled cheaper brokerage and a vast trove of information that is putting full-service brokers at risk.\nFoolish takeaway Self-driving cars are on the horizon and robotics continues its advance. There are even robots that can replace brickies – truly, no industry is safe.\nThe challenge for investors is clear; competitive advantages are narrower and shallower than ever, and technology will remain one of the greatest threats – and opportunities of the 21st century.\nInvestors, don't miss out: Low interest rates mean dividend-paying shares are very attractive, compared to term deposits.
