Three-month LME copper rebounded from a six-year low of $US5,118 a tonne to an intraday peak of $US5,323.50, a gain of 2.9 per cent and the highest in more than a week. Copper, which has shed around 16 per cent so far this year, failed to trade in closing open-outcry activity and was last bid at $US5,309 a tonne. Copper also gained support from heavy rain and winds that battered the Chilean coastline and lead to the precautionary suspension of work at some mines in the top copper exporter. Snowdon said the better-than-expected copper imports were not due to improved demand in China but because domestic smelters had been holding back supplies of metal. The lacklustre demand conditions in China were expected to continue in the short-term, said strategist Daniel Hynes of ANZ in Sydney. \"But as we get into late Q3, we expect the underlying demand conditions will improve. If we get further stimulus measures from China it would suggest that import demand will hold up during the rest of the year.\" Concern about demand conditions were evident from data showing hedge funds and money managers increased their bearish stance on COMEX copper futures and options to their highest in more than two years. A drop in China's semi-manufactured aluminium exports in July may offer only a fleeting reprieve to global producers hammered by a supply glut, Citi said. \"We believe exports will remain weak in August, but falling Chinese prices are expected to re-open the export and see exports recover later in the year.\" LME aluminium, also untraded in closing rings, was bid up 1.8 per cent at $US1,618 a tonne. Nickel jumped 3.2 per cent to close at $US11,150, zinc closed 1 per cent stronger at $US1,881 a tonne, lead added 1.7 per cent to finish at a two-week high of $US1,758 while tin gained 3.1 per cent to $US15,775.
