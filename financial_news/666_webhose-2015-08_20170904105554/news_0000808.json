Its five-year Isa pays 2.55pc, up from 2.4pc, beating Virgin’s 2.51pc. \nVirgin has, however, claimed top spot for three-year Isas. It launched a new account today which pays 2.25pc. This puts Skipton's 2.1pc offer into second place. \nThe new one and two-year Isas from Julian Hodge are also competitively priced, matching the best rates on the market, paying 1.75pc, up from 1.6pc, and 2pc, up from 1.8pc, respectively. \nThese accounts must be opened by post, while the minimum investment stands at £5,000. Transfers in from previous years' Isas are accepted. \nThe bonds pay the same rates, but the minimum investment is lower at £1,000. \n= Verdict = \nThe Julian Hodge Bank bonds are some way off the best-buys . Paragon Bank has the best accounts over one (2.07pc), two (2.34pc), three (2.66pc) and five years (3.06pc). While, the top-paying four-year fixed-rate bond from Charter Savings Bank offers 2.75pc . \n• Our pick of the best fixed-rate savings bonds \nThe Isa accounts, as mentioned above, are more competitive . \nSusan Hannums, of rate-monitoring site Savingschampion, said: “In recent weeks we have seen some improvements amongst fixed rate ISAs, giving encouragement to those who have yet to use their cash ISA allowance for this tax year, who may have been biding their time in the hope for better deals following an underwhelming Isa season. \n“The current trend in the savings market is for improved fixed-rate deals, this being the latest example and hopefully this will continue with rates being pushed up further as a result.” \n• Our five favourite fixed rate cash Isas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:05:55.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
