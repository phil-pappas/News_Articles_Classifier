By Anna White | Telegraph – 2 hours 1 minute ago 25.32 0.00 \nWelcome to the lives of the DIY estate agents who are pitting their wits against the professionals and think they can achieve the best house price \nRiverside is Steve Phillips’s favourite place. Willow trees line the banks of the River Thames as it slides by just yards from his back door. \nThe five-bedroom house in Bray has been the Phillips family seat and home to his three children since their teens and twenties for the past 15 years. \nLike many retired couples, Steve and his wife, Chris, are hoping to downsize, but the former Vodafone executive is not following the accepted wisdom when selling a property. The 68‑year-old is simultaneously advertising Riverside on his own website, complete with video, while marketing it through two high street estate agents, Savills (Other OTC: SVLPF - news ) and Braxtons. \nThis has become a race to sell, and the prize for Phillips is a handsome one. If he completes the transaction himself at the asking price of £4 million, he will save £96,000 in fees and VAT the 2 per cent specified in the joint agency agreement. \nRiverside in Bray. Interested parties can contact info@riversidebray.com or Steve Phillips on 07836 200200. \nHow hard can it be to sell such a property and the lifestyle that goes with it? Bray, in Berkshire, is a foodie’s haven, the original home of Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck and the Waterside Inn, which was founded in 1972 by the brothers Michel and Albert Roux after the success of Le Gavroche. \nIt is also an easy commute to London, just two miles from Maidenhead station which ferries workers into Paddington every morning in just 25 minutes. \nThe house itself, separated from 225ft of river frontage by a childproof white fence, has a detached garage, manicured lawns and decking. There is a large, family kitchen-diner with a central island and windows overlooking the water and, despite its proximity to the Thames, the property has not flooded in the past 15 years. A claim backed up by the Environment Agency which praised the £110 million Jubilee River flood protection scheme for keeping Maidenhead homes dry in the flash floods of 2013-14. \nThe kitchen with doors that open out on to the river.

I put an ad in a national paper which cost me £600 and had 40 inquiries from all over the world. This time around one was not enough - I needed to commission a series.” \nIt is a tactic he will pursue if the house is still on the market come the September selling season when the market is expected to pick up after the traditional summer recess. \nSteve and Chris Phillips who are downsizing. \nWhile the cash saving is attractive in itself, only offset by the relatively small costs of building a website and paying for a few print adverts, the biggest challenge when selling yourself is creating hype, says Russell Quirk, the founder of online estate agent eMoov. \n“It’s becoming a common occurrence for sellers to go it alone and attempt to sell their property online themselves. The only downsides are that sellers really need to commit to the whole process to see it through and it can be hard to generate the marketing footfall required to sell as only registered estate agents can list properties via the major online search engines [Rightmove (LSE: RMV.L - news ) , Zoopla, Prime Location and OnTheMarket].” \nHe also bemoans the increase in income experienced by some of the big high street estate agents (see chart below). \nPhilips (Amsterdam: PHIA.AS - news ) has a head start on many other private sellers. His son Ben produced the video and created the website, which would typically cost £1,000. \nJeff Bock-Brown has forked out for a website, but ditched the high street estate agent for the cheaper online version. \nCrown Lodge for sale - which could be bought and run as a guest house by an adventurous family. \nHe has paid eMoov a flat, upfront fee of £834. \nThis buys Jeff the usual service from photography to price negotiation, but he handles the viewings himself. \nHis home, Crown Lodge in Harlech on the west Wales coast, is on the market for £550,000, meaning that when he tots up his costs against the typical high street agent fee of 1.5pc, he will save around £7,400. And he can wax lyrical about the Grade II listed stone building, which overlooks the Royal St David’s golf course, in far greater detail than an agent. \nDavid George and Stephen Dumble also teamed up with an online agent to get exposure on the big property search sites, while handling the rich history of the Old Water Tower in Swanage themselves. \nIt was requisitioned by the War Department in the Second World War with an anti-aircraft Bofors gun placed on the roof and is now on the market for £1.25 million, a perfect buy for a history buff. \nThe Old Water Tower: contact eMoov on 0333 121 4950. \n“Building your own private website provides the vendor with a great place to get nerdy about their home,” says Quirk. \n“It allows vendors to expand on the history and heritage of the property and information on the local area. Something you might not include in full within your advert but certainly something that would be of interest to potential buyers.” \nThe renovated interior of the Old Water Tower. \nTips \n1. De-clutter. Buy fresh flowers and pay attention to the little things. Remember first impressions count. \n2. Use professional pictures do not try to save money by doing them yourself. \n3. Include details of the location with key benefits of living in the area. \n4. Create a professional-looking sales website. \n5. Do not expect too much interest until it has been advertised for several weeks. The awareness builds. \n6. Remember the cost is a fraction of an estate agent’s cut £5,000- £10,000 can buy many weeks of advertising. \n7. Be efficient when returning calls and flexible when arranging viewings. You are now acting as a sales rep. \n• Swap your Surrey semi for a chateau in France and still work in London \n• Guess why this country mansion is the latest freak occurrence on Rightmove", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:13:21.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
