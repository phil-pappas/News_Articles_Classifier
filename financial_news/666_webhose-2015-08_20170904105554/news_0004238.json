Officials now hope BER will be operational in late 2017. \nBild said that large invoices submitted by the companies for subsequent services were paid \"often without question\". \nLawyers for the airport consortium called the rate at which the additional bills were paid \"unparallelled and suspicious\", according to Bild. \nBosch and T-Systems declined to comment on the report but Bild quoted an airport consortium spokesman as saying that \"all payments made since the start of the project will be subject to another overall review\". \nA spokesman for Siemens declined to comment on the report but noted that the company had introduced broad internal review practices in recent years. \n\"We cannot completely rule out wrongdoing by individuals but if there are indications that the law and internal guidelines were violated we will decisively investigate this in cooperation with the relevant authorities,\" he told news agency DPA. \nThe German capital's new international air hub has become a multi-billion-euro planning disaster and a running joke for many Berliners, tarnishing Germany's reputation for engineering prowess, efficiency and punctuality. \nAfter several delays and budget blow-outs due to serious technical flaws -- especially in the fire safety and smoke extraction system -- officials now hope to open BER in two years' time. \nBut even that date has looked to be in serious doubt after recent setbacks including the bankruptcy of the German division of Dutch group Royal Imtech (Other OTC: IMTEF - news ) , which is handling major electrical, ventilation and plumbing work at the site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T19:32:31.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
