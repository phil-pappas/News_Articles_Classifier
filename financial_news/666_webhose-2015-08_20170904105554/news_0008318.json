[EIA/S] \nAs late as Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, forecast a 2.3 million barrel drawdown for the week to Aug 14. A Reuters poll of analysts on Tuesday had predicted a more conservative stockpile drop of 800,000 barrels. [API/S] \n\"The numbers were a total surprise with crude showing a build when the whole Street was forecasting a draw,\" Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in Laurel Hollow in New York, said. \n\"We feel these numbers are not factored in to the current price of spot crude.\" \nThe front-month futures contract in U.S. crude (CLc1), which expires on Thursday, was down $1.80, or 4 percent, at $40.82 a barrel by 11:49 a.m. EDT (1549 GMT). It had tumbled earlier to $40.60, its lowest since March 2009. \nThe front-month in Brent (LCOc1), the global benchmark for oil, was down $1.75, or 3.5 percent, at $47.06 a barrel. \nBP's Whiting, Indiana, refinery, the largest in the Midwest, shut down its biggest crude unit unexpectedly at the start of the week covered by the data. Refinery utilization in the U.S. Midwest region fell to 92.2 percent, the biggest weekly drop in eight months. \nGasoline futures fell even more than crude, tumbling 5 percent to a six-month low, despite stockpiles of the fuel falling 2.7 million barrels, compared with the 1.6-million barrel drop expected by analysts in the Reuters poll. \nDiesel (HOc1) lost 3 percent, hitting six-year lows. \nOil has lost about a third of its value since June, driven by global oversupply and record stockpile levels. \n\"This week's EIA data reaffirms the bearish fundamentals that continue to mount,\" said Chris Jarvis, analyst at Caprock Risk Management in Frederick, Maryland. \n\"Couple that with the stronger dollar and weakness out of China and it's a recipe for lower prices ahead for crude,\" Jarvis said. \n(Additional reporting by Lisa Barrington in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Dale Hudson and Frances Kerry)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:24:11.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
