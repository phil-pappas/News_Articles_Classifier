Peter Braig Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Ask almost any new parent what comes to mind when they think of their young kids, and they'll light up and talk about the joy parenthood has brought to their life. The second thing they'll likely tell you is the cost.\nRegardless of whether you're a solo parent, a duo planning to both work full-time after kids, or have a stay-at-home arrangement in mind, the one certainty is you will have to make sacrifices.\nThe parents who get ahead are those with a financial plan, advisers say. Even if you haven't got firm strategies in place when the kids arrive, if you have at least talked about the financial impact, you'll be ahead.\nHow to look after the kids (and bills)? Decide how you will look after the kids in their pre-school years before, not after, they come into the world. \"Start planning how much time you'll have off work, if you're the main caregiver, how you'll manage financially,\" says adviser Suzanne Hadden. Will your partner split their super contributions to compensate for your months or years out of the workforce? Will they top up your discretionary spending budget? Will you have a dual child-raising budget? These are all questions to answer before you jump into parenthood.\nWhat's the education plan? if you want to send your children to a private school, get a head start by putting money aside up to a decade beforehand.\nSpeed up repayments: make the most of your time in the workforce to accelerate your loan repayments because you won't have much spare cash when the kids come along, says Hadden.\nWhat do you want to teach them about money? Children receive their financial grounding from their parents, adviser Justin Hooper of Sentinel Wealth Management says, so you should decide early what key lessons you want to pass down â€“ and what mistakes to avoid.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T11:02:49.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
