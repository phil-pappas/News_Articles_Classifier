The report found that 14% of consumers are saving less while 55% are saving about the same amount. \n“With millions of Americans behind in their retirement savings, it is important not only to save, but to save more each year,” said Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate.com’s chief financial analyst. “Even for those saving the maximum, 401(k) contribution limits increased for 2015, affording the opportunity to put more away for retirement. The keys to successful savings are paying yourself first and automating the process as much as possible.” \nThe report found that while 14% of Americans are currently saving less for retirement, this is a massive improvement from 2011 when 29% of Americans were saving less for their golden years. \nThe Financial Security Index by Bankrate slipped for a third consecutive month to 101.2 and demonstrates the lowest reading since October 2014. Any number above 100 indicates improved financial security compared to one year ago. The Financial Security Index has been above 100 every month since June 2014, a long streak of 15 consecutive months. \nWhile feelings of job security rebounded from last month’s decline, the readings for each of the other components -- savings, debt, net worth and overall financial situation -- have all declined. \nWomen’s feelings of financial security turned negative for the first time this year, the report said. While men’s feelings remain positive, they tied the lowest reading of the year. Both men and women continue to say they feel less comfortable with their savings now as compared to one year ago. Women’s comfort level with the amount of debt also turned negative this month for the first time since December 2014. \nCatching Up on Savings \nAmid the negative sentiment consumers have about their savings, increasing their allocation for their retirement portfolio can be an easy feat. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T16:31:02.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
