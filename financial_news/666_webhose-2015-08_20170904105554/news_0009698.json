Cornelia Erdmann, SuperLux by Davina Jackson No significant city is ever devoid of desolation and danger. Indeed some European capitals, especially London, revel in their histories of assaults and murder under the shroud of darkness.\nNewer cities can seem more sanitary – as futurist William Gibson once complained about Singapore. On their 1990s visits to Sydney, Barcelona architect Oriol Bohigas and French designer Philippe Starck dismissed the city's \"clean\" demeanour. Bohigas remarked: \"Any really great city makes you feel there's been blood on the streets.\"\nIn most prosperous cities now, however, constant surveillance of public areas is deterring violence: partly because Hollywood films, YouTube videos and smartphone cameras routinely show the algorithmic feature-recognition and GPS location-tracking accuracy of sensor-fitted devices.\nSo what does danger mean to designers of urban lighting? At one level, designers must help dispel perils for people using shadowy areas. Yet outré artists often subversively want to emphasise the dark aspects of human circumstances.\nLED-lit polypropelene boats float across an inlet of the Thames at Canary Wharf, London; these are linked by cables and can be colour-controlled by shore-based observers via a Wi-Fi network. This \"Voyage\" lightwork, by London artists Aether & Hemera, was shown recently on Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. Philip Vile, SuperLux Many light artists enjoy confronting witnesses with site-specific night works that exploit the weedy decay of alleys, vacant sites, derelict buildings, motorway and bridge undercrofts, car parks, road tunnels or railway cuttings.\nMeanwhile, transport and infrastructure agencies see advantages in funding light artworks for potentially troublesome or visually prominent places beside busy roads. One permanent example is New York artist Erwin Redl's Passing through Light – an installation of LED fixtures beaming bold colours up the bleak concrete walls of an I-77 motorway underpass in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nEspecially alluring to light artists is the potential for shimmering reflection in black urban waterways. Witness Aether & Hemera's Voyage , a sea of folded boats floating LED \"candles\" across a calm Thames inlet at London's Canary Wharf.\nRomance up high Moonlight shadows and LED tubes and downlights by Hervé Descottes create pools of mystery and atmosphere along the High Line, a transformed former elevated goods railway in New York. Iwan Baan, SuperLux One of the world's most successful recent examples of landscaping and lighting a derelict urban zone is the rejuvenation of a defunct elevated freight railway above New York's Meatpacking district: now a linear park called the High Line.\nLighting designer Hervé Descottes (of L'Observatoire International) specified LED strips fitted to the underside of waist-high handrails along the edge of the walkway. This keeps light sources and intensity low to create a romantic mood for wanderers, emphasises the lights of surrounding buildings, and avoids contributing more photon pollution to Manhattan's night sky.\nDerelict sites and districts of cities always seem poised for reinvention. When local demographic and economic conditions reach the right nexus, nondescript lighting must be upgraded to express the desired new spirit of place.\nTight budgets will often demand installation of versatile fixtures. In the late 1990s, Sydney lighting engineer Barry Webb and architect Alex Tzannes produced then-innovative, now ubiquitous, multifunctional smart poles to tidy the city's main streets in time for its tourist influx for the 2000 Olympics.\nStone walls along a central Melbourne laneway are suddenly transformed by short videos of lush vegetation. This projection, titled \"Human Effect\", was produced by artist Yandell Walton. Lauren Dunn, SuperLux One recent variation on smartpoles has been effective in the low-income district of St Catherine at the French port city of Le Havre. The council installed a group of 10-metre-high light poles, slightly inclining between clusters of trees around the town square, to provide not only general lighting but perimeter definition for the plaza, navigation signals for citizens at a distance, and creative effects at community gatherings.\nThe whole point of lighting dead areas of a city is to rescue them back for human life.\nThis is an edited extract from SuperLux: Smart Light Art, Design and Architecture for Cities , edited by Davina Jackson, Thames & Hudson, $55.\nThe SuperLux: Smart Light Cities exhibition will be on show at Sydney's Customs House, Circular Quay, Sydney, September 3 to October 17, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:14:54.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
