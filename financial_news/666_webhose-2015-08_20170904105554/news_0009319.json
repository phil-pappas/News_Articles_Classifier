Peter Braig by Tim Binsted Independent senators Nick Xenophon and John Madigan are drafting legislation that would force the federal government to consider local jobs, rather than just price, when procuring goods and services.\nUnions are pushing the Abbott government to mandate the use of Australian steel on government projects in a bid to keep the last blast furnace at BlueScope's massive Port Kembla steelworks from closing.\nBlueScope boss Paul O'Malley said last week that the iconic plant, in Wollongong in the NSW Illawarra, must cut $200 million in costs or the blast furnace, and 5000 jobs, will go .\n\"I am drafting legislation, along with Senator John Madigan, that will make it much easier for local participation in Commonwealth procurement,\" independent Senator for South Australia Nick Xenophon said.\n\"At the core of the legislation there wil be a presumption that you should procure locally unless there is a good reason not to.\"\nAmong other considerations, the two independents want better accountability and reporting of the $40 billion in annual Commonwealth procurement.\nThe private Senator's bill will also require procurement to consider broader economic benefits from using local product such as employment, tax, 'whole-of-life' project costs such as maintenance, and multiplier effects from keeping those jobs in Australia.\nMr Xenophon said that \"other countries are laughing at our procurement policy\".\n He said it makes no sense that a government contract could be awarded to a foreigner based on a $5 million saving when the broader benefits of using local product could be worth $30 million to Australia.\n\"We should structure an annual reporting framework and monitoring of procurement policies. There should be a buy Australian approach where you maximise local industry participation,\" he said.\n$40 billion of procurement \"We are talking about $40 billion of Commonwealth procurement and we don't know how much of that is going overseas.\"\nThe legislation being tabled is based on a report by the Senate finance and public administrations references committee, of which Mr Madigan and Mr Xenophon were both members, that was published in July 2014 and has been ignored by the government.\nBut BlueScope's Mr O'Malley's frank assessment last week that \"the [Port Kembla] steelworks is on a knife edge\" has given the procurement issue fresh impetus.\n\"This goes beyond steel. I was working on this before steel [went into crisis]. But steel is an example where if the rules were changed to reflect the impact of local procurement, the steel industry wouldn't be anywhere near the trouble it is now,\" Mr Xenophon said.\nThe South Australian independent is no doubt also concerned about the future of Arrium's blast furnace at Whyalla in South Australia. Some analysts argue Whyalla will be turned off when it requires its next reline in 2024.\nThe Australian Workers' Union will hold a mass workers meeting at Port Kembla at 7am on Wednesday.\nPart of BlueScope's $200 million of cost savings, which would keep the blast furnace open, is predicated on 500 job cuts.\nMediation between BlueScope and the unions will begin next week under the direction of Fair Work Commission vice-president Adam Hartcher.\nThe AWU is also demanding that federal industry minister Ian Macfarlane agrees to get the Commonwealth to procure local steel for its projects.\nA \"buy our steel\" community rally will be held on September 12 at the Wollongong mall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:57:41.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
