However, its spell at the top of the mid-cap index was short lived as it plunged 7.4pc to 103.2p on Friday after Jefferies and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) targeted the stock. \nDespite posting a half-year loss after tax of $375.2m , Premier Oil had initially impressed investors by revealing it had renegotiated debt covenants with banks and bondholders to mid-2017. But UBS in particular were not convinced, as they reduced the target price by 35p to 130p. The bank’s Daniel Ekstein warned “there is little margin of safety”. \nWith more than $1.3bn write-offs over the past 18 months, Mr Ekstein noted “poorly deployed capital lingers on the balance sheet”. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) came as the FTSE 100 closed down 363.09 points at 6,187.65, a drop of 5.6pc over a week in which £93bn was wiped off the value of Britain’s leading companies. Friday saw fresh data from China which further exacerbated fears of a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. \nChina-led carnage and political uncertainty in Greece prompted a sea of red across equity markets worldwide . European bourses recorded hefty losses, recording their biggest weekly fall this year. The German DAX slid 3pc and the CAC in Paris fell 3.2pc. Joshua Mahony, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said “there is a growing feeling that China is fast running out of ideas to fix this crisis and the implications for global business have been exhibited perfectly on the stock markets”. * Global markets tumble as commodity prices fall into 'death spiral' Back in London, Spire Healthcare (LSE: SPI.L - news ) suffered its worst day since it floated last July, plunging 57.1p, or 14.2pc, to 344.5p, amid expectations of near-term weakness in NHS demand for the year . Despite half-year results coming in with market expectations, the FTSE 250 company announced a more cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. \nHowever, Sally Taylor, of Numis, said “NHS waiting lists are at the highest level seen since February 2008, which we would expect to drive self-pay markets and expect Spire (Stuttgart: SIZ.SG - news ) to benefit from its high quality and transparent pricing model”. \nN Brown (LSE: BWNG.L - news ) was also among the laggards after Exane BNP Paribas revised its target price lower to 300p from 320p. The bank believes pre-tax profit will fall about 18pc when the company reports its half-year results on October 14. Simon Bowler, of Exane BNP Paribas, described the first half of the year as a “six month storm”, as he expects immature new stores and ongoing re-phasing of marketing will push profits lower. The stock closed 23p lower at 298.3p. \nOn an otherwise disastrous day, Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) found itself as the sole FTSE 100 rise, advancing 7.5p to 478.2p. Finally, gold mining stocks fell into negative territory despite gold spot climbing to an intraday high of $1,168, as investors sought a safe haven from the Chinese turmoil. Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) slipped 3p to 681.5p, while Randgold Resources closed 13p lower at £42.42.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T23:02:20.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
