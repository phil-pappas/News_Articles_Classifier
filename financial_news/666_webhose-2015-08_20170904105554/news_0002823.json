Further more, the private sector can generate, distribute and sell power to the customers. In such approach the government not only provide license for the investors who are interested to involve in such venture it but also purchase power from them. \nPower Africa is the President Obama's initiative to supply 30,000 MW to African countries and mobilizes 7 billion dollar for the implementation of the programme and with this scheme, the private sector play a very crucial role. The programme supports the nation's energy development strategy through technical assistance. \nIn addition, it helps the government to secure the private sector investment for developing geothermal, solar and wind projects. The 1000 MW that is going to be generated from geothermal power in the Corbeti area near to Hawassa Town is an indicator of the Power Africa Initiative positive out come. It is a private sector investment which invest 4 billion dollar in two phases. In the first phase, it generates 500 MW and in the next phase it produce the remaining 500 MW and totally within 8 to 10 years it produce 1000 MW. According to the Corbeti project manager Edward Njorge, his company is entitled to generate power and supply to the national grid and in return, the government will pay for that. \nThe commencement of such kinds of projects can help to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The transfer of knowledge and technology is the other advantage that the nation enjoy. \nThe inflow of private investment in the sector also enhances business competition which make the economic foundation more strong and helpful for sustainable development. \nPower Africa also brought additional opportunity which make value chain with different stake holders. It also supports Ventus Company to install 2000 meters cable in Addis Ababa and produce two million meters lines which hold electric power to improve electricity service and make reliable for millions of customers. The utilization of smart meter technology in Ethiopia has the potential to reduce power loses immensely. The other better chance brought by the Power Africa Initiative is facilitating energy trade in the eastern Africa countries. To make this a reality, power pool established its head office is in Addis Ababa. The main objective of the programme is connecting the region countries with renewable power with the lowest possible cost. It also strives to manage efficiently the system in an integrated manner. \nPower Africa also supports the project to develop common grid codes and structure transmission interconnection between countries those are involved in the mutual benefit programme in the region. \nThe Power Africa which is initiated by President Obama underlined that, the appalling poverty pervasive in Africa must be tackled through multifaceted approach. And thus, the expansion of energy specially the renewable one is crucial. Energy reinforces the expansion of education, health, household energy and small-scale enterprise manufacturing; in general, it accelerates better way of life. \nWhen people are properly educated, the way of farming improved and productivity increased; this in turn, give way for achieving food security. Educated farmers not only focus on their farming enhancement but also look for the proper management of their surrounding natural resources and ecosystem. \nOn the other hand, when household energy demand is satisfied with renewable energy, the death rate due to in house pollution will be reduced, cutting trees and clearing vegetation cover will cease. \nAs the result, land degradation and soil erosion will be minimized; and the degraded land will be rehabilitated, streams and ponds also replenished and the ecosystem will be balanced. These again helps hydropower dams to get uninterrupted water flow and generate power at their maximum capacity. The cooperation of Power Africa also strengthen rural electrification. Currently, most of the rural population is due to inaccessible to electricity spend the night at dark such a situation is not acceptable by whatever standard; hence, the exploitation of energy resources helps to liberate people suffering from energy poverty and lack of electric light. \nIn the coming Ethiopian year, the second phase of GTP will be commenced and the programme emphasises the expansion of manufacturing which could be the base to industrialization and structural change of the economic land escape. It targets the shifting of rural labour to the manufacturing sector. The sector serves for import substitution and expanding export to earn more hard currency; but all these with out the supply of viable and renewable energy is unthinkable. On the other hand, the annual demand of energy is rising to about 20 per cent; thus, to meet the demand, exploiting the resource is vital. \nSide by side with meeting the demand, earning hard currency through exporting renewable energy as mentioned above also strengthen the diversification of the nation economy. Hence, becoming partner with the Power Africa Initiative supports our attaining development goal. \nIn sum, energy can serve as a backbone for any development scheme and for that we need not only domestic financial resources but also we must mobilize from external sources. And the nation economy will be integrated with the global economy; as the result, attracting foreign investment will be advanced and ultimately we realize our dream in reaching middle income status by 2025. \nBY ABEBE WOLDE-GIORGIS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:15:14.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
