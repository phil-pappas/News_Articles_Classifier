The company had about 466 million shares outstanding as of July 31.\nMoody’s cut ADP’s issuer rating by two notches to Aa3 from Aa1, and said ADP’s first-ever debt-funded buyback “represents an abrupt shift away from the company’s historically conservative financial practices”.\n“The significant planned increase in ADP’s funded debt signals a meaningful change in financial policy and sets the stage for the possibility of further credit weakening through future debt raises,” it said in a statement.\nADP’s new rating is three notches below the coveted AAA rating, the pristine measurement that says a company is well able to pay back its debt. ADP was one of a handful of U.S. blue chips to enjoy that top rating for many years until April 2014, when a decision to spin off its auto-dealers service and use about $700 million in proceeds to buy back shares led to downgrades from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.\nThe number of companies doing debt-financed share buybacks has increased dramatically in recent years, as companies have used low borrowing rates to fund rewards for shareholders.\nApple Inc. AAPL, -0.48% for example, has used massive debt issuance in a range of currencies to fund dividends and share buybacks in recent years, rather than repatriate cash from overseas that would be subject to high U.S. corporate taxes. Apple had long-term debt of $47 billion as of June 27 , up sharply from $29 billion a year earlier. Apple had no long-term debt as recently as September 2012.\nThis leveraging of U.S. companies has come at a time when market valuations are (or were) near their highest levels in history on some measures, according to fund manager John Hussman, the owner of Hussman Funds.\n“What drives buyback activity is not value, but the availability of cheap, speculative capital at points in the business cycle where profit margins are temporarily elevated and make the increased debt burden seem easy to handle,” Hussman wrote in a recent note.\nU.S. companies had borrowed almost $600 billion to fund about $500 billion of buybacks by 2012, he said, citing data from Datastream. Buybacks have spiked in recent years to reach more than $280 billion in the three-month period through May 2015, the highest in more than a decade, he said.\nAs the Federal Reserve gears up to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006, credit spreads for companies are expected to widen, increasing the cost of debt, while profit margins are coming under pressure.\n“Debt-financed buybacks effectively put investors on margin,” said Hussman. “As corporations have borrowed in order to aggressively buy back their stock near the highest market valuations in history, existing stockholders have quietly become heavily leveraged, without even realizing it.”\nADP’s credit profile had already deteriorated following asset sales that reduced its scale and decreased the diversity of its product portfolio, according to Moody’s. But its Aa3 rating is supported by the predictable profit and cash flow that stem from its leading market position in payment processing and other services, and a recurring revenue base that comes from a large and diverse group of customers.\nInvestments aimed at expanding the business and improving systems will pressure the company’s operating margins and free cash flow generation in the next two years, the ratings firm said. Moody’s expects margins to improve to about 19% once ADP starts to benefits from those investments.\nShares were up slightly in recent trading. They are down 6% in the year so far, while the S&P 500 has lost 3.6% in the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Downgrades-Automatic-Data-Processing-to-Aa3-Affirms-Prime-1--PR_333457?WT.mc_id=AMRG93X0pvbmVzX05ld3NSb29tX1NCX1JhdGluZyBOZXdzX0FsbF9Fbmc", "http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/07/23Apple-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results.html", "http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AAPL/635808548x0x840568/7616A2CA-9254-40E4-92BC-3815B1155018/Q3_2015_Form_10-Q_As-filed_.PDF"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T21:00:05.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
