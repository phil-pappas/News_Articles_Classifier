Reliance Industries , the owner of world’s largest refining unit, also ended down 2.4% on the BSE, while Cairn India touched its 52-week low, pushing the gauge of oil and gas companies down nearly 3.5%.\nMarket experts and energy analysts highlighted a combination of factors for the decline in crude prices. Rupee’s depreciation against the dollar may escalate the cost of importing crude oil and negate the benefit of falling oil prices.\nOil accounts for one-third of India’s total imports, based on last year figures.\nOn Wednesday, the Indian rupee weakened to its weakest level in almost two years as China’s devaluation of the renminbi sparked concerns about China’s slowing economic growth and sluggish exports.\nChina’s move to devalue its currency for a second straight day also sent shockwaves through world stocks and currency markets.\nAnalysts said that traders booked profit — ahead of first quarter earnings — as shares of OMCs had risen sharply over the last 12 months, driven by deregulation of petrol and diesel prices and softer crude prices, allowing incremental marketing margins.\nIOC will announce its Q1FY16 results on Thursday, while BPCL will announce its earnings on Friday. While HPCL reported better-than-expected earning, analysts do not foresee the performance to sustain. GRMs of state-owned refiners are expected to decline to sub-$6 per barrel after touching a peak of $8-9 levels.\n 13, 2015 12:21 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T08:35:46.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
