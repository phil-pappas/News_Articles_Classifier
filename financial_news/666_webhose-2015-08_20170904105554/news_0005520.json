While it would like to draw a line under loss-making contracts and reassure investors that the turnaround is on track, in the notoriously tricky world of construction it simply can’t offer those assurances. \n= Construction crunch = \nPlanning the cost of building projects is always, excuse the pun, difficult to nail down. From the home kitchen extension to the multi-billion-pound national infrastructure project, there is always an element of finger in the air when working out how much the materials, manpower and expertise will cost. \nWhen times are good, this isn’t so much of a problem. As big construction projects overrun, customers are willing to discuss how they can be funded. In an environment of strained finances, these discussions are often much shorter. \nIn an effort to win work in the competitive heat of the financial crisis six years ago, Balfour is now paying the price of rising building material costs and wages. \n= Construction crunch = \nBalfour Beatty has become something of a poster child for the sector’s woes. The previous management team has been culled following a string of profit warnings , Balfour was nearly taken over by rival Carillion (Other OTC: CIOIF - news ) last year and the dividend was axed in March this year . \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) chief executive Leo Quinn, former boss of Qinetiq, unveiled a first-half loss of £152m to June 26, as he attempts to puts his own estimate on the profitability of the projects. \nBalfour Beatty chief executive Leo Quinn joined the company in January \nMr Quinn said that 90pc of the old problem contracts should be finished by the end of next year. Unfortunately that still leaves 14 months for things to get worse. The company will have built some fat into the provisions on each contract, but investors are still exposed to the vagaries of a tough UK market. \nThe Far East may also hold surprises. In particular the Hong Kong Express Rail Link is a headache. Balfour is in discussions with the customer, but if those talks end badly then there will be more pain to come at the year end. \n= Reasons to believe = \nBalfour has plenty of qualities to ride out the storm. Under Mr Quinn a focus on cash led to an inflow of £362m in the first half, leaving a £260m cash pile on the balance sheet at June 26. The business is focusing on cutting costs and made £25m in savings during the first six months with a total target of £100m by the end of next year. \nThe builder is also sitting on an attractive investment portfolio of infrastructure assets worth £1.25bn, for which there is no shortage of demand as they generate inflation linked income. The value in that portfolio of assets underpins the shares as the whole company is worth £1.8bn \nMr Quinn is tentatively optimistic on the outlook. There are some big projects on the horizon such as HS2, British nuclear and tenders for a potential new runway at Heathrow. The order book is stable, down slightly from £10.4bn to £10.3bn at the end of June. \nInvestors gave Mr Quinn the benefit of the doubt and the shares jumped more than 4pc higher to 263p yesterday, bringing gains so far this year to 24pc. \nBalfour Beatty has been one of Questor’s worst share tips, having r ecommended them at 273p in October 2013 and again at 293.5p January 2014 , on early signs of a recovery it has been a rollercoaster ride. We’ve learnt our lesson and until trading is solidly profitable and dividends return it remains a hold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T12:08:23.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
