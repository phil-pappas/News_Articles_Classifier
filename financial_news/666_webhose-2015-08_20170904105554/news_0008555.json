Ryan Stuart Despite the company having an internal service to inform on any dubious practices, Mansotte says he couldn't risk using it for fear of his identity being exposed, or the company not handling it appropriately.\n\"I didn't trust them; they were not independent: they were providing other services like audit and consulting, so they were working for Leighton, not for me as a whistleblower,\" Mansotte recalls.\n\"It is really hard to accept, as a whistleblower, that you have the facts and that you are the one that is going to have to report it. He was a GM of finance and had been an employee for 30 years. Many people in similar positions would not have acted because they couldn't risk it; I was lucky with circumstance.\"\nIn his case Mansotte was able to involve Leighton's head of procurement. She had only recently joined the organisation as well, meaning she could not have been involved with the fraud. Once it was reported, O'Carrigan quickly confessed and was sentenced to a lengthy jail term.\n Former Leighton Contractors finance manager Damian O'Carrigan was jailed after defrauding the company of $20.7 million. Fairfax Fraud spawns idea After leaving Leightons, Mansotte conceived Fraudsec, and has since found that numerous industry sectors are keen on the idea.\nThe site, hosted on Amazon Web Services' cloud servers, allows a user to create a report and attach files via their phone or PC. The report is encrypted and the service generates a unique URL and QR code for the case, allowing the company to communicate via message with the whistleblower in complete anonymity.\nMansotte says Fraudsec is picking up interest from a range of new clients who are able to trial the product easily due to the increasingly popular software-as-a-service model, whereby the service is accessed online via an ongoing subscription.\nFraudsec allows a user to create a report and attach files via their phone or PC. Fairfax He says the company is not yet at the stage where big-name customers are happy for them to slap their logos on the Fraudsec site for marketing purposes; however the calibre of organisations is significant.\nThey include major global banking and financial services institutions, as well as companies in the telecommunications sector.\nOne sector particularly receptive to the idea is insurance, due to the high costs providers can incur when organisations are defrauded. Mansotte says O'Carrigan had spent most of the vast amount stolen from Leightons, so the company could only recover a fraction. The insurance company was left to stump up an $18 million shortfall.\n\"If Fraudsec had been implemented at the time at Leighton it is highly likely that the fraud would have stopped well before then,\" Mansotte says.\n\"Insurance companies are now looking at Fraudsec as being insurance for the clients and for themselves. They are looking at ways of packaging Fraudsec into their solution for crime and stability insurance.\"\nWider possibilities The wider possibilities for the service are also starting to dawn on Mansotte as a partnership with a large professional services firm has yielded inquiries from previously unsuspected sources. The New South Wales government inquired about using the service as part of plans to combat bullying in schools, and as a result Fraudsec is working on a rebadged app to be known as SchoolSafe.\n\"You can change the labels of most of the fields on the whistleblower forms to make it fit for your business, and you can add 10 new fields. So you can make it work for bullying, sexual harassment, anything you'd like really,\" Mansotte says.\n\"When bad things start to happen at school, kids often don't come forward to talk about it, but an anonymous app could make that first communication much easier.\"\nFraudsec is still privately funded, or bootstrapped in start-up parlance, and Mansotte says this approach will continue until the end of the year, when further funding will become an issue. However he says the idea has already turned into a viable and ongoing business.\n\"We will definitely be profitable in less than 12 months; we have a lot of traction now,\" he says.\n\"Usually when you have a large organisation subscribing to Fraudsec, they set up between five and 20 users, and each user is billed $99 a month. If they deploy it wider, then it can go up to 20, 30, 40 users very quickly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:03:35.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
