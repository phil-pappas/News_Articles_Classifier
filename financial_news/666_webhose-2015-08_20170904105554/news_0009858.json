In the currency market, investors reacted by unwinding recent moves that had lifted both the yen and the euro.\nA recent spike in risk aversion had triggered short-covering in the yen and the euro, which are popular funding currencies for carry trades. Such trades involve selling low-yielding currencies to buy higher-yielding currencies and assets.\nDemand for the yen and the euro showed signs of ebbing, however, with the dollar rising along with global stock markets. Traders said any upward revision to second-quarter growth data out of the United States later in the day, could bolster the greenback.\nThe dollar was up 0.3 percent against the yen at 120.24 yen , and well above a seven-month low of 116.15 yen struck earlier this week. The euro, too, was up 0.4 percent at 136.10 yen, while against the dollar it was flat at $1.1320, well below this week's seven-month high of $1.1715.\nThe dollar index edged up to 95.223.\n\"The focus is shifting back to U.S. data and central banks. The market is looking for more dovish comments from central banks to counterbalance the tensions stemming from China,\" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Credit Agricole.\n\"Incoming U.S. data, if it surprises on the upside will give a boost to the dollar.\"\nNew York Fed President William Dudley said on Wednesday an interest rate hike next month seemed less appropriate given the threat posed to the U.S. economy by recent market turmoil.\nTraders said Dudley's relatively dovish tones, combined with upbeat data showing a big increase in U.S. business investment plans have helped soothe market nerves.\nA focal point for investors is an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, attended by many of the world's top central bankers. On Saturday, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer will take part in a panel discussion on \"U.S. Inflation Developments\".\nThe market will be watching to see if central bankers play down recent market volatility as a headwind, analysts at DBS in Singapore said in a note.\n\"They will probably agree that the problem today is not in the advanced economies but the emerging economies,\" DBS said.\n\"If so, the dollar index can regain some of its composure if the symposium succeeds in keeping expectations intact for a Fed hike later this year without more panic in the markets,\" they added.
