Activist investor ValueAct Capital Management said in late July that it had a 5.44% stake in company.\nMoreover, the shares look cheap to investors who are hopeful that ValueAct and others can prod the sputtering firm to higher profitability. (The Rolls-Royce automobile brand now belongs to Germany’s BMW. BMW, -2.21% )\nRolls-Royce is part of an enviable duopoly with General Electric GE, -1.48% in the wide-body commercial jet engine business. When Rolls or GE becomes the engine of choice for a successful airplane, the firms produce many copies of an engine, which become hugely profitable over time as maintenance and repair contracts kick in.\nA new entrant in the business would have to spend billions of dollars on engine development — a process that once landed Rolls in receivership despite the ultimate success of the engine it was developing at the time.\nEven after successful development, a new entrant would likely incur losses for many years before the profits from maintenance contracts would accrue, according to Australian fund manager John Hempton of Bronte Capital, who owns shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings.\nEngine makers effectively give the engines away, and make money over years or decades for servicing the engines. Yet despite the technological and financial barriers to entry, Rolls-Royce’s profit margins are much narrower than GE’s, and Rolls hasn’t been the supplier for a successful plane recently.\nUsing materials and parts from outside suppliers, such as Precision Castparts PCP, -0.01% , has crimped Rolls-Royce’s margins, according to an analysis by investment firm GreenWood Investors . Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace unit produces less than 12% operating margins, compared to close to 21% for GE aviation.\nOther investors contend that Rolls-Royce is distracted by the diesel engine business, which, they argue, it should spin off or sell. Sequoia Fund SEQUX, +0.28% manager Robert Goldfarb wrote in his year-end 2014 shareholder letter that Rolls-Royce is “[destroying] shareholder value in the name of diversification.”\nGoldfarb at that time also expressed considerable dissatisfaction with then-CEO John Rishton, whom Goldfarb described as “[showing] minimal awareness of the returns on capital his acquisitions have generated.”\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/03/sequoia-fund-2014-letter/", "http://www.gwinvestors.com/2015/07/31/rolls-royce-rr-ln-mind-the-gap/"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:04:29.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
