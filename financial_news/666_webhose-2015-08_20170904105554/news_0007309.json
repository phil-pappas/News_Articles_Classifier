The stock is listed at the bottom of the list. NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- If you're a student of technical analysis, here's a list of more than two dozen stocks that are looking good, according to the charts. \n\"The battle between the Bulls and Bears has never been more evenly matched. The SPX closed higher last week, marking six consecutive weeks alternating between gains and losses,\" Jonathan Krinsky, the Chief Market Technician at investment firm, MKM Partners, based in Stamford, Conn., wrote in an Aug. 16 note to clients. \"It remains in the narrowest trading range in history, and as a result, the SPX's weekly Bollinger Bands are as narrow as they have been in over twenty years.\" \nThe S&P 500 index is up 1.87% this year. The index has not registered a 5% pullback all year, \"Since 1928, there have only been five years without such an occurrence, and only one in the last 50 years ('95),\" Krinsky wrote.

The presumption is they continue to outperform in the intermediate-term,\" Krinsky wrote. \nHere's the list. TheStreet added ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet' s proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNote: Year-to-date returns are based on Aug. 14, 2015 closing prices. \nIndustry: Health Care/Health Care Equipment Market Cap: $75 billion Year-to-date return: 11.6% \nAbbott Laboratories manufactures and sells health care products worldwide. The company serves retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices, and government agencies. It has strategic alliance with Fonterra. The company was founded in 1888 and is headquartered in Abbott Park, Ill. \nTheStreet Ratings: Buy, B TheStreet Said: \"We rate ABBOTT LABORATORIES (ABT) a BUY. This is driven by a few notable strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its compelling growth in net income, revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance and reasonable valuation levels. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Health Care Equipment & Supplies industry. The net income increased by 68.6% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $465.00 million to $784.00 million. ABT's revenue growth trails the industry average of 30.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 2.2%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.38, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. To add to this, ABT has a quick ratio of 1.60, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. Looking at where the stock is today compared to one year ago, we find that it is not only higher, but it has also clearly outperformed the rise in the S&P 500 over the same period. Although other factors naturally played a role, the company's strong earnings growth was key. Looking ahead, unless broad bear market conditions prevail, we still see more upside potential for this stock, despite the fact that it has already risen over the past year.
