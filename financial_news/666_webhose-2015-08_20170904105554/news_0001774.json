David Mariuz by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell We wonder how long it will be until another chapter is written in the sad story of Hills Ltd.\nHills shares matched their worst ever close on Thursday, while its boardroom wrangles about how to re-make the company and investors question a recent deal with Woolworths. But sources told Street Talk there may be another get-out option on the way.\nIt's understood the company's shocking run has prompted at least one tyrekicker to run the numbers on the group.\nWhile nothing is definite or close to the point of disclosure, sources were pointing towards one of the big two retailers - Wesfarmers or Woolworths.\nWoolworths has its own issues and it is hard to see how the board would want to add another troubled until into the mix.\nAs for Wesfarmers, its Blackwoods division could find a few synergies with Hills' cast of electronics and communications products.\nThe third - and perhaps most exciting - theory being tossed around is a play by former chief executive Ted Pretty, backed by a private investor. Pretty had big plans for the group, before he parted ways with the company after disagreements on future strategy.\nFinally, PR firm Citadel-MAGNUS is used to putting out fires.

Sources said the investor call was temporarily abandoned and everyone had to bail the building while two city fire brigade units looked for the burnt toast.\nIt was certainly a baptism of fire for Steve Boggiano, the former Barclays managing director who was recently appointed Director of Strategy for Estia. The investors listened in on the drama unfolding and shrugged it all off as good entertainment with the share price hitting a new intraday high of $6.86.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:09:34.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
