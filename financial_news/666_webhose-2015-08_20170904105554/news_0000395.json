She has previously been a director at David Jones, Medibank Private, Boom Logistics and several Victorian government boards.\nUGL has also appointed its senior counsel, barrister Robert Kaye, to its board. Mr Kaye is currently chairman of Collins Food and Paperlinx, and a non-executive director at magnesium manufacturer Magontec.\nThe new board appointments , combined with the earlier appointment of engineer John Cooper in April, would help \"lead the new strategic direction\" of UGL as a standalone engineering and maintenance services company, Ms Spargo said.\n\"We are now well progressed with the renewal of the board.\"\nExisting director Doug McTaggart, who joined the board in September 2012, will resign from the board on August 3 due to other board commitments.\nMs Spargo, who replaced Trevor Rowe as UGL's chairman after the 2014 AGM, wants to create a more diverse board to oversee the company's development following the sale of property arm DTZ, which has left it with just 9,000 employees compared with 55,000 previously.\nUGL reports annual results on August 24.", "external_links": ["http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150810/pdf/430dfrmqynjmp3.pdf", "http://www.aspecthuntley.com.au/docserver/01648998.pdf?fileid=01648998&datedir=20150810&edt=MjAxNS0wOC0xMCswOToyMzo0MSsxNDQwMCs2MjM4NytGYWlyZmF4IDEgREFQK3JlZGlyZWN0Ky9pbWFnZXNpZ25hbC9lcnJvcnBhZ2VzL1BERlRpbWVvdXQuaHRtbCsvaW1hZ2VzaWduYWwvZXJyb3JwYWdlcy9wZGZkZWxheWVkLmpzcA==", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/orica-takes-165b-writedown-on-mining-slump-and-downgrades-profit-estimate-20150806-gitmxg.html"], "published": "2015-08-10T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:04:43.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
