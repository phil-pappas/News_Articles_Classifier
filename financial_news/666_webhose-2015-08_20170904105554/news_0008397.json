Getty Images by Primrose Riordan and Laura Tingle Prime Minister Tony Abbott is pushing the case for extending the RAAF's bombing missions against Islamic State into Syria following a request from the Obama administration.\nMr Abbott said a decision would be made within weeks. \"In the end, when they don't respect the border, the question is, why should we?\" he said.\nCanada and Britain have indicated they will join the air strikes and Australia is already refuelling planes, and co-ordinating air space for Coalition strikes in Syria, Mr Abbott said.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said he had spoken to Mr Abbott briefly about it and was open to bipartisanship on the issue and expected a briefing next week.\nTony Abbott says \"In the end, when they don't respect the border, the question is, why should we?\" Getty Images Labor and defence experts have raised concerns over the legal basis for Australia's involvement in Syria and the direction of the entire coalition mission.\nWhile the government has a legal basis for participating in the war in Iraq following that government's invitation to Australia to fight against Islamic State, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad opposes US air strikes. Mr Shorten said he would push Mr Abbott to respond to this.\nLegal basis unclear ANU international law professor Don Rothwell said while bombing Syria may make sense militarily, the legal basis for it was unclear because there is no Security Council resolution and Australia cannot exercise a right of self-defence.\n \"The fact that the US has made an invitation is not sufficient â€¦ I think the only way that Australia could perhaps proceed would be to actually radically adjust Australian doctrine to these matters, to take a more expansive view of self-defence,\" he said.\nThe Labor opposition is angry that their bipartisanship on national security has not protected them from being accused by the government of being soft on terror.\nLabor's foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, said the Coalition was using the media to float the idea of extending Australia's military involvement and as of Friday she was yet to receive any information because a scheduled briefing was cancelled.\nDefence think tank, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, has previously said Australia should only join the fight in Syria if there was a \"new strategy with an achievable set of objectives\".\nThe Defence Department's Joint Chief of Operations, David Johnston, has said the move would expose Australia to a \"significantly\" more difficult environment and said Australia's involvement in Syria would not be a \"game-changer\".", "external_links": ["http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-19/australia-joining-airstrikes-in-syria-not-a-game-changer/6708782"], "published": "2015-08-21T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:13:07.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
