Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) warned Wednesday that the Tea Party could interfere with the path GOP leaders choose to pursue this fall to fund the government. In an interview on \"The Ed Schultz Show,\" which is no longer on MSNBC, Van Hollen said a government shutdown is “a real danger right now.” “I remember two years ago, when Speaker [John] Boehner [R-Ohio], at just this time of year, said that he was going to stop the Tea Party Republicans from shutting down the government. He wasn’t able to do it. Ted Cruz and the Tea Party crew said that they wanted to shut down the government in order to shut down the Affordable Care Act, and they did it for 16 days, at great cost to the country,” said Van Hollen, top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. The Maryland lawmaker, who’s running for Senate in 2016, said he’s now hearing the same group of conservative lawmakers threatening to defund Planned Parenthood this fall and risk a government shutdown. ADVERTISEMENT Van Hollen suggested this year's course of events closely mirrors the lead-up to the 2013 shutdown, when GOP leaders said at the time that they wouldn’t let it happen. “Once again, you hear people like Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell say we’re not going to let this happen,” he said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “But we heard that before, and at the end of the day, the Tea Party folks have an awful lot of power in both the House and the Senate. So we’ve got a fight on our hands.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who’s running for president, has called for defunding Planned Parenthood as an anti-abortion group continues to leak videos highlighting the healthcare organization's use of fetal tissue. On Tuesday night, however, Cruz told a group of pastors on a conference call that any effort to blame him for another government shutdown would be “nonsense,\" The Washington Post reported . He was credited with leading the campaign to defund ObamaCare that led to the 2013 shutdown. A group of 18 House conservatives warned Boehner before Congress's August recess that they would oppose any spending legislation that continues fund Planned Parenthood. GOP leaders, meanwhile, have been mum about their strategy to keep the government funded through Oct. 1. They’ve made clear a continuing resolution (CR) that extends 2015 funding is the most likely option, but they have not addressed the question of Planned Parenthood funding in that bill. McConnell reiterated to reporters before the recess that he would not allow any more government shutdowns. Once Congress returns to Capitol Hill after Labor Day, lawmakers will have 12 days in session before the deadline to fund the government. September will already be a busy month, with votes planned on the Iran deal and Pope Francis's visit to Washington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T01:44:55.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
