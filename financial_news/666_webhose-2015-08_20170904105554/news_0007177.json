It is estimated that the number of new cases of AF is expected to rise from 120,000 in 2014 to 215,000 by 2030. \n“With the increasing number of individuals with atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias, the adoption of catheter ablation procedures will increase as these procedures reduce surgical time and cost, and improve patient outcomes,” says Faisal Ghaus, Vice President of Technavio. \nThe latest report by Technavio also emphasizes the use of robotic-assisted navigation technologies, which have significantly improved the navigation of catheter needles, electrodes, and tips to the target during ablation procedures. \n“The new technology used in cardiac catheters enhance visualization of the catheter's orientation, thereby improving procedural efficiency,” adds Ghaus. \nMarket Scope and Calculation of Market Size \nThe new Technavio report covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the ablation catheters market in Europe from 2015-2019. To calculate the market size, we consider revenue generated from sales based on different types of catheters, including single-point ablation catheters and multi-electrode ablation catheters, and different procedures, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia. \nKey Information Covered in the Report: Key Vendors:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:30:21.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
