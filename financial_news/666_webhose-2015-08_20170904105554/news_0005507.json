David Mariuz Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Prime Minister Tony Abbott has urged a hostile public to allow politicians enough resources to at least do their jobs.\nPushing back at what has become a stampede to shame politicians for legitimate use of travel entitlements, the Prime Minister said that at the end of the day, politicians have to be able to do their jobs.\n\"We have got to be able to do our job. If we can't do our job, we can't properly serve the Australian community,\" he said.\n\"In order to properly serve the Australian community, we have to have access to some resources in the same way that people in business need to have access to some resources in order to do their jobs properly.\n\"The important thing is that those resources are used responsibly, where possible frugally, and in accordance with community expectations.\"\nMr Abbott said the review he had ordered of the system would ensure frugality would be the case.\n\"Members of parliament have a number of different roles. We have a Governmental role, we have a Parliamentary role, we have a political role,\" Mr Abbott said.\nMr Abbott was defending his comments earlier Thursday that MPs should still be able to use taxpayer-funded Comcars to attend party fundraisers.\n The whole storm over expenses broke because Bronwyn Bishop chartered a helicopter to fly to a fundraiser in Geelong.\nIt then transpired she has claimed expenses to attend the weddings of two colleagues and claimed there was official business associated with the trips.\n\"Should you use a helicopter to get there? Well, plainly that's outside community expectations,\" Mr Abbott said.\n'No holiday with public servants' Burke says As the major parties agree to a truce, Mr Abbott again declined to criticise shadow finance minister Tony Burke who, as environment minister in 2012, took his kids with him on a work trip to Uluru.\nMr Burke told reporters on Thursday that he had acted completely within the guidelines, which allow for some family travel, and he said he had asked the Finance Department to examine his expense history.\nMr Burke said he wanted to counter the view that the Uluru trip was a holiday rather than a work trip.\n\"You don't go on a holiday with the public servants from your department,\" he said, adding he largely only saw his kids in the evenings.\nThe prime minister is expected to appoint a businessman and two former federal politicians to help expedite the review to ne led by former Finance Department secretary David Tune and Remuneration Tribunal chief executive John Conde.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-06T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:03:38.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
