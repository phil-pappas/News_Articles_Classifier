Twenty-seven per cent said they were struggling to make ends meet, 46 per cent said they were living comfortably but didn't have enough money for extras. Only six per cent said they retired later than they planned.\nThe age when people retire in Canada is rising slowly but steadily. The average retirement age nationally has risen from was 62.1 years in 2010 to 63 years in 2014.\nHaving a comfortable retirement might be part of the Canadian dream but it can not necessarily be taken for granted.\nIn the Angus Reid survey 48 per cent of retired Canadians admitted to being worried about having enough money to last through their entire lives. And that angst also is shared by 74 per cent of Canadians who are not yet retired.\nResearch from Investors Group has found that 40 per cent of working Canadians between the ages of 45 and 64 believe they would not be able to cover their cost of living beyond five years if they unexpectedly had to retire tomorrow, including 16 per cent who said they would not be able to cover their costs for less than one year.\nThirty-six per cent of pre-retirees say they are worried they will not be able to live the retirement lifestyle they see themselves having at their current pace of saving and investing.\n\"When faced with sudden retirement your previous savings goals and payment plan fall by the wayside and a new strategy must be developed to reflect your current assets and opportunities to generate income,\" says Cottee. \"It is critical that those who are forced into an earlier-than- anticipated retirement adjust their financial plans to match the diminished number of employed years they had initially intended to ensure that they don't run through their retirement income too quickly.\"\nThe Investors Group survey found that 40 per cent of Canadians currently are working with a financial adviser to develop a financial plan and have a better grasp of their retirement plans than those who are doing it themselves. Fifty five per cent of Canadians aged 45 and older working with an adviser feel more prepared for retirement than the average person compared to 45 per cent who are doing the planning themselves.\n\"Sudden retirement may happen to you and it could occur at a time when you least expect it,\" says Cottee. \"In all likelihood you won't have the time to plan for it, save for it or prepare for it. A financial adviser can not only help you plan for the unexpected but also can work with you to adapt your financial plan in the event of an unanticipated retirement to ensure you are able to maximize what you have and make it last as long as you need it to.\"\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T18:26:54.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
