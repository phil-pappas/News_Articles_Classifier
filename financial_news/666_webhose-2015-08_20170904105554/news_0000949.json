Last month I wrote about the damaging and plummeting drop in the asset protection allowance (APA) in the Department of Education’s updated college financial aid formula.\nIn my previous post , Quote: :\nThe 2016-2017 update to the federal college aid formula that determines a student’s expected family contribution (EFC) toward the cost of college, using the FAFSA aid form, has been announced, and like recent years it penalizes middle class families even more. For families that save at all, the change in the formula has penalized them by almost $8,000 over four years of college, raising their out-of-pocket cost of college.\nWhile politicians laud their miniscule increases in Pell Grants and other hyped changes to college aid programs, their stealth updates to the college aid formula are wiping out aid gains for the middle class.\nThe so-called asset protection allowance (APA) is the amount of non-retirement assets, like savings and investments, that the formula allows parents to have without those assets being counted against a student for aid purposes. If you had a child entering college four years ago the asset protection allowance for a 45 year-old married parent was $41,300 for the 2012-2013 academic year. The recent update published in the Federal Register for the 2016-2017 academic year (when rising high school seniors will enter college), is only $6,300 (a paltry $3,600 if the parent is single).\nThat means the amount the government allows you to have saved without your savings impacting your child’s college aid eligibility has dropped a whopping 85% or $35,000 in just a four years. It is down to $6,300 from $28,200 last year. Since parent assets are counted at up to 5.64% for amounts over the asset protection allowance, this means that with $35,000 less in assets being shielded by the formula, this four-year change will now decrease a student’s aid eligibility by $1,974 per year. For families that save at all, the change in the formula penalizes them by almost $8,000 over four years of college, raising their out-of-pocket cost of college.\nBased on the DOE’s corrected asset protection allowance values as of August 3rd, 2015 , a 45-year-old parent’s asset protection is higher, at $17,400, but still ridiculously low. At $17,400, the corrected APA represents a 58% drop (from $41,300 four years ago) in the amount of savings that the aid formula protects. $23,900 per year less in parent savings will be sheltered by the aid formula compared to four years ago ($41,300 - $17,400 = $23,900). Since the aid formula counts assets at up to 5.64% of the value of the assets reported, that means that $23,900 more of a parent’s assets will be counted against the child at up to 5.64%, or $1,348.\nThat means that the child will have $1,348 per year less in aid eligibility, or about $5,391 over four years of college.\nIf students have to take out loans to cover this shortfall, it will add at least 20% more debt to their burden than what the average student leaves college with today, which is about $27,000 depending on which source you use.\nBut let me be very clear here, you should definitely still be saving as much as you can, and for almost all parents the best way to save for college is using a 529 college savings plan!\nTroy Onink is the CEO of Stratagee , a college planning consulting firm that helps parents determine their best strategy to pay for college.
