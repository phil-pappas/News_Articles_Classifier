You'd let the gold watch glint under the Florida sun. Now, retirement is a nebulous concept that has no universal definition, especially when you cross-examine 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-somethings, according to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies , with attitudes ranging from “cautious” to “committed” to “frazzled.” In many senses, it's a work-until-you-drop world , at least with many retirees taking on encore careers after they've officially left the workforce. \nRetirement isn’t a monolithic concept, in other words. it’s a moving target that’s as much about financial security as it is about personal identity. And yes, managing depression in retirement is often as big an issue as strategizing financial planning.

For others, because of their financial situation, they have to see so-called retirement as part of a work-life continuum. \nAccording to the report, American workers have added more legs to the “three-legged stool” of Social Security, employer pensions and personal savings in organizing possible sources of retirement income. Supporting the idea of a work-life continuum, 37% of respondents plan to, indeed, work after they leave “work,” and 23% hope to take advantage of defined benefit plans (whereby employers allocate some earnings to reward former employees based on years of service and other factors). Another 13% will dip into home equity for income, and a lucky 11% count on inheritances to stem the tide of expenses in their 60s, 70s and beyond. \n“More and more people in the workforce, based on our research, envision retirement as a transition as opposed to a specific moment when they stop working,” Collinson says—a transition from full- to part-time work, for instance, or seeking out opportunities that are less demanding and lucrative, but more personally satisfying. \nMaintaining some work obligations after retiring means that you can continue to draw a paycheck, which helps preserve whatever pre-retirement savings arrangements you’ve made. \n“Income and enjoyment become equal factors and motivations,\" Collinson says. \"As we continue to earn income, it enables us to continue saving, instead of dipping into savings, which can help our nest eggs last. The enjoyment factor also pays dividends—community, camaraderie, shared goals and feeling that you’re making a difference.” \nSo, what does this change look like? 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T17:48:18.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
