(AP) - About half of the 200 unionized stagehands who worked last month's Rolling Stones concert outside Buffalo are still waiting to get paid.\nOfficials with Local 10 of the International Association of Theater and Stage Engineers say the paychecks sent to some 100 union members have bounced. The stagehands set up and dismantled the extensive sets used by the Stones during the group's July 11 sold-out concert at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park.\nAEG Live, the concert's promoter, said it subcontracted the stagehand labor and payroll to a Long Island-based company. That company's accounts had been frozen, but on Tuesday a judge ordered them to be unfrozen.\nAEG said it's confident the situation is being corrected.\nMore coverage Dead & Company will haunt you again New checks are expected to be cut on Thursday and received by union members next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:13:54.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
