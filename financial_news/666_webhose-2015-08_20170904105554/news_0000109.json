Reuters by Vesna Poljak The commodities sector has been dealt a new blow by China sinking its currency, making resources such as iron ore and coal more expensive for Chinese buyers and hurting demand. A sell-off in mining stocks pushed the Australian sharemarket into correction territory.\nBHP Billiton shares were down 4.3 per cent to $25.20 on Wednesday, Rio Tinto lost 5.4 per cent to $51.65 and Fortescue Metals Group was down 8 per cent to $1.79. The losses added to a torrid year for the materials and energy sectors.\nThe huge weighting of resources stocks on the S&P/ASX 200 Index means the trend is negative for the whole market and consequently perceptions of Australia as a place to invest have taken a dive. The 1.7 per cent drop for the S&P/ASX 200 Index to 5,382.1 points means stocks have shed 10.04 per cent since April, putting the market into correction mode.\nWednesday's losses were not surprising to all fund managers in spite of the magnitude of the wipe-out. Karl Siegling​, chief executive of Cadence Asset Management, saw the bad news as consistent with the unwinding of the commodity boom which was not fully exhausted yet.\nCadence has short positions in Rio Tinto and Fortescue meaning the fund sees the prices of those stocks declining.\n\"We have no interest in buying stocks that are falling in price,\" Mr Siegling said. \"At the end of all of this there will be some survivors,\" but that point had not yet been reached.\nThe market's reaction to China's devaluation decision fuelled ongoing momentum behind selling of resources and energy stocks, but also according to Mr Siegling, would mean any asset denominated in a commodity currency such as the Australian dollar is vulnerable.\n\"Asset managers are having to get their assets out of countries like Australia,\" he said.\n \"As the earnings disappear under your feet, so does the currency move as well.\n\"To me it's all part of a longer term trend. With the iron ore stocks for example, we shouldn't forget that the iron ore spot price has fallen from $US160 to around $US50s and the longer term average for iron ore is around $US31 or lower,\" the fund manager said.\nAfter a 1.9 per cent devaluation on Tuesday, the People's Bank of China set the official currency peg lower again against the United States dollar on Wednesday, making a total devaluation this week of 3.4 per cent.\nA lower value Chinese currency makes the price of its exports more competitive against Japan and South Korea for example, but it also inflates the value of its external debts in an economy where credit is an enduring concern.\nGlobal growth The decision has been interpreted as a negative signal for global growth prospects because of uncertainty around how Chinese demand responds to higher prices for offshore goods. The US and Europe have been beneficiaries of booming Chinese demand during the post-crisis recovery years.\nThe Australian dollar, which is regarded as a proxy for Chinese growth, fell further on Wednesday. It was fetching US72.44¢, around a six-year low.\nChinese coal miners suddenly look more competitive. Demand for coal in China is regarded as being fairly elastic, in that there is already an oversupply of coking (for making steel) and thermal (for creating energy) leading to a slump in Chinese coal imports through 2015. The Newcastle thermal coal price for September delivery fell from $61.30 per tonne on Monday to $60.09 on Tuesday in response to the initial yuan devaluation.\nDalian iron ore futures for January delivery priced in renminbi went up by 2.4 per cent in early trading on Wednesday, reflecting the higher cost to buyers at the Chinese port. Iron ore and coal were Australia's two biggest exports in 2014.\nRaaz Bhuyan​, principal at WaveStone Capital, said it will be difficult to predict just how severe the yuan depreciation will become .\n\"Hard to second guess the timing of the renminbi reset by the government but all else being equal, it has introduced another element of risk into the market place,\" the fund manager said.\nMr Bhuyan sees markets as being on edge until the big event on the calendar - the window for an interest rise by the United States - comes into play.\nThe rates market took the view that China's devaluation reduces the chances of a Fed hike coming as soon as September. A higher value US dollar has a tightening effect on the world's biggest economy.\nThe People's Bank of China has made the case that the value of its currency should more closely reflect market forces in justifying the decision, supporting a view that China has inched towards floating the yuan.\nRay Attrill, National Australia Bank global co-head of foreign exchange strategy, said China would recover some of the competitiveness it had lost over the past year through the currency.\n\"Asian currencies have weakened 10 per cent on average against the Chinese currency the past 12 months. In a way I have a fair bit of sympathy for what China's done here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:12:38.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
