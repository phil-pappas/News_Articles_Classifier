It's the first significant fall in commodity's price since early July, when it traded as low as $US44.59. Since then, iron ore has traded in a relatively narrow range compared to the volatility it has experienced through the year.\nCopper for delivery in three months dropped 2.1 per cent to settle at $US4951 on the London Metal Exchange, after touching $US4855, the lowest since July 2009. On the Comex in New York, copper futures for December delivery lost 2.2 per cent to $US2.248 a pound.\nAll six main contracts traded on the London Metal Exchange declined, with nickel falling as much as 9.7 per cent.\nUnited States\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell into a correction for the first time since 2011 in one of the most volatile trading days ever, as a rout in global equity markets deepened. It was a day of wild swings as equities plunged at the open before staging a sharp rebound, with the Nasdaq 100 Index by midday nearly erasing a 9.8 per cent drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1000 points in the opening minutes of trading, and the S&P 500 tumbled 5.3 per cent and then pared declines before an afternoon wave of selling.\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose 44 per cent to 40.42, trimming an earlier 90 per cent surge that temporarily sent the index to its highest level since January 2009. The gauge known as the VIX more than doubled last week, soaring 118 per cent to 28.03.\nThe S&P 500's rout sent valuations tumbling. The price-to- earnings ratio for the gauge sank to 16.76, the lowest level since the October pullback. Then, the measure bottomed just above 16.50, the cheapest since January 2014.\nEurope\nEuropean stocks plunged on Monday, wiping hundreds of billions of euros off their value and sending one benchmark index to a seven-month low. Athens' market, already down, slumped 10.5 per cent.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 ended 5.4 per cent lower, wiping roughly 450 billion euros off its total market capitalisation - its worst daily closing performance since November 2008. The index was down 7.8 per cent at one point, its worst intraday loss since October 2008, just after the demise of US investment bank Lehman Brothers. It closed above those lows but remained on course for its worst monthly loss since 2002. More than a trillion euros of its market value has been lost since the start of the month.\nThe STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources Index, whose constituents are mostly mining stocks, fell 9.3 per cent and energy shares lost 8.1 per cent. China is one of the world's biggest users of metals and oil. In London, Glencore shed 13pc, Anglo American fell 9.9pc and BHP Billiton dropped 9.2pc. Rio Tinto ended 6.9pc lower.\nWhat happened yesterday\nThe Australian sharemarket suffered its worst day since the financial crisis, driven by fears that China's economy is slowing much faster than previously expected and will lead to slower global growth. The S&P/ASX 200 Index closed down 4.1 per cent at 5001 on Monday in the sharpest one-day sell-off since 2009, equivalent to a $57 billion loss of shareholder wealth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T05:21:31.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
