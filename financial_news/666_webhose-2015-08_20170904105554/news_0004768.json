By contrast, wages rose by an average of 2.4pc in the last 12 months, failing to keep pace with the property market. \nBuyers are increasingly looking to lock in low interest rates before the Bank of England acts to push up the cost of borrowing. \nThe average mortgage taken out to buy a home between April and June stood at £151,668, the MAB said. \nIf that is stretched over 25 years, the monthly repayment stands at £634. By contrast, spreading that over 30 years brings the monthly bill down by £83 to £551, and stretching it out to 35 cuts the regular cost again to just £493 per month. \nHowever, the longer time period also means interest accrues for longer, resulting in a bigger overall bill. \nThe 25-year loan would result in an overall interest payment of £91,385. Over 30 years that rises by £23,297 to £114,683. And a 35 year loan would come with a final interest bill of £139,092. \nBy contrast those already with houses are cashing in on the enormous equity gains they have received as house prices have shot up. \nThe proportion looking for a remortgage deal with a term of below 15 years has risen from 5pc to 8pc over the last year, while the proportion looking for a 15- to 24-year remortgage loan has risen from 9pc to 13pc. \nAt the longer end the number searching for a loan with a term of 25 to 29 years is down from 85pc to 76pc. \n“For those fortunate enough to own their home, it is unsurprising that they are looking to capitalise on the profit levied from record house prices by remortgaging,” said the MAB’s head of lending Brian Murphy. \n“Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) more so, they can get rid of their debt quicker and reap the benefits of smaller total repayments as homeowners can often access lower rates thanks to their equity gains.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T03:38:16.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
