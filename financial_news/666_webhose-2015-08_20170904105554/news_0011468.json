The Japan-based investment boutique pointed out, however, that Mr. Dorsey's announcement of his investment should be taken in context against a clear pattern in previous stock transactions that has seen him sell far more than he has bought. \"Mr. Dorsey's announcement may have had the effect in temporarily lifting the stock price but it also, unfortunately, tends to invite scrutiny of his transaction history. Looking closely at that history, Mr. Dorsey has sold shares worth $15 million since Twitter's IPO which makes the $875,000 he bought this week look rather paltry by comparison,\" added Rome.   neutral on Twitter citing headwinds facing the company as it struggles to clarify the point of its service to an audience that remains slightly confused as to why they need it.\"While we're not suggesting clients sell TWTR, we are waiting to see what progress is made with regard to a new CEO and user growth before taking advantage of the relatively low stock price,\" concluded Rome.About  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:39:33.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
