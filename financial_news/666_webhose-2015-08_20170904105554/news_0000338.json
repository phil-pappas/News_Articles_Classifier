Morrisons said the new product would offer its customers “the choice to support dairy farmers directly”. \nBut critics accused the retail giant of trying to “absolve itself of its responsibility to trade fairly” by passing the issue on to consumers and said if supermarkets wanted to engage in price wars over milk they should eat into their own profits, not farmers’. \nFarmers unions say that they currently receive as little as 22p to 24p per litre from supermarkets such as Morrisons and Asda well below the 28p cost of production. \nSome of their rivals including Sainsbury’s and Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) , which currently charge consumers £1 for four pints, do pay farmers a price that covers their costs but with the bulk of the market failing to do so, farmers say the industry is in crisis. \nMeurig Raymond, the National Farmers Union President, said the price farmers received from Morrisons’s standard milk was “unsustainable” and urged consumers to \"please search out the milk that is guaranteeing those farmers a fair price\". \nHe warned that farmers were “haemorrhaging” money and said more than 250 dairy farmers had already quit so far this year in the worst crisis he had ever seen for the industry . \nHe said surveys suggested that \"British consumers would be prepared to pay more so long as that money went back to the dairy farmers\". \nMr Raymond added: \"There has got to be something radically wrong in society when four pints of highly nutritious milk is worth less than a bottle of water . A lot of retailers have been using milk as a loss-leader to get footfall through the door. \n\"I would dearly love [Morrisons] to sell just the premium brand but it's not going to happen,\" he said. \nMorrisons, which buys its milk via cooperative Arla, declined to say how much farmers ultimately received for its standard milk or whether it believed the price was fair. \nKirsty Williams, a Lib Dem member of the Welsh Assembly who campaigns on farming issues, said: “My concern is it’s a token gesture. They should be ensuring that all the milk they purchase is purchased at a price that is sustainable for those who are producing. \n“I think it tries to absolve them of their responsibility that they have to trade fairly with British and in my case Welsh milk producers. \n“For whose benefit is this? Is it for Morrisons’ bottom line, or is it actually a genuine attempt to try to address the very dire situation our milk producers are facing? Is suspect it’s the first not the latter.” \nIf Morrisons wanted to sell milk at a loss it should cut into its own profits to fund it, she said. \nIt is understood farmers unions have further talks with Morrisons on Friday and hope they can persuade the supermarket to increase the price farmers are paid for their standard milk. \nRuth Mason, chief food chain adviser to the National Farmers’ Union, said that if Morrisons failed to do so, “you could argue it is them abdicating responsibility” because they were “not taking responsibility for the whole of their supply chain”. \n“We want Morrisons to be doing something over the bulk of their milk lines - this is just one line and it’s likely to be quite a small volume versus the main lines,” she said. The new line was a “step in the right direction but it doesn’t go far enough”. \nMartyn Jones, Morrisons corporate services director, said: “We recognise that the current market for liquid milk is impacting on hardworking dairy farmers and their families. We want to offer practical help by launching a range of 4-pint milk at a retail premium of 10p per litre, all of which will be passed back directly to dairy farmers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T01:33:07.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
