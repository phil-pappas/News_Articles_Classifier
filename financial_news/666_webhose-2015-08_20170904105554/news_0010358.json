But the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC fell 0.8 percent to 3,207.07.\nBoth indexes shed around 12 percent for the month, their third straight monthly decline, and have lost nearly 40 percent of their value since mid-June despite repeated and unprecedented measures by the government to shore up the market.\n\"A pull back in the market was to be expected as some investors are taking profits after the two-day rally,\" wrote Gerry Alfonso, director of Shenwan Hongyuan Securities, referring to a rebound on Thursday and Friday after ferocious selling earlier last week.\n\"Investors seem to be waiting until the manufacturing PMI figure is released later this week before making significant decisions.\"\nChina will release its official reading on August factory conditions on Tuesday, and economists polled by Reuters believe activity likely shrank at its fasted pace in three years. Similar surveys on service sector activity are also due.\nReflecting bearish market sentiment, Chinese fund managers cut their suggested stock allocation over the next three months to an eight-year low of 66.3 percent, a Reuters poll showed.\nBrokerages shares fell, led by CITIC Securities , after four senior executives from the brokerage confessed to insider trading.\nThe probe into CITIC Securities was part of regulators' latest crackdown on market malpractice.\nAn index tracking banking stocks reversed early losses to end the day up 3.1 percent.\nChinese state media announced a slew of confessions on Monday following investigations into recent stock market gyrations, including from a detained reporter who admitted to spreading false information that caused \"panic and disorder\".\nBut most analysts attribute the summer crash to the bursting of a typical stock market bubble which was earlier egged on by official media and fueled in large part by borrowed money.\n(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Pete Sweeney ; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:57:03.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
