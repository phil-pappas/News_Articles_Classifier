MICK SHAW\nowner, Port Stephens Mountain Bike Adventures\nHow did you get started as a cyclist?\nIn my teens and 20s, I used to race motorbikes, so cycling has always been a part of my fitness training. I've had a love of anything two wheels ever since I can remember. My wife and I lived in Switzerland for a few years, where everyone is cycling mad and I guess this rekindled my love of cycling. I worked in the UK as a racing instructor at the Bedford Autodrome​ before that, so when we moved back to Australia a few years ago with two small children, I wanted to do something active and outdoors combining two things I love – mountain biking and the spectacular scenery in the Port Stephens region. Hence, I started Port Stephens Mountain Bike Adventures.\nHow many bikes and how do you know when you have too many?\nI've currently got more than 10, but some I use for my mountain biking business. You can never have enough bikes. There's still plenty of room in the garage. My current mountain bike is a Specialized Stumpjumper Comp Carbon Hardtail​ and I have an old custom-made Teschner TT for getting the kilometres in out on the road.\nHow much did they cost?\nThe Teschner cost about $10,000 and I am fortunate to be a brand ambassador for Specialized, supported by Drift Bikes in Kotara, the local Specialized dealer for my mountain bike business.\n Kind of riding\nI do coastal and national park mountain bike tours and skills training sessions for beginners to advanced riders, mostly for visitors to Port Stephens as well as training and fitness rides for locals. Outside of the tours – and family time permitting – I usually get out for a good road ride each week and one or two decent mountain bike rides with two local mates who like to push the boundaries. I do the occasional Masters mountain bike race or charity bike ride.\nDo you stop at a stop sign if there is no one around?\nAlways. But these days I'm mostly riding in the bush, so no stop signs out there.\nTips to become a better rider\nTry to build up slowly and aim to do a little bit extra every month. Try to keep riding somewhere new to get outside your comfort zone and familiar tracks. Always have fun.\nKilometres a week\nI probably average between 150 and 300 kilometres per week, plus regular rides with my four-year-old daughter and her biking pals.\nMost like to go on a long ride with\nI always love to go exploring some new off-road mountain bike tracks with a few mates, but I'd love to spend a day on the cobbles with Tom Boonen​, an amazing Belgian stage racer, who at 193 centimetres is almost as tall as I am.\nFavourite refuel station\nNice at Nelson Bay for coffee and brunch and Little Beach Boathouse is a fave for lunch and dinner.\nFavourite cycling gear\nMy Specialized COBL-GOBL-R carbon seat post. Having had a crushed vertebrae, and being so tall, it saves my back.\nFavourite ride\nGenerally just anywhere new with some nice single track for a bit of off-road adventure. Somewhere you've never been before is always good because getting lost is part of the fun.\nCrashes? Catastrophes?\nI've had plenty of crashes, mostly on the road and I guess that's why I've favoured mountain biking as I'm getting older and have a family. Getting far too up close and personal with a caravan once certainly didn't end well. One of my most memorable moments was definitely watching and riding part of the way with my two crazy mates who completed an Everest climb up Mount Tomaree​ last year (8848 vertical metres in a single ride) in an amazing time (in the rain)!\nIf you could improve one thing about the world of cycling what would it be?\nI am passionate about the sustainable development of new quality mountain biking tracks in national parks and reserves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:08:08.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
