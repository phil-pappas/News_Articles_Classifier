Credit gouge .. a graphic from the Reserve Bank’s submission to the Senate credit card inquiry. Source: Supplied\nThat is up from borrowers paying interest had been only about 10.8 percentage points in 2008.\nWestpac makes no mention of this increase since then in its submission.\nAnd it chose not to respond to requests for comment yesterday.\nThe RBA said those who don’t pay off their balances each month are known as “revolvers”.\nThis group has more than its fair share of low-income households, the RBA submission shows.\nRevolvers are carrying with about two-thirds of Australia’s $51 billion worth of credit card debt.\nThe Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents credit unions and building societies, said in its submission that it was possible to get a credit card with an interest rate as low as 7.99 per cent. That Visa card is offered by Sydney-based Quay Credit Union. It comes with a six-month zero per cent balance transfer. Both the purchase rate and cash advance rates are 7.99 per cent.\n“There is no need for customers to be paying exorbitant interest rates,” COBA said.\nNAB submission said its cards offered “fair value”.\nCBA is expected to file a submission this week, as is ANZ.\nThe senate inquiry is due to have its first hearing in Sydney next week.\nThe inquiry was set up because of concerns that credit card rates have not responded to repeated cuts to the RBA cash rate, which has been falling since 2011.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/Credit_Card_Interest/Terms_of_Reference", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/westpac-is-using-statistics-to-plead-innocence-on-credit-card-interest-rates/story-fnagkbpv-1227490563068?sv=35315771dccd5265736a025de30e321&title=Banking+we%26%238217%3Bll+fall+for+the+spin", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Banking+we%26%238217%3Bll+fall+for+the+spin&c=THIS+represents+what+should+happen+to+the+noses+of+executives+at+a+certain+bank+after+it+twisted+statistics+to+hide+the+great+credit-card+gouge.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/westpac-is-using-statistics-to-plead-innocence-on-credit-card-interest-rates/story-fnagkbpv-1227490563068?sv=35315771dccd5265736a025de30e321", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/westpac-is-using-statistics-to-plead-innocence-on-credit-card-interest-rates/story-fnagkbpv-1227490563068?sv=35315771dccd5265736a025de30e321", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/westpac-is-using-statistics-to-plead-innocence-on-credit-card-interest-rates/story-fnagkbpv-1227490563068?sv=35315771dccd5265736a025de30e321&h=Banking+we%26%238217%3Bll+fall+for+the+spin", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/westpac-is-using-statistics-to-plead-innocence-on-credit-card-interest-rates/story-fnagkbpv-1227490563068?sv=35315771dccd5265736a025de30e321", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/westpac-is-using-statistics-to-plead-innocence-on-credit-card-interest-rates/story-fnagkbpv-1227490563068?sv=35315771dccd5265736a025de30e321&title=Banking+we%26%238217%3Bll+fall+for+the+spin"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:53:06.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
