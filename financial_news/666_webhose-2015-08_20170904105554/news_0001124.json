Erin Jonasson by Robert Harley The bad news for equities is good news for property – at least in the short term.\nThe surprise downgrades to supposed blue chips, and the wobbles of the small investor favourites like the banks , reinforce the seeming security of today's property, despite the low return. In the long term, property is not immune to the weaknesses in the broader economy.\nCorporate troubles show up in weaker underlying demand for commercial and residential property. And the selloff in the banks foreshadows tighter lending to real estate .\nSmall investors in particular need to be wary of investments that look good now but will not look so good when tenants move out, or debt costs rise.\nMorgan Stanley analyst, John Lee, noted the low risk of earnings downgrades among the REITS. But at the moment the real estate investment trusts (REITs), and in fact most forms of commercial property investment, are having their day in the sun.\nDEXUS Property Group chief executive Darren Steinberg told me on Wednesday that the REITs would show \"a really consistent performance\" which highlights their investment attraction, particularly to those heading to retirement.\n\"The distributions, critical to small investors, have already been fully disclosed. All the REITs in the ASX bar one – a small REIT caught with an industrial vacancy in Queensland – are delivering on target to the investors.\nThe response is reflected in the pricing. Over the past three months, as the broader ASX 200 lost 5.9 per cent, the REITs lost only 0.3 per cent. Over the month the REITs are in positive territory unlike the broader equities.\n Morgan Stanley analyst, John Lee, noted the low risk of earnings downgrades among the REITS.\n\"Our view is earnings will fall in line with guidance, albeit toward the top end if a guidance range has been provided, as office and retail fundamentals have improved steadily and residential conditions have remained buoyant since February,\" he wrote.\nAnd he is positive on the earnings outlook for financial year 2016 though he notes that it will be difficult to for 2016 guidance to exceed consensus estimates, currently around aiming for an increase of around 5.5 per cent.\n\"FY16 guidance could be a case of 'meets equals a beat',\" he wrote reflecting a low return world where delivering promised return is valued.\nLee does see clouds. The interest cost reductions are coming to an end, though DEXUS has forecast that its cost of debt will drop again in 2016. The velocity of housing price growth and turnover will likely slow and, here is a wild card, could there be a credit squeeze? Rising capital requirements will no doubt squeeze corporate lending margins, and the ol' \"let's break a swap and rebase our debt costs\", may no longer be so lucrative.\nAt the same time Lee, like most sees further upside for values, and thus to Net Tangible Asset backing and Net Asset Value, based on a sales like the Investa and GIC portfolios and, as Steinberg noted, further sales to come.\nIn fact one analyst quizzed DEXUS about its plans for revaluation, wondering whether the directors were comfortable trading at the current valuations. Steinberg draws a parallel between London and Sydney commercial property. In the UK, cap rates fell to 3-4 per cent, followed by strong growth in income.\nHe thinks the tightening in yields, with consequent rise in prices in the Sydney and Melbourne CBDs will be followed by increased income to owners. Today's graph reflects the view that vacancy will rise in the Sydney CBD next year as new towers are opened.\nrharley@afr.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:04:30.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
