The fees for all types of facilities will decrease in FY16 over the corresponding fees in FY15 due to an increase in the number of facilities that self-identified for FY16,” FDA further said.\nThe individual fee will be recalculated each fiscal year and that of 2016-17 will be adjusted for inflation and other factors, including the projected number of ANDAs and PAS based on experience.\nWhen an ANDA or PAS is refused in certain circumstances, a partial refund may be possible. If the reason for refusal is not related to failure to pay fees, then 75 per cent of the fee paid will be refunded to the applicant, the regulator said.\n 05, 2015 12:09 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:25:51.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
