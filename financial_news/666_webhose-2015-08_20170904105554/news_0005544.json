There is no such thing as sustainable mining,' she indicated. \nMs Kirabo called on African governments to stop the promotion of extraction which would not generate enormous income to put them in the league of the ‘developed world.' \nShe called for support for the growing food sovereignty movement to revive Africa’s diverse food systems and encourage resilience in the continent’s food system. \n'We support the strengthening of our diverse, ecologically adapted African food systems which have generated enormous diversity of crops on the continent,' Ms Kirabo said. \nShe entreated academics, religious and civil society leaders and social movements to join forces to campaign to boost the unique African heritage and stop the dumping of foreign systems and products in Africa. \n'As a network, we are committed to building community cohesion and resilience and ensuring that the communities we work with have a full understanding of the impact of extraction on ecosystems and their future options.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T03:51:44.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
