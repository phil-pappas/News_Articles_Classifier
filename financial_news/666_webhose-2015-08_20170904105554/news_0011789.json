Today’s decline marks the third largest this year with the sell-off now approaching the first region of key technical support at 1.5448/62. The immediate short-bias is at risk above this region with interim resistance seen at 1.5528 backed by our bearish invalidation level at the highlighted region into 1.5580. Bottom line: We’ll be looking for to sell rallies / short triggers while below weekly trendline resistance with a breach above needed to shift the focus back towards the 1.57-handle. A break below support this targets subsequent objectives at 1.5420 backed by the July low-day close at 1.5358 & 1.5331. A quarter of the daily average true range (ATR) yields profit targets of 28-31pips per scalp. Caution is warranted heading into US & UK event risk later this week with the release of the 2Q GDP revisions and ongoing commentary form the Jackson Hole Fed Symposium likely to fuel added volatility in USD & GBP crosses.
