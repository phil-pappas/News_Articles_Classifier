ADVERTISEMENT May’s number of job openings was the highest on record — marking the most job openings in a month since the government began tracking them in 2000.\nJob openings over the last year expanded for many industries, the report said, with the largest growth in professional and business services, healthcare and social assistance. By contrast, openings fell in mining and logging industries and in finance and insurance. \nThe monthly survey found 5.18 million people were hired in June, 2.75 million voluntarily quit their jobs and 1.79 million were laid off or discharged in June. \nThis comes after a positive jobs report last Friday, which said the economy added 215,000 jobs in July and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.3 percent.
