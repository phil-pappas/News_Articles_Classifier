Similarly with vehicles,\" Environment Minister Greg Hunt said on Melbourne radio.\nMr Hunt predicts that, out of a required cumulative reduction in emissions of 800 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2020 to 2030, about 50 million will come from more efficient cars.\nEncouraging energy-efficient fridges is supposed to deliver about a third of the reduction needed to meet the Abbott government's target. Fridge coolant switch He reckons Australia can save another 50 million tonnes by reducing the use in fridge cooling systems of ozone and hydro-fluorocarbon which are much more potent greenhouse gases than carbon. And another 150 million tonnes of emissions' reductions is supposed to come from energy-efficiency programs in the rest of the economy.\nTony Wood, energy policy director for the Grattan Institute, said that these programs were not costless and without concrete incentives and penalties they were unlikely to be enough to reach the 2030 target.\n\"The thing about energy efficiency is that if it pays for itself. People are already doing it,\" he said. \"People need an incentive to take up energy-efficient appliances faster.\" He said this would require something like a price on carbon.\n Rob Murray-Leach, a policy executive for the Energy Efficiency Council, said the proposed savings were achievable and would eventually pay for themselves. He said that businesses and households naturally shifted to more efficient technologies but the federal government would have to adopt much more \"aggressive\" policies to reach its targets.\nHe said that under the slogan of winding back red tape the Abbott government had scrapped the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act, which encouraged large energy users to improve their energy management practices.\n\"The government has a higher hill to climb because so far they've gone backwards on energy efficiency,\" he said.\nThe federal government's energy white paper this year set a target of using 40 per cent less energy per unit of gross domestic product by 2030. But it said that at the rate of the past two decades the improvement would be only 25 per cent.\nMr Murray-Leach said it wasn't clear whether reaching the 40 per cent target would deliver the reductions in carbon emissions on which the government is budgeting for 2030.\nHe said one of the highest priorities was to change the way electricity networks charged customers in order to increase the incentive to buy energy efficient appliances.\nHe said that too much of a household's electricity bill is based on fixed charges whereas networks should charge consumers more depending on the amount of power they use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:56:57.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
