The only difference is it is unencumbered by debts, which it conveniently left behind in the previous company, owing suppliers hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nHow anyone with any conscience can do this I do not know, but it's a practice that is all too common. The new entity is called a phoenix company, having risen from the ashes of the former corporation.\nIt makes my blood boil because directors of companies who do this have absolutely no regard for customers who have paid for goods and services they will never receive; suppliers left out of pocket, who sometimes fail as a result; and staff who are owed entitlements, including superannuation.\nSo I asked Ursula Hogben​, principal and general counsel of law firm LegalVision, about whether phoenix companies are legal and what protections there are for businesses that end up being owed money from a phoenix arrangement.\nAdvertisement She tells me the Australian Taxation Office has set up two groups, the Phoenix Taskforce and the Trust Taskforce, to investigate and combat phoenix businesses and the misuse of trust structures.\nShe also says there are three potential avenues for business or individuals that are owed money from a business that has become a phoenix company to seek recompense.\nThe first is under directors' duties obligations set out in the Corporations Act.\n\"When a director has engaged in phoenix activity, he or she is likely to have breached the Corporations Act, breaching the directors' duties to act for a proper purpose, not misuse information, and not misuse their position to cause detriment to the company – the previous company – or gain an advantage for themselves or someone else by establishing a new phoenix company,\" Ursula says.\n\"If a director breaches directors' duties, the court can impose penalties of up to $200,000 and extra compensation if there was a loss to the company,\" she says.\nThe second form of recourse open to victims of phoenix companies is under criminal laws.\n\"Some breaches of directors' duties amount to criminal offences,\" she says.\n\"These include reckless, dishonest or a fraudulent breach of the duty to act in good faith; directors using their positions or information to intentionally or recklessly cause damage to the company by gaining an advantage for themselves or for someone else; or insolvent trading if the director knew the company was insolvent and acted dishonestly.\"\nThe third form of recourse is through an Australian Securities and Investments Commission ban or disqualification.\n\"A director can be disqualified from managing a company for a period of time for certain reasons. The court will consider factors including their conduct, their character, the interests of the creditors and other people affected and the hardship to them or their family if they will be disqualified,\" Ursula says.\nThere are also other actions creditors can take.\nFor instance, Ursula notes that if the company trades while insolvent with the director's knowledge, individual creditors can bring legal action against the director for compensation for the amount of debt they are owed.\nThe commission can also obtain injunctive relief when a director is attempting to transfer assets from the original company to an associated company. It can stop the transfer of any assets by an order of the court before it goes ahead.\nLiquidators also have the power to challenge non-commercial transactions such as the previous company selling assets to a director, new company or other party, for a non-commercial price.\nHowever, the best way for businesses and individuals to protect themselves from falling victim to phoenix activities is to do diligence on the companies with which you interact BEFORE becoming a creditor.\nUrsula's advice is to research companies before doing business. This includes searching the ASIC Insolvency Notices website for insolvency and other notices and company deregistrations, to see if a company is being wound up.\nASIC Connect also has details about people who have been banned r disqualified from being a director.\nHave you been the victim of a phoenix company?
