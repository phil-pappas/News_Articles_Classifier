'China risk' has dampened hopes for a September rate hike and upcoming data could further chip away at expectations for a Fed tightening,\" said Junichi Ishikawa, market analyst at IG Securities in Tokyo.\nWhile trading was quiet early on Thursday, investors braced for the Chinese yuan's midpoint fixing around 0115 GMT.\nChina's surprise move on Tuesday has been of general benefit of the dollar but sent emerging market currencies and the Australian and New Zealand dollars into reverse.\nThe central bank continued to cause ripples the following day by again setting the yuan's midpoint significantly lower.\nThe focus fell on how much lower the PBOC would set the yuan midpoint on Wednesday, with the dollar expected to gain a breather should the authorities allow the Chinese currency to weaken significantly.\nThe Australian dollar was little changed at $0.7372 after bounce sharply from a six-year trough of $0.7217 struck overnight thanks to a bounce in prices of commodities mauled earlier in the week by China's currency move.\nThe New Zealand dollar was also mostly steady at $0.6615 after pulling away from six-year low of $0.6468 plumbed on Wednesday.
