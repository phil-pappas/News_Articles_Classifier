An increase could be in the cards, but the minutes of the Fed’s July meeting suggest that officials have wide-ranging views about taking that step and several notable sources of trepidation. The central bank has turned a wary eye to China , saying that “the possibility of adverse spillovers from slower economic growth in China raised some concerns.” Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury bonds rallied broadly yesterday upon news of the report, while a tumble in oil prices prompted investors to sell shares of energy companies , weighing on the broader stock market. And another fall in China’s stock market overnight looks set to produce more jitters in the U.S. today.\nThe Parent Trap Marine Le Pen’s quest to transform the French far-right National Front party from a fringe movement into a dominant force in European politics is hitting a fundamental obstacle: her father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen. Her success at the polls, however, ultimately hinges on whether the National Front can broaden its appeal to mainstream voters by removing the stain of World War II-era recriminations that have long made far-right parties taboo in Europe’s highest offices. That struggle is embodied in her tug of war with her father, a hero of Europe’s far right. Mr. Le Pen will appear before a National Front disciplinary hearing today to decide whether he should be expelled from the party.\nCan You Dig It? It’s getting dark down the mines. Glencore swung to a steep first-half loss , hit by price falls in the raw materials it extracts and lower profit from the trading business. Its debt, the largest among the big miners, is spooking investors , who worry the company may lose its investment-grade credit rating. The biggest mining companies have been hemorrhaging jobs as they downsize to cope with a prolonged China slowdown and a commodity-price slump. “Glencore set out to be different from all the other miners. That is proving precious little help,” notes our Heard on the Street London editor Helen Thomas . Meanwhile, one prominent law firm has an idea that may be music to the ears of companies like Glencore: end quarterly earnings reports .\nCheck That Bag Confusing differences in how airlines measure luggage can cause frustration for passengers checking in, our Middle Seat columnist Scott McCartney writes. Travelpro and other luggage makers say the industry practice in the U.S. is to size bags by the dimensions of the packing area without counting wheels and handles. But airlines count wheels and handles and have grown more strict about enforcing rules. Bag sizing has become a big issue since major airlines began charging to check them in seven years ago, prompting passengers to carry more stuff on to avoid fees. And, as airlines install more seats into jets , passengers increasingly compete for overhead bin space.\nTOP STORIES U.S. Chelsea Manning Given Restrictions for Prison-Rule Violations\nBush, Kasich Find Some Common Ground on Common Core\nWORLD The Greek Fisherman’s Lament\nNorth and South Korea Exchange Fire\nBUSINESS Valeant Nears $1 Billion Deal for Maker of Women’s Libido Drug\nAs Investors Circle, Organized Labor Moves Into Digital Media\nMARKETS Online Lender Social Finance’s Latest Fundraising Implies $4 Billion Valuation\nAsian Shares Fall Amid Cloudy Outlook on U.S. Rates, China Uncertainty\nToday’s Video Police Use of Cellphone Trackers Rises ENLARGE Cellphone tracking technology is getting cheaper, smaller and more accessible for police departments.

Never make more enemies than are absolutely necessary, and 2. Never let someone know you are his enemy if you can possibly avoid it.” James Hyland from Quote: : “The old adage ‘your reputation precedes you’ has never been more accurate in this age of social media. Leave as you came—with an eagerness for the next chapter in your career.” And Norman Blanton of Oklahoma shared the following: “I left a job of 17 years because of a change in management. I did the smiles and handshakes on my way out. But I did leave a ‘top ten list of reasons I was leaving’ in my desk for my co-workers to find. Hopefully it wasn’t shared with the new management, not that there was anything ugly in there.”\nThis daily briefing is named \"The 10-Point\" after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary \"What's News\" digest of top stories.
