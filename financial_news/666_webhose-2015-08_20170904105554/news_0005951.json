Photo: John Woudstra\nWhile investors focus on the challenges of China's painful economic adjustment, some listed Australian businesses are focusing on the opportunities to sell to the country's burgeoning middle class..\nThe accelerated devaluation of the yuan this week has shaken equity and currency markets as concerns re-emerge about China's economic slowdown and its loss of trade competitiveness.\nWhile Australian commodity exporters and those that compete directly with Chinese imports will be the immediate losers of the currency moves, the broader economic adjustment under way inside China continues to throw up new opportunities for smaller companies.\nCapilano's honey: Strict sanitary controls have added to the allure of Australian food n China. Photo: James Alcock\nBy devaluing its currency, say some, China is trying to offset the loss of competitiveness that comes with rising wages and the shift to more consumer-driven growth.\nThe flip side of this is that as the Chinese middle class expands, so too does demand for the sort of higher value-added food products and services such as healthcare, that Australia does well. Although currency shifts can go against small exporters as well, the higher profit margins help compensate.\nAustralia's free trade agreement with China, signed in June, has added impetus to what is already Australia's most important commercial relationship.\nAnd this is one of the reasons why UBS's funds investing in smaller listed companies include shares in such well-known names as Blackmores, which makes vitamins and supplements, honey-maker Capilano, health food group Freedom Foods and Sirtex, which has pioneered a breakthrough liver-cancer treatment.\nAccording to UBS's co-portfolio manager for Australian small companies, Victor Gomes, the potential revenue growth from pushing into the enormous Chinese market makes these companies, and others like them, attractive to investors.\nBlackmores in particular is already gaining a toehold in China via what is known as the grey market, which is exportation via individuals who buy the company's products in bulk from Australian pharmacies and ship them to the Shanghai free trade zone. From here they are sold on via T-Mall, which is part of internet giant Alibaba.\nChinese visitors to Australia can also turn a small profit carrying the vitamins back to China in their luggage.\nGomes first discovered the practice when he noticed that chemists in Sydney suburbs with large Chinese populations were constantly running out of Blackmores' stock. The trend has a parallel in baby formula, which was bought in bulk and imported via travellers' luggage after contaminated China-made formula resulted in fatalities.\nAustralia's strict sanitary controls and a series of fatal food contamination episodes in China over the years have added to the allure of Australian food.\n\"The Chinese are looking for these products; they don't trust their own products, and they want products that they think have integrity and reliability,\" says Gomes.\n\"This has meant that there has been an opportunity for individual Chinese to simply earn a dollar selling grey imports.\n\"In the case of Blackmores, essentially you've had the brand already built up in the country.\"\nWith distribution and marketing systems already in place in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, Blackmores will gradually set up sales channels in China, he says.\nFreedom Foods is already selling and marketing UHT milk in the country via a tie-up with the Chinese agribusiness giant New Hope Group.\nIn the meantime, China's free trade zones allow small-scale duty-free importation as a precursor to mass shipment and distribution.\nAlthough not all of the stocks in UBS's small stock portfolio are currently export-focused or able to leverage off the growth of China's and Asia's middle class, there will be opportunities across a wide range of industries. These include healthcare, aged care and financial services, where UBS is heavily invested.\nThe mix also includes media software and service group iSentia, pizza delivery franchise Domino's and Burson, the automotive parts group.\nAll of these meet the small cap team's criteria, including good cash flow, the capacity for sales growth and the prospect of improved margins over time.\nAnd the formula appears to be working, with UBS small caps funds easily outperforming both the ASX200 and Small Ords indices for most of the past 11 years, and particular since the pits of the global financial crisis.\n\"If you think about the Australian economy at the moment, it's really tough to find revenue growth out there,\" says Joel Fleming, who picks small companies for the funds.\n\"People are cutting costs and that's how they're trying to maintain their earnings or grow their earnings.\n\"But in small caps, you've often got cases where they're taking market share or growing into new markets,\" he says.\nTeam-mate Gomes says although small cap shares are considered high-risk assets, assembling the right portfolio of micro and small companies is almost like creating a blue-chip corporation.\n\"What you've done is that you've put a portfolio together of 30 to 40 small or micro cap companies, then you've actually synthetically created a large cap in a best of breed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T19:59:12.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
