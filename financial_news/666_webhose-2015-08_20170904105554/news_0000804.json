Photo: Supplied\nThe appeal of a good competition is perennial. Staging one via social media can be a low-cost way to promote your business brand, drive traffic to your website and boost inquiries and sales.\nSo what are the keys to doing it well in cyberspace?\nHere are some tips.\nProfessional design\nAdvertisement Want more people to stop, read and enter?\nInvest in the services of a graphic designer to create a clear, compelling and professional look for your contest, Mum Central and Australian Baby Bargains founder Belinda Jennings says.\nPast promotions on her Facebook pages have included a competition to become the Aldi toy tester, with the prize of a $350 toy bundle, which attracted 5500 entries in 10 days.\n\"Social media users are scrolling, scrolling, scrolling,\" Jennings says, and they'll bypass your competition in the blink of an eye, if it doesn't catch theirs immediately.\nGet the prize right\nGone already are the days of raffling off a random Apple device.\nToday's savvy competition hosts identify their target market and offer a prize that's relevant, and congruent with their own business image.\nDearest is not necessarily best, Jennings points out.\nFor some demographics, a $50 Coles voucher will appeal more than a designer handbag worth five times as much.\n\"What will tickle their fancy?\" Jennings asks.\n\"It's really important that you make a bit of hype, don't just give away a product. Put a bit of a spin on big giveaways.\"\nBig picture planning\nLike your contest to be more than a flash in the cyber-pan?\nTreat it as part of a greater marketing mix, not a stand-alone tactic to pique interest temporarily, says Joshua Strawczynski​, marketing director at Myguestlist, an agency which runs promotions for the hospitality sector.\n\"We've seen that customers with a thought-out engagement strategy, including email, text and social media, are the companies that turn competition entrants into loyal customers,\" Strawczynski says.\nFollow the rules\nMore market awareness, more customers: great outcomes for your business. Having your contest stopped or your social media account banned? Not so much.\nMake sure you don't run afoul of Facebook, Twitter et al, by boning up on their promotional guidelines before launch, Hello Social managing director Max Doyle cautions.\n\"Every social media platform has their own sets of rules you must adhere to but from personal experience, as long as you don't instigate spammy tactics or post inappropriate content, you should be fine,\" he says.\nGet app-y\nWant to simplify the process of running a contest and ensure it's easy for your fans and customers to enter? There's an app for that.\nLots of them in fact, Doyle says, and if you want your comp to run smoothly, you'll use one.\nSome of the most popular are Woobox for Facebook; SnapApp, which can be used to create competitions on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Pinterest; and Wishpond, which works across Facebook and Twitter, Doyle says.\nTesting, 1, 2, 3 . . .\nThink you're ready to go full steam ahead?\nNot so fast, cautions Buderim Ginger group marketing manager Jacqui Price, who presided over the manufacturer's hugely popular Australia's Hottest Ginger contest.\nLaunched last October, it attracted 2500 entries and 300,000 votes across social media; statistics vastly in excess of the 300 entrants and 3000 votes expected.\nCheck you have the right infrastructure in place for your contest to run smoothly before going live, Price says.\n\"It's very hard to backtrack once it's out there . . . Do lots of quality testing beforehand; get your platform right.\"\nRinse and repeat\nSo your competition was a big success?\nThen it's time to start planning the next one, says Jamie Radcliffe, the owner of Edwards Tavern in Wodonga in country Victoria, whose first Facebook contest offering two flights to Thailand went off like a rocket in March.\nEntrants were required to become members of the Tavern, like its Facebook page and tag the person they would take with them on holiday. The contest generated 154 new memberships and a spike in sales and bookings.\nRadcliffe plans to run a similar contest, with a major prize – \"you've got to put on something decent for them; the days of putting up a couples of slabs are gone\" – every three months.\n\"You've got to be proactive with it and keep going,\" he says.\nHas your business run a social media contest?
