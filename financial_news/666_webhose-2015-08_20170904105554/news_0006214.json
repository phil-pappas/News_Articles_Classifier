The carrier partly attributed the losses partly to a foreign exchange (Forex) loss of MYR28 million, compared to a Forex gain of MYR20 million in the year-ago quarter.\nThe airline said the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) had depreciated 13% year-on-year against the US dollar in 2Q 2015. It pointed out that every MYR0.10 movement in the exchange rate resulted in either savings or expenses of approximately MYR50 million per annum for the company.\nSecond-quarter revenue was down 3% year-on-year to MYR653 million, largely due to a 16% drop in scheduled flight revenue and a 24% decline in ancillary revenues. This was caused by the lower load factor resulting from a hiatus in marketing activities, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea, and the massive earthquake in Nepal.\nThe number of passengers carried in the second quarter was down 20% to 810,944, while ASKs decreased 9% to 5.7 billion. RPKs fell 23% to 3.9 billion and load factor was down 12 percentage points to 68%.\nHowever, revenue per ASK (RASK) increased 7% in the second quarter while unit cost per ASK (CASK) increased 5%, helping AirAsia X reduce its operating loss by 14% to MYR100 million from RM116 million in the year-ago period. Much of that improvement can be attributed to lower operating expenses, and particularly to a 44% year-on-year decline in fuel costs. However, this was offset by increased aircraft rental and maintenance costs for an additional eight aircraft leased since 2Q 2014.\nIntensifying sales\nAirAsia X said that, in an effort to reduce the foreign exchange impact, it would be intensifying sales in markets where the currency was stronger, such as the Australian dollar, to offset US dollar bills.\nAirAsia X Group CEO Datuk Kamaruddin Meranun said the carrier had “expected to see some setback” in the first half of the year as marketing activities were halted, but this had been compounded by “unforeseen external factors,” such as MERS and the Nepal earthquake. In addition, there were also “ remnants of irrational competition during the quarter,” he said.\n“We’ve seen a return of business in the third quarter onward, as forward bookings for the second half are promising,” Meranun said. “We are optimistic of reaching a turnaround this year as we’ve set ourselves the task of getting AirAsia X to a better financial footing.”\nSubsidiaries on track\nAirAsia X associate Thailand AirAsia X (TAAX) reported a 72% load factor, hit by the MERS outbreak in Korea and ICAO’s red flag warnings about aviation safety oversight in Thailand.\nDespite these “temporary hiccups,” Meranun said “TAAX continues to see positive forward sales.”\nHe said Indonesia AirAsia X (IAAX) was “expanding steadily and is on track for turnaround in 2016.”\nAirAsia X Acting CEO Benyamin Ismail said: “We were operating in a challenging environment both internally and externally in the first half of the year and it was some of the toughest conditions AirAsia X has ever seen. We have been working diligently for the past months and it’s starting to show positive outcome with promising forward booking trends. The company’s yields continue to look positive for the second half as excessive capacity has been consolidated industry-wide, allowing us to compete in a much rationalized environment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T07:22:20.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
