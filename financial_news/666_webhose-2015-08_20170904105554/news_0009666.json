And for that, there should be no restriction of goods produced within East Africa.\" \nMr Sezibera also revealed that the East Africa Legislative Assembly (Eala) has passed a law that requires a member country subjected to non-tariff barriers (NTBs) by another member state to be compensated. Something any of the aggrieved members can resort to once the regional head of states assent to it. \nHe said: \"Restriction of movement of goods (among them sugar) is a barrier to trade and in future, Uganda could seek compensation for that and so can any other EAC country whose goods are blocked from entering another country within the bloc.\" \nKenyan opposition politicians have seriously criticised the trade deals president Uhuru Kenyatta struck in Kampala following his three-day state visit early in the month. \nFormer prime minister Raila Odinga, who started the contention, believes the deal between the two neighbouring countries is not only bad for Kenya's economy but will also see thousands of farmers, who derive livelihood from sugarcane growing, lose their livelihood. \nIn response, president Uhuru Kenyatta has defended the move, saying it is good for regional integration. \nIn one of his responses on the issue, President Uhuru said: \"We would rather import sugar from Uganda than Brazil so as to support our own and promote the region integration.\" \nTit bits about sugar production \nTrade. Uganda imports goods worth $700m (Shs2.4 trillion) from Kenya, compared to exports worth $180m (Shs631b) to Kenya annually. \nFree trade. Common Market protocol signed by all the EAC member states allows each member state to export freely to each other's market. \nUganda's surplus. Uganda produces about 465,000 metric tonnes of sugar against a consumption of 320,000 metric tonnes, leaving it with a 145,000-tonne surplus.Kenya's deficit. Kenya produces an average of 600,000 metric tonnes, consumes 800, 000 - 850,000 metric tonnes. That's a deficit of between 250,000 or 200,000 metric tonnes which must be plugged by imports. Kenya produced only 590,000 tonnes of sugar last year. \nDuty free. Kenya's duty free sugar (the 200,000 tonne quota) is supposed to come exclusively from Comesa states. Anything from outside Comesa attracts punitive tariff of 75 per cent.
