Either the fund aims narrowly in that range or else it’s a broad-market index fund (covering all maturities) and winds up with a mid-range average duration by default.BlackRock, a cost laggard with its emerging market stock fund, is the cost winner in broad-market bonds. Its iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond fund ( AGG ) is $30 cheaper over ten years than the similar item from Vanguard, Total Bond Market ( BND ).AGG’s expense ratio is a tad higher than BND’s. How does it win the cost race? By lending out some of the bonds to short-sellers, market makers and arbitragers for a fee. The resulting income lightens the expense burden by 2.8 basis points. Securities lending is one of the strong suits at BlackRock, which sits on $4.7 trillion of assets.Schwab has an attractive bond fund to compete with BND and AGG, U.S. Aggregate Bond ( SCHZ ). Despite its small asset base it lands a cost number only a hair above AGG’s.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 AGG iShares Core US Aggregate Bond 25,467 0.08 86 SCHZ Schwab US Aggregate Bond 1,644 0.05 88 BND Vanguard Total Bond Market 26,419 0.07 116 SCHR Schwab Intermediate-Term US Trs 347 0.09 161 BIV Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond 6,132 0.1 169 LAG SPDR Barclays Aggregate Bond 991 0.1 172 GOVT iShares Core US Treasury Bond 1,349 0.15 190 VCIT Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corp Bd 5,437 0.12 206 VGIT Vanguard Intermediate-Term Govt Bd 349 0.12 208 VMBS Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities 1,467 0.12 210 IEI iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond 5,252 0.15 210 ITR SPDR Barclays Interm Term Corp Bd 772 0.12 212 CRED iShares Core US Credit Bond 892 0.15 235 ITE SPDR Barclays Intermediate Term Trs 337 0.1 239 IBDC iShares iBonds Mar 2020 Corporate 68 0.1 251 GVI iShares Interm Government/Credit Bd 1,830 0.2 260 IBCD iShares iBonds Mar 2020 Corp ex-Fincls 54 0.1 294 AGZ iShares Agency Bond 425 0.2 304 GBF iShares Government/Credit Bond 135 0.2 305 IUSB iShares Core Total USD Bond Market 410 0.15 307 QLTA iShares Aaa - A Rated Corporate Bond 385 0.15 328 GNMA iShares Core GNMA Bond 60 0.15 331 CIU iShares Intermediate Credit Bond 6,302 0.2 339 BSCL Guggenheim BulletShrs2021 Corp Bd 171 0.24 412 BSCJ Guggenheim BulletShrs2019 Corp Bd 360 0.25 418 BSCK Guggenheim BulletShrs2020 Corp Bd 346 0.25 425 BSCM Guggenheim BulletShrs2022 Corp Bd 179 0.25 431 MBB iShares MBS 7,198 0.27 442 CMBS iShares CMBS 182 0.25 470 MBG SPDR Barclays Mortgage Backed Bond 151 0.29 499 QLTB iShares Baa - Ba Rated Corporate Bond 81 0.3 543 JNK SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond 9,924 0.4 644 SJNK SPDR Barclays Short Term Hi Yld Bd 3,961 0.4 645 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
