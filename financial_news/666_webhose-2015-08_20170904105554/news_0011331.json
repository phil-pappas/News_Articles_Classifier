So it's too little, too late,\" Mercy for Animals President Nathan Runkle told the news conference. He said the farm typically housed over 120,000 chickens.\nMcDonald's announced earlier this year it would phase out its use of chickens raised with certain kinds of antibiotics at its 14,000 U.S. restaurants as part of a major restructuring plan to reverse a long sales slump.
