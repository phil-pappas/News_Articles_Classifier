'now we are all experiencing healthy industrial competition among the over 80 OMCs'. \nThe National Petroleum Authority (NPA) on June 16, issued a statement which was signed by the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Moses Asaga, announcing the first process towards the implementation of the petroleum product price deregulation. \nThe price was increased by four per cent on June 16; and on July 2 increased by 15 per cent but on July 16, the price was reduced by 14 per cent. \nAccording to NPA, the implementation of the first stage of price deregulation would continue into subsequent pricing windows while the Authority reviews the existing legal framework of petroleum products, pricing towards a smooth implementation of the full steps of petroleum products price deregulation in Ghana. \nThe OMCs are also under obligations to display their ex-pump prices at their retail outlets, to allow the NPA monitor 'the application of the Prescribed Petroleum Pricing Formula, to ensure that all petroleum service providers apply the formula in the right way defaulters would be duly sanctioned'. \nThe NPA has subsequently directed OMC and LPG Marketing Companies (LPGMCs) to submit their indicative ex-pump prices to NPA two days before every pricing window. \nThe indicative ex-pump prices submitted by an OMC or LPGMC would represent its maximum indicative price for the two week period - first to 15 and 16 to the end of the month. \nIn a directive to the OMCs, Bulk Oil Distributing Companies and other industrial stakeholders signed by Mr Jacob Amuah, NPA Technical Director for the Chief Executive and copied to the Ghana News Agency in Accra said. \nThe directive tagged: 'Interim Guidelines for Petroleum Service Providers under-price deregulation,' tasked service providers to adhere strictly to the guidelines to ensure effective transition and smooth implementation of the price liberalisation regime. \nThe NPA directives also warned Petroleum Service Providers that they cannot price its ex-refinery or ex-pump price higher than the maximum indicative price set for a specific pricing window. \n'However, it can revise its ex-pump prices downward within the pricing window if the Petroleum Service Provider chooses,' the statement stated. \nThe NPA also direct all Petroleum Service Providers to ensure that ex-pump prices of products remains the same at all its retail outlets throughout the country at any given particular period. \n'By implication an OMC or LPGMA's ex-pump price at any given time must not vary at any of its outlets across the country irrespective of the geographical location,' the statement said. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:06:58.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
