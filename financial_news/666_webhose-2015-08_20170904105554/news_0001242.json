When the rule goes into effect in 2017, shareholders will get a clear view of what corporate executives bring in each year compared to their rank-and-file employees. More Headlines \n\"It's going to be ugly,\" said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance and a professor at the University of Delaware. \"If it wasn't ugly, no one would object to it.\" \nMany of the figures already available on CEO-to-worker pay ratios are pretty shocking. \nAccording to executive compensation and governance data provider Equilar, median CEO pay for the S&P 500 hit $10.3 million and for the leaders of S&P 1500 companies reached $5.3 million in 2014. Meanwhile, median employee income for full-time wage and salary workers in the U.S. was $41,132. \nThe Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington, DC, estimated the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio among the largest 350 publicly-owned companies in the United States to be 303-to-1 in 2014. According to the AFL-CIO , it is 373-to-1 among the largest companies. \nSome, however, say pay ratio figures are exaggerated because they deal with such small sample sizes. \n\"It is a really distorted comparison, because it is such a small number,\" said Mark Perry, professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan's Flint campus and scholar at center-right leaning think tank the American Enterprise Institute. \nHe believes the actual CEO-to-worker pay ratio to be low as 4-to-1 when considering all U.S. chief executives as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even among the biggest 100 U.S. companies, he argues that the average ratio is 84-to-1, based on data from a 2013 analysis from PayScale. \nOthers say pay ratio figures may be higher, due in part to a reliance on international workforces. \nDean Baker, co-director of the Washington, DC-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, performed an analysis with the The New York Times in April of the pay ratios of a dozen executives. He found some ratios to be in the thousands. \n\"The hard part is getting a good sense of what the median pay is. There's a number of places where we can get CEO pay, sometimes from their own reporting,\" he told TheStreet . \"We tried to make a judgment on worldwide ratios, and they will almost invariably be lower. If a company has positions in Europe, it doesn't change the story that much, because pay scales aren't necessarily lower. In fact, they can be higher, in many cases, than in the U.S. But many large companies, of course, have operations in the developing world, and then when you bring those in, then their median employee would either be a high-paid person in a developing country or maybe one of the very lowest-paid people in the United States.\" \nCompensation information company PayScale has put together its own list of CEO-to-worker pay ratios based on data from 2013. It compares only cash compensation executives because, as PayScale research analyst Katie Bardaro told TheStreet , including equity data wouldn't be \"apples to apples.\" \nSo which CEOs are on the high-end of the pay ratio scale when compared to their workers? Here is a look at 10 from PayScale's list, in order of ascending CEO-to-worker pay ratio. \n10. Randall Stephenson, 100:1 \nAT&T brought in a record $128.8 billion in consolidated revenue in 2013. Its workers made a median $71,300 that year, and its chief executive, Randall Stephenson, made about 100 times more, earning $7.2 million in cash. \nIncluding stock and option awards as well as change in pension value, Stephenson's total compensation reached $23.2 million in 2013. In 2014, it increased to $24.0 million. \nAT&T representatives declined to comment. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T01:45:54.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
