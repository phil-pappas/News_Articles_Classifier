Although Barnett said he attempted to explain to them that he was a business owner and needed to conduct presentations for Fortune 500 executives, the rental companies would not budge. In the end, he wound up taking cabs, which was also costly. \n“Even though I was clearly a responsible person, because I was under 25 they could not rent me the car without a ridiculous deposit, even though I was meeting with high profile CEOs,” he said.
