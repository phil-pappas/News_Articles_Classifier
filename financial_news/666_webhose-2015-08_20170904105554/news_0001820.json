Reuters Share on twitter by Philip Baker Financial markets, prone as they are to the odd hissy fit, are generally pretty good at sniffing out any economic change. But heading into the last three major rate hike cycles in the United States, they have made the mistake of underestimating how high the federal funds rate can go.\nWhat are the odds for a fourth time?\nWell, maybe not, after the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart caught markets on the hop when he said economic data between now and next month, when the Fed meets, would have to really deteriorate for there not to be a rate hike.\nThat's in contrast to traders and most investors who have been of the mindset that the Fed would need to see much better economic data to justify a hike.\nNot so now.\nIt would certainly suit the Reserve Bank of Australia if the Fed meeting next month produced the first rate hike in nine years as the US dollar would march higher and the Australian dollar lower.\nOn Wednesday the $A was battling hard against the greenback following the RBA's decision to keep rates on hold and upbeat commentary .\nLockhart thinks the economic data is strong enough already so rather than a case of whether the Fed should go or not, it's a question of why wouldn't it.\n \"I think there is a high bar right now to not acting, speaking for myself,\" Lockhart said in an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal .\nLockhart is known for being a good gauge of the what the Fed is thinking because he usually toes the Fed line and rarely has an outlier type of view.\nNot quite ready But a rate hike so soon is not quite priced in.\nFurthermore, the implied rate of the futures contract for the Feds fund rate shows that it might rise by around 1 per cent by 2016, compared to the latest median projection of Federal Open Market Committee participants of 1.625 per cent.\nFor all the talk about rate hikes from the Fed and getting markets prepared, it can often be the case that traders only really act when the news is on the screen in front of them.\nThe Fed hiking is also at odds with the rest of the globe where growth is still very low and for that reason other central banks will keep monetary policy at record lows.\nOne potential concern for Wall Street is a spike in wages although it doesn't look like a concern right now. That's why the job numbers are so important and the latest report is released on Friday night.\nIf the robust labour market leads to wage growth, US equities would have to keep rising against the Fed hiking rates and declining profit margins.\nWith earnings per share growth of 7.5 per cent expected over the next 12 months, that might make it hard for Wall Street to keep breaking records.\nAccording to Perpetual, within two years higher interest rates have killed off four bull markets over the past 10 cycles of rate hikes.\nThe worry is if the Fed starts next month it may be too early, and it comes as valuations are stretched and the bull market is in its seventh year.\nThe price-earnings ratio of the US sharemarket is just under 18 times earnings. On average over the past 10 rate hike cycles it has been lower at 17.3 times.\nStill, it has been higher. The P/E was 18.3 times in 1972 when rates started to rise and 27.5 times in 1999.\nAnalysts such as Perpetual's Matthew Sherwood are also worried about the narrow rally in the US, the gains being driven by just a handful of stocks.\n\"Against this backdrop investors need to ask one simple question: are you confident that the market is ready for the first rise in US rates in the past nine years, given that some of the largest losses in history occur when optimism is high, valuations are elevated and EPS is moderating?\" asked Sherwood.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/atlanta-feds-lockhart-fed-is-close-to-being-ready-to-raise-short-term-rates-1438709252"], "published": "2015-08-05T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:12:38.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
