It was the worst reading since October 2009 and the 40th straight month of price decline. \nFalling producer prices are worrying because they eat into the profits of miners and manufacturers and raise the burden of their debts. China's corporate debt stands at 160 percent of gross domestic product, twice that of the United States, according to a Thomson Reuters study of over 1,400 firms. \nIn line with the sluggish economy, annual consumer inflation remained muted at 1.6 percent despite surging pork prices, in line with forecasts and slightly higher than June's 1.4 percent. \nCHALLENGING SECOND-HALF \nA cooling housing market, uneven exports and weak investment have cooled annual economic growth, which will be slowest in a quarter of a century even if it hits Beijing's target this year. \nA strong yuan policy - designed in part to support domestic consumption and help Chinese firms to borrow and invest abroad - is hurting exporters. Trade data on Saturday showed depressed demand from Europe and the first drop in exports to the United States, China's biggest market, since March. \nChinese firms have laid off workers for 21 consecutive months as they slash prices to a six-month low to attract customers, an official survey showed this month. \nChina's turbulent stock markets, which have fallen by almost a third since peaking in June, also add a new sense of urgency for top officials as they try to ensure a stable financial system can fund Beijing's efforts to rekindle economic growth. \nYet, even the central bank has warned that looser policy may not be effective in lessening the pain felt by companies. \nCompanies are holding back on spending amid a reluctance by banks to lend due to rising bad debts. \n\"Maintaining a growth rate of 7 percent in the second half of the year will be a challenge,\" ANZ Bank said in a note at the weekend. \"Monetary policy will need to become more supportive.\" \n(Editing by Mark Bendeich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:04:02.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
