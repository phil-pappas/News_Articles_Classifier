AXP, +6.29% according to a person familiar with the matter, the latest example of an activist investor targeting a blue-chip firm.\nIt isn’t clear at this point if San Francisco-based ValueAct plans to agitate for changes at the big New York-based card company, which has been led by Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault since 2001.\n“ValueAct is a well-respected firm,” AmEx said in a statement. “We have been speaking with them, as we do with other investors, and look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue. At American Express, we are focused on building long-term value for shareholders, and are always open to the views and perspectives of our investors.”\nAmEx has seen its stock price fall 13% this year due to two high-profile losses that are expected to take a big bite out of earnings for at least the next year. The move by ValueAct, first reported by Bloomberg, sent shares of AmEx up more than 6%, to $79.72, on the New York Stock Exchange.\nValueAct’s position is the latest example of activist investors gravitating up the corporate food chain toward larger targets. So far this year, activists have emerged in 17 companies with market capitalizations over $10 billion at the time, a year-to-date record and more than double the year-to-date average during the previous nine years, according to FactSet SharkWatch.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/valueact-capital-takes-1-billion-stake-in-american-express-1438977064"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T11:03:05.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
