FBI spokeswoman Deb Green told the newspaper that it would not be appropriate to comment at this time. \nSmith said the bank meets all standards to qualify as well-capitalized and has enough capital to withstand the theft. He noted that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits of up to $250,000. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
