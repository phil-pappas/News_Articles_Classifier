Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest single exporter of crude, was the main catalyst behind this strategy, but it has become increasingly apparent that the oil industry in North America was not the main target of this plan. \nInstead, Saudi Arabia appears to have used its “barrels” to seize more market share from its rivals within Opec rather than those outside. Although the number of drilling rigs in the US has fallen sharply over the last year, production has not declined. US output climbed 8.8pc last month to 9.52m bpd, its fastest pace of growth since the Twenties. \nRussia, the other major international rival to Opec has also managed to cope with lower prices better than most. Fields in Russia are now expected to produce around 11m bpd of crude on average this year and Moscow appears ready to endure prices at between $30 and $40 per barrel for a prolonged period. \nLast November, Saudi Arabia’s wily old oil minister, Ali al Naimi, made the case to Opec’s other members that the group, which controls a third of world supply, could no longer afford to ignore the boom in US shale oil or allow Russia to continue taking market share. Many of his counterparts within Opec such as Venezuela, Algeria and Iran, were sceptical. They wanted Opec to do what it had always done when faced with competition and tough market conditions. Only Opec acting collectively by cutting production to eliminate the spare capacity that had built up in the system would restore prices to levels around $80 per barrel or higher. \nBut for this to happen, Saudi Arabia which accounts for a third of Opec’s capacity would have had to make the majority of cuts to its own production. This would have resulted in the kingdom losing more market share to its rivals beyond and within Opec. \nThe meeting ended in acrimony with none of the participants particularly happy about the outcome except, that is, Mr Naimi. He had insisted that oil prices would eventually be revived once excess production had been knocked out of the system and for that to happen Opec had to keep producing at its current target level. \nThe strategy might have worked if Opec wasn’t fighting amongst itself as much as with its rivals outside the group. Saudi Arabia has opened up its own spigots regardless of the financial turmoil this has caused poorer members of Opec. \nInstead of taking on US shale it appears that the real battle is being waged within the group, which is now deeply divided over what action to take with prices heading towards $40 per barrel. The kingdom, backed up by its close Gulf allies, is pumping record volumes of crude despite the market being oversupplied by as much as 2m bpd. Combined with Saudi Arabia, the Gulf quartet of the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait, now account for just over 18m bpd of Opec’s total supply. This has left no room for Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela, Algeria and Libya to increase output to compensate for falling revenues if they want to comply with the group’s existing target. \nOutside Saudi Arabia’s clique only Iraq, which is not expected to comply with Opec’s target, has boosted output significantly. Baghdad is now producing over 4m bpd and wants to add another 1m bpd to capacity in the next few years. Then there is Iran. \nTehran’s power within Opec has been diminished over the past five years due to economic sanctions, which have restricted its oil industry. However, the agreement between world powers and Iran this summer to lift sanctions could result in more oil flowing into an already flooded market. Iran wants to increase output by about 1m bpd to 4m bpd in the next year or two. \nHowever, Opec will have to make room for the Iranian barrels if it wants to maintain a semblance of unity and Saudi Arabia is unlikely to rein in its own production for the economic benefit of its main political rivals in the Middle East . Instead of waging a price war against US shale drillers and Russia, Saudi Arabia has effectively orchestrated a strategy that is now tearing Opec apart from within. \nVenezuela, Iran, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria and Iraq are now all agitating behind the scenes for an emergency meeting and insiders say that some within the group are “fed up” with Saudi Arabia’s actions. Opec’s secretary general, Abdulla Salem el-Badri, has made Riyadh aware of the severe strain that other members of Opec are now under , but it remains to be seen whether Mr Naimi will listen. \nIf he wants to maintain Opec in its current form then he should. \nThe danger is that Opec fragments further and ceases to have any global relevance with all its members acting entirely in their own self interest. Some critics will argue that this point has already been reached and that the Vienna-based institution no longer has a viable role to play in world markets. \nOf course for many especially in the US who have argued that Opec is a price-fixing cartel, interested only in maintaining oil prices at $100 per barrel, its possible demise is a good thing. \nSaudi Arabia needs to start listening to other voices at the Opec table and agree to an emergency meeting or watch the group, founded in 1960, fall apart and be consigned to history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:56:03.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
