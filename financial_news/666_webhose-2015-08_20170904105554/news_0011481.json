A similar uncertainty stalks trading floors around the world and it can make already volatile price movements even worse. \nThe FTSE 100 in London has this week broken records for one-day swings that were set during the throes of the eurozone crisis. Dramatic rises and falls in the markets are evaporating within minutes and each day seems to bring a different driver of instability, along with ominous-looking pictures of red and green trading screens. \nBut what do traders mean when they talk about volatility in the markets? Let's start at the beginning. \n= What is volatility? = \nAt its simplest, the price of any asset will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. This price can change if, for example, a big seller enters the market, increasing supply and signalling to everyone else that someone is trying to get shot of something. \nPrices can be affected by having too many buyers or sellers on one side, or even a lack of buyers and sellers, as the ones who are left might have very different views on what the asset is worth. This means that if a trade does take place, it will skew the current asking price very quickly. This is also described as a \"lack of liquidity\" in the market. \nThen there are the “technical” traders, who buy and sell based on stocks hitting particular levels. The success of trading on these tactics is up for debate. However, if enough market participants expect lots of buying or selling at a certain price, then it'll move the market price anyway. \nIn sum, the more dramatically prices rise and fall, the more volatile the market. \n= How can we measure volatility? = \nOne way to see volatility in action is to watch how quickly prices are rising and falling on the market. The FTSE 100, an amalgamation of share prices in the biggest London companies, rose by a total of 182 points on Tuesday, or the biggest one-day points gain since 2013. So this is what a volatile few days looks like: \nYou can also measure how many quotes for trades there are at a given moment. Here is the same period but with the number of quotes for trades coming through every three minutes: \nAnother way to measure volatility is to use an index based on some of these factors. The CBOE Vix is the best known index, and tracks how many futures contracts traders are buying for the S&P stock index. \nA trader will buy options at a certain price, protecting themselves against price changes - which can be seen as the mark of a trader worried about big price moves. As they buy more options, the Vix rises. \nThe Vix and its tradable brother the V-Vix have both spiked in recent days. The S&P futures market was falling so fast that it was almost impossible to calculate the Vix for brief periods, according to the CBOE. \n= Why is volatility spiking now? = \nExpectations are crucial in financial markets. A surprise leads to a flurry of volatility as traders rush to correct their positions to match reality. \nAfter several years of relatively calm markets, helped by a flood of cash from the European QE programme, traders have in recent months focused their attention on expected interest rate rises in the US and the UK. \nSince it becomes more difficult to attach a price to an asset with an uncertain future, this has stoked volatility in prices. \nMeanwhile in China, the stock market has been crashing since June. When the Beijing authorities started intervening to prop up the market, with mixed success, concerns rose about what this meant for the overall health of the world’s biggest economy. \nOnce the People’s Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) devalued the yuan by 2pc last week but then failed to prop up the market as expected over the weekend, this surprise seemed to crystallise broader worries about central banks in the minds of traders. \nHowever, this is just one possible explanation for why the Western markets went into a tailspin this week, and not several weeks ago when the Chinese markets started their descent. The opaque nature of the crash is itself another driver of volatility. \n= Is computer-driven trading making things worse? = \nMaybe. According to estimates from the US regulator , about half of all trades in the US stock markets are made by high-frequency traders (HFT).While the definition of HFT is not fixed, it tends to refer to computers rapidly placing trades based on a particular goal of the trading house to gradually unwind a big tranche of shares, for example, or to only buy orange juice futures when the dollar is climbing against the euro. \nThe traders who use HFTs can be intensely competitive - laying underwater lasers and cables through mountains to gain crucial miliseconds on rival trades. HFT has gained a bad reputation - author Robert Harris dubbed it \"The Fear Index\" - but in reality it bears little resemblance to the sinister algorithm in his novel of the same name, which stirred up and then profited from hysteria. \nHFT is potentially useful, creating more opportunities to trade for other market participants. However, algorithms can create problems when they are allowed to trade without a safety net that stops them when things get out of hand. \nThe notorious Flash Crash in May 2010 took place on a day when volatility was already spiking as the eurozone reached another crossroads during the debt crisis. From there, algorithms took fright while trading derivatives of the S&P market (the exact cause is under scrutiny again ), which quickly spread to the underlying stocks and shares. \nThe US market now has circuit-breakers to halt trading if the S&P 500 loses more than 7pc of its value in a day. \nThe London Stock Exchange also has these circuit-breakers in place, but it will only suspend stocks one by one as they lose 5pc or 10pc of their value, rather than calling a time-out on the entire market. \nWhile these measures are designed to let traders reset their algorithms and restore some calm, the very fact that the circuit-breakers are triggered can stoke further panic, as we’ve seen in China in recent months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:33:08.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
