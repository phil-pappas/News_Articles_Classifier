Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told reporters that just “one or two very small details” remain, in comments broadcast on Skai TV. An EU official confirmed a deal had been struck, asking not to be named because the talks are private and details have still to be announced.\nGreece’s parliament must now pass the reform or fiscal requirements before a meeting of euro-area finance ministers tentatively scheduled for Friday. A draft of the memorandum of understanding includes 35 so-called prior actions the country must pass immediately, with more measures to follow in October, before aid can be released Kathimerini newspaper reported, citing a copy of draft.\nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s government needs a quick release of about 20 billion euros to create a buffer for its banks and to make loan payments.\n‘Lasting Solution’ “One needs to look closely and then we’ll ask the Bundestag for approval when the common understanding is that this will hold for three years,” Jens Spahn, a deputy to German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, said on ARD television. “It has to be convincing that it isn’t just about Aug. 20 and an installment payment, but really about how, together with the Greeks, we can have a lasting solution.”\nThe Athens Stock Index, which reopened Aug. 3 after being shuttered for five weeks, rose 2.1 percent on Monday in anticipation that a deal was near. It fell 15.2 percent in the five days ended Aug. 7 to 676.33, just shy of its lowest closing level in three years. A measure of Greek banks fell 58 percent last week after reaching the lowest closing level since 1995 on Aug. 5.\nPeople are “too pessimistic” on the likelihood of a deal for Greece suceeding, Erik Nielsen, global chief economist at UniCredit Bank AG, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.\n“I don’t know if it’s going to work but I wouldn’t write it off,” Nielsen said on Monday. In any case, Greece won’t leave the euro “because they were out there looking into the abyss and decided they didn’t like it,” he said. “That is not a very big risk.”\nThe commitment to seek another bailout backtracks on Tsipras’s election pledges, prompting a rebellion within his Syriza party. He has called an emergency Syriza congress for September.\n\",\"byline\":\"Eleni Chrepa and Marcus Bensasson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T10:11:22.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
