However, only around half of participants reported that they discuss these issues monthly or quarterly,” the Bank of England said on Wednesday. \n“Given the significant increase in cyber-attacks on financial firms since this survey was completed, we would expect that proportion to have increased in the ensuing period.” \nThis latest study will seek to find out if insurers have made more progress since then. \nThe Bank of England will ask 28 multiple choice questions , with some additional space for extra information. They range from the basics, such as asking insurers if their senior managers understand their roles and responsibilities, through to the more complex, such as questions on the type of incidents the firm would investigate. \nAt the bottom of the survey, it leaves space for the Prudential Regulation Authority to add up the answers, counting the number of times the firm gave the response A, B or C. \nInsurers are also asked if they offer cyber insurance products to other companies. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority joins the PRA in asking about this part of the business, to find out what data insurers hold on their customers with regard to cyber security. \nThey have 10 weeks to send the forms back to Threadneedle Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:13:25.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
