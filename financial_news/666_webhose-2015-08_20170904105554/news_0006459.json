Photo: Jesse Marlow\nBig banks are yet to experience a significant lift in bad debts, but the latest round of results suggest personal loans and exposure to the resources sector are emerging as likely stress points.\nA key concern among bank investors in recent weeks has been the prospect of provisions for soured loans rising from historic lows.\nSuch a rise would eat into banks' multibillion dollar profits, because the benefit of low bad debts goes straight to the bottom line.\nRecent figures from CBA suggest new impairments may be rising.\nHowever, analysts say updates from Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ Bank and National Australia Bank in the last two weeks suggest the credit cycle is only turning gradually.\nAdvertisement Where bad debts are rising, the increases have mostly been modest, and often concentrated among borrowers affected by the resources sector slump.\nCBA equities analyst Victor German said commentary from the banks suggested credit quality had started to deteriorate, but the trend did not appear to be \"material\".\n\"Key areas of stress appear to be emerging within the unsecured personal portfolio and in the commercial part of the book exposed to a slowing mining industry and agribusiness [NZ dairy],\" he said in a note.\nBanks have benefited from falling levels of new impaired loans but Mr German said figures published by CBA suggested this trend may have turned around.\nANZ has reported the sharpest rise in provisions, which rose to $366 million in the June quarter, due to signs of weakness in the agriculture and the resources sector.\nChief executive Mike Smith said on Tuesday the credit cycle had turned, and UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said the bank appeared more sensitive to this change than peers.\n\"This deterioration appears more significant than the other majors have recently reported, indicating greater exposure and/or more lenient underwriting to these sectors in recent years,\" Mr Mott said in a note.\nCBA's full-year profit last week said overall credit quality was sound but its loan impairment expenses to rose to 0.17 per cent of assets in its second half, from 0.14 per cent in the first half, due to higher arrears in unsecured personal lending.\nThis increase related to rising unemployment in resource-rich states of Queensland and Western Australia.\nWestpac's total provisions for bad loans continued to fall in the third quarter, despite rising numbers of stressed loans in parts of the bank's retail, manufacturing and retail portfolios.\nNational Australia Bank has not yet provided its detailed report on credit quality known as a \"pillar three\" disclosure, but its trading update last week said bad debts were still falling.\nIf the credit cycle is turning, a key question for investors is what affect this will have on profits, at a time when banks also face skinnier margins and tougher regulatory demands.\nMr German said he did not think the likely rise in bad debts would be as severe as in previous cycles.\nOne reason for this is because banks had not rapidly expanded in business lending, a trend that has previously occurred before significant rises in bad debts.\nBusiness credit growth has only lifted to between 4 and 5 per cent a year â€“ compared with more than 20 per cent before the global financial crisis.\nAnother factor that has probably helped banks' loan quality is the strong housing market.\nMortgage giants CBA and Westpac have not yet shown any significant signs of stress in their home loan books.\nWestpac said 90 day delinquencies edged up by 2 basis points to 49 basis points, mostly due to stress in Western Australia and Victoria, while CBA's 90 days arrears rose by the same amount to 52 basis points.\n\"Frankly we are not really seeing stress in the housing portfolio,\" Mr German said.\n\"The banks don't tend to lose money on housing when property prices are going up.\"\nFor the benign bad debt picture to change significantly, analysts say there would have to be a prolonged rise in unemployment, or an increase in interest rates.\nYet the Reserve this month said it thought the unemployment rate would be \"little changed from recent levels for some time.\nAt the same time, futures markets are betting any move in official interest rates over the next 10 months is more likely to be down, not up.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/anzs-staunch-defence-of-credit-quality-20150817-gj1enz", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/westpac-says-bad-debts-under-control-despite-rising-stress-loans-20150817-gj0jf2.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/commonwealth-bank-of-australia-to-raise-5b-posts-record-profit-20150810-givpwe.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/nab-third-quarter-profits-rise-9-per-cent-to-175-billion-20150809-giv9ap.html"], "published": "2015-08-21T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T14:18:56.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
