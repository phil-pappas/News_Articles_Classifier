Healthy accommodation, electric power and potable water are still in deficit and the deadly EBOLA Virus Disease (EVD) has further exacerbated and exposed the level of poverty, ignorance and disease and the inadequacies of the basic needs of many of our people and of our infrastructure,\" the seasoned Liberian diplomat pointed out. \nThe veteran Liberian diplomat was speaking at the country's 168th Independence Day Program heldin Greenville City, Sinoe County on Monday, July 27, 2015. \nThis year's Independence Day Celebration was jointly hosted by Sinoe and Grand Kru Counties respectively. \nSpeaking on the theme: \"Celebrating Our Community As A Strong Foundation For Accelerated Development\"-Inspiring Hope for the People of our Country, the former Liberia's Ambassador to the United States of America, asserted that too many Liberians seem to be stuck below the economic glass ceiling while foreign business men and women are excelling\". \nListen to him: \"In real estate, for example, Liberians who have exclusivity to own land, appear to be relinquishing the ownership rights through long term lease and fronting arrangements to non-Liberians who are becoming the landlords of the most valuable properties. Growth in agriculture, especially food production has lagged considerably below the demand for food. As a result, most of what we eat is imported if not from neighboring countries than from faraway Asia.\" \nHe continued: \"Dogafla is strangulating our tailors and seamstresses while street venders market their pre-used and cheaper clothing, shoes and everything else, all over the country. Selling imported goods have become the predominant form of economic activity for a large number of our people; and while merchandising on the streets provides opportunities to make a living, it dissipates our productive capacities and adversely affects our balance of trade and constantly drains our foreign exchange earnings.\" \nHowever, the orator mentioned thatthe score card is incomplete \"when we accentuate only the negatives and the minuses. We need to also check out the positives, the plus side of the score card\". \n\"On the plus side, we must thank Almighty God who has been gracious unto us. He has sustained us as a Nation for 168 years, when several attempts were made to remove the name Liberia from the world Map. Even through the Ebola Virus Disease, we have survived. For over 10 long years, PEACE has prevailed in Liberia, although justice has not always been swift for all.\" He stated. \nHe noted that an impressive level of National COHESION has been attained in the country, stressing, \"notwithstanding, we continue to witness a lot of bickering over lands and the rights to their use.\" \n\"The economic foundation began to strengthen for a number of years between 2006 and the advent of Ebola as our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth exceeded population growth; and LIBERIA again began to obtain a higher level of respect in the comity of Nations. The level of international assistance provided us in our fight against EVD, which enabled us to achieve early success in the defeat of the deadly enemy, demonstrates a good level of support we, as a country, have earned,\" the orator among other things added.
