According to Greek media reports on Friday, as many as 25 rebel MPs from the main party Syriza are now planning to break away and form a new party. \nTsipras resigned on Thursday night after he lost the support from within his Syriza party on a vote on the country's third bailout with European creditors earlier this month. \nDisappointing Chinese manufacturing data was also weighing on the market as it added to concerns of a slowdown. \n\"Uncertainty concerning the Chinese economy continues to rattle stocks,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \"At the moment the Chinese economy is in the middle of a moderate slow-down, however Chinese GDP is still estimated to be growing around 6.6% and therefore the scale of the slowdown doesn't necessarily justify the negative impact it is having on stock markets around the world.\" Turning to news at home, pay rises in Britain remained at 2% in the three months to July and showed little sign of picking up soon, survey from XpertHR, a human resources services company, revealed on Friday. \nThe Bank of England is looking for an improvement in wages before raising interest rates. \n\"Employers are either unable to, or see no need to, increase wages by any more than 2 percent,\" said Sheila Attwood, pay and benefits editor at XpertHR. \nMeanwhile, oil prices were at their lowest levels since January. \nOn the company front, GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) slumped following reports Novartis (Xetra: 904278 - news ) has agreed to buy all remaining rights to Ofatumumab from the British group for up to $1bn. \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) slid as a US judge said shareholders who claimed the bank inflated its stock price by manipulating Libor may pursue their lawsuit as a class action. \nRoyal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) edged lower as its unit Sarawak Shell Bhd transferred its 50% stake as operator of the MLNG Dua liquefied natural gas plant to Malaysian state oil firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,077.19 -0.94% FTSE 100 6,327.65 -0.63% FTSE 250 17,101.31 -0.80% FTSE 100 - Risers Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) (JMAT) 2,720.00p +1.08% Randgold Resources Ltd.
