PUBLISHED: 21:36, Thu, Aug 20, 2015 | UPDATED: 21:41, Thu, Aug 20, 2015 GETTY The bank will remain in the red until 2017 \nThe reason the lender escaped a £120million fine last week despite serious failings which brought it close to collapse – regulators were concerned it would damage its finances and hamper its recovery – was made clearer by a widening of pre-tax losses to £204.2million from £77million the previous year. \nAs well as suffering losses on disposals of non-core assets, the bank also increased its spending to £102million on projects to address previous underinvestment. \nIt made no new provisions for mis-selling of payment protection insurance but set aside a further £16.8million for missold packaged accounts. \nChief executive Niall Booker said “real progress” had been made on the turnaround but fixing legacy issues would continue to hit the bank’s performance for some time, making a stock market listing unlikely in the short term. \nHe said: “We won’t be profitable in 2015 and we won’t be profitable in 2016 either. Personally, I think it will be a wee bit of time before we’re ready to IPO (float the business). It would be good to be closer to profitability.” We won’t be profitable in 2015 and we won’t be profitable in 2016 either Chief executive Niall Booker \nThe bank’s escalating financial woes and chaotic governance following an illfated merger in 2009 with Britannia Building Society were exposed when it announced a £1.5billion black hole in its finances as it tried to buy over 600 branches from Lloyds Banking Group. \nIts rescue by hedge funds left former owner the Co-op Group with a 20 per cent holding. \nBooker said there had been “no meaningful discussion” about hedge funds buying the Co-op Group’s remaining stake but he indicated the bank could become involved in consolidation among the UK’s socalled challenger banks. \nThe number of customers switching their current account away from the bank fell to 2,250 from 62,646 the previous year, while the number of branches shrank from 227 to 165. \nThere will also be a greater focus on small and medium sized businesses.
