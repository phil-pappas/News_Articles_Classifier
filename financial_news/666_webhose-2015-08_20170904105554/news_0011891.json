The Mexican food chain says it will lure the best employees by pointing out what the future may hold for them if they stick with Chipotle- a future that may include a $100k salary, stock options, etc. \nPlans call for the hiring binge to take place on September 9, 2015 and, if things go as expected, it will boost Chipotle’s workforce from approximately 59,000 to 63,000. This represents an increase of about 7 percent, which is one of the largest single- day employment increases for any company in U.S. labor history. \nChipotle management feels the move is necessary to capture and retain the best talent in a tightening job market . Several years ago, unemployment was high and workers were readily available. But with unemployment rates falling and demand for quick- serve meals increasing, the labor pool is shrinking, forcing Chipotle and other fast food and quick- serve dining establishments to rethink their hiring strategies. \n“The economy has been thawing, more restaurants are opening, and there are fewer job applicants than there were several years ago,” said Monty Moran, Chipotle’s Co- CEO. \nChipotle isn’t the first restaurant chain to make what is considered a radical move to attract and retain employees. Recall that Starbucks just recently added tuition reimbursement to attract workers and McDonald’s increased wages and added its own educational incentive plans. \nWhether or not Chipotle’s plans work the way they hope remains to be seen, but this is still encouraging news for a company in an industry that is often criticized for its lack of employee pay and benefits.
