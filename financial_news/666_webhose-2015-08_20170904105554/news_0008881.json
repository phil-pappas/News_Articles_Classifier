The firm does not rely on advisers.\nMr Klink said risk management was a priority for the firm and its systems checked bank balances on a trading-plus-zero-day, known as T+0, basis even though settlement still occurs on a T+3 cycle.\nBBY collapsed in May after it was forced to wind down its exchange-traded options (ETO) business and failed to repay an intraday loan to St George Bank. In the aftermath of the firm's demise it became clearer BBY was chasing volumes across various markets at skinny margins.\nBut some market players are not convinced OpenMarkets will succeed as a self-clearer on its pricing model.\n\"Massive swings in markets like that [this week] will catch them out,\" a broker said on the basis of anonymity.\n For online equities, warrants or exchange-traded-fund trading, OpenMarkets charges a fee of $13.95, or 0.07 per cent of trades above $20,000.\nBBY had about 1 per cent share of trading across the Australian Securities Exchange and Chi-X prior to being placed in voluntary administration, and accounted for 7 per cent of the local ETO market, according to IRESS data.\nOpen markets had 0.03 per cent of the cash equities market in the first five months of the year and racheted that up to 0.9 per cent between June and August 25. The firm has jumped to a top-20 local broker over that period. In the ETO space where BBY was ranked fourth in mid-May, trading firm D2MX has picked up almost 2 percentage points of market share over the same period while Pershing added 1.5 percentage points. D2MX is the largest player in the ETO market locally.\nAn ASX spokesman said the exchange continued to monitor the situation, including where former BBY clients had moved to.\n\"The movement of clients between participants is not unusual. ASX captures the impact of client movements on each participant through its normal risk monitoring activities ... Any issues related to the transfer of former BBY clients would be detected and acted upon. There have been none.\"\nMr Klink noted that Open Markets was \"close to profitable\" and set an ambitious goal for 4 per cent market share within the next five years . The firm has almost 1700 retail clients. It employs 12 staff and six developers for its Paritech system.\nMr Klink had a long stint at IBM before starting software company Paritech, the technology behind OpenMarkets. He believes nimble low-cost trading models are the way to go to \"own the cost structure\".\nOpenMarkets has appointed Neil Roderick, who founded the Macquarie Wrap, as a non-executive chairman and wants to have a board in place within six months. Mr Roderick spent 14 years at Macquarie until late 2013.\nOpenMarkets' strategy draws on innovation and trading hubs and the firm wants to grow partners including banks, fund managers and developers. OpenMarkets joined Chi-X in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:09:36.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
