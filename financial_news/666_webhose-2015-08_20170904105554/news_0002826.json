That's compared to $3,500 minimum earnings and $53,600 maximum for the Canada Pension Plan.\n— Employers and employees with a comparable plan won't have to enrol in the ORPP.\n— Employees between the ages of 18 and 70 qualify, but can only start collecting benefits at age 65.\n— Defined benefit plans are considered comparable with a minimum benefit accrual rate of 0.5 per cent.\n— Defined contribution plans are defined as comparable with a minimum annual contribution rate of eight per cent and employers must match at least 50 per cent.\n— Self-employed people can't take part in the ORPP, as the federal Income Tax Act doesn't allow the self-employed to participate in registered pension plans.\n— Large employers (with 500 or more employees) without registered workplace pension plans start contributions Jan. 1, 2017. Medium employers (with 50-499 employees) without registered workplace pension plans start contributions Jan. 1, 2018. Small employers (with 50 or fewer employees) without workplace pension plans start contributions Jan. 1, 2019.\n— Employers that already have pension plans but that aren't comparable to the ORPP have to start contributions Jan. 1, 2020.\n— Contributions will be phased in, starting with 0.8 per cent each from employers and employees, and reaching 1.9 per cent each by 2021.\n— Benefits will be paid starting in 2022.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:56:03.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
