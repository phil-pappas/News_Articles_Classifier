Alwyn Thomas, of Nomura, said “optimism should be muted given the substantial reinvestment commitment in east Africa and geopolitical risk in west Africa”. The stock slumped 19p, or 7.8pc, to 224.3p. \nPremier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) was among the biggest laggards on the mid-cap index, down 7p, or 5.5pc, to 119.7p. Nomura issued a “neutral” rating, as analysts raised concerns about the group’s sensitivity to long-term oil price moves. \nThe FTSE 100 fallers also included mining companies. \nAnglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) , which was trading ex-dividend, slumped 22.7p, or 2.8pc, to 775.4p. The miner was downgraded by Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) following the group’s half-year results, which contained plans to axe thousands of jobs and offload more assets. \nNick Hatch, of Canaccord Genuity, said that “while the share price has fallen back below recessionary levels, indeed to levels not seen since 2000, we see no near-term catalyst to reverse the recent trend”. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) slipped 2pc to 199.3p, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) fell 2.1pc to £11.76 and BP , which was also trading ex-dividend, was 3pc lower at 383.2p. Brent Crude (Source: Bloomberg) \nIn the broader market, the highly anticipated “Super Thursday” - which saw the Bank of England release a flurry of data, including its interest rate decision, policymakers’ votes and inflation - did little to excite the markets. The FTSE 100 edged 5.32 points lower to finish at 6,747.09. * Bank of England Inflation Report: five things we learned Housebuilding and property stocks jumped in afternoon trading after only one of the central bank’s policymakers voted to start raising interest rates. \n“Judging by the way the Monetary Policy Committee voted, the British mortgage-paying public can rest easy for the time being, as there weren’t many itchy trigger fingers there,” Alastair McCaig, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said. \nTaylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) rose 4.5p to 200.7p, Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) edged 10p higher to 651p and mid-cap Bovis Homes (LSE: BVS.L - news ) added 23p to £11.75. \nRSA Insurance (LSE: RSA.L - news ) slipped 14p, or 2.7pc, to 510p despite profits coming in ahead of market expectations . Zurich Insurance (Xetra: ZFI1.DE - news ) , which is interested in bidding for the company, said it wouldn’t overpay. \nElsewhere, Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) jumped 4.9pc to 229.1p after it recorded a 19pc rise in half-year operating profit. \nInmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) became the FTSE 100 favourite, climbing 60p, or 6.7pc, to 956.5p, following half-year results and a raised price target by JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) . \nWhile the communications group had a soft second quarter for revenue, the stock was boosted by confirmation the launch of the Global Xpress satellite had been rescheduled to “late August”. The British company was forced to delay the launch in May after its partner, ILS, suffered another rocket failure. \nAggreko (LSE: AGK.L - news ) tumbled 57p to £11.30 as its half-year results pointed to another tough year ahead. The temporary power company is undergoing a restructuring, which will include axing about 600 jobs from the 8,300 workforce it employs globally. \nLast month, the group warned full-year results would fall at least 8pc short of market expectations due to lower prices for contracts in Bangladesh. * Questor share tip: Aggreko still has to answer growing problem UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) downgraded Associated British Food as it believes the valuation already reflects a successful launch of Primark in the US. \nThe bank reckons the retailer’s imminent entry into the American market is critical to the current investment thesis. \nSophie Hughes, of UBS, said that if Primark failed to impress US shoppers, there would be limited downside risk. “We estimate exit costs of less than 1pc of market cap, given the leasehold nature of the agreements and hence the US opportunity is a risk worth taking,” she added. \nABF’s stock was changing hands at £32.20 by the close, down 17p. \nFinally, beleaguered insurance outsourcer Quindell (Xetra: M6FA.DE - news ) plunged 28.3pc to 89.5p after it resumed trading . The shares were suspended on June 24 following the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigation into public statements regarding the company’s financial accounts for 2013 and 2014. \nOn Wednesday, the group posted a £238m loss for last year. A criminal investigation into the business and accounting practices were also launched by the Serious Fraud Office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:24:52.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
