Ajinomoto Co soared 5.0 percent and Kikkoman Corp jumped 5.9 percent.\nBanks also were in demand, with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rising 3.9 percent, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group soaring 3.5 percent and Mizuho Financial Group gaining 2.9 percent.\nMajor exporters rose, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 3.4 percent and Advantest Corp surging 3.5 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 2.5 percent to 1,515.86, with all of its 33 subsectors in positive territory.\nThe JPX-Nikkei Index 400 rose 2.5 percent to 13,642.50.
