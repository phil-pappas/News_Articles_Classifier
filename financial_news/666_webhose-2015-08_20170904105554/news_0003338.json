The contract awarded Soma the right to subsequently pick other blocks it wanted to exploit. \nAbdirizak Omar Mohamed, Somalia's security minister who signed that deal in 2013 when he was the country's resources minister, said the SFO investigation had come as a surprise. \n\"It was a fair deal for Somalia. I don't know how the investigation came about or what kind of corruption we are talking about,\" he told Reuters. \nSoma is chaired by Michael Howard, a member of Britain's House of Lords and British Prime Minister David Cameron's predecessor as Conservative party leader. \n\"The SFO have confirmed that no suspicion whatsoever attaches to Lord Howard arising from the business of SOMA and his role as a non-executive director of the company and he has agreed to speak with the SFO to help resolve their enquiry as quickly as possible,\" a Soma spokesman told Reuters. \nHoward was not available for immediate comment. \n(Reporting by Mike Holden and Drazen Jorgic; writing by Drazen Jorgic; editing by Jason Neely)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:43:38.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
