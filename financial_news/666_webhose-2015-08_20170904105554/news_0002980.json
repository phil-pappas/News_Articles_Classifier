Photo: Supplied\nIt never pays to lie, but the workplace may be the exception. Research shows people regularly tell lies at work for personal gain â€“ from chucking sickies to faking qualifications on resumes.\nThey may be justified as white lies, but is it OK to lie at work?\nFeigning agreement with a customer to keep them happy or exaggerating a company's success may boost the chances of success, but oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.\nEtiquette expert Rebecca Wiles from The Training Establishment says just one little lie has the power to bring down a credible organisation and ruin individuals' reputations.\nAdvertisement \"Sometimes we think it's OK to tell this one small lie, but in time it becomes a mammoth task just to remember what the lie was and about to begin with,\" she says.\n\"In all my years in business, teachings, trainings and coaching, honesty has always been the best policy. Small, white lies turn into bigger lies and it's a fulltime job just to keep covering up the original story.\"\nIn an age of viral videos, online reviews and pervasive social media, lies are harder than ever to maintain, Wiles says.\n\"These days our customers are more savvy than ever before, we've educated them more than ever,\" she says.\n\"They'll find the truth out eventually, and when they do, you won't want to be around.\"\nIt's possible to avoid the Pinocchio effect by learning ways to delicately deliver the truth. Wiles recommends phrases such as, \"I think you know me well enough by now to know that I'm not going to say things that I think you want to hear\" and \"I'm not the expert in this field, let me introduce you to someone who is\".\nAustralian workers chuck an average of 9.5 sickies a year, a report by Direct Health Solutions last year found. While some are legit, many involve elaborate lies to escape workplace stress, take a long weekend or nurse a hangover.\nLying on resumes to win a job or bigger pay packet may deceive some employers, but not all. In a survey of more than 2000 hiring managers, 58 per cent said they caught applicants lying in order to embellish their skill-sets, dates of employment, academic degrees and job titles.\nBesides the obvious ethical transgressions, lying has serious consequences. An Australian Taxation Office employee found this out the hard way in April this year when he was found guilty of fraud for providing false and misleading information on his resume.\nBut it's not just employees. Managers have been known to stretch or conceal the truth when it comes to company lay-offs, sales performance and the real reasons why pay rises are denied.\nHowever they justify their lies, managers are under the same obligations to be just as honest as their employees, says Professor Tony Coady from the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics.\n\"The context of the workplace makes no difference to the wrong of lying and that's true in the workplace whether you're a leader or a follower,\" he says.\n\"Indeed, a leader may be under a stronger obligation not to lie since his or her example may corrupt others.\"\nWhile we may suspect others of lying, it's often difficult to know for sure. Body language expert Dr Louise Mahler says there are some behavioural tell-tale signs.\n\"You're looking for changes in breath, so for instance people can suddenly breath high or hold breath and that's a bad sign,\" she says.\n\"These things manifest in vocal tone with the pitch suddenly going high or the words starting to speed up.\"\nOther clues include avoidance of eye contact, rapid eye movement and refusal to give direct answers.\nBut while observing body language may provide hints, Dr Mahler says it's not a reliable indicator of dishonesty.\n\"The reality is you can never tell if you're being lied to unless you know the person well because you have to know what their responses are under stress and then see if you're getting something different to what you normally get,\" she says.\nWhat do you think?
