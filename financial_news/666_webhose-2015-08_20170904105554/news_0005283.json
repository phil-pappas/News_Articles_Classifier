Photo: Peter Braig\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has approved TPG Telecom's $1.56 billion takeover bid to buy iiNet and become the nation's second-largest provider of internet services.\nThe ACCC on Thursday morning issued its decision on the matter after its commissioners met on Tuesday. iiNet shareholders have already voted overwhelmingly in favour of the deal.\n\"While the ACCC was concerned that the acquisition of iiNet by TPG may lessen competition in the retail fixed broadband space ... the ACCC concluded this would not reach the threshold of a 'substantial' lessening of competition as required under section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act,\" ACCC chair Rod Sims said in a statement.\nThe regulatory approval clears the way for iiNet to lodge an application for its deal to be ratified by the courts, which would make it final and binding.\nTPG will then become a telecommunications powerhouse and Australia's second-biggest provider of fixed-line broadband with over 1.7 million customers compared to the 3.1 million at Telstra and 1 million at Optus.\nMr Sims had previously said that the majority of submissions made to the ACCC's inquiry had been against the merger with fears about a potential fall in customer service and decrease in competitive offerings.\nHowever, the competition watchdog said it took comfort from the fact that Telstra, Optus and M2 Group were able to provide enough rival services to limit the potential harm.\nBut it also noted that any further mergers between the Big 4 telcos would cause \"serious competition concerns.\"\n\"The ACCC has noted the growing consolidation in what will now be a relatively concentrated broadband market,\" Mr Sims said.\nThe regulator also decided that there was enough competition in the wholesale transmission market, which is also known as backhaul. This is the service that connects data centres, cities and NBN points of interconnect together.\nThe merger has major implications for all of TPG's rivals. M2 Group, which operates Dodo and iPrimus, and Optus are in the most danger of losing market share but the former has launched new products to protect rising profits while the latter has ramped up bundling and content offerings.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/telecommunications/bulk-of-submissions-against-tpg-telecomiinet-deal-accc-chair-rod-sims-says-20150818-gj1gpd", "http://www.afr.com/business/telecommunications/why-tpg-telecoms-david-teoh-bought-iinet-20150727-gil299"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:34:07.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
