Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Michael Smith The Victorian government has backed down over an unrealistic proposal to increase the rent stevedores and shipping groups pay at Australia's biggest port terminal by as much as 800 per cent.\nThe new rental deal between stevedore DP World Australia and the Port of Melbourne is about a tenth of what had been proposed.\nIt is a victory for the stevedoring and logistics industry, which campaigned strongly against the increase. It was only ever so high because that is what Philippines-based International Container Terminal Services (ICTS) agreed to pay when it won the bid last year to become the third operator at the port.\nICTS to agree to pay a rent of $120 per square metre compared with DP World's current rent of $16 per square metre. As a result of the premium the new user was willing to pay, DP World was asked to fork out the same amount.\nDP World was never going to agree to this kind of increase, but the new deal was better than expected. It highlights how keen the government is to get this dispute out of the way and push on with the $6 billion privatisation process.\nAs Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chairman Rod Sims notes, it is always better to have a negotiated rather than a regulated outcome. It was the threat of regulation that got the deal over the line.\nThe agreement enables the government to push ahead now that the threat of DP World seeking to declare the port under the national access regime has been removed.\nBidders get certainty This gives bidders certainty around the asset's future value and removes the risk of lengthy legal and regulatory delays.\nSources say that DP World will pay about $20 per square metre in rent under the agreement, announced on Monday night after The Australian Financial Review broke news of the agreement on its website .\nThe 50-year deal commences with CPI increments in 2015 to 2016 to nominally $45 per square metre in 2023. DP World also secured a longer period between rental reviews, which removes a lot of uncertainty.\nIt is believed DP World previously paid about $16 per square metre. The Port of Melbourne's proposed increase would have taken this up to $120 per square metre.\nIt is understood negotiations were heated at times and the deal is a win for DP World chief Paul Scurrah who has strongly opposed the rent increase, warning it would lead to job losses. Rival Asciano, which owns Patrick Ports, should also benefit when its rents are reviewed next year.\nBut it does not resolve long-term issues around how the port sale is legislated or the absence of regulation for future port pricing. Then there is the issue of compensation payable to stevedores if another port is build.\nA consortium of representatives from the logistics industry earlier on Monday called on the Victorian government to amend the privatisation legislation to protect them from excessive price increases in the future.\nDraft legislation 'falls short' \"Even if short-term rental increase issues are resolved with the Port of Melbourne Corporation, the draft legislation falls short of effective regulation, creating uncertainty and putting at risk future investment and trade volumes through the port,\" says coalition spokesman, Rod Nairn, Shipping Australia chief executive.\nThe consortium says a parliamentary inquiry may be needed to address issues such as regulating the term of the proposed lease for future rent increases and how new port charges are introduced. It is also worried that the ACCC will not have any power to scrutinise the transaction. It says the solution is for the privatised owner to submit a voluntary access undertaking to the ACCC before it completes the sale.\nThis is what happened with the privatisation of the Webb Dock West automotive terminal in Melbourne ahead of its sale last year.\nThe Victorian government needs the Port of Melbourne privatisation process to go smoothly, considering the trouble it ran into with another big infrastructure project, the East West Link, which was shelved at considerable cost to the taxpayer.\nThe DP World deal is the latest sign that the government is willing to make some concessions to get the sale legislation through Parliament.\nDesigned to get farmers on side Premier Daniel Andrews outlined a new $200 million Agriculture Infrastructure and Jobs Fund on the weekend, which will be funded by cash from the Port of Melbourne sale . This was designed to get farmers, who have been worried the port sale would hurt rural exports, on side.\nThere is some concern in the industry that, despite DP World's win, it will not protect stevedores from further excessive hikes when existing rental agreements, which usually last two years, expire.\nBecause ICTS hasn't started operating at the port yet, its future rental can be excluded from the current process. It is unclear what happens in the future when they are paying $120 per square metre. It is also unclear how ICTS will respond to the latest development, given it will be paying 10 times more than its competitors.\nThe coalition of companies affected by the proposed rent increase led by Asciano wrote to Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey and Sims earlier this year, seeking an assurance the government will not privatise port assets just to maximise sale revenue.\nIt also asked the federal government to consider regulating the port under the trade and commerce powers in the Australian constitution without any involvement from the Victorian government.\nKathmandu fights off Duke's advances Kathmandu is expected to release an earnings update later this week as it seeks to defend the unwanted advances of New Zealand-based entrepreneur Rod Duke's Briscoe Group .\nDuke, who launched a $324 million takeover bid the same day Kathmandu's new chief executive started last month, has been on a charm offensive trying to convince the target's shareholders to accept the mostly scrip offer.\nIt is safe to assume Kathmandu's board and some of its shareholders have a different perspective on the company's valuation than Duke. Exactly what that is will become clear when its target statement comes out.\nKathmandu's message for shareholders is that it is coming through an isolated period of poor trading and new chief executive Xavier Simonet has what it takes to turn things around.\nInvestors will be grateful for some clarity around Kathmandu's earnings profile for both the 2015 and 2016 financial years after a weak first-half rattled the market and gave Duke the opportunity to get in while the stock looked cheap.\nKathmandu's weakness has been its management vacuum. It was also slow to migrate off the old model under founder Jan Cameron. There has been a long period of no news between trading updates and ahead of the chief executive's start date.\nTime to form views Former chief Peter Halkett resigned in August last year and Simonet could not start until he served out his six-month gardening leave. This has given him some time, though, to form some views on how to fix the company.\nHe has already flagged changes to the Kathmandu promotional model and is keen to expand online and overseas, as well as utilise the company's loyalty program.\nLike any new boss, he is likely to look at the cost base and make other changes to the Kathmandu model while protecting its strong brand, which is the best thing going for the company.\nKathmandu is not like a regular fashion retailer where inventories turn over quicker based on trends. Its current design-to-sales cycle of about 12 months is too long and there are opportunities to improve this process and push back on suppliers to get it down to eight or nine months.\nThe problem is that investors needed to hear all this six months ago, and the company is now playing catch-up on efforts to give them confidence the model is not broken. Private equity has been sniffing around the company for some time and there were early exploratory talks but nothing came about.\nDuke has a foothold with a 19.9 per cent stake in Kathmandu.\nWhile some Kathmandu shareholders will be keen for a way out after the company's lacklustre market performance, the scrip component of the offer is not popular with investors even though Duke has committed to listing Briscoe in Australia. They will also be agitating for a higher offer.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR\nMatthew Stevens is on leave.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@MikeSmithAFR", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-08-03T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:17:34.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
