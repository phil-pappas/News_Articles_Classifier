Pat Scala Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger Retired Adelaide doctor Prabhash Goel paid $10.95 million for a Bunnings warehouse in Swan Hill in regional Victoria on a record low yield of 5.1 per cent as investors splurged on retail and commercial property, sending prices soaring and yields tumbling.\nIn total, investors splashed out $130 million on retail and commercial property over two days of frenzied bidding at packed Burgess Rawson portfolio auctions in Melbourne and Sydney.\nDr Goel, who also bought the Bunnings in Ballina last year for $21.3 million – both investments made on behalf of his family – said he was very happy with his investment despite the low yield which set a \"new marker\" for the asset class.\n\"Wesfarmers is one of the best leases around for commercial property. The yield is low, But If you look around, good long term leased property is being sold on low yields,\" he said.\nDr Goel, who also owns Wesfarmers shares, said he would buy more Bunnings property for his family, but warned other investors who snapped up childcare centres, bank branches and even a digital sign above Flinders Station, which sold for $3.05 million at the Melbourne and Sydney auctions, could be caught out if interest rates started to rise .\n\"We have got other cash businesses, so we can sustain any interest rate rise, but [we're] not sure that other investors can.\"\nDr Goel's acquisition was one of the standout results at the two portfolio auctions, where a 76 per cent clearance rate was achieved with properties backed by leases to Wesfarmers and Woolworths the most sought after.\nYields to compress Burgess Rawson director of valuations, Tim Perrin, said commercial yields would continue to compress and prices rise as long as interest rates remain low.\n\"The more conservative investors are being drawn out of cash and bonds, where returns are so low, and looking at some of the lease covenants backing these properties. They are seeing that the security they offer is almost as good as bonds, but at much higher yields, \" Mr Perrin said.\nHe added that a striking feature of the market was the appetite for the major brands, principally Coles or Woolies. \"It doesn't matter if it's a Dan Murphy's, a Bunnings or a supermarket.\"\nInvestors Tom and Karen Zafir, who missed out on a childcare centre, questioned some of the buyer behaviour, which included incremental bids in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\"We are not working in a rational market,\" Mr Zafir said.\n\"Buyers don't appear to be doing their due diligence. We had the contracts for the childcare centre checked over by our lawyer, but other buyers are not doing that,\" said Ms Zafir,\nAsked if they thought some of the buyer behaviour resembled punters at the pokies Mr Zafir said: \"That's a pretty good analogy.\"\nAlso at the auction, a Bendigo office property leased to the state government on a 10-year lease sold for $7.31 million on a very low 4.4 per cent yield\n\"Somebody really wanted it,\" remarked one bemused punter.\nThe freehold digital advertising sign opposite Flinders station was bought by a Sydney investor who also owns a sign in North Sydney. A Brisbane investor bought the Dan Murphy's liquor store in Broadmeadows Melbourne.\n\"[A yield of] six has become the new five,\" said Burgess Rawson selling agent Shaun Venables.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-08-05T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:11:19.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
