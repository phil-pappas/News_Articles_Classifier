Consider this - the median pay day borrower is in debt to his payday loan provider 199 days of the year, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . A separate study, from the Center For Responsible Lending states almost half of all payday loan borrowers default within two years of their first loan. Now, the CFPB is out with new regulations that restrict high cost payday loans . \"The proposals under consideration would restrict lenders from attempting to collect payment from consumers' bank accounts in ways that tend to rack up excessive fees,\" the CFPB said. \"The strong consumer protections being considered would apply to payday loans, vehicle title loans, deposit advance products and certain high-cost installment loans and open-end loans.\" Consumers hold a dim view of payday lenders but stop just short of wanting them eliminated, according to Pew Research . \"Our survey shows that Americans think payday loans are unfair, but would support loans with lower costs and more reasonable terms,\" says Nick Bourke, small dollar project loan director at The Pew Charitable Trusts. \"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's proposed framework is a good start, but the public would like the CFPB to do more in this market to ensure loans are safe and more affordable.\" Approximately 12 million Americans use payday loans and spend an average of $520 in fees to borrow $375, Pew reports. That seems unacceptable to most Americans, as 75% of adults surveyed by Pew say payday loans should be \"more regulated.\" Overwhelmingly, consumers say banks should step up and play a bigger role in offering \"smaller loans\", with \"lower prices.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:07:05.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
