But organic revenue, excluding the impact of fuel prices, foreign exchange, acquisitions and disposals was up 5pc. \nFlight support, BBA's refuelling and ground handling division, represented 76pc of the group's operating profit, with good performance driven by BBA’s Signature service for private jets. BBA described its other flight support business ASIG’s progress as “satisfactory” despite the loss of key contracts including one in Singapore. \nBBA's aftermarket services division, which provides repairs and maintenance for engines, saw underlying operating profit down a third. The weaker-than-expected performance was blamed on costs associated with its plan to rationalise and close select sites. \nBBA said it would increase its dividend by 5pc, “reflecting continued confidence in group’s future growth prospects”. \nSimon Pryce, chief executive, said the first-half performance had been good with “very strong performance” in the flight support division, and an improving performance in aftermarket services in the second quarter. \n“This, coupled with a continued, albeit slow, recovery in our major markets gives us confidence that 2015 will be a year of good growth with strong momentum into 2016,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:57:11.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
