The two will however not count in the weekend’s awards, but will strongly determine which bank will pick that award in the coming year. \nThe banking award, which is in its 14 th year, is a vehicle to showcase and applaud best performing banks in various categories of the Ghanaian financial services market. \nIt is also intended to result in an enhanced financial sector in terms of products, processes and services, give public recognition to the best performing banks, as well as stimulate healthy competition among them. \nThe awards is competed for by all the banks operating in the country and winners are determined based on a nationwide survey of consumers of banking products and services. \nThe coveted Bank of the Year was last year won by Access Bank while UT Bank was adjudged the most active e- zwich bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T03:13:06.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
