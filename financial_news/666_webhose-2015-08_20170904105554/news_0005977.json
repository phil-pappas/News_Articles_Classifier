Photo: D Lorimer\nBillionaire James Packer's hopes of luring Chinese holidaymakers to a new $3.2 billion resort in Macau with a mix of Hollywood celebrity and Gotham City themed rides could yet be derailed by a shortage of gaming tables for the main casino offering.\nWith Mr Packer's Las Vegas and Sydney casinos not due to open until later this decade, the former Portuguese colony – under pressure from falling gambling revenues – has become integral to the gaming tycoon's ambition to create high-end resorts known as much for rides like Batman Dark Flight and Asia's highest ferris wheel as baccarat tables and poker machines.\nWe hope to get 400 and we think 400 is a realistic figure but ultimately it is not our call.\nMelco chief executive Lawrence Ho Melco Crown, 34 per cent owned by Mr Packer's Crown Resorts, has revealed it will open its latest Macau casino called Studio City on October 27 adding to its existing Altira and City of Dreams casinos in Macau and the Philippines.\nWith less than three months until opening day, Lawrence Ho said he still has no idea what table allocation they will receive.\nMr Packer has tapped his Hollywood connections to lend some star power to the opening with Rush Hour director Brett Ratner lining up producer Martin Scorcese with actors Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt to star in a short film dubbed The Audition themed around a Studio City storyline.\nThe quartet are thought to have been paid up to $60 million to appear in the film along with their appearance at the opening of the resort in October.\nWhile the glitz of Hollywood is bound to attract just the sort of public relations polish needed for the out of luck Macau, Melco continues to sweat on the number of gaming tables it will be allocated by the Macau government.\nMost analysts expect Studio City may only receive 150 tables.\nIt's thought the debt covering Studio City has a covenant that states the casino needs a minimum of 400 tables but most analysts expect it may only receive 150 tables, in line with Macau's stated aim of diversifying its economy away from gaming.\nWith less than three months until opening day, Melco's upbeat chief executive, Lawrence Ho said he still has no idea what table allocation they will receive and admits to some concern that rival Galaxy applied for 400 tables and only ended up with 150.\nHope for greater reward It is believed Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Robert De Niro will star in a short film to promote the casino.\n\"We hope the government will reward us more, for the hard work we have put in over the last 10 years,\" said Mr Ho. \"We've had some dialogue with the government … but we are extremely concerned with the table allocation Galaxy got. We hope to get 400 and we think 400 is a realistic figure but ultimately it is not our call.\"\nMelco Crown showed how concerned it was about the issue warning in the latest Studio City quarterly report saying if the new property was allocated \"fewer than 400 tables,\" it would have \"a material adverse effect on our cash flow\".\nMr Ho, the son of 93-year-old Macau gambling-industry legend Stanley Ho, admits the timing of Studio City's opening is far from ideal given the slump in revenues from Macau's gaming sector.\n\"City of Dreams opened at the peak of the global financial crisis [in June 2009] at the worst of it … and I think there are some similarities between opening City of Dreams during the GFC and the current situation in the Macau market right now,\" Mr Ho said on a media call on Wednesday. \"Hopefully we can be the catalyst to get out of the current situation.\"\nBeijing's efforts to rein in fraudulent activity and illegal cash flowing across the border have hammered gambling activities in Macau, the only region in China where its citizens can legally gamble.\nGross gaming revenue in July fell 35 per cent to 18.6 billion patacas ($3 billion), marking a 14th straight month of declines and the lowest level of revenues since 2010.\nMelco is due to report its second quarter results on August 6.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/street-talk/afr24street2-20150623-ghw1fl", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/james-packer-bets-on-cyber-security-to-grow-fortune-20150804-girfen.html", "http://www.afr.com/business/gambling/celebrity-key-to-packers-global-brand-plan-20150804-girahc"], "published": "2015-08-06T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:48:03.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
