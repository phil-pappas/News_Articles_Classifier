REUTERS/China Daily (CHINA - Tags: BUSINESS POLITICS) CHINA OUT. NO COMMERCIAL OR EDITORIAL SALES IN CHINA Reuters Share on twitter by Angus Grigg Each weekday morning for the past five years China's central bank made an announcement few ever noticed. At 9.15 am from its Soviet style headquarters in Beijing, the People's Bank of China released the \"daily fix\" – the rate at which the yuan will trade against the US dollar.\nEven for most committed market watchers it was hard going, worthy only of reporting as a matter of record as the currency was tediously stable.\nThen on Tuesday everything changed.\nWithout notice or explanation the PBOC lowered the \"daily fix\" by 1.9 per cent against the US dollar, the largest devaluation in 20 years. Investors responded by hitting the panic button . Without the usual softening-up period or carefully worded statements that usually preface such a change, anything exposed to China was sold off as investors believed it signalled a sharper than expected slowdown in the world's second biggest economy.\nApple shares dropped 5 per cent, the Australian dollar was hammered and oil hit a six-year low. The Aussie recovered later in the week .\nThe issue was not the size of the devaluation, which by Friday had run to 4.4 per cent, but that investors hadn't had time to game out the likely consequences.\n\"Everyone is still trying to work out what this means,\" said ANZ's chief economist, Warren Hogan, on Wednesday.\nEven the Reserve Bank of Australia was caught off guard and seemed a little unsure of how the devaluation would affect the local economy.\n Deputy governor Philip Lowe outlined three theoretical scenarios on Wednesday evening during a speech, in which he said it was a \" very recent development \" and wondered out loud if any of his interpretations would prove correct.\nDefining moment But looking beyond the short and even medium-term impact on financial markets and commodities , ANZ's Hogan and veteran China watcher Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics see this as a defining moment in Beijing's reform push.\n\"What we have seen this week is the start of China's full integration into the world economy,\" said Hogan via phone from Sydney.\n\"This is the start of a new era for the global financial architecture.\"\nThat's a big statement, requiring plenty of explanation. Hogan has come to this view as he believes Beijing has taken its first significant step in allowing the yuan's value to better reflect market fundamentals.\nYes, China still has a managed exchange rate – but it is less managed than on Monday. This was the technical change implemented on Tuesday by the PBOC.\n\"[The] market will play a bigger role in exchange rate determination,\" the central bank said in a statement issued 11 minutes after the abrupt policy switch.\nIn what was described as a \"one-time adjustment\", the bank said its goal was to allow the previous day's trading activity to exert greater influence over the \"daily fix\" the next morning. Such a change means if the yuan falls in trading on a Wednesday, for example, the \"fix\" on Thursday morning should be set at a lower level.\nTechnically, therefore, if the yuan keeps falling, Beijing will not have devalued the currency: it will have let the markets to do so.\nAs changes go, this one has been a long time coming, hence the excitement from those seeing the bigger reform picture.\nIt was only 10 years ago that Beijing officially scrapped the yuan's peg to the US dollar, but it went back on this reform by unofficially reinstating the peg three years later during the depths of the global financial crisis. The peg was finally lifted in June 2010 and over the next four years the PBOC gradually allowed the yuan to appreciate against the US dollar, hitting a record high in January last year.\nAt the same time, it has widened the trading band to 2 per cent either side of the \"daily fix\" – the currency can therefore trade in a 4 per cent range on any given day. It has also set up offshore markets for trading yuan – the main one being in Hong Kong – which don't have the same restrictions.\nThe so-called managed float onshore has allowed Beijing to keep the yuan relatively stable – it likes stability in all things – while muting China hawks in the US Congress who have repeatedly accused it of keeping the currency artificially low.\nBut as Japan and Europe devalued their currencies via Quantitative Easing (QE), the relatively high yuan was suddenly out of step with the slowing Chinese economy.\nBeijing needed the currency to fall and did so by dressing it up as a market reform via a more flexible exchange rate.\nPush to shore up economy It demonstrated once again the political smarts of PBOC governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who looks to have sold the reform to hardliners as a means to engineer a lower currency in the short term without drawing criticism from the US or International Monetary Fund. As it turned out, both praised the move.\nThis suggests Beijing's change in currency policy was an opportunistic move to address both weak growth and the yuan's lack of flexibility. There was also a hint of panic after last Saturday's horrible trade number – followed by weaker than expected industrial production and fixed asset investment data released on Wednesday.\nThe weakening of the currency should therefore also be seen as Beijing's latest attempt to maintain growth near 7 per cent this year, after the country's short-lived stock market rally collapsed in July.\nLardy, a long-time chronicler of China's economic reforms, labelled the move a \"potentially major step\" and said up until Tuesday the PBOC has been \"overriding the market\".\n\"The action taken by China, far from being a step to manipulate its currency, is actually an effort to let the yuan fluctuate according to the dynamics of the exchange markets,\" he wrote in an article published on the Peterson Institute's website.\n\"China's move is consistent with long-standing advice from the IMF and from the US Treasury, both of which have repeatedly called for China to adopt a more market-determined exchange rate policy.\"\nFor Hogan this means we are going to see and hear a lot more about the yuan, as China takes its final step of fully integrating into the world economy. \"We are now entering a new global currency regime.\" Hogan argues that until now only China's real economy – the trading of goods and services – was integrated into the world economy, while its financial system remained closed.\nHe is forecasting a big rise in the amount of yuan used in trade and the amount of yuan traded in currency markets – it is already the fifth-most-traded currency and is set to overtake the yen this year and has the British pound in its sights.\nIt's being called \"the rise of the Redback\" and its ascension will be completed when the value of the yuan is mentioned on the nightly news alongside the US dollar, euro, pound and yen. That might take three years, but for the likes of Hogan and Lardy the rise is now inevitable.\nVolatility ahead \"We should expect this to lead to greater volatility,\" wrote Lardy.\nThe one disclaimer to all this reform optimism is that the PBOC has reserved the right to intervene when the market is \"distorted\".\nIn a rare press conference on Thursday, the bank's deputy governor, Yi Gang, said Beijing would keep the currency at a \"reasonable\" and \"balanced level\".\nThis suggests geopolitics and domestic affairs, along with market forces will play a role in settings the yuan's level.\nAt Friday morning's fixing, which has now become a live Tweeting event, the PBOC showed its intent to drive the direction of the currency .\nFor the first time in three days it strengthened the yuan marginally, despite the currency trading slightly lower on Thursday.\nThe PBOC's action suggests markets will play a greater role in setting the yuan's level, but will remain a secondary force to the central bank for now – it has $US3.2 trillion in foreign reserves in its back pocket.\nThe result still means greater fluctuations in the yuan and these will now need to be considered by most multinationals, traders and anyone connected to China.\nUntil Tuesday most had given little thought to such risks, which is why markets reacted so violently.\nBy week's end the market's collective thinking, as reflected in asset prices, had changed completely.\nWhat began as a knee-jerk reaction to sell anything exposed to China became the exact opposite. That is why the Aussie, which is often seen as a proxy for Chinese growth, had bounced off its lows by Friday.\nRather than the devaluation being bad for Chinese growth it is now being interpreted as a positive for the economy this year as the lower currency will help the underperforming export sector.\nFor a commodity-exporting country like Australia this should be marginally positive as Chinese manufacturers will need to buy more iron ore, coking coal and copper, which will then be re-exported in the form of mobile phones, steel and other finished products.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey acknowledged as much to Parliament on Thursday.\n\"We need to remember that the yuan has appreciated significantly in recent times, and that has had some significant impact on Chinese exports,\" he said.\nHockey said the more Australia supports the growth of China and its opportunities, \"the wealthier Australia will be; for every dollar we spend buying Chinese goods and services, the Chinese spent $2 buying our goods and services\".\nRBA cautious The RBA's Lowe was more cautious but still saw the benefit for Australia. \"If it supports growth in our largest trading partner, it's probably good,\" he said. \"If it's a positive sign about structural reform, a stronger commitment to markets, then that's ultimately good for China, and if it's good for China then it's probably good for us.\"\nANZ's Hogan agreed the devaluation should be positive for commodities like iron ore, but said the overall picture is far more complex.\nIndeed, the potential ramifications reach into every corner of the world economy.\n\"It could be quite negative for global growth,\" says Hogan. That's because gains made by China may come at the expense of others like Japan, South Korea and potentially Europe. \"There could be a deflationary shock.\"\nIf global growth is dented even slightly, then the US Federal Reserve's carefully planned schedule for beginning to lift interest rates may pushed back from September to later in the year.\nThis is the type of chain reaction the RBA's Lowe mooted on Wednesday evening. \"We know that movements in exchange rates often set off a chain reaction of events which can be difficult to predict,\" he said.\nBy week's end this chain reaction was not looking too scary, but it should be remembered that China now has the infrastructure in place to resume weakening the currency at any time.\nHogan and others believe over the next few months it will fall by as much as 10 per cent, which means Beijing's daily fixing is now a must-watch event as the yuan becomes a new global currency.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/AngusGrigg"], "published": "2015-08-14T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:06:07.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
