Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Hong Kong shares may be the cheapest they've been in 12 years but professional investors remain wary as they question if the Chinese government's intervention is the only thing holding the Chinese share prices up.\nThe benchmark Hang Seng index has fallen 16 per cent this year, but has been incredibly volatile. The index forged 30 per cent higher between March and May, only to suffer a nasty reversal, slumping by a third.\nThe past week has also been marked by heavy volatility , as early session falls were offset by late rallies. Analysts have pointed to margin calls accelerating the initial losses, with the government then stepping in to provide a steadying hand.\nThe spectre of official intervention to stem losses has sparked concerns any gains are short-term and even illusory.\nSo while Chinese stocks look cheaper, some professional investors are hesitant to call them good value. The MSCI China index trades on 9.8 times reported earnings, which is almost half the value ascribed to the All-Country World Index.\nThe share indices are now in what is described as a \"death cross\", which is formed when the 50-day price average crosses below the 200-day average and indicates the recent falls could signal a long-term period of lower shares.\nThe key question for analysts is how long Chinese authorities can and will continue to prop the stock market up.\nThe fact Beijing felt compelled to intervene pointed to a much bigger issue, PM Capital's Asian portfolio manager, Kevin Bertoli, said, one that made him wary of investing in China.\n \"It's not a rational market place and that makes it much more dramatic and harder to gauge,\" Mr Bertoli said.\n\"Even the situation where the government helps the market fix itself has the same negative starting principle: the economic environment is weak and everything the government has done so far to fix the fundamentals hasn't worked.\"\nThe weakening economy and sharemarket woes could be causing a reverse wealth effect, Mr Bertoli said, pointing to data that shows automobile and smartphone sales are down in the second half of this year for the first time in a decade.\nMr Bertoli said his funds had scope to take up to about 30 Chinese stocks, but had fewer than 10 at the moment. Rather than bring more on board, he is keeping about 30 per cent of the fund's available capital in cash as he waits for the right price to invest.\n\"What investors need to do is be very patient about when they buy into companies as stocks can fluctuate 30 per cent or so in weeks, even businesses where the fundamentals are strong,\" Mr Bertoli said.\nFidelity investment director for Asian ex-Japan equities Catherine Yeung said they were expecting more volatility but hadn't changed the positioning of their funds. Ms Yeung said she was anticipating the market would recover as Chinese authorities launch a range of fiscal policies over the coming months.\n\"The aim of the regulators is to diversify the investor base and particularly to attract more foreign investors as they have a longer term investment horizon and favour blue chip stocks,\" Ms Yeung said.\nMs Yeung said Chinese retail investors favour soaring small cap stocks and can wreak real damage on companies and the market as they often have an investment horizon as short as a week long, causing many to cash out after significant gains and bring the stock crashing back down.\nShe added she understood the anxiety of the many institutional shareholders waiting on the sidelines and concedes periods of intense volatility will continue for some time.\n\"There is nervousness in the market in terms of the investor risk and sentiment. But we were far more nervous as when the market was soaring because so much of that was driven by domestic retail investors. Had the market just corrected to its own natural level, we could have seen more institutional investors come in for then for the attractive valuations.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/china-stocks-plunger-further-as-investors-eye-state-retreat-20150819-gj2q58.html", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-08-21T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:50:13.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
