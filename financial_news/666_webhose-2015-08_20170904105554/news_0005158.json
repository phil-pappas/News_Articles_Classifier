But they also have changed the distribution of wealth, and ever rising prices are unlikely to make us better off as a nation.\nThe RBA cut its official cash rate to fire up housing construction and business investment. But in Australia, it seems, before there can be a decent housing construction revival there must be a residential land price boom.\nFor most of us, the thrill of discovering the new wealth beneath our feet lasted only as long as it took to discover the price of buying anything better. It was a reminder of a former Bank of England governor's famous dictum: housing wealth isn't wealth.\nThat, economists say, is only a slight exaggeration. Bubbles aside, only those \"long housing\", as the Porsche drivers say, are likely to be genuinely wealthier.\nFor those struggling to get into the market, the increase in residential land prices is a new and even higher barrier. However, for those who already have a property, there can be genuine gains in wealth.\nWe talk about housing wealth, but as Lowe explains, the real source of capital gains is the land.\nGenerational loss Housing wealth is not like sharemarket wealth. We live in houses, and we consume housing services for which we either pay or impute rent.\nImpute? There is a large item in the national accounts called \"ownership of dwellings\", which includes the imputed value of housing services accruing to owner-occupiers from their occupation of their own residences. It's the rental income you give up in order to live in a house that you could have let out to someone else.\nIf the value of your residence exceeds the present value of the housing services you plan to consume over the rest of your life, you have a surplus of consumable wealth that you can tap by, for example, taking out a reverse mortgage. And if the value of your land rises, so does your wealth.\nLike a market rent, the value of housing services you consume in your own home rises with the market price of the property. However, the dollar value of any gap between the two increases even as they rise at the same rate.\nAs Lowe explains, for an older person who owns their own home and has no children, the dollar value of the capital gain from the higher land prices is greater than the dollar increase in expected future housing costs.\nThe same is true for the owners of investment properties, because they own multiple properties on which they earn a capital gain. The capital gains on all their properties exceed the increase in the cost of their personal housing services.\nHowever, the older generation's gain can be the younger generation's loss. Lowe gives the example of young home owners with multiple children.\n\"If they care about the future housing costs of their children, then, in some circumstances, it is possible that the higher future expected housing costs could exceed the capital gain on their dwelling,\" he says. \"In a welfare sense, the increase in land prices could make them worse off, even though they own land.\"\nThe same, of course, is true of renters, who don't have any capital gain to offset the higher future housing costs.\nProxy for income growth I suppose some of the Porsche drivers who sweep past my wheezing Mazda must be property investors, but they all look too young to be using reverse mortgages.\nPerhaps the non-property investors are high-flying examples of a phenomenon Lowe talks about, in which people take the increase in housing prices as a proxy for faster expected income growth into the future.\nLowe gives the example of renters who increased their spending on consumption when house prices in their area went up. Increases in residential land values can be readily used as collateral by people who want to increase their consumption.\nOf course, the debt has to be serviced and, if things don't work out as well as some of the borrowers expect, there will be a period of lower consumption in the future. For some it could be a case of goodbye Porsche, hello Hyundai.\nHow did the Irish finance minister, Brian Lenihan, put it? \"While I have it I'll spend it, and when I don't I won't.\"\nWhat may be charming, happy-go-luckiness at the individual level can be highly dangerous at the macro level. Australian household debt is high, and the outlook for income growth is uncertain.\nAs Lowe puts it: \"It is unlikely to be in our long-term interest for a consumption boom to be financed by a pick-up in household borrowing.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-dg-2015-08-12.html"], "published": "2015-08-14T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:14:25.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
