The Japanese yen hit a two-month low of 125.08 to the U.S. dollar.\nThe euro, buoyed by the Greece deal, rose 0.2 percent to $1.1040.\n\"Devaluation of the yuan likely won't end here. Currencies like the Singapore dollar, South Korean won and Taiwan dollar which stand to compete with China, are falling and today's move could generate headlines heralding the start of a devaluation war,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, senior strategist at Monex in Tokyo.\nU.S. reaction will be crucial. Washington has for years pressed Beijing to free up the exchange rate to allow the yuan to strengthen, reflecting growth in the world's second-largest economy.\nToday, China's economy is slowing and the new exchange rate mechanism gives markets greater ability to push the yuan lower, just as the United States prepares to raise interest rates - a step that should add to dollar strength.\nEuropean shares fell. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.5 percent, led lower by car makers and luxury goods companies, whose products just got more expensive for Chinese consumers. Shares in Athens rose 1.6 percent.\nThis followed falls in Asia. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gave up early gains and was last down 1.2 percent at its lowest since February 2014. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.4 percent.\nOn Chinese stock markets, airlines and importers fell, though exporters rose. The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen lost 0.4 percent and the Shanghai Composite closed flat.\nBONDS\nWeak stocks boosted top-rated bonds. Germany's benchmark fell 2.7 basis points to 0.68 percent and U.S. 10-year yields dropped more than 4 basis points to 2.19 percent.\nThe deal on a third bailout for Greece also helped yields on lower-rated Spanish and Italian bonds drop 3 bps apiece while Greek two-year yields fell 4 percentage points to 15.25 percent.\n\"The Chinese devaluation was taken as 'things are not going that well in China' and this is a risk-off move,\" said Martin van Vliet, senior rate strategist at ING, adding that \"with the Greek deal secured and the ECB continuously buying bonds, peripheral spreads would have been much tighter otherwise.\"\nOil prices fell as the dollar strengthened. Brent crude was last down 32 cents a barrel at $50.09.\nGold fell as low as $1,093.25 before recovering to $1,114.56.
