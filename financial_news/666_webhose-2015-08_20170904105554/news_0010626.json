This would be the first step for us to return to the markets and regain their trust, if of course simultaneously we have managed to return to positive rates of growth,\" he said.\nWhile Syriza wants an outright majority - something it narrowly missed in January - the strength of its support is unclear due to a lack of surveys by leading pollsters in the past month when much has changed. Last week, 25 out of Syriza's 149 lawmakers walked out to form a new anti-bailout party.\nWill Tsakalotos run for Syriza?\nThe defection has done nothing to heal the rift in Syriza. Many of the 43 lawmakers who refused to back the bailout in parliament remain in the party, at least for the time being.\nBut more seriously, there are also misgivings among members of Syriza's mainstream \"53+\" faction, including lawmakers who reluctantly backed the bailout for the sake of the party and the nation.\nThese include Tsakalotos, the British-educated economist who clinched the deal, and former government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis, members of the faction said. \"Neither Tsakalotos nor Sakellaridis have yet made clear whether they will run in the upcoming election,\" a member of the faction told Reuters.\nTsipras signalled he had won them over, saying both would run for Syriza. \"Euclid Tsakalotos has done a marvellous job and it's true that if he wasn't for him, we wouldn't have achieved a deal,\" he said.\nThis warmth contrasted to the scorn he poured on his previous finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who became a cult figure among anti-austerity campaigners across Europe for attacking the eurozone establishment.\nTsipras recalled one session of particularly tough negotiations in June - just before he closed Greek banks for three weeks to save them from collapse - with IMF chief Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank head Mario Draghi and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\"Varoufakis was talking but nobody paid any attention to him. They had switched off, they didn't listen to what he was saying,\" said Tsipras. \"He had lost his credibility.\"\nTsakalotos has won the trust of his fellow eurozone finance ministers despite his left-wing views. But he has yet to confirm his candidacy in the election.\nUnder the Greek political system, Tsakalotos could still serve in a future government even if he is not a member of parliament. But if he failed to run for Syriza, this would be a blow to Tsipras who needs the \"53+\" faction if he is to hold the party together, win the election and implement the bailout programme.\nPresident Pavlopoulos has asked a conservative and the leader of the new anti-bailout party to try to form a new government, but the former has already failed and the latter is due to give up formally on Thursday.\nThe official at the presidency stressed that the timetable could still change, but Pavlopoulos intended to appoint a caretaker premier, Supreme Court judge Vassiliki Thanou, on Friday (28 August), and call the election. Thanou would become Greece's first female prime minister, but only until a new government is formed.\nEurActiv.com with agencies ,", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPb2NkcCctY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBDJz-Ojmt0"], "published": "2015-08-27T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:37:14.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
