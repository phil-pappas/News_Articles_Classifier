Chris Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Commonwealth Bank of Australia has tightened its lending to apartment developers because new capital requirements, and particularly the restrictions on lending to investors, increase the settlement risk at the end of the project.\nThe Australian Financial Review has learnt that over 10 finance negotiations between CBA and apartment developers have fallen over at very late stages in the process because CBA has changed its lending terms and required a higher level of loan coverage.\nCBA neither confirmed nor denied the move.\n\"We have been growing our business in this market and in line with our usual business practice for all market segments, we regularly review our risk policy settings,\" a CBA spokesman said.\n\"Commonwealth Bank assesses each development on its own merits in determining presales requirements which will vary from project to project. It is business as usual for Commonwealth Bank on property development financing.\"\nLoan-to-value ratios Prospective developers have been told that the bank now requires the percentage of pre-sold apartments must now equate to 100 per cent or more of the debt provided by the bank. It used to be about 80 per cent. The loan-to-value ratios have also apparently changed. The bank will only lend 75 per cent of the total development cost, down from 80 per cent.\nThe Australian Prudential and Regulatory Authority has put pressure on the banks to rein in the lending to investors. As the rules for end buyers tighten – the AMP Bank has stopped lending to investors for off the plan apartments all together –​ the risk of not settling on such purchases has started to rise.\n Banks risk divisions have become concerned that the settlement risk to individual purchasers on completion of a project will be heightened as a result of APRA's requirement that they increase their equity allocation on residential mortgages used for investment purposes from 16 per cent to 25 per cent by July next year.\n'Number of options' CBA chief financial officer David Craig said a fortnight ago that in expectation of APRA's recent announcements the bank was \"working on a number of options for managing our capital\" and that the bank would provide more commentary when it presented its annual results on August 12.\nNational developers such as David Devine's Metro Property Development are seeing the tighter lending conditions from the big banks.\n\"The banks are tightening up their lending because they feel the market might be heating up,\" Mr Devine said, \"They are doing it because they are concerned about speculators.\"\nHowever, Mr Devine said that while tighter lending conditions would hurt smaller and later entrants to the development sector established players like himself could benefit.\nGuidelines have tightened Chairman of development finance broker Holden Capital Steve Wiltshire said that bank guidelines on lending had definitely tightened.\n\"We are also seeing some banks limit their appetite in the sector and increasing their requirements on developers seeking construction loan approvals,\" Mr Wiltshire said.\n\"Over the past 12 months we have witnessed the major banks in particular, easing their lending requirements as they vied for their share of income from those projects. However, over the past month we have seen a significant shift in attitude with many of the banks reverting to 75 per cent or less in terms of their loan to cost ratio and a tightening of the pre-sale requirements back to a 100 per cent from as low as 35 per cent.\"\nMr Wiltshire said that while some may see this as a means of slowing the levels of investment borrowing in the home loan sector, it is likely that smaller banks and other institutional lenders will take advantage of the opportunity to fill the gap.\nGresham Property joint managing director Ami Simon said that there had been a strong interest in the groups latest lending fund opened just over a month ago.\n\"Since launching our new fund which provides a different offering to the traditional banks, GPF No 5 has seen a strong level of developer demand,\" Mr Simon said.\n\"The Fund does not adhere to hard and fast guidelines with respect to presales, the level of presales we require depends on the project and our assessment of the project's risks.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-08-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:13:01.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
