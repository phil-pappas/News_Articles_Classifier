Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine) . \nPoliquin spoke with TheStreet's Rhonda Schaffler at Camp Kotok , an annual gathering of economists and money managers in Maine. Poliquin said the Dodd-Frank Act , which was signed in 2010 and changed financial regulation, is too burdernsome. \"We need to make sure we keep credit flowing throughout the economy, because if money flows through the economy, the businesses grow and you hire more workers and folks make a fatter paycheck. That's all good,\" said Poliquin, who added the regulations are preventing that from happening.Poliquin said that parts of the law should be reformed so that credit is accessible from community banks, credit unions and auto finance companies. On another topic, Poliquin said the most important issue for the Presidential candidates is job creation . \"We need to get government out of the way of the private sector,\" said Poliquin, who cited statistics from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which found that the total cost of federal regulations on businesses is $1.9-trillion dollars annually. \"What's happening is, these regulations have gone way overboard, they're smothering our businesses who are not able to grow the way they should be,\" he said. On another topic, the congressman commented on new environmental regulations put forward in President Obama's Clean Power Plan , saying that he was worried the proposal \"is far too reaching and harmful to Maine's hardworking businesses and employees.' Poliquin previously served as State Treasurer of Maine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:07:45.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
