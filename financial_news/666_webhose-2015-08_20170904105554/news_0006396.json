Some of this has to do with wages, some with fewer laws regulating air pollution and so on.\nBut a large portion of the reason why Chinese goods are so cheap stems from the value of its currency in world financial markets. Although most currencies float against the others, not all do.\nChina is one of those countries whose currency does not float. It is tethered to the dollar at a level USDCNY, +0.0266% well below its true worth. In other words, the yuan’s value is tightly managed low by the Chinese government — ostensibly to allow its export sector a chance to grow.\nAs you know, an undervalued currency makes a country’s exports cheap and imports more expensive. This encourages goods made in that country to flow out while restricting the inflow of imported merchandise.\nEstimates of the amount by which the yuan is undervalued vary, but if the Economist’s Big Mac Index has it right, the yuan could well be undervalued by as much as 43%!\nAnd this is before last week’s devaluation.\nImpacts of the Chinese Economic Crash, Explained (2:34)\nOn the other hand, the International Monetary Fund declared in May that it no longer judged the yuan to be undervalued.\nSo why did China devalue an already weak currency? I can think of at least two reasons.\nThe first is that its struggling economy needs a lift, and, as noted above, this move will help exporters. Second, because it is tied to the dollar, the yuan has already risen against the currencies of most of its trading partners and may rise further if and when the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates.\nAlso read: David Marsh says China isn’t engaged in a currency war\nBesides the usual effects on its trading partners, China’s devaluation will have other, less noticed consequences. These currency moves will depress sales of high-end goods in fancy shopping centers, and even real estate, here in the United States.\nFor some time now, wealthy Chinese have been taking money out of China and investing it stateside. It is not unusual to see Chinese bidding up prices of luxury homes in neighborhoods with good schools, offering to pay cash at times. They think nothing of plunking down thousands of dollars to buy designer pocketbooks, clothes and jewelry. However, this urge to splurge is cooling off, now that the yuan is worth less than before, and may head even lower still.\nThose countries that don’t follow China’s devaluation will experience slower growth and less inflation. This is bad news and good news for a country like ours.\nThe bad news is less growth in an already slow-growth economy risks keeping unemployment from falling further. The good news is that this may very well stay the Federal Reserve’s hand when it comes to boosting interest rates — especially since most other central banks are actually loosening their monetary policies.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2015/pr15237.htm", "http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T14:11:00.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
