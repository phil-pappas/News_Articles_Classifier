It’s made without synthetic chemicals, fragrances or dyes, according to the product listing on the website. Most sunscreens on the market contain the active ingredient zinc oxide, with levels that typically register between the recommended 18% to 25%. The Honest Company decreased the amount of zinc oxide to 9.3% at some point, according to an investigation by NBC 5 in Chicago .\nNBC 5 reported that the product has been “discontinued” at a local Target and is also unavailable at a local Nordstrom. The sunscreen is currently out of stock on The Honest Company’s website though it’s still available on Amazon, where roughly 60% of customers have given it one star. Honest Company told NBC 5 the sunscreen has not been discontinued.\nThe company maintains the integrity of the product, saying in a statement that the sunscreen has been tested by a third party to meet FDA standards with results showing “our product is effective and safe for use.”\nThe Honest Company also said that it has been transparent regrading the amount of zinc used in its sunscreen since the new formula was released this year.\nA small number of sunscreen users may disagree with that assessment, however, taking to Amazon’s review section, Twitter and Facebook over the weekend to complain and post images of sunburned bodies.\nMy best friend used @jessicaalba #honest #sunscreen - after about 40 minutes in the sun she looks like this #SunBurn pic.twitter.com/Nwszxr9uRZ\n— THE MAN ® (@DJ_DTM) August 2, 2015 Don't buy @Honest sunscreen unless u want to look like this.
