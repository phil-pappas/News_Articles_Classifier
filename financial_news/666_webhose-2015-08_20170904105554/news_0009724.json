However, a huge decline in the US markets the previous Saturday, followed up by crashing markets in Asia, led to a major fall in Indian markets.

The Indian market continued to act in sympathy with the global markets on Tuesday. After a huge crash across all markets on Monday, the Asian markets were all mostly up except that of China and Japan, while European markets were trading sharply higher and so were US futures. This rubbed off on the Indian markets which staged a modest rally. Global markets also got a boost with a surprise rate cut by China in later afternoon.

The US markets staged a huge recovery on Wednesday. On Thursday, the market recovered a bit. The US reported that it logged in strong economic growth in the June quarter which sent the US markets higher again on Thursday.
