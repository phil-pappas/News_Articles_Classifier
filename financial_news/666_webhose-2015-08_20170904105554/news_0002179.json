Alex Ellinghausen by Phillip Coorey Jacob Greber The Abbott government is on a collision course with big business by pushing ahead with the introduction of an effects test that would limit the market power of retail giants and help smaller businesses and innovators flourish.\nFederal cabinet is scheduled to discuss Small Business Minister Bruce Billson's plan to change the Competition Act when it meets in Adelaide on Tuesday, bringing forward the potential introduction of the test, which would ban the misuse of market power that has the effect of ­substantially lessening competition.\nThe new test would set a much lower threshold than the current test, which requires proof of an anti-competitive purpose or intent. Proving such a purpose has been a key stumbling block that has led to practically no successful prosecutions under the law.\nThe effects test was recommended by the broader Harper review into competition , which the government commissioned upon coming into power and to which it will respond in full later this year. The test would toughen section 46 of the Competition Act.\nAn effects test would limit the market power of retail giants and help smaller businesses and innovators flourish. Gabriele Charotte Business Council of Australia president Catherine Livingstone slammed the proposed changes as anti-competitive, a risk to small and big business and likely to expose companies to risk of prosecution due to competition effects that cannot be anticipated.\nThe changes \"would have significant unintended consequences for the economy and consumers, and would undermine rather than improve the competitive process,\" she said.\nMs Livingstone said the concept of changes to \"misuse of market power\" laws have been rejected by several reviews in recent times. \"At the very least, cabinet needs plenty of time to consider a thorough, independent assessment of the costs and benefits of the proposal through the Productivity Commission before proceeding,\" she said.\n\"Small business needs to understand they will not be quarantined … for example, in regional towns or markets where a small business' product or service is dominant.\"\n Came to a head The issue came to a head in June at a private Business Council dinner in Canberra, which was attended by Mr Abbott and about nine of his most senior minsters. People were left in little doubt that the government intended to proceed with the test.\nAt the dinner, Business Council president Catherine Livingstone urged Mr Abbott to proceed with \"sensible reform\", which she defined as not including an effects test.\nIn what witnesses described as a testy moment, Mr Abbott, in his response, thanked Ms Livingstone but said \"we will proceed with reforms as we see fit, even if it means changes to competition law\".\nGovernment sources said the BCA's claims were baseless and a scare campaign. The changes to be studied by cabinet were not about hamstringing big business and competition, but focused on encouraging new entrants and innovators. There was no intention to harm big business.\nShadow Treasurer Chris Bowen criticised Mr Abbott for campaigning against a price on carbon because of potential cost-of-living impact, yet now supported higher prices in supermarkets.\n\"After weeks of lurching from news report to news report about the former speaker's travel entitlement abuses, the Prime Minister seems intent not only on making crazy economic policy, but making it on the run.\n\"And where is Joe Hockey in all of this?\" Mr Bowen said. \"Labor has consistently been opposed to an effects test, which will chill competition in the economy and see higher consumer prices.\"\nCoalition MPs in marginal regional seats will be forced to explain to their constituents that they voted to increase local grocery prices, former Labor competition minister Craig Emerson said.\nEmerson slams Coalition Writing for Tuesday's The Australian Financial Review , Dr Emerson slammed the Coalition for succumbing to \"its anti-competitive instincts again\" by pushing ahead with the effects test.\n\"The commissioning of the Harper review was always a ruse. Instead of saying no to small business demands for protection against competition, the government promised a root-and-branch review of competition policy, nudging and winking to protectionist lobbies that all would be well after the election.\"\nThe Business Council, which lobbies on behalf of big companies, has a list of 18 examples of how the change would hamper competition, such as blocking a company that decides to expand capacity in excess of its current requirements, as part of a longer-term plan, but with the effect of deterring a new entrant.\nThe law may block a company from discounting to levels that competitors can't match, after finding new production systems that dramatically reduce costs. Even refusing to supply a competitor or exposing their product defects could be sanctioned.\nMr Billson has long expressed support for a switch from a purpose to an effects test, as has current ACCC chairman Rod Sims and a former chairman Allan Fels .\nOne of the greatest opponents of the change, Wesfarmers chief executive officer Richard Goyder , said last year that an effects test would \"deter businesses from seeking ­efficiencies and keeping prices low and could even restrict the ability of ­businesses to offer quality services.\n\"There is a very serious risks the ­consumers would be made worse off,\" he said.\nThe Abbott government commissioned the Harper review amid growing concerns, including from within its own ranks, of the impact of the market dominance of Coles and Woolworths and their subsidiaries.\nThese concerns extended to the impact on smaller businesses that cannot compete with the buying power of the giants and the supermarkets' suppliers who complain about low prices for their produce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:11:25.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
