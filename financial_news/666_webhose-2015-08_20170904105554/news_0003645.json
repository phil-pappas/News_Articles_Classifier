Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan A spike in demand for office spaces in Australia's main cities, Sydney and Melbourne, and a net fall in national office vacancies around the country are evidence the national economy is making the move from the mining boom and growing in non-mining sectors.\nIn Sydney and Melbourne, service businesses such as education providers, banks, fintech hubs, government departments and insurance groups are snapping up offices spaces for expansion and growth, the Property Council of Australia's July Office Market Report has shown.\nSydney's vacancy rate has fallen to 6.3 per cent in July from 7.4 per cent in January while Melbourne's vacancy is at 8.1 per cent from 9.1 per cent.\n\"We had grown a lot and just moved into new office spaces at 155 Clarence Street in November but once we moved in we realised we were growing even faster than we thought, and had to take out another two floors,\" Tyro Payments' head of marketing and communications, Fiona Stollmann said.\nMassive growth The technology company, which provides integrated payment services firms to small and medium businesses, started about ten years ago and has successfully \"disrupted\" traditional banking services, growing nearly 100 per cent in size last year.\nIt has 230 staff and leases five floors measuring 3900 square metres at 155 Clarence Street in Sydney after relocating from two floors in York Street. One of the floors is dedicated to its fintech hub.\nProperty Council's chief executive Ken Morrison said office demand in Sydney and Melbourne is double the historical average.\n \"Surging demand for office space in Sydney and Melbourne is one of the strongest signals yet that Australia's transition from a mining investment dominated economy is taking hold,\" he said.\n\"In another healthy sign, office vacancy rates actually fell in 17 of the 23 markets measured by this report.\"\nColliers International's managing director in office leasing, Simon Hunt, said Colliers had increased its leasing by 22 per cent to 241,551 square metres from 198,360 square metres.\n\"In terms of demand for office space nationally, there has been increased traction at the larger end of the market,\" he said.\nFinancial and tech sectors fuel demand Mr Hunt also said there has been a shift in the types of industries looking for office space in the two main cities with government firms dominating in 2014 and business services, communications and finance catching up in 2015.\nMMJ Real Estate's chief executive, Chris Johnson also agreed the tech sector and financial services were fuelling demand while most withdrawals of space in Sydney and Melbourne were a result of the conversion of office buildings into residential developments.\nInsurance giant, IAG expanded in Melbourne with 4238 square metres at 414 La Trobe Street in Melbourne. New education business, Australian Technical & Management College claimed 4760 square metres at 399 Lonsdale Street.\nCommonwealth Bank took out 5019 square metres of offices at 1 Market Street while Bank of Queensland signed up for 2600 square metres at 2 Chifley Square in Sydney.\nWhile the Sydney and Melbourne markets were buoyant, Savills national head of office leasing, Rob Dickins, said there would be some downward contraction before the year end and at the start of 2016.\n\"The undeniable aspect is that tenants are ready and willing to move and that shows a growing confidence in those markets.\"\nThe positive result – the national average office vacancy rate which decreased from 10.8 percent to 10.4 percent over the last six months – was not seen in all cities.\nPerth vacancies up Perth's vacancy rate continued to climb and is now the highest in Australia. Brisbane CBD saw a decline in the office vacancy rate for the first time in three years.\n\"This reality will have different implications for the market and for policy makers in each city,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"Sydney and Melbourne need governments to invest in infrastructure and the public domain to support the work of the private sector. Other cities need more support to stimulate economic activity.\"\nDespite the challenging conditions in other cities outside Sydney and Melbourne, Knight Frank's head of office leasing John Preece said the outlook was good.\n\"Notwithstanding, even in these challenging markets, deals are being done which is a positive sign, and occupier activity in Brisbane has increased in recent months,\" he said.\n\"In Adelaide, tenants are taking advantage of good deals in better quality buildings to upgrade their premises, and in Canberra the department of finance push to better use existing leased office space is forcing a reduction in government sub-lease availability.\"\n\"Overall business confidence is good, with both overseas corporates and local business seeking higher quality premises and better working environments for their employees. This bodes well for the year ahead.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-08-05T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:04:58.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
