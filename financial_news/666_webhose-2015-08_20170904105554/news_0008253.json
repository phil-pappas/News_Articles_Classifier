The \nminutes are pretty consistent with what was said in the \nstatement,\" said David Keeble, global head of interest rates \nstrategy at Credit Agricole (Swiss: ACA.SW - news ) in New York. \nMany investors and economists see the Fed as most likely to \nstart the rates \"liftoff\" next month as unemployment falls below \nits targets. Low inflation and still moderate U.S. growth, \nhowever, are seen holding the Fed back from aggressive rate \nhikes and may still push back the first increase. \n\"I think September is still in play, but these minutes \ndefinitely came out as dovish and lean more towards a rate hike \nlater in the year or into next year,\" said Cantor Fitzgerald's \nLederer. \nYields had increased earlier on Wednesday after data showed \nconsumer prices rose on July. \nThe Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged up \n0.1 percent last month after advancing 0.3 percent in June, \nmarking the sixth straight monthly increase. \nIn the 12 months through July, the CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) climbed 0.2 percent. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was the second straight month in which the annual CPI \nincreased after plunging crude oil prices pushed it into \nnegative territory in January. \n(Additional reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Paul Simao \nand Jonathan Oatis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T21:54:40.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
