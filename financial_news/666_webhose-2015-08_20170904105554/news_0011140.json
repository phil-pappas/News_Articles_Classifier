The energy committee, in its report, called on the Senate to open up the market fully to private sector participation, an electricity law and an act for the new LEC or its successor. \nIn the report submitted to the plenary of the Senate, the committee claimed that the establishment of an independent and transparent regulatory process will be essential for the creation of an environment conducive to increase private sector involvement in the energy sector, as contained in the National Energy Policy. \"To achieve independence and transparency, the institutional framework must avoid conflicts of interest and overlapping roles by separating policy setting, regulatory oversight, and policy implementation and operation,\" the committee said.

It is believed that this will enable both urban and rural businesses and residents to have easy access to cheap and affordable electricity as with the telecommunication sector. \nThe Senate energy committee also informed plenary in its report that whatever electricity law the legislature intend to enact, the roles must be assigned to three institutions. In the law, the Ministry of Lands, Mines and energy will be assigned the role to have energy policy oversight while an independent energy regulatory board, commission or authority will monitor policy implementation by all operators, whether owned by the public sector, private sector, or local communities. \nThe second piece of legislation, which has not yet been drafted, will deal with and fully define the new role of the LEC or its successor company. The committee said during its investigation that it discovered that the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) has a quasi-monopoly over the commercial generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, which the LEC has failed to provide despite support from donors. The committee also said it has discovered that most businesses in Liberia run small private generators at very high costs, which they claim, is killing a number of businesses.
