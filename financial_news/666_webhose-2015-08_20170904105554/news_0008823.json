The new leader of Labour, which suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives in May, is expected to be announced on Sept. 12. \nCorbyn's emergence as a front-runner has surprised many people as he initially struggled to secure a nomination. Blair, in office from 1997-2007, has urged Labour to reject Corbyn and embrace a more centrist candidate if it wants to regain power.
