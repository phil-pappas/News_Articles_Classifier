ROBYN EDIE/ Fairfax NZ by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Could a bank holiday really hold up a $2 billion trade?\nThat's the question fund managers were asking on Monday, after going to their brokers to enquire about Origin Energy's stake in Contact Energy.\nAs Street Talk had predicted, Contact Energy played a role in Tiwai Point's new electricity contract by agreeing to supply 80 megawatts a year to the Rio Tinto-backed aluminium smelter.\nBrokers told clients the deal was likely to cost Contact Energy a few million dollars a year but was a good deal for the electricity industry and a good deal for Contact.\nContact shares even gained 1.4 per cent to $NZ5.02 in trade across the Tasman.\nBut despite the good news, the bank holiday was said to be holding up any chance of Origin Energy selling down its 53.1 per cent stake. And so Contact Energy, which has also attracted strategic interest, remains top of the list for equities desks with businesses in both New Zealand and Australia.\nIt also comes amid expectations another Kiwi power player - Solid Energy - was set to head into liquidation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:19:13.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
