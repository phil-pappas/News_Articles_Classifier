Photo: Supplied\nRudimentary buildings from the 1960s on the Clayton campus have been targeted for improvement under Monash University's master plan.\nThe Clayton campus is dotted with several of the brown brick buildings. Unremarkable in appearance, these buildings are, in the main, not thermally efficient or inviting to occupy.\nSo it's not surprising that part of the master plan, headed by architect Rob McGauran of MGS Architects, has included alterations and additions to many of these brick edifices.\nThe innovative JCB Architects' Monash University science faculty. Photo: Supplied\n\"The other issue was creating a network of spaces and channels surrounding the new Lyons building Green Chemical Futures,\" says architect Graham Burrows, one of three directors at Jackson Clements Burrows (JCB) Architects.\n\"These 1960s buildings are integral to the urban renewal master plan as well as shaping a new identity for them,\" he says.\nMGS Architects' master plan included three buildings, all bordering a new outdoor space for science students at Monash University.\nRather than treat each of the three buildings in a different manner, JCB saw the opportunity to create unique identities using what it referred to as a \"kit of parts\": steel to frame windows, blades in varying hues and double-glazed windows.\n\"We wanted to create strong contemporary buildings, but, importantly, engage with the landscape and the new east-west and north-south linkages conceived in the scheme,\" Burrows says.\nJCB has engaged with both the new square and walkways by utilising coloured steel battens on undercrofts and creating distinctive points of arrival.\nThe entry to the first-year students' physics and astrophysics laboratory features an angular, pale blue, origami-like canopy and glass doors. These additions are clearly delineated from the brown brick buildings.\n\"We saw the overall design like a kit of parts. When the university is ready to expand its renewal program, it can proceed in the same architectural style,\" Burrows says.\nWhile the three buildings appear new from most vantage points, the interiors have been changed to accommodate learning in the 21st century.\nMany of the buildings have been gutted to allow light-filled interiors and to provide a level of engagement with students strolling past.\nThe active learning centre, for example, on a ground floor, is now a vast, open plan space, with a variety of seating, from banquette to round tables and benches.\n\"This area is open virtually around the clock for first-year students. As well as having tutors available, it's a place for students to hang out with friends,\" Burrows says.\nOther areas, such as study areas and offices, have been reconfigured from the 1960s era. Central corridors, with enclosed rooms either side, have been replaced with a more transparent arrangement of workstations and glass-sided work areas. And to ensure northern light reaches all spaces, JCB Architects has designed banquette-style seating around the periphery of the building.\nThe design includes generous areas for whiteboards. Rather than being positioned in front of a class, these whiteboards double as walls.\n\"Science students regularly write formulas and test theories on boards, and the idea was to maximise this process, rather than confining this to one corner,\" Burrows says.\nAlthough creating several highly specialised spaces for science students proved a complex assignment for the architects, so was the timeline to delivery.\n\"This project had to be fast-tracked to allow the Lyons development to proceed on time. And, obviously, when you are redesigning student buildings, there are always the concerns of making sure classes continue during the construction phase,\" Burrows says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:12:27.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
