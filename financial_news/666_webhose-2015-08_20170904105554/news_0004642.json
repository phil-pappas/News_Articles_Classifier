While the currency and credit markets are reasonably factoring that situation in, the country's domestic equity market has yet to \"adequately price in such a risk,\" Stuhlberger wrote.\n\"On the economic and political fronts, we continue to flirt with an abyss,\" he said.\nIn a crisis whose intensity has been likened to the one that led to former President Fernando Collor de Mello's impeachment in 1992, Rousseff is struggling to cut spending and fend off opposition calls to step down after her government became ensnared in a corruption scandal at state-owned firms. Investors are closely attuned to further turbulence that could knock efforts to stabilize the economy off track.\nSao Paulo-based Verde posted a consolidated return of 5.41 percent in July, the highest in 10 months. Verde, which has been closed to new investors for years, recorded an accumulated 21 percent return this year, compared with 7.16 percent for the benchmark CDI interbank lending rate.\nThe letter suggested that Stuhlberger's long-time bets on a generalized decline in Brazilian assets this year are finally paying off.\nThe Brazilian real touched the lowest level in more than 12 years on Thursday after shedding as much as 2 percent to hit 3.562 reais to the dollar. The benchmark Bovespa stock index is trading near the lowest levels in eight years, when measured in dollars.\nVerde oversees about 30 billion reais ($9 billion) in assets.\n($1 = 3.5333 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal and Paula Arend Laier; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:06:28.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
