More Court rejects relaxing rules for builders \nThe report comes only months before the outcome of a major review into the current account sector by the Competition and Markets Authority, launched following concerns over the lack of transparency. \nThe research found 55 per cent of customers “find it impossible” to determine the value of their account, in terms of cost and what they receive in return, preventing many from seeking a better deal elsewhere. \nIt said many people find it tough to “make meaningful comparisons” on the most important elements, including overdraft fees, charges and credit interest. \nBut only 14 per cent of consumers believe there are large differences between current accounts, the report added. \nBenny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, warned people are often not aware that banks are making “billions of pounds in foregone interest” — money that customers could have earned if they had moved account. \nForegone interest is the largest source of current account revenue for banks, generating about £3.2bn in 2013, representing an average of £50 a customer, according to the CMA. \nThe watchdog said in a study last year that while most current accounts are “free if in credit” — meaning no regular charges are applied — people still pay through interest foregone on their credit balances and overdraft charges. \n“These costs are typically more complex to grasp for customers than, for example, a monthly fee,” the watchdog said, adding it is “therefore critical” that current accounts have sufficient transparency about the cost of different features. \nHarriett Baldwin, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: “The government is committed to increasing competition in banking to improve outcomes for consumers: more competition means banks have to strive to offer the best possible products and services to their customers.” \nThe government launched a service in 2013 designed to make moving providers easier. \nHowever, critics believe the level of current account switching is low. Some 1.16m current account holders switched last year, representing only 2.3 per cent of the total number of accounts in the UK. \nJayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of challenger bank Virgin Money, recently told the Financial Times that Britain’s “free” in-credit banking model needs to change to stoke competition and prevent another mis-selling crisis. \nShe said the reason account switching is low is that there is no differentiation between current accounts. \nThe bank has plans to launch into the current account market and is trialling a digital payments account that it expects to launch widely at the start of next year.
