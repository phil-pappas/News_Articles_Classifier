GETTY You could get £430 each if your flight is cancelled \nYet many Britons still fail to realise they may be due compensation if their flight departs from or arrives in the European Union.Nearly a million Britons a year could get a payout but many are losing hundreds of pounds by failing to file a claim.Here is how to get compensation. Holiday hell Last year, more than 9,000 flights were delayed for three hours or more, according to an investigation by Which?, meaning around 900,000 passengers may be due compensation, but only just over a third bother to claim. This may be because half of passengers delayed said they received no support or information from the airline. Which? found that Gatwick was the worst airport for delays, hitting 200,000 passenger journeys. Short-haul flights on airlines Vueling, Monarch and Thomas Cook were most likely to be hit. For long-haul flights, Pakistan International Airlines, Air India or American Airlines were most often delayed. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd, says: “We are urging people to hold their airline to account and if delayed claim the compensation they are rightly owed.” Related articles Flight delays: Simple online check for travellers \nFlight rights Compensation rules apply to all flights between EU countries. They also apply to all flights departing from an EU airport to further afield, even if the airline is from outside Europe, for instance, an American Airlines flight from London to New York. The rules only apply to EU arrivals if you fly with an EU carrier. Bizarrely, this means an American Airlines flight from New York to London would be excluded, although the same flight with BA would be covered. If your flight qualifies and is delayed by more than two hours, your airline must offer you a “welfare package”. Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket.com, says: “This includes food, drinks, two phone calls and, if you are delayed overnight, accommodation plus transport.”Whether you qualify depends on the length of your flight and how long it is delayed. If you are flying short haul from Manchester to Frankfurt, a trip of less than 1,500km, you can claim your welfare package after a delay of two hours. The delay must be more than three hours for medium-haul flights up to 3,500km, for instance from London to Athens, or more than four hours for long-haul flights. Atkinson says: “If your airline does not give you a welfare package, you can claim back any meals, transport and hotel costs from the airline. Just remember to keep the receipts.” If your flight is cancelled or arrives more than three hours late, you may be able to claim compensation on top. You could be eligible for up to ¤250 (£180), ¤400 (£285) or ¤600 (£430), depending on whether your flight is short, medium or long haul. Atkinson adds you cannot claim if the delay is due to “extraordinary circumstances”: “This might include strikes or a volcanic ash cloud, but you are still entitled to the welfare package.” Getting even If you think you are due compensation, contact your airline direct. Each airline has a slightly different claims procedure, which should be set out on its website. Also, the Civil Aviation Authority website (Caa.co.uk) shows what information to include. It also has a downloadable complaints letter template, as does Which.co.uk. Claims companies are springing up to help people seeking compensation, but Atkinson says think twice before using them: “The claims process is straightforward so why share your refund with them?”Getting compensation can take time, but if you feel your claim has been unfairly rejected, the CAA may argue your case. Be warned: getting compensation from non-European airlines can be tricky. Also, you will not get any compensation if you arrive late at the airport and miss your departure. Some travel insurance policies may cover this, but only if the cause was out of your hands, say, if your car broke down or you were affected by industrial action.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T09:34:58.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
