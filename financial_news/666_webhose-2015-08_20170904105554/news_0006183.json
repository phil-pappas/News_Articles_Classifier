They target a three- and six-month price of $1,500 per tonne and a 12-month price of $1,550 per tonne. \nWhile the bank's super bearish view of copper attracted much comment from other analysts, no-one has rushed to disagree with its equally gloomy view of aluminium. \nBut is there a contrarian lurking in the LME spreads? \nBecause someone is holding a mega long position on the LME's October prompt date (Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) . 21). \nSpreads have already started tightening and right now it looks as if aluminium is gearing up for one of its sporadic long-short showdowns. \nOCTOBER STAND-OFF? \nThe long position on October is huge, even by the standards of aluminium, the LME's most liquid contract and a market populated by heavyweight players. \nThe exchange's latest futures banding report shows one entity holding a long position greater than 40 percent of open interest on the October date. \nThat means it is at least 1.15 million tonnes in size and quite possibly larger. \nThe report also shows four significant short positions on the same date, all within the 5-10 percent band. \nThere will be many more smaller shorts out there as well, given the recent steady downtrend. \nMoney managers are still net long of aluminium (LME-AH-MNET), according to the LME's Commitments of Traders Report. But at 5.3 percent of open interest that long positioning is close to the bottom end of the range established since the LME first started publishing the report in July last year. \nMoreover, the LME's data seems to have an inbuilt long bias when it comes to the money manager category. \nAn alternative series on \"speculative positioning\" published by LME broker Marex Spectron shows a net short position of 191,500 lots (4.8 million tonnes), or 29 percent of open interest, on aluminium. This, it claims, is \"the biggest spec short in Ali since August 2012.\" \nSpread tensions are already there. \nThe October-November spread was valued at $4.50 per tonne backwardation at Tuesday's close. \nThat has pulled in the contango across the LME's benchmark cash-to-three-months period to $27 per tonne, the tightest it's been since early May. \nQuite evidently, this may just be a foretaste of things to come, if that long position holds steady all the way through to Oct. 21. \nBULL OR BEAR? \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , sporadic spread tension has been a regular feature of the aluminium market for many years. \nPrevious bursts of tightness have as often as not been resolved by mass transfers of metal and a swift easing of spreads back to a level of contango that makes stocks-financing profitable. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's a play that is in essence bearish, predicated as it is on metal surplus and a spread structure that incentivises financing and storage of that surplus. \nSeen this way, the big October position may not signify a contrarian bull at all, if someone is betting on more surplus metal and a corresponding flexing in the contango structure of the market. \nExpected surplus, after all, is why analysts such as Goldman Sachs are forecasting a long period of prices trading into the cost curve. \nAluminium is a market with a long track record of over production and slow responsiveness to falling prices. \nAs Goldman points out, non-Chinese producers have already made the \"easy\" cuts to their smelter portfolios over the last seven years, while many higher-cost plants in China are being kept afloat by government subsidies. \n\"If we assume 25 percent of ex-China production at high risk at current prices was curtailed, it would still be necessary to shut another 2 million tonnes of Chinese supply,\" Goldman says, adding, \"at this stage, we simply don't have confidence that this will occur and thus forecast slightly lower prices over the next 12 months.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T14:42:57.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
