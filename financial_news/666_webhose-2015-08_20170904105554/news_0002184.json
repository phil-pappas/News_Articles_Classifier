I didn't see the point buying a new one when that one was perfectly adequate.\" \nThe married father-of-one described how his \"love-hate job\" was like a rollercoaster. \nHe said: \"It could be the worst job in the world, could make you want to jump off a bridge and make you feel physically sick when you went into work. \n\"But the success when you got it right. That's like solving that equation, it's like seeing that number pop up on your screen. \n\"There's no subjectivity, you make money or lose money - it's so pure.\" \nBut the prosecution claimed that behind his quirks Hayes was the \"ringmaster\" behind an international conspiracy to rig Libor which undermined the integrity of financial markets. \nHe was depicted as \"greedy\" and driven by a desire for money. Not satisfied with his large salary, he rigged Libor so he could impress his bosses and make millions, jurors heard. \nHayes, from Fleet in Hampshire, graduated from the University of Nottingham in 2001 with a degree in maths and engineering. \nHe worked for Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Royal Bank of Canada (Other OTC: RBCDF - news ) before joining UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) in 2006 as a trader in Tokyo. \nHe was paid £1.3m before tax in salary and incentives by UBS from September 2006 to December 2009. \nHe joined Citibank in 2009 after he \"felt that UBS were not paying him enough\", and received £3.5m before tax for just nine months' work. \nThe prosecutor said Hayes immediately set about rigging Libor in his new job. He sent a message on his first day trading with UBS, on 29 September, 2006, saying: \"Do me a favour and get the Libor rate up?\" \nAs a trader in yen Libor derivatives, he bet on movements of the daily rate banks are able to borrow from each other. \nHe admitted making \"requests\" concerning the Libor rate, but insisted lots of bankers were doing the same, and \"no one batted an eyelid\". \nBut he claimed his rigging and manipulating of Libor was not dishonest and his bosses knew what he was doing. \nHayes said in a recorded interview with the SFO on the 1 February, 2013: \"Although I was operating within a system or participating within a system in which it was commonplace, you know, ultimately I was someone who was a serial offender.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:45:13.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
