Photo: Michel O'Sullivan\nThe purpose of the superannuation system should be defined in legislation to stop piecemeal changes that undermine confidence, says Michael Keating, one of the architects of the regime.\nThe absence of an enshrined purpose for superannuation – to provide retirement income to substitute or supplement the age pension, as distinct from enabling wealth creation – has been fingered as a cause for shambolic policymaking over the past decade.\nIt has also resulted in the super system being under-prepared for the shift from accumulation to providing reliable and predictable streams of retirement income to members.\nMr Keating, a former head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet under the Hawke government, admitted it was a mistake not to define the purpose of super when it was introduced in 1992, and doing this now would lead to more predictable policy.\nAdvertisement \"There is a risk of continuing constant piecemeal reform across the retirement incomes system, which undermines confidence,\" he told the Financial Services Council conference on the Gold Coast on Wednesday.\n\"With a number of important issues identified that need addressing, the time is right for a much more holistic approach to reform.\"\n'Objective a priority' Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen will tell the FSC conference on Thursday that \"setting a proper objective for our superannuation should be a matter of priority\".\n\"I encourage the government to put something on the table so we can get this done,\" Mr Bowen will say.\n\"Having an objective, enshrined in legislation, will mean that all future proposed changes can be assessed against this. We can have a debate about specific language, but I think we can all agree that having a clear statutory objective for our super system would be beneficial.\"\nFinancial Services Council chief executive Sally Loane has written to Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and to Mr Bowen to urge them to meet to discuss bipartisan support for defining the objective of the super system, whose assets are forecast to grow to $9 trillion by 2040.\n\"We urge these brothers-in-arms – both of them persuasive and articulate leaders – to work together to define and enshrine the purpose of superannuation, to show leadership and work collaboratively towards putting in place a stable, depoliticised legislation framework for superannuation,\" she will tell the conference on Thursday.\nIn June, Mr Frydenberg suggested he was amenable to the recommendation, telling a retirement incomes conference in Canberra that \"notwithstanding the clear point of difference between the opposition and ourselves on superannuation tax changes, there would undoubtedly be positive benefits for the stability and accountability of the system and those who play a role in it if a bipartisan objective were able to be enshrined\".\n'Ad hoc policy making' The final report of last year's financial system inquiry, chaired by David Murray, said the absence of agreed objectives for super \"contributes to short-term ad hoc policymaking\" and \"adds complexity, imposes unnecessary costs on superannuation funds and their members, and undermines long-term confidence in the system\".\nThe previous Labor government made 12 unexpected changes to super, often on budget nights, which increased tax on super by almost $9 billion, according to the government .\nMr Murray's report also said the lack of a defined purpose increases the cost of the superannuation system to government \"because tax concessions are not being efficiently targeted at meeting the system's objectives\".\nIt fingered high-worth individuals benefiting from the current system \"for purposes other than providing retirement income, such as tax-effective wealth management and estate planning\". Mr Murray will address the conference on Thursday.\nThe potential for tax concessions on super to be capped was raised by the chief executive of Westpac-owned BT Financial Group, Brad Cooper, who said last Friday it was appropriate and necessary to limit the tax concessions received by the rich .\nConcessions should remain in place only \"as long as they are being used to build savings that generate an income in retirement that affords a decent quality of life\", he said, and it was not appropriate \"to use its tax-free status to build incredibly high levels of wealth or serve as a proxy estate planning tool\".\nMr Cooper called for a cap of $2.5 million on the amount that people are able to roll over from accumulation to pension.\nTax breaks should 'moderate' Mr Bowen has suggested as a starting point for discussion on the definition: \"Our superannuation system should ensure that as many Australians as possible have access to the resources for a dignified retirement without recourse to the full age pension.\"\nMr Bowen will tell the conference on Thursday that \"once people earn a certain amount in retirement, concessions should moderate\".\nHe will also say Labor remains committed to establishing a Council of Superannuation Custodians, which would advise the government every five years on future changes to the system alongside the release of the intergenerational report.\nThis was a recommendation that the FSC made to the inquiry.\nThe government may respond to the inquiry this month.\nMs Loane will call on both sides of politics to lift the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent by 2022 on the basis that 9.5 per cent \"is not enough to deliver adequate retirement incomes\".\nShe will present research showing the government's decision to hold the guarantee at 9.5 per cent and slow its increase has resulted in a $136 billion blowout in the retirement savings gap – the difference between what has been accumulated by workers at retirement and what is required for an adequate retirement – adding pressure to the age pension.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/westpacs-wealth-chief-brad-cooper-says-cut-superannuation-tax-breaks-for-rich-20150730-ginkpe"], "published": "2015-08-05T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:43:51.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
