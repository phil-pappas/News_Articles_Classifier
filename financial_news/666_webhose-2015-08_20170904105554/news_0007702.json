Take this quiz to find out By Lauren Davidson | Telegraph – 5 minutes ago 0.35 0.00 \nThe average European earns £18,432 a year, works 37.93 hours a week and spends up £2.12 on a regular cappuccino. How do you fare: are you a typical Brit (LSE: 133772.L - news ) ... or perhaps more French... or maybe Greek? \nThe average European earns €26,051 (£18,432) a year, lives to the age of 78.6 spending 17.8 of those years in education and eats 154g of vegetables every day, or about two and a half carrots. \nAnd it turns out the lives and living habits of people in Britain are among the most typically European of all the countries in the continent, ranking ahead of Germany, the Netherlands and Spain in sixth place. \nThe findings come ahead of a referendum, planned to take place by 2017, over whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union . \nQlik, the Nasdaq-listed data visualisation company, pooled data from a variety of sources, such as the OECD and Eurostat, to compare living habits across 21 European countries. \nSlovenians lead the most typically European lifestyles, with 67.8pc employment, working 39.3 hours per week, contributing €29.22 to GDP per person per hour and with 61pc of people in good health. \nOverall, the UK came sixth closest to the pan-European average, despite having the second highest disposable income £1,800 a year, behind Germany's £2,160 and being among the most expensive countries to live in , second only to Denmark. \nThe UK also has considerably more statutory leave , with 28 days compared to the average of 20 days, and employees earn 40pc more than the typical European, despite working 36.7 hours per week, the sixth shortest working week of all the countries surveyed. \nThe average European works 37.9 hours per week, while Greeks work the most (41.9 hours) and Dutch people take it easiest (30.1 hours). \nDespite this, the UK's productivity is lacklustre , lagging behind France, Germany and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) , with the average worker contributing £26 per hour to GDP. \nThe UK also seems to be less healthy than its continental peers. While the Spanish consume the most food and drink, Britons drinks four times more alcohol than the average European , and more than a third say that they never exercise. \nBulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia were excluded due to lack of sufficient data. \n= How European are you?
