Wealth protection is a hugely important factor in the United States in today's modern climate, particularly as the country still struggles to recover from the significant economic downturn of the last decade. Since the collapse of the housing market, more and more Americans have drained savings accounts, retirement accounts and more just to survive. While it is true that the economy has been on a slow and steady recovery for the past few years, it still has a long way left to go. Wealth protection techniques like high-yield investments and even the stock market are one of the best chances that millions of Americans have to both live a comfortable lifestyle and make sure that those they leave behind are taken care of.\nPeople who are looking for more information about the upcoming segment on wealth protection or who are looking for more information about VOICES IN AMERICA in general are urged to visit the show's official website at voicesinamericamedia.com today. VOICES IN AMERICA was always intended to be an entirely independent production and it is not currently affiliated with either PBS or APT. VOICES IN AMERICA airs on Public Television Stations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T10:43:42.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
