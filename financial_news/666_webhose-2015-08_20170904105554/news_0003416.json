Priced from Rs 8.34 lakh to Rs 13.74 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Maruti S-Cross is the first car from the company to be powered only by diesel engines. It gets two engine options, the 1248cc DDiS 200 which generates a peak power of 66kW and the 1598cc DDiS 320 which generates a peak power of 88kW. The claimed fuel efficiency (mileage) of the DDiS 200 is 23.65 kmpl and that of the DDiS 320 is 22.7 kmpl. It gets twin airbags and ABS as standard. But there is no automatic variant on offer.\nThe Maruti Suzuki S-Cross , however, will not be available at regular showrooms, but will be sold only through the new, premium sales channel of the company, called the Nexa. Currently 35 Nexa showrooms are operational in 23 cities. “We plan to increase the number to 100 by the end of FY16,” said RS Kalsi, executive director, Marketing and Sales, Maruti Suzuki. It remains to be seen how successful the S-Cross will be considering the fact that it is currently available at a limited number of showrooms in India and will be facing competition from the hugely successful Hyundai Creta.\nPHOTOS: Check more pictures of Maruti Suzuki S-Cross\n 05, 2015 1:27 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:30:17.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
