Treasuries were steady on \nFriday and were poised to end the week stronger after minutes \nfrom the Federal Reserve's most recent policymaking meeting \ndidn't indicate that the Fed is likely to begin raising interest \nrates next month. \nA dovish interpretation of the U.S. central bank's July \nmeeting minutes, and concerns about low inflation as crude oil \nfalls to 6-1/2 year lows, have added a bid for U.S. debt this \nweek. \nInvestors will closely evaluate a speech by Fed Vice Chair \nStanley Fischer at Jackson Hole on Aug. 29 for clues on whether \na rate increase in September is likely. \nThe employment report for August, to be released next month, \nwill also be crucial, coming ahead of the Fed meeting in \nSeptember. \n\"The September rate hike is still possible, but you're not \ngoing to get a better feel on that until you see the employment \nreport,\" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at \nBank of Nova Scotia (Other OTC: BKSHF - news ) in New York. \nBenchmark 10-year notes last yielded 2.08 \npercent, down from 2.20 percent last Friday. \nLarge index extensions heading into month-end and concerns \nabout tumbling stock markets may keep yields low. \n\"Month-end is a week from Monday and there's a large \nextension for Treasuries, so I think they will stay bid,\" \nComiskey said. \nThe Treasury will also sell $90 billion in new \ncoupon-bearing debt next week, including $26 billion in two-year \nnotes, $35 billion in five-year notes and $29 billion in \nseven-year notes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T16:47:34.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
