The whole point is, banks forgot what they were there for if you only ever see things through the filter of a large corporate, you don’t get a real feel, whereas if you go and sit down with a customer, they are not shy about saying, “I don’t like this” or “there is a problem here.”” \nRBS is Britain’s biggest lender to businesses, but its reputation has taken a series of knocks in recent years, with customers claiming compensation for interest rate swap mis-selling , and investigations into the bank’s Global Restructuring Group which was accused of profiting from small firms’ financial problems. \n“I think we’ve got a long way to go in improving customer service and the trust and the advocacy,” she said. \nMs Rose said she is sending all 3,500 relationship managers at the bank on a new set of training courses working on the basics of banking from credit risk through to culture and behaviour, as well as making more staff specialise in specific sectors. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) is also taking the course, along with the executive committee. \nAnother part of that is to show customers that she is not a distant figure at head office turning down loans on a whim. \n“I’m quite ordinary, and I think that is quite important, that they don’t think there is a big bad boss up at central office opining on their business,” said Ms Rose. \nShe was speaking after the government began selling down the shares acquired in the bank bailouts of 2008 and 2009. \nChancellor George Osborne said the sale of a 5.4pc stake in the bank for £2.1bn indicates it is now “time for RBS to rebuild itself as a commercial bank, no longer reliant on the state, but serving the working people of Britain.” \nThe first stage of the privatisation came after the bank reported profits of £293m in the second quarter of 2015, as RBS continues to struggle with the costs of compensating customers for past mis-selling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T00:43:30.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
