Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Coty Inc. and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries, should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. When used in this discussion, the terms \"Coty,\" the \"Company,\"\"we,\"\"our,\" or \"us\" mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Coty Inc. and its majority and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion on the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. The following discussion includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Overview-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated. All dollar amounts in the following discussion are in millions of United States (\"U.S.\") dollars, unless otherwise indicated. OVERVIEW We are a leading global beauty company. We manufacture and market beauty products in the Fragrances, Color Cosmetics and Skin & Body Care segments with distribution in over 130 countries and territories across both prestige and mass markets. We continue to operate in a challenging market environment particularly in mass fragrance and color cosmetics with heightened promotional activities in mass retail in Western Europe and the U.S. We are focused on growing our ten power brands around the world through innovation, strong support levels and excellence in market execution. With respect to our non-power brands, we expect to see a gradual decline of certain of those brands which are later in their lifecycle. We are also focused on expanding our geographic footprint into emerging markets and diversifying our distribution channels within existing geographies to increase market presence. As part of our expansion efforts, we entered into agreements to broaden distribution in Asia, South Africa, Brazil, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), United Arab Emirates (\"U.A.E.\") and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (\"K.S.A.\") during fiscal 2014 and 2015 and our results from certain of these efforts reflect incremental net revenues from joint venture consolidations and conversion from third party to direct distribution in these geographies. We have determined that our operating and reportable segments are Fragrances, Color Cosmetics and Skin & Body Care (also referred to as \"segments\"). The reportable segments also represent our product groupings. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, in conjunction with the Organizational Redesign restructuring program (see Note 7, \"Restructuring Costs\" in Item 4, \"Consolidated Financial Statements\"), we reclassified revenues and costs associated with a brand from Fragrances to Skin & Body Care operating segment. This change has been reflected in each reporting period presented, both in the segment results below and in Note 11, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net\" in Item 4 \"Consolidated Financial Statements\". Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. per Common Share are non-GAAP financial measures which we believe better enable management and investors to analyze and compare the underlying business results from period to period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis, and we provide reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. per Common Share provide an alternative view of performance used by management and we believe that an investor's understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these adjusted performance measures. In addition, our financial covenant compliance calculations under our debt agreements are substantially derived from these adjusted performance measures. The following are examples of how these adjusted performance measures are utilized by management: � senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that are prepared on an adjusted performance basis; \n� strategic plans and annual budgets are prepared on an adjusted performance basis; and Table of Contents \n� senior management's annual compensation is calculated, in part, using adjusted performance measures. \nAdjusted Operating Income We define Adjusted Operating Income as operating income adjusted for the following: Share-based compensation adjustment: � For grants issued prior to June 12, 2013, the effective date of the share-based compensation plan amendments, the component of share-based compensation expense adjustment represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the fair value at June 12, 2013 using equity plan accounting. \n� Future adjustments for share-based compensation will consist of the difference between expense under equity plan accounting based on the grant date fair value and total estimated share-based compensation expense, which is based on (i) the fair value on June 12, 2013 for nonqualified stock option awards and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and (ii) all costs associated with the special incentive awards granted in fiscal 2012 and 2011. The estimated aggregate expense is approximately $4, $1, and $0 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively. \n� Share-based compensation adjustment may also include special transactions. Refer to \"Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for a full discussion of the share-based compensation adjustment; and \nOther adjustments, which include: \n� restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs; \n� acquisition-related costs and certain acquisition accounting impacts; and \n� other adjustments that we believe investors may find useful. \nAdjusted Net Income and Net Income per Common Share Attributable to Coty Inc. We define Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. as net income attributable to Coty Inc. adjusted for the following: � adjustment made to reconcile operating income to Adjusted Operating Income, net of the income tax effect thereon (see Adjusted Operating Income); \n� certain interest and other (income) expense, net of the income tax effect thereon, that we do not consider indicative of our performance; and \n� certain tax effects that are not indicative of our performance. \nAdjusted basic and diluted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. per Common Share is calculated as: � Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Coty Inc. divided by \n� Adjusted weighted-average basic and diluted common shares using the treasury stock method. \nConstant Currency We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (\"constant currency\"). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information we present may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Table of Contents \nMarketing and Advertising Costs Management reviews marketing and advertising costs on an aggregated basis, including trade marketing spend activities and advertising and consumer promotional costs, which are included as a reduction to gross revenue and in selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, based on the counterparty. Marketing and advertising costs for the year ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are presented below: Year Ended June 30, 2015 2014 2013 Trade marketing spend activities $ 463.2 $ 492.9 $ 502.1 % of Net revenues 10.5 % 10.8 % 10.8 % Advertising and consumer promotional costs 1,007.7 1,070.0 1,072.3 % of Net revenues 22.9 % 23.5 % 23.1 % Total marketing and advertising costs $ 1,470.9 $ 1,562.9 $ 1,574.4 % of Net revenues 33.4 % 34.3 % 33.9 % \nNET REVENUES In fiscal 2015, net revenues decreased 3%, or $156.4, to $4,395.2 from $4,551.6 in fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 5%, partially offset by an increase in unit volume of 1% and a positive price and mix impact of 1%. In fiscal 2014, we announced the discontinuation of our TJoy brand and the reorganization of our mass business in China (\"China Optimization\"). The discontinuation of TJoy and China Optimization had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results, however positively affected our Skin & Body Care segment in Asia Pacific. In the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Bourjois cosmetics brand (\"Bourjois acquisition\"), which positively impacted total net revenues in fiscal 2015 by 1%. The impact to net revenues from the Bourjois acquisition affected our Color Cosmetics segment primarily in EMEA. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translations, the discontinuation of TJoy and China Optimization and the Bourjois acquisition, total net revenues in fiscal 2015 were consistent with total net revenues in fiscal 2014, reflecting a positive price and mix impact of 1% offset by a decrease in unit volume of 1%. Excluding the impact Bourjois acquisition, new launches represented approximately 16% of net revenues for fiscal 2015. The contribution from new launches was offset by an approximate 20% decline in net revenues from existing products that are later in their life cycles, in part due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translations. In fiscal 2014, net revenues decreased 2%, or $97.5, to $4,551.6 from $4,649.1 in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange translations had an immaterial impact on total net revenues. The decrease was primarily the result of a decline in unit volume of 3% partially offset by a positive price and mix impact of 1%. In fiscal 2013, one of our licenses was divested and a certain North American service agreement expired and was not renewed (\"2013 Ceased Activities\"). The 2013 Ceased Activities had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results, however negatively affected the Fragrances segment, particularly in the Americas and EMEA. In the quarter ended June 30, 2014, we announced the discontinuation of our TJoy brand and the reorganization of our mass business in China, which resulted in a one-time charge related to product returns. This one-time charge had an immaterial impact on our consolidated results, however it negatively affected primarily our Skin & Body Care segment in Asia Pacific. New launches represented approximately 15% of our net revenues for fiscal 2014. The contribution from new launches was partially offset by an approximate 16% decline in net revenues from existing products that are later in their life cycles. Net Revenues by Segment Year Ended June 30, Change % (in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015/2014 2014/2013 NET REVENUES Fragrances $ 2,178.3 $ 2,324.0 $ 2,312.8 (6 %) - % Color Cosmetics 1,445.0 1,366.2 1,468.5 6 % (7 %) Skin & Body Care 771.9 861.4 867.8 (10 %) (1 %) Total $ 4,395.2 $ 4,551.6 $ 4,649.1 (3 %) (2 %) \nFragrances In fiscal 2015, net revenues of Fragrances decreased 6%, or $145.7 to $2,178.3 from $2,324.0 in fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of a negative price and mix impact of 6% and a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact Table of Contents \nof 4%, partially offset by an increase in unit volume of 4%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translations, net revenues of Fragrances decreased 2%. The decrease in the segment primarily reflects lower net revenues from existing celebrity brands that are later in their lifecycles, Calvin Klein, whose lower net revenues were primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translations, and Davidoff and Roberto Cavalli, reflecting lower new launch activity in fiscal 2015 relative to the strong contribution from new launches in fiscal 2014, and declines from existing product lines. The decline in the segment also reflects continued deterioration of fragrance market trends, particularly in Europe. Partially offsetting the decrease in the segment were higher net revenues from Marc Jacobs, in part due to the new launch Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream, along with incremental net revenues from recently launched Enrique Iglesias Adrenaline and Vespa. Results for Chlo� were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange translations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations, net revenues for Chlo� increased in part due to the new launch of Chlo� Love Story. The negative price and mix impact primarily reflects an ongoing increased level of promotional and discounted pricing activity, reflecting a competitive retail environment. Also contributing to the negative price and mix were higher relative volumes of lower-priced products sold in the mass retail channel in a certain emerging market, driven by a change in our distribution model. In fiscal 2014, net revenues of Fragrances increased $11.2 to $2,324.0 from $2,312.8 in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange translations had an immaterial impact on net revenues in Fragrances. An increase in unit volume of 3%, which includes a negative impact on net revenues related to the 2013 Ceased Activities of 1%, was offset by a negative price and mix impact of 3%. Excluding the impact to net revenues from the 2013 Ceased Activities, net revenues of Fragrances increased 1%. Segment growth was primarily driven by incremental net revenues from the newly established brand Katy Perry Killer Queen and higher net revenues from Calvin Klein, Davidoff and Roberto Cavalli in part due to the launches of Calvin Klein Downtown, Calvin Klein Endless Euphoria, Davidoff Cool Water Night Dive, Davidoff Cool Water Woman Sea Rose, Davidoff the Game, Roberto Cavalli Nero Assoluto and Just Cavalli for Him. Power brands Marc Jacobs and Chlo� also positively impacted segment results in part due to the launches of Marc Jacobs Honey, Roses de Chlo� and continued growth of Marc Jacobs Daisy. Also contributing to segment growth were higher net revenues from David Beckham, Jil Sander, Guess, Bottega Veneta and Nautica. Partially offsetting the increase in the segment was a decline in net revenues from Lady Gaga, Beyonc� and Vera Wang in part due to a lower level of new launch activity for these brands in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, the expiration of certain licenses and lower net revenues from existing celebrity brands that are later in their lifecycles. Segment growth reflects weak market conditions in developed markets. The negative price and mix impact primarily reflects an increased level of promotional and discounted pricing activity in select developed markets, reflecting a competitive retail environment. Also contributing to lower price and mix was lower prices for select brands as we cascade them into different distribution channels in accordance with our strategy. Color Cosmetics In fiscal 2015, net revenues of Color Cosmetics increased 6%, or $78.8, to $1,445.0 from $1,366.2 in fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily the result of a positive price and mix impact of 7% and an increase in unit volume of 5%, partially offset by a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 6%. The Bourjois acquisition positively impacted net revenues by 4%, contributing 4% to the unit volume increase. Excluding the impact to net revenues from the Bourjois acquisition and the impact of foreign currency exchange translations, net revenues of Color Cosmetics increased 8%. Higher net revenues were primarily driven by strong growth in Sally Hansen and Rimmel. The increase in Sally Hansen was primarily driven by the success of new launch Sally Hansen Miracle Gel. Higher net revenues in Rimmel primarily reflect incremental net revenues from new launches such as Rimmel Wonder'full mascara and Rimmel Provocalips liquid lipstick along with growth from existing brands, such as Rimmel Lasting Finish foundation and Rimmel Exaggerate eyeliner. Results for OPI were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange translations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations, net revenues for OPI increased, driven by growth in the U.S. professional channel, primarily due to incremental net revenues from new launch OPI Infinite Shine, and an increase in net revenues internationally, primarily reflecting incremental net revenues following the acquisition of a U.K. distributor. Partially offsetting the increase in OPI were lower net revenues in the U.S. retail channel driven by a decline in Nicole by OPI. The positive price and mix impact for the segment primarily reflects a price improvement in all major brands, in part reflecting the new launch of Sally Hansen Miracle Gel. In fiscal 2014, net revenues of Color Cosmetics decreased 7%, or $102.3, to $1,366.2 from $1,468.5 in fiscal 2013. Foreign currency exchange translations had an immaterial impact on net revenues in Color Cosmetics. The decrease was primarily the result of a decline in unit volume of 5% and a negative price and mix impact of 2%. The decline in the segment was primarily driven by lower net revenues from nail products, in part reflecting continued declines since the first quarter of fiscal 2014 in the U.S. retail nail market. The Sally Hansen brand was the largest contributor to the segment decline, in part due to lower net revenues from Sally Hansen Insta Gel and Sally Hansen Salon Effects nail products that generated stronger net revenues in fiscal 2013, partially offset by higher net revenues from new launches Sally Hansen Triple Shine, Sally Hansen Miracle Gel and Sally Hansen I Heart Nail Art in fiscal 2014. Also contributing to the decline in Sally Hansen was the impact of several key U.S. mass retailers significantly reducing their inventory on hand, particularly in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 in response to the sudden decline in consumer demand for nail products, resulting in lower replenishment orders in fiscal 2014 compared to Table of Contents \nfiscal 2013. Net revenues for Sally Hansen were also negatively affected by an increasingly competitive retail environment, decline in market share and the aforementioned weaker demand in the nail category in the U.S. Lower net revenues from OPI also contributed to the decline in the Color Cosmetics segment, reflecting a decline in the U.S. retail channel driven by lower net revenues of Nicole by OPI and the discontinuation of a particular product line sold exclusively by a large retailer. These decreases in OPI were partially offset by incremental net revenues attributable to new distribution through a professional salon chain in the U.S., incremental net revenues in the U.K. following the acquisition of a U.K. distributor and expanded distribution in Australia and our travel retail business. Partially offsetting the decline in the segment was an increase in Rimmel primarily reflecting strong growth of Rimmel Scandal'eyes mascara and Rimmel Stay Matte foundation. The negative price and mix impact for the segment was primarily driven by unit price declines in most key brands within the segment primarily driven by an increased level of highly promotional and discounted pricing activity, reflecting a competitive retail environment. Skin & Body Care In fiscal 2015, net revenues of Skin & Body Care decreased 10%, or $89.5, to $771.9 from $861.4 in fiscal 2014. The decrease in the segment was primarily the result of a decline in unit volume of 9% and a negative foreign currency exchange translations impact of 6%, partially offset by a positive price and mix impact of 5%. The discontinuation of TJoy and China Optimization contributed 3% to the unit volume decline and positively impacted price and mix by 4%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translations and the impact to net revenues from the discontinuation of TJoy and China Optimization, net revenues of Skin & Body Care decreased 5% with a unit volume decline of 6% and a positive price and mix impact of 1%, primarily reflecting higher relative volumes of higher-priced products. The decrease in the segment was primarily driven by lower net revenues from adidas and Playboy. Lower net revenues from adidas in part reflect the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translations, a change in our distribution model from subsidiary to distributor in China, a decline in the U.S. primarily related to lower holiday orders and reduced shelf space at a key retailer in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and declining net revenues in existing product lines. Partially offsetting these declines in adidas were incremental net revenues from new launches such as adidas UEFA Champions League Edition and incremental net revenues in Brazil, due to the commercial distributor relationship with Avon. The decline in Playboy was in part driven by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange translations, declining net revenues in existing product lines and lower net revenues in the U.S. related to reduced shelf space at select retailers and lower holiday orders in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Partially offsetting the decline in Playboy were incremental net revenues from new launches such as Playboy #Generation for Him and Playboy #Generation for Her and growth in Brazil, due to the commercial distributor relationship with Avon. Partially offsetting the decrease in the segment were higher net revenues from philosophy primarily reflecting strong growth in Asia Pacific and higher net revenues in key distribution channels in the U.S., in part due to new launch philosophy renewed hope in a jar. In fiscal 2014, net revenues of Skin & Body Care decreased 1%, or $6.4, to $861.4 from $867.8 in fiscal 2013. Results were primarily driven by a decline in unit volume of 4% and a decline related to product returns associated with the reorganization of our mass business in China of 2%, partially offset by a positive price and mix impact of 4% and a positive foreign currency exchange translations impact of 1% . Excluding the impact to net revenues associated with the reorganization of our mass business in China and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange translations, net revenues of Skin & Body Care in fiscal 2014 were consistent with fiscal 2013 as higher net revenues from philosophy, Lancaster and adidas were offset by a decline in TJoy and Playboy. Net revenues from philosophy increased primarily due to higher net revenues in key distribution channels in the U.S., in part due to expanded distribution and new launches, and strong growth in Asia Pacific in part due to expanded distribution. Net revenues from Lancaster reflected strong growth primarily due to strong growth in sun care products and new launch Lancaster Total Age Correction, along with expanded distribution in China. Net revenues from adidas increased reflecting strong growth in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia, Brazil, China, and South Africa, partially offset by lower net revenues in developed markets such as the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands and Southern Europe in part due to an increased level of highly promotional and discounted pricing activity. Partially offsetting these increases in the segment were declines in TJoy, reflecting weak demand for the products which led to our decision to discontinue the brand along with the one-time impact to net revenues associated with the discontinuation of the brand, and Playboy, primarily due lower holiday customer orders in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The positive price and mix impact for the segment was primarily driven by lower relative volumes of lower-priced TJoy products and higher relative volumes of higher-priced philosophy and Lancaster products. Net Revenues by Geographic Regions In addition to our reporting segments, management also analyzes our net revenues by geographic region. We define our geographic regions as Americas (comprising North, Central and South America), EMEA (comprising Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific (comprising Asia and Australia).
