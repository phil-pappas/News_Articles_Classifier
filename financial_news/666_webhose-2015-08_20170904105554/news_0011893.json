The more closely watched underlying profit, which strips out one-offs, more than halved to $US6.42 billion.\nThat is the lowest tally since 2004 and well below the $US7.5 billion analysts’ had been expecting.\nThe hit to the bottom line did not stop BHP from lifting its full-year dividend, with chief executive Andrew Mackenzie saying the mining giant was “resolute” in its commitment to never let payments fall.\nBHP would step up its ­ongoing cost-cutting and productivity drive and again cut capital expenditure, Mr Mackenzie said.\nBoth BHP and rival Rio Tinto have previously said they expect steel demand in China — their biggest customer — to peak at 1 billion tonnes between 2025 and 2030. BHP has now lowered its forecast to between 935 million tonnes and 985 million tonnes by mid-2020.\n“In the short term we expect ongoing economic reforms in China to contribute to periods of market volatility,” Mr Mackenzie said on Tuesday.\n“And, while we remain confident in the long-term outlook for commodities demand ... we have lowered our forecast of peak Chinese steel production.”\nBHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie. Picture: Noelle Bobrige\nSharp price drops across all of BHP’s key commodities cut underlying profit by $US15.2 billion.\nBHP also booked $US3.2 billion in writedowns, with the bulk linked to its US onshore oil and gas assets and a $US2.1 billion loss stemming from its South32 demerger.\nBHP maintained its final dividend at US62c a share, lifting its payout across the year by 2 per cent to $US1.24. A falling Aussie dollar means local investors will pocket a 28 per cent increase.\njohn.dagge@news.com.au\n Big Aussie’s bottom line feeling pinch", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/big-aussies-bottom-line-feeling-pinch/story-fni0dcne-1227498682492", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/08/25/1227498/681466-59ce0192-4b08-11e5-ba64-b40512aab75c.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-26T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T17:34:23.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
