But realistically, the civil servant in her early 50s understands that likely means working for at least a few more years.\n\"I have some investments, and I'm wondering if they're set up to help me reach my goal of retiring at 55,\" says Barbara, who will not be eligible for a full pension from her work until age 57.\n\"Moreover, can I even retire while one of my children will just be starting university and the other one could still be studying for a few more years?\"\n\nWith one child years away from post-secondary education and another contemplating graduate studies, Barbara is worried about whether the $77,000-plus she has saved in RESPs is enough.\nFor that reason, she is still contributing $2,000 a year.\n\"That way, I'm still getting the maximum grant from the government.\"\nIn addition to RESP contributions, she's also setting aside $250 every month in her RRSPs.\nEarning about $68,000, or roughly $3,300 a month after taxes, Barbara figures once retired from her \"high-stress job\" she will probably work part time.\nThat's in part a recognition her savings -- less than $200,000 in an RRSP, a non-registered account and TFSA -- are likely not enough to cover any funding shortfall between age 55 and 60 before she'd be eligible for Canada Pension Plan payments.\n\"My concern is I'm a single parent with two kids to still support, so am I spending too much? Am I investing the right way? When is a realistic time for me to retire?\"\nWell, Barbara might want to reconsider retiring at age 55, says certified financial planner Ian Wood, with Nelson Financial Consultants in Winnipeg.\nHe ran the numbers for two scenarios: one with Barbara retiring at age 55 and not working; the other where she still retires at 55 from full-time work, but finds a part-time job.\nIn the first instance, Barbara will receive a pension worth about $25,600 a year from her current employer. She could also withdraw about $3,325 from an RRIF every year to help make up for some of the shortfall she'd face in covering household expenses.\nBut she'd still face a monthly deficit of about $1,200.\n\"This is not sustainable in the long run, and her savings will be fully exhausted around age 85,\" Wood says. \"Basically, this strategy poses a significant risk of her outliving her savings.\"\nFurthermore, Barbara should not take on more risk in her portfolio to increase her savings by age 55. Already her portfolio's allocation of 60 per cent growth stocks/40 per cent defensive investments (i.e. bonds) involves enough stock-market risk for someone whose retirement may be less than a decade away. She also doesn't have enough cash flow to increase contributions.\nThe numbers for the second scenario play out much better. If Barbara can find part-time work once retired from her current position, she would be able to balance her budget and can then delay drawing on her savings. That way, her money will probably outlast her.\nThe strategy's success, however, is dependent on her finding a part-time job paying about $34,000 a year. This way, Barbara can continue contributing to RRSPs while still having $400 extra a month in her budget.\nWood recommends she keeps working part time until she turns 65. This would allow her to delay taking CPP so she wouldn't be penalized for early withdrawal, which could be reduced by as much as 36 per cent from what she would receive at age 65.\nBy then, her CPP and pension would pay for most of her income needs. But she'd still need to draw about $6,400 per year from her RRSP to create a combined after-tax income of about $42,500, indexed to inflation. Barbara would still be running a deficit of about $500 a month, but it would be temporary.\n\"And she would be able to cover this deficit with her savings,\" Wood says.\nOnce old age security begins at age 67, her budget would be balanced.\n\"OAS would add an estimated $600 to $700 more after-tax income, adjusting for inflation,\" he says. \"And if she can continue working part time until age 67, it will increase her financial security even more.\"\nBarbara can improve her financial picture slightly in other areas, too, including the RESPs.\n\"She is currently contributing approximately $2,000 per year in hopes of receiving the maximum Canada education savings grant,\" Wood says. \"But the maximum annual grant was increased in 2007 to $500 per year based on $2,500 of contributions.\"\nThat being the case, Barbara might have unused contribution room and could possibly increase her contributions to catch up on missed grants to a maximum of $1,000 a year.\nYet with more than $76,000 set aside for her children's education, Barbara may have already reached the eligible grant limit. To find out, she can contact Service Canada.\nAnother consideration is the RESP asset allocation. It's almost a 50-50 split between stocks and bonds, which might be spot-on considering one child is a few years away and another is in withdrawal mode. But again, Wood says it's worth reviewing with her adviser whether this is truly the right mix.\nAnd while a good argument can be made Barbara does not have to help her children out any more than she already has, it's likely she will continue giving them a financial boost on occasion in addition to the $170 a month she may or may not keep contributing to the RESP.\nFor this reason (and the many aforementioned others), Wood says Barbara should work as long as she can full time, and if that's not possible any longer, then she should at least work part time.\n\"Otherwise if she decides to fully retire at age 55, she will either need to significantly reduce her lifestyle expenses, or run the serious risk of outliving her capital,\" he says.\nIt's likely unsustainable unless she finds good part-time work from 55 to 65.\nBut Wood says Barbara is best off bearing down and working full time as long as she can handle it.\n\"This is because her pension increases as she continues with her current employer,\" he says. \"The longer she defers retirement from her current job, the more secure her retirement income will be.\"\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T11:14:17.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
