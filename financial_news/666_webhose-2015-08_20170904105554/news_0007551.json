Target groups including vulcanizers, tyre importers and retailers, transport operators and drivers complained their views were not sought in the passage of the regulation.\nThe Second Hand Tyre Importers Association leads the protest. \nAshanti Regional Chairman of the association, Samuel Adjei-Adomako, has asked for the suspension of the enforcement to allow more time for public education. \n“Majority of about 75 per cent are using used tyres. They have to educate us so that we can bring the standard tyres they are talking about,” he said. \nThe Road Safety Commission appears convinced by the agitated groups. Director in charge of Planning and Programs, David Osafo Adonteng, will not rule out possible amendment of the Legislative Instrument. He says the genuine concerns raised at the forum will receive the needed attention.\n“They have raised series of concerns which means that we need to go back to the drawing board. So we’ve taken all these in good fate. We have asked them to submit their proposals regarding two critical areas they raised; regarding the date of manufacture and then the four years that we are talking about and then also the implementation date. They think that it is too close,” he noted. \nMr. Adonteng has hinted of a possible amendment to the yet to be implemented law. \n“Once they bring their proposals, the technical team will meet again and look at the way forward. If it is making some amendments to the law, of course we will go ahead, go through the procedures and do it accordingly,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T07:22:34.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
