These aircraft will be delivered between 2016 and 2021 and will enable Iberia to replace and expand its existing longhaul fleet,\" IAG said in a statement. \nReinforcement of the Iberia fleet follows a difficult period for the carrier in recent years, which required heavy restructuring to improve its financial performance. \nIAG also said it had converted options it took in 2013 into firm orders for 20 Airbus 320neo planes to facilitate fleet replacement for the group airlines that also include low-cost Spanish company Vueling, and Aer Lingus (Other OTC: AELGF - news ) of Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) which it is in the process of acquiring. \n\"The aircraft will be delivered between 2020 and 2021 and can be used by any airline in the Group for fleet replacement. These modern, fuel efficient aircraft will bring both cost efficiencies and environmental benefits to the airlines' fleet,\" it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:47:24.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
