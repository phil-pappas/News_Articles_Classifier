Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders BHP Billiton chief Andrew Mackenzie has conceded that peak steel production in China will be lower than the mining giant's previous forecasts, by between 25 million and 165 million tonnes but insists the Chinese market is not impossible to read.\nAnd he declared the miner remains in \"resolute\" commitment to its so-called \"progressive\" dividend policy to maintain or steadily increase its dividend, which costs at least $US6.5 billion a year.\n\"That resolve is shared by every man and woman who works for BHP Billiton,\" Mr Mackenzie said on Tuesday. \"It has withstood many previous cycles and is a key differentiator relative to our peers.\"\nBHP's second-biggest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management said the progressive dividend helped to underpin the valuation of BHP.\nAberdeen London-based senior investment manager Ben Ritchie said he welcomed BHP's commitment to the progressive dividend.\n\"BHP has invested an awful lot of shareholders' money on capital investment over the last five or six years and I think shareholders want to see a return on that investment,\" he told The Australian Financial Review, adding that the same logic applied to Rio Tinto.\nDividend still affordable: Mackenzie \"These companies have strong balance sheets. I wouldn't support the company paying out a dividend it cannot afford, but at current commodity prices it seems sustainable.\"\n Mr Mackenzie said the miner was \"doing everything in our power to buttress the divided\".\n\"This has not come by compromising our balance sheet or our plans for growth.\"\nBHP on Tuesday posted a 51 per cent fall in underlying profit for the year to $US6.4 billion, excluding South32. It was a slight miss on analyst expectations. The result it less than the productivity gains and controllable cost efficiencies the miner has made in the past two years.\nBHP's underlying payout ratio is 155 per cent (meaning it paid out 155 per cent of its profit), and its dividend yield is about 6.4 per cent, after taking into account franking tax credits. Rio's is not far behind at about 6 per cent. BHP has not cut its dividend since 1988, and did not rebase its dividend when it spun out South32 in May this year.\nBHP's shares have collapsed to $23.34, well down from the $33 they were fetching this time last year.\nBHP's disciplined cost Â­savings and productivity drive is not enough to offset the crunch commodity prices are having on its bottom line.The miner said on Tuesday it had hit its 2017 cost-cutting target of $US4 billion after 12 months. It is also cutting capital spending for the 2016 for the third time since February, to $US8 billion as it moves to protect its dividend. Mr Ritchie said it would not be surprising if the guidance was cut again. Capital spending for 2017 is put at $US7 billion.\nNet profit fell to a 13-year low of $US1.9 billion after the miner took writedowns in copper and shale gas.\nBut Mr Mackenzie insisted company is not hurting its growth prospects by slashing investment in new and existing projects.\n\"These reductions do not in any way slow in any way our growth\". Productivity gains would allow the miner to grow with less capital, he said.\nChina not impossible to read While Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg last week declared the Chinese market was \"impossible to read\", Mr Mackenzie disagreed.\n\"We don't find China impossible to read, we've been at this game for decades, and I think by and large we have made forecasts about China and we've made very sound business decisions off those forecasts that have proved to be correct.\n\"I don't agree that China has not articulated its forward strategy well. I think it's clear but you have to look deeply and you have to look across all the sectors and that's what we do.\nBHP revised its Chinese peak steal forecast date to between 935 and 985 million tonnes, compared to previous guidance of 1 billion to 1.1 billion tonnes, but kept the target date at the mid 2020's.\nPrices for BHP's four key \"pillar\" commodities, of iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper and oil and gas, have collapsed in to multi-year lows in the past 12 months. Potash is a possible fifth pillar.\nMr Mackenzie said the miner was \"only just now beginning to reap the simplification dividend\" of South32.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-08-25T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T13:06:08.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
