This was achieved after climbing the World’s Highest Motorable Pass – Khardong La (18,380 feet) and several other passes like Chang La, Zozi La, Fotu La and Namik La. Mr. Vagish in his Tata Nano has traversed the most rugged terrains and erratic weather conditions in this journey.\nAccording to Varun Vagish , “Being a rear wheel drive car, Tata Nano was a mobile powerhouse while climbing the steep inclines of the highest mountain passes. Lowest turning radius also helped me to easily manoeuvre the vehicle on sharp curves. It just took 30 minutes to climb the last 16 kilometres stretch from North-Pulu to Khardung-la, World’s Highest Motorable Pass. In the plains, it was driven more than 800 kms in a day at few instances. During the whole journey, I felt immense respect for the whole team of Tata Motors who conceptualised and shaped this beautiful vehicle.”\nThe Nano has put India on the world motoring map by demonstrating innovation and frugal engineering. The latest version of the car, GenX Nano, is an efficient and a smart city car.\n 05, 2015 5:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:16:48.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
