Compare your loan offers carefully. (Photo by Ron Antonelli/Bloomberg)[/caption]If you’re looking for cash to expand, congratulations: The rise of online lending and marketplace lending means small businesses have more options for borrowing than ever. In fact, there’s now a land rush going on for your business, with some lenders spending heavily on marketing and others relying on brokers (whose fees may get rolled into the cost of your loan).But shopping for a business loan can make taking out a mortgage look easy. So many options, so much confusion. Some lenders will tell you your APR, others will offer you a short-term cash advance, and still others throw in various fees that may be tough to untangle. After all, if you’re paying 10% over three months, that’s far more expensive than 12% over a year, though it may not look it at first glance. And a fully-amortizing loan (in which part of each payment goes toward principal) will cost you less over the duration of the loan than one that is not.I’ve written about finance for years, yet trying to make sense of the differences is enough to make me tear my hair out – and hope that new regulations will require greater transparency. “It’s really difficult to spreadsheet different products,” says Brett Baris, co-founder and president of Credibility Capital, a new alternative lender that’s partnered with Dun & Bradstreet to identify small business borrowers. “What is not right,” adds Sam Hodges, co-founder and U.S. managing director of Funding Circle, the British marketplace lender that’s lent more than $1 billion, “is when businesses think they are getting one thing and get another.”Here are a few rules of thumb for making sense of the offers you get: Your Quote: d interest rate may not be your APR. When you shop for a credit card, you’ll see your APR. But if you’re borrowing for your business, the lender may not tell it to you. And not all business financing is loans per se; some of it is short-term advances against receivables. To make a comparison between two offers, you’ll have to figure out the effective APR.Baris notes that, often, when he Quote: s small business owners a rate of 12% for a fully-amortizing term loan, they’ll respond that they can borrow elsewhere for 10%. “When I say, ‘okay, what kind of product is it?’ it turns out the 10% is a three-month loan,” he says. “That’s not actually 10%, it’s 40%.” It’s really about cash flow. The big question for any borrower is: Do you have a plan to use the cash that makes borrowing worthwhile? “It’s not just about APRs, or effective APRS. It’s monthly payments,” says Evan Singer, general manager of SmartBiz, which runs an online platform for SBA loans.When helping businesses refinance their debt, he says, he’ll use a metric called the “loan constant,” in which you take the required minimum monthly payment, multiply by 12, and divide by the current oustanding loan balance. “It encapsulates the rate, the payment and the terms to have an apples-to-apples comparison,” Singer says. “The higher the loan constant, the worse it is for the business.”Other items to take into consideration include whether the loan is amortizing or not, and whether there are prepayment penalties (which you should avoid if at all possible). Fees, fees, fees. In addition to the interest rate on your loan, you may have to pay an origination fee, which could be 3% or 4%. The shorter the term of your loan, the bigger of a deal that origination fee is – especially if you have to keep rolling over the financing and adding new fees each time. And if you’re offered a loan through a broker, the broker’s fee may also get passed on to you, in some cases increasing the rate on your loan by double digits. Yes, that's legal.
