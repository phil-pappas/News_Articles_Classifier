It also provides the App Store platform for competing streaming services including Jango, Spotify, Rhapsody and others. \nReuters reported in July that U.S. government antitrust regulators were also looking into claims about whether Apple's treatment of rival streaming music apps is illegal under antitrust law. \nApple, the European Union and Spotify were not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. \n(Reporting by Anannya Pramanick in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T04:50:36.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
