Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/AFP Why is Google (Alphabet) doing this? Google's search advertising business is hugely profitable, effectively a monopoly in that arena. Its other so-called \"moonshot\" businesses are...not so much. They include Google X, a research lab trying to master everything from self-driving cars to transmitting the internet in remote areas via hot air balloons, to (Google) Fiber, which provides superfast broadband internet in some American cities, to Calico, which is focused on making people live longer. And don't forget (Google) Ventures and (Google) Capital, its investment arms that have taken stakes in companies like ridesharing service Uber and SpaceX, Elon Musk's space exploration company. The announcement suggests that the Google prefix will be dropped from these entities going forward.\nRemember, Google doesn't pay any dividends. The huge profits it mints in search are funnelled back into promising areas that seem to keep its two co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, interested. Separating these activities going forward should give investors more clarity on how strong the Google search business is, and how much money the other businesses are losing. And investors seem to like that idea, with shares up by 6 per cent in after hours trading.\nIs this actually about tax?\nThat's what everyone is trying to figure out. Google's corporate motto is famously \"don't be evil\", although that hasn't stopped the company from getting into strife with the European Union, which has been trying to break up Google for years, over its market dominance, or being criticised by various countries (including Australia) for not paying much tax. It's quite possible that setting up a new holding company structure will have tax advantages for Alphabet and its shareholders. But it's not clear whether the new name means Alphabet is now absolved from Google's 'don't be evil' responsibilities. (We doubt it).\nAlphabet? Really? Yeah, we know. It's terrible! But at least Google co-founder and now Alphabet president Larry Page said we shouldn't expect too see Alphabet Insignia replacing Google on buildings all over the world (they'll still be Google). \"I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related products—the whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands,\" he said in the announcement.\nGoogle co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
