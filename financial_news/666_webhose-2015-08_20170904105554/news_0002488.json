Indeed, Tesco's troubles are similar to those faced by larger peer Carrefour several years ago. \nCarrefour, the world's second largest retailer in terms of sales, was hit hard by the European debt crisis. Sales collapsed across Europe and during 2011, the company's share price was cut in half. Drastic action followed. \nOut went Carrefour's old management team and new managers embarked on a 'ruthless' cost-cutting programme. Carrefour's dividend payout was scrapped and the group began exciting markets around the world. \nIt took nearly two years for Carrefour's recovery to gain traction and the company is only just starting grow again. \nOnly just started \nCompared to Carrefour's turnaround, Tesco's restructuring has only just started. The company kicked off its reorganisation during January, announcing a raft of cost-cutting measures, the benefits of which should begin to show through within the company's next few trading statements. However, the bulk of the cost savings will take several quarters to filter through as Tesco merges its offices and exits costly contracts. \nWhat's more, it is taking time to process and discuss the sale of Tesco's international businesses. Tesco is trying to reduce its £22bn debt pile by selling off lucrative assets like its Dunnhumby data management business for £2bn and the group's Korea business, which has a £4bn price tag. Management is trying to avoid a fire-sale by taking time to get the best price possible for these businesses. \nBut overall, things are changing at Tesco and it's clear that shoppers are slowing their exodus from Tesco's stores. During the first quarter of 2014, Tesco's UK sales fell by 4%, which marked a low point in the company's performance. By the fourth quarter of 2014 declines had slowed to 1.7% and during the first quarter of 2015, Tesco's like-for-like sales fell by 1.3%. Like-for-like volumes rose 1.4% during the 13 weeks ended 30 May 2015. \nAlso, Tesco's European sales are starting to show signs of life. Total European sales for the 13 weeks ended 30 May, Tesco's central Europe sales volumes rose 2.2% on a like-for-like basis and this trend should continue as the European economic recovery gains traction. \nThe bottom line \nAll in all, Tesco's recovery is starting to take shape. However, just like Carrefour's recovery, Tesco's turnaround will take time. \nHidden gem \nHere at the Motley Fool, we're always on the lookout for the markets best- hidden gems and business visionaries.
