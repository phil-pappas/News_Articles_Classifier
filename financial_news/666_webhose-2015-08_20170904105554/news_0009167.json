Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores. Trade Secret has 35 stores which will likely, although not confirmed, be rebranded to TJ Maxx, according to retail sector observers.\nAdvertisement It is said TJX is looking to expand in Australia to about 100 stores, a similar number to its UK operation, which has had great success.\nCBRE are understood to have been advising TJ Maxx, but declined to comment.\nAnnouncing the takeover, Carol Meyrowitz, chairman and chief executive of The TJX Companies, Inc., said \"TJX is one of the few major US retailers to have expanded successfully in international markets, including Canada and Europe, which gives us confidence in our potential growth in Australia\".\n\"With consumer demographics similar to Canada, we see Trade Secret as a strong platform to grow in Australia similar to how we entered Canada with our acquisition of Winners in 1990 and grew that business into a leading Canadian retailer,\" Ms Meyrowitz said in a statement.\nRetail agents in Australia said the deal was important as it will add a new mix of names into the ever-expanding international retailer pot.\nIt also comes as the Swedish H&M take possession of the keys at its new site in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall. The 5000 square metre store, one of biggest in the H&M world, is in the Stockland and Investa-owned Glasshouse arcade, and is being renovated by Built.\nH&M, which has a store in Melbourne's former GPO and in the AMP Shopping Centre's Macquarie Centre, North Ryde, in Sydney, will complete the fit-out of its Sydney CBD store, with an opening due for mid November.\nThe deal comes as the retail sector is going to be keenly analysed in the coming week as the major landlords report their results.\nFor the big guns of GPT, Scentre and Westfield, the reports will be for the half year to June 30, with the remainder being annual results.\nThe interest stems from the fact retail is considered the best bellwether for consumer behaviour and the state of the underlying economy.\nIt is also influenced by the housing sector, so by default it is also a good indicator of that market.\nUBS's property analysts said specialty sales will one of the areas under the spotlight.\nThey said specialty sales are in the middle of a clear trend and were the strongest they have been in the past five years at the third quarter updates, averaging positive 3.4 per cent versus 3.1 per cent gains in the first half of 2015.\nRecent feedback from Woolworths South Africa on David Jones stated a strong second half led to full-year sales increasing by 6.4 per cent (3.7 per cent, excluding new stores). Country Road Group sales in Australia and New Zealand grew 11.5 per cent (4.7 per cent excluding new stores).\n\"We believe discretionary retail will outperform non-discretionary retail over 2015, driven by the combination of the wealth effect (strong house price growth to continue / equity markets to be supportive), lower $A leading to increased net inbound tourism and less online expenditure, as well as lower oil price and interest rates boosting discretionary income.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:14:39.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
