First half capital expenditure was more than 50 percent below 2014 levels and unit production costs for the first half were 11 percent lower. \nThe underlying performance of the business remains strong. Production was up 13 percent in the first half and continued growth is expected over the next few years, coinciding with the ramp up of GLNG . \nThe GLNG project has made significant progress and remains on track for first LNG around the end of the third quarter. All upstream facilities are fully operational and good progress is being made on commissioning the LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant on Curtis Island.
