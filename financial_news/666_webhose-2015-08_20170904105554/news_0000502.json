PUBLISHED: 17:36, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:06, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 GETTY The Concorde retired from service in 2003 \nThe new model would travel at twice the speed of the retired Concorde, taking passengers from London to New York in just an hour, according to documents filed in the US to grant a patent. A distance of 4,000km, for example Tokyo to Los Angeles or San Franciso to Paris, could be covered in around three hours. Customers will largely be VIPs and business travellers who want trans-continental return journeys within just one day, Airbus said.The \"ultra-rapid air vehicle\" would be capable of flying four times the speed of sound and carrying around 20 passengers.At take-off the futuristic jet would blast into the air reaching a near-vertical angle to break the speed of MACH 1, according to the details. The hypersonic aircraft would then cruise at a speed between MACH 4 and MACH 4.5 on the edge of space at an altitude of around 100,000 feet - around 20 kilometres higher than the typical commercial plane currently travels.

The model features three different types of engines and Airbus said it would also have environmental benefits by being partly power through combining oxygen and hydrogen.Concorde was taken out of service in 2003, it travelled at twice the speed of sound and carried up to 120 passengers. A spokesperson for Airbus said that the patent is a very early stage of concept and does not mean that the model will become a reality. He said: \"Airbus Group and its divisions apply for hundreds of patents every year in order to protect intellectual property. \"These patents are often based on research and development concepts and ideas in a very nascent stage of conceptualisation, and not every patent progresses to becoming a fully realised technology or product.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:39:31.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
