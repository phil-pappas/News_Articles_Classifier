Keep it up China Henan. \nOne of the things common among some local contractors is setting of wrong priorities. It is always prudent to handle public funds with utmost caution by sticking to the prime objective and repelling temptation of experimental adjustments such as diverting money to other short-term ambitions which are not in the approved plan, with the hope of reconciling transactions later. \nThis has, most times, proved disastrous. \nIt is important, therefore, to develop a progressive culture of impeccable integrity on one hand and build capacity on the hand that will meet the challenges of our society. \nThat way, development will spread evenly and rapidly.
