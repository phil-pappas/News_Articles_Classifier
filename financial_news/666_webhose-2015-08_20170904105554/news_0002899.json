Without the decline in oil and gas prices, the trade surplus would have fallen compared with the previous year. \nGermany has come under international pressure to reduce its trade surplus, which critics say contributes to imbalances in the world economy. \nIn a report published last month, the International Monetary Fund said Berlin should focus on bolstering mediumâ€“term growth and reducing external imbalances. \nThe European Commission considers trade surpluses that are repeatedly over 6 percent of economic output as dangerous for stability and has urged Germany to undertake more investment to stimulate imports. \nDespite a fall in exports in June, the larger net balance between exports and imports meant that the trade surplus widened to a record 24.0 billion euros ($26.19 billion), data published on Friday showed. \n(Reporting by Caroline Copley; editing by Andrew Roche)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T15:59:53.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
