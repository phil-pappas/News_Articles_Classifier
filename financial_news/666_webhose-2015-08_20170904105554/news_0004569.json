The RBA subsequently revised its forecast for the unemployment rate with the publication of its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy. It is now forecasting it to remain steady around six per cent, rather than peak at 6.5 per cent in mid-2016. \"Today's official statement suggests the RBA appears to be more comfortable with the current policy settings,\" he said. St George Bank chief economist Hans Kunnen saw implications in the upbeat discussion of the economy. \"Given the relatively optimistic tone of the Statement, further cuts to the cash rate seem unlikely,\" he said. Royal Bank of Canada's Su-Lin Ong zeroed in on the RBA's preoccupation with the slow GDP/faster jobs growth conundrum, and its implication that the economy might not have to pick up as much before hitting its maximum sustainable growth rate. \"By definition, this argues against further easing and will likely water down further its easing bias,\" she said. Between the RBA's interest rate decision on Tuesday and the quarterly report on Friday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the July labour force figures. As happens about half the time, most likely due to random variation in the household survey sample that tends to push employment and labour force participation in the same direction from one month to the next, employment and the unemployment rate moved in seemingly contradictory directions. Employment grew strongly by 38,500, but the unemployment rate jumped to 6.3 per cent from 6.1 per cent previously. NAB's chief market economist Ivan Colhoun advised looking past the monthly volatility. \"We'd discount the sharp rise in unemployment as the start of a new trend and instead conclude that the unemployment rate has been broadly stable at around the 6.1 to 6.2 per cent mark,\" he said. \"This is still a better outcome than appeared likely a few months ago.\" ANZ's Justin Fabo said it was likely that the figures had been affected by the changing household sample, which the ABS said had boosted the employment reading, and warned that there may be some \"payback\" in coming months. \"Our view is that employment growth will moderate over the second half of 2015, consistent with the slower recent trend in job advertising and a softening trend in GDP growth,\" Mr Fabo said.
