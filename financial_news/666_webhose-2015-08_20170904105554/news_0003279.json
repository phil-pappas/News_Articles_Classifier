The company expects valuation of its mobile tower company to be to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore.\nFrom 2010 fiscal onwards, BSNL began sharing its tower assets with other operators but it is yet to realise full potential of its market share.\nThe Cabinet also approved to extend financial support of Rs 169.16 crore to BSNL and Rs 458.04 crore to MTNL totalling Rs 627.20 crore on surrender of 800 MHz CDMA carriers in few of their circles, the source added.\nBSNL has surrendered spectrum (one carrier of 1.25 MHz each) for 4 circles and MTNL in Delhi and Mumbai (two carriers of 1.25 MHz each).\nThe source further said there has been a gain for the government as the sale of this spectrum for 20 years has yielded a revenue of Rs 3,997.61 crore to the government which otherwise would not have been available in case the spectrum was not put to auction.\n“The surrender of spectrum by BSNL and MTNL enhanced contiguity of spectrum in some licensed service areas thereby enabling higher prices obtained in auction,” the source said.\nContiguity of spectrum enhances the special efficiency, and usability of airwaves with different technologies has an impact on competitive bidding through e-auction.\nOn hiving off BSNL towers into a separate company, the source said consequent to this approval, the DoT is authorised to constitute an inter-ministerial group for working out the capital and organisational structure of the new company after market valuation of its tower assets for consideration of the Union Cabinet.\n 05, 2015 8:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:00:07.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
