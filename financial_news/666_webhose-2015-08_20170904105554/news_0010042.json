This implies that the Brown Card motor certificate cannot stand alone or should not be issued in isolation of an underlying local motor insurance cover or policy. \n'Invariably, a local policy holder who intends to travel to another ECOWAS country should call at the office of his local insurance company to obtain the Brown Card certificate,' he said. \nMr. Glover warned motorists against the use of fake Brown cards, stating that 'we have discovered that there are a large number of fake Brown Cards in circulation and causing serious challenges to the management of the scheme in the sub-region. A person who issues or tenders false documents commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 25 penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding eight months or both. \nGabriel Glover taking the participants through the topics in Tema \nA Business Desk report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T11:32:41.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
