Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith As the seven or so bid groups in the race for NSW network owner TransGrid gear up to lodge indicative offers, the sensitive issue of security is being discussed only in whispers.\nWhile the scaremongering over Chinese interest in the asset that arose prior to the state election in March could be dismissed as xenophobic, any foreign investment in critical infrastructure will clearly be closely examined.\nTransGrid owns the 12,900-kilometre network of high-voltage transmission lines in NSW as well as the inter-state linkages with Queensland and Victoria, and plays an important role for \"black start\" functions to re-energise the grid in the event of a major system collapse.\nIt also owns a state-wide telecommunications network made up of microwave radio systems and an optical fibre system.\nOn any count it's a vital asset underpinning the economies of the biggest state and the national capital, more \"critical\" than the Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy distribution businesses to be offered later in the NSW privatisation process, and 100 per cent is on offer.\nAny bidder seeking to take the 99-year lease over from TransGrid will face close scrutiny of its capability and governance. Any overseas acquisition has to pass a \"national interest\" assessment by the Foreign Investment Review Board.\nSix of the seven groups in the TransGrid process have foreign participation, but much of that is passive, in the form of pension and infrastructure funds. That leaves a scattering of sovereign wealth funds, US private equity and at least three overseas utilities: Hong Kong's privately controlled Cheung Kong Infrastructure, which owns several power assets in Australia; Chinese government-owned State Grid Corporation, which already owns networks in Victoria and South Australia; and its smaller state rival China Southern Power Grid, a potential new entrant.\nCKI is bidding alone, while State Grid has linked with Macquarie's infrastructure arm, and China Southern is with China Investment Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners.\n Range of options for offshore bids Keen to maximise competition until a deal is struck, the government is requiring bidders to tick off early on governance and regulatory approvals. Banking and legal sources suggest a range of options for foreign bid groups to meet FIRB concerns, including capping equity stakes of individual parties, giving guarantees on the make-up of the board or management team or even outsourcing the grid's telecommunications functions.\nIn any case, it won't be carte blanche for the buyer, NSW Treasurer Gladys Berejiklian signals, noting the government has been \"proactively engaging\" with FIRB on the transactions.\n\"Following the transactions, the NSW government will retain significant influence over the assets as lessor, as licensor, as safety and reliability regulator, through the planning system, through the National Electricity Market rules and through network price regulation,\" she says.\nState Grid has already twice successfully negotiated the FIRB process, in its $500 million purchase of 41 per cent of South Australia's ElectraNet in 2012, and in a $US7.5 billion deal with Singapore Power that gave it holdings in AusNet Services and unlisted Jemena.\nFor ElectraNet, it secured FIRB approval early to be able to lodge an unconditional bid and avoid any disadvantage. The SingPower deal clearance required at least half the directors appointed to the boards of AusNet and Jemena to be local Australian citizens.\nThe Australian deals are among a string of recent overseas acquisitions by State Grid, including a 25 per cent stake in the Portuguese grid – the maximum allowed by any buyer – and a 41 per cent stake in an Italian network owner.\nBut it has hit some hurdles, notably the decision by the Philippine government in February to expel Chinese technical experts employed by State Grid at its Philippine operation due to security concerns.\nHandling of the foreign bids in the TransGrid process will be closely watched.\namacdonald-smith@afr.com.au\nTwitter: @angelamacd\n.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@angelamacd", "https://twitter.com/angelamacd"], "published": "2015-08-06T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:08:39.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
