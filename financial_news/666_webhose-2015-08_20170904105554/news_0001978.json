The boroughs of Hammersmith & Fulham and Camden also suffer from a house-price multiple above 20 times local incomes.\nThe 15 least affordable areas for private renting were all London boroughs, with tenants in those such as Newham and Brent expected to hand over 65% of their pay for the average private flat. Newham also had the highest average rent for socially provided housing at £128.90 a week. The most affordable London borough was Bexley, but even there the average private rent took 40% of monthly salary, according to the ONS.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In some parts of the country, such as Newcastle, the price/income ratio has fallen since hitting a peak in 2007.
