She also said both sides may appeal Thursday's ruling immediately in light of the stakes.\n\"There are billions of dollars riding on this decision,\" she wrote. \"CEOC has already filed for bankruptcy, and-given the amount at stake-a decision in plaintiffs' favor would likely open the door to a bankruptcy filing by CEC.\"\nScheindlin scheduled a conference for Oct. 7.\nLawyers for the bond trustees did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Caesars did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nThe Caesars operating unit filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in January.\nIts parent has been trying to avoid that fate while the operating unit attempts to reach a consensus with creditors on restructuring its roughly $18 billion debt load.\nBased in Las Vegas, Caesars was created through the 2008 buyout of the former Harrah's Entertainment.\nOn Friday, the company said it had won support for a restructuring of the operating unit from lenders representing the most senior $12 billion of that unit's capital structure.\nCaesars shares closed up 25.5 cents at $8.71.\nThe cases are BOKF NA v Caesars Entertainment Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-01561; and UMB Bank NA v Caesars Entertainment Corp in the same court, No. 15-04634.
