To date, US$7,8 million has been disbursed. \nThis support was channelled towards construction of 12 court houses set to be complete by year end in Beitbridge, Chivi, Rutenga, Binga, Nkayi, Victoria Falls, Mvuma, Shurugwi, Zvishavane, Bindura, Goromonzi and Murambinda. \nZimbabwe is also benefiting under the Zimbabwe Reconstruction Fund (Zimref) which runs until 2019. \nThe fund has pledges amounting to US$36,5 million, of which US$11,5 million has been disbursed into the World Bank account. \nThe funders are the European Union which has made available €10 million, Sweden (US$5 million), Norway (US$4,3 million), State and Peace Building Trust Fund (US$5 million), Denmark (US$1 million), Germany (US$1 million) and the Department for International Development (£6 million). \nKey projects being funded this year by Zimref are the Zimbabwe National Water project to the tune of US$20 million, public financial management enhancement project (US$20 million), business environment enabling programme (US$4 million) and parastatal reform support (US$6 million.). \nOther schemes to benefit from the fund are productive safety nets project, results-based budgeting, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation, procurement reform programme, health systems strengthening, agri-business and the education sector.
