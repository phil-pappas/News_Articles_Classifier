Due to financial constraints many small and mid-size companies prefer doing in-house accounting leaving them devoid of sound financial advice. In the absence of chief financial officer expenditure calculations and zero guidance on budgeting decisions, SME’s face the threat of a shutdown.

The minimum wage rate has been growing steadily whereas there is a diminishing trend of per capita income, which finally taxes small business owners. The CEO of the organization then has to look through financial aspects, address the expenses, and prioritize crucial moves all with a singular mindset. This exhausts the drive and eats up precious time and energy of a person who is supposed to move the company through to its vision.\nScenarios like the ones above gave rise to the concept of a virtual CFO.
