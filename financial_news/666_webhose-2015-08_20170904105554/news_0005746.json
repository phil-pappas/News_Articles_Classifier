Kroger Co. is getting some national TV love from financial news network CNBC for the way it's manhandling its competittors. Eric Rosenbaum , a financial writer and editor for the cable network, asked in a recent article about consumer staples stocks , “What do you get when you cross Whole Foods and Wal-Mart?” His answer: Kroger. Rosenbaum wrote that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Whole Foods (NYSE: WFM) have been “crushed” so far this year. Each stock plunged at least 16 percent through the first half of the year. But Cincinnati-based Kroger (NYSE: KR) has been able to clean up in their wake. Its stock surged 22 percent through the first six months of the year. That’s not all. It has taken investors on a rocket ride the past couple of years, with shares soaring 62 percent last year and 52 percent in 2013. Why? Scott Mushkin , an analyst at New York-based Wolfe Research who’s talked to me about Kroger , told Rosenbaum that Kroger is beating up on its rivals by targeting the middle class and getting the best of both worlds. Kroger now offers a huge array of organic foods at better prices than Whole Foods, and it’s kept its prices relatively competitive with Wal-Mart while offering higher quality products. “Kroger has learned how to do natural and organic,” Mushkin told Rosenbaum. “Whole Foods has an enormous price problem and Kroger can mimic them for less.” Kroger also gains because it’s so big – it’s the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets – and it has a better business model than many peers. Mushkin cited Wal-Mart battling minimum-wage increases around the country. But Kroger’s unionized workforce means it isn’t affected by those pay changes as much. Wal-Mart’s cost gap is narrowing. It adds up to a healthy gain for Kroger investors so far this year, putting the company just outside the top five consumer staples stocks in the S&P 500 for the first half of the year. By the way, if you’re wondering about the worst consumer staples stocks on the S&P 500 so far this year, No. 4 on that list is Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG), with a 16 percent decline through the end of the second quarter. \nWant Cincinnati Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
