This hindered meaningful mineral exploration.\" \nMsaka said the first time Malawi collected mineral data was 30 years ago during the era of late dictator Kamuzu Banda, when Malawi \"did not have enough details and accurate data.\" \nHe said the new data, acquired using modern and state-of-the art equipment, \"was accurate and will reduce needless speculation and the high risks involved in discovering mineral resources.\" \nMsaka said he hoped Malawi, like Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique, would now \"witness a surge in foreign investment in the minerals industry\". \nNeville Huxham, managing director of Global Metals and Mining (Africa) Limited, an Australian firm mining niobium, told AFP the survey was \"a step in the right direction because it is simply showing us where there is a possibility for exploration and Malawi's mineral potential.\" \nHe said Malawians would now be \"well-informed of what is involved in mineral exploration and realise that they won't be millionaires overnight. \n\"A great deal of work now begins because you need a lot of investment to open a mine.\" \nMalawi's minerals industry, on average, contributed around 1.5 percent to national income between 2006 and 2010, according to the World Bank. \nThe bank projected that the sector would contribute 2.8 percent to the economy between 2011 and this year. \nMsaka said the industry was set to \"drive the diversification of the agrarian-dependent economy.\" \nHe said that because of its dependence on agriculture, with tobacco contributing nearly 70 percent of foreign exchange earnings, Malawi had been hard hit by the global anti-smoking lobby and unpredictable climatic conditions. \nHalf of Malawi?s population of around 16 million live on less than a dollar a day. \nThe Kayelekera uranium mine in Karonga district, northern Malawi, remains the single biggest mining project, after opening in 2009. \nThe project is owned by Paladin Africa, an Australian firm which holds an 85-percent stake, with the government holding the remaining shares. \nThe mine suspended its operations last year due to low prices at the international market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:45:53.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
