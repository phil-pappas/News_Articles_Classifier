What are the tax reliefs? \n● Income tax relief on investment at 30 per cent \n● CGT liabilities in investment year can be deferred \n● Returns exempt from capital gains tax (CGT) \n● Losses can offset income tax payable that year \n● Investments must be held for at least three years to qualify \nDan Hird, head of corporate finance at Triodos Bank, says the returns targeted by such bonds, contingent entirely on a project’s results, will be attractive to many income-starved investors in the context of historically low yields. \nMr Hird cites the example of Ambition East Midlands , a social impact bond targeting youth homelessness that launched in January. The three-year bond offers investors annual returns of up to 7 per cent a year. Triodos’ clients contributed a total of £50,000 in SITR-qualifying investments. \n“Assuming they get their money back at the end — and this is a big if — they could achieve returns of around 14.5 per cent [net of tax] and are also helping 300 young people.” \nNot all marketed returns are this high. A recent SITR loan offer by FC United of Manchester, a small football club that raised £2m through a community share offer for its stadium, offered investors optional annual returns of 2 per cent. \nFor social investment to take off, however, many in the sector point to the development of funds to aggregate investment and diversify investor risk. \n£270,000 \nValue of FC United of Manchester loan offer to finance football and educational facilities in a deprived community, with investments from £10,000 and up \n“If you invest in an individual enterprise, all of your eggs are in one basket,” says Thomas Gillan, chief financial officer at Social Investment Scotland (SIS), a lending intermediary that has launched one of the first two funds targeting SITR-qualifying investments. \nThe SIS community capital fund, which Mr Gillan says will lend to six to eight Scottish social enterprises, has raised roughly £320,000 so far from 20 investors. It is aiming to raise a total of £500,000. \nMr Gillan says that while some investors are motivated by the social returns, others are more concerned with SITR qualification. “Some have previously done ethical investment, others have a tax liability and want a tax-efficient place for their money.” \nA second SITR fund, launched by Resonance, hopes to raise £5m to tackle poverty in Bristol, and has a pipeline of possible investments, including social enterprises that tackle homelessness and offer rehabilitation for young offenders. How does SITR work? \nAlthough individuals can invest up to £1m each year into any number of projects, qualifying enterprises can currently only receive a total of roughly £250,000 under current EU rules. There are hopes this will soon be increased. \nInvestment can be in the form of either equity or debt. Social enterprise shares cannot be listed, and investors must not be entitled to dividends that are fixed or above reasonable commercial rates. \nMoney lent to qualifying enterprises cannot be secured by assets, and the debt — like share capital — must rank below all others in the event of commercial failure. In other words, SITR investors can’t be guaranteed to get their money back before other lenders or shareholders. \nAll money raised through SITR must be invested by the social enterprise within two years and four months, for the purpose of the qualifying trade. \nIf the Bristol fund is successful, Resonance aims to replicate the model in other areas of the country. Anti-social challenges \nFor investors, however, the buy-in is high. To invest in the Resonance fund, participants must commit at least £10,000 upfront. Their Scottish counterparts have set the bar at £5,000. \nThese minimum limits — comparable with those for EIS investments — mean SITR investment is, for now at least, the preserve of the relatively wealthy. This is not coincidental — the promotion of SITR products, like EIS, is restricted to sophisticated and high net worth investors as the underlying investments are deemed higher risk. \nAlthough they can deliver strong returns, social impact bonds are especially risky, says Simon Rowell, a director of strategy at Big Society Capital. “They are at the more risky end of the spectrum, as there is no payment if targets are not met.” \nMr Hird at Triodos says the bank only promotes social impact bonds to customers “who can afford to lose” their investments. \nCharles Mesquita, a senior director at Stanhope Consulting, says social investment is inherently a challenging concept for investors. “You need to be very clear about what you’re trying to achieve . . . [and] expertise to validate if it is a good business idea or not.” \n“Unless you have good advice and due diligence, there is a danger people might invest in something they don’t fully understand,” says Mr Francis. \nSocial investments are inherently long-term — not only are returns often contingent on long-term success, but must they also be held for three years to qualify for tax reliefs under SITR. \n£70,000 \nSITR funds raised by charity FareShare South West to finance a loan that will be repaid by catering using food that would otherwise be thrown away, supplying over 130 community organisations \nIn the absence of an established secondary market, these unlisted investments are highly illiquid, although there are efforts to address this. \nEthex is one platform that allows social investments, including community shares and social impact bonds, to be exchanged. \nLisa Ashford, chief executive, says that while shares are inherently more liquid than bonds, even the latter can trade at a premium in the secondary market. Five-year bonds in Golden Lane Housing, which provides housing for people with learning disabilities, are a recent example, resold two years after issuance. \nIn the future, social VCTs — proposed by the chancellor in the March Budget — could offer a more liquid investment proposition, as VCTs are listed, and bring the sector closer to the mainstream. These products remain a way off, however, and fund managers have expressed concerns they may not take off in their current form. \n£40,000 \nTotal raised from six investors by the Freedom Bakery, in Scotland, to fund a project that will give recently released prisoners skills and reduce reoffending \nWhile the goal of mass participation in social investment therefore remains distant, concerns for now focus on the first few products ahead of the anticipated increase in investment limits. \n“This market is very important and needs to be nurtured carefully, as do investors,” says Mr Francis. “I would be cautious about democratising investments too early, before there is a track record.” Case study: SITR bond \nThis January, Mike Davies, a retired solicitor from Bristol, joined a pioneering band of investors. He was one of four individuals to invest £10,000 in the first social impact bond to qualify for SITR. \nThe three-year project targets youth homelessness in the county of Gloucestershire. \nAspire , the charity partnership running the programme, will be paid by government according to its results. Specifically, homeless or vulnerable 18 to 24 year olds must be housed, then helped into education, training or work. \nAlthough Aspire aims to pay tax-free returns of 7 per cent a year — up to 19 per cent, taking SITR into account — investors will only receive this if targets are met.
