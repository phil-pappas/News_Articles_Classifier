The judge, Jeremy Cooke, called him “the hub of the conspiracy” to rig LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate. The nature of his offence is less easy to explain than, say, burglary, making explosives or cannabis-peddling—other offences that carry 14-year sentences in Britain. He made his employers—UBS and then Citi—hundreds of millions distorting LIBOR to suit his trading positions.

Beyond Bernie Madoff, the Ponzi-schemer who copped 150 years in American jail, few white-collar criminals spend more than a year or two behind bars. Other crooked traders, including Kweku Adoboli, a former colleague of Mr Hayes at UBS, got off much more lightly.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20150808_FNC300.png"], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:16:08.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
