Photo: Michele Mossop\nDo corporate chief executives make too much money or too little?\nAt first glance, it seems like an outlandish question. After all, the ratio of what the chief executives of America's largest companies are paid to that of average workers has soared from 20:1 in 1965 to more than 300:1. Corporate chieftains used to be affluent professionals not unlike doctors or lawyers; now they are among the mega-wealthy.\nOn the other hand, the stewardship of large, complex companies is really important, and anyone who cares about the US economy should want the most capable people in charge of them.\nDouglas McMillon, for example, makes more than $US19 million a year (including unvested stock grants) to run Wal-Mart, a company with 2.2 million employees and half a trillion dollars in revenue. That's a lot of money, no doubt. But 26 Major League Baseball players make more than that. It is a safe bet that the future of the US economy depends more heavily on how well McMillon does his job than how well Albert Pujols does his, even if Los Angeles Angels fans might disagree.\nAll of which helps explain America's confused approach to regulating executive pay, which is embodied in a new rule that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved on Wednesday .\nPublicly traded companies will now be required to disclose how much their chief executives are paid relative to their median workers. The idea is that those with particularly enormous pay gaps between their top executives and ordinary workers will face public and investor pressure to narrow them. It might even be enough to make boards think twice about giving their chief executive a raise, or make them more sympathetic to raising pay for the rank and file.\nWe'll see. But the fact that this is the most significant policy initiative on executive pay of the Obama years - and that it took five years of rule-making purgatory since being initially legislated in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act - reveals how conflicted public policy remains over why executive pay has risen so drastically and what, if anything, can be done about it.\nThere are competing (and not necessarily exclusive) theories as to why executive pay has soared so much.\nOne is that it reflects self-dealing by corporate boards, mutual back-scratching by corporate elites who overpay one another out of some kind of cultural solidarity. Another is that this is a manifestation of winner-take-all effects that are prevalent in the modern economy, where the very best at something earn vast rewards and everybody else is out of luck.\nIn the first story, high chief executive pay is basically irrational, a fraud upon shareholders and workers alike. In the second story, high executive pay is more or less rational. If you are a director at a major company, it's worth paying tens of millions of dollars a year to get an executive who you expect will increase the company's value by billions. In this telling, McMillon vastly out-earns a typical Wal-Mart cashier for the same reasons that Pujols vastly out-earns a minor-league baseball player.\nAdvocates of the new SEC rules generally emphasise the self-dealing story. The Economic Policy Institute notes that chief executive pay has risen even faster since 1979 than overall pay for the top 0.1 per cent. And if that's right, then you can imagine subtle regulatory changes like the new disclosure rules mattering. If boards are overpaying chief executives because they are selfish or stupid, exposing their pay practices to the light of day might make some difference.\nBut things get a great deal trickier if the second story is closer to the truth. If chief executives are receiving eight-figure pay packages because in a modern economy they really are worth that, then boards should ignore whatever public pressure comes their way from disclosure of pay gaps.\nAnd if boards do respond to public pressure and slash executives' pay, publicly traded companies could see an exit of top talent toward privately held companies that don't face similar disclosure rules, potentially making some of America's biggest and most important firms less well run as a consequence.\nIn this version, if you believe that there is something fundamentally unfair about an economy that shifts more and more of the rewards of growth to the ultra-wealthy, you would want to deal with it with policies that apply to everyone, not just the chief executives of one subset of corporate America. For example, you could raise the marginal tax rate on income above some high number and use the extra revenue to fund a higher earned-income tax credit that essentially subsidises the working class.\nThat, of course, would never pass a Republican Congress that is staunchly opposed to higher top tax rates. But it would apply equally to all the winners in the winner-take-all economy, whether they are elite baseball players, heads of public companies or executives of privately held companies.\nSo, in effect, the conservative argument that high executive pay reflects the market at work implies that fighting inequality requires a more radical set of policy responses than conservatives could ever get behind. And the liberal argument that it is a problem of bad incentives and corporate misdeeds implies that smaller interventions might do the trick, even if many on the left would prefer a more robust set of policies to reduce inequality.\nEither way, the five-year drama of the new chief executive pay rule that concluded on Wednesday makes this clear: Even small changes to policy around executive pay won't come easy.\nNew York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:18:46.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
