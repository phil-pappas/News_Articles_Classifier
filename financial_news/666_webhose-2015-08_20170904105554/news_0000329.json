It's not just more useful than ever (mostly), now that Samsung has done away with the plastic that has bedecked the Note in past years, it's finally pretty, too.\nIt's early days in the review process -- at the time of writing this, I've had less than two hours with the Galaxy Note5 and its stylus-free cousin, the Galaxy S6 edge+, making this more a preview than a review -- but so far so good.\nThe 2015 update to the beloved Note franchise does the main thing I was hoping it would do -- it makes the Note finally look and feel like the premium device that it has always been at heart -- and it has a couple of unexpected but very welcome features, too, that make it more than just cosmetic makeover.\nThe add-on keyboard case (middle) isn't bad, but it's no BlackBerry keyboard. It's faster than handwriting, but slower than you might hope. John Dav idson The cosmetic upgrade to the Note5 is very good, and even better than expected, though it does come at a price.\nAs expected, Samsung has upgraded the Note5's case to the same glass and aluminium finish it introduced with the Galaxy S6 earlier this year, making the Note5 equal to the S6 as one of the prettiest phones on the market. And based on the fact I've dropped the Galaxy S6 onto concrete more than a few times, to absolutely no ill effect, the Note5 should prove to be one of the more robust phones on the market, too, despite that worrying glass finish.\nImproved ergonomics What I wasn't expecting from the Note5, though, was the curve Samsung added to the back side edges of the Note5, to make it easier to hold.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements If you've seen the curved screen on the Galaxy S6 edge, all you have to do is imagine that same curve on the back of the phone rather than the front, and you're imagining the shape of the Note5. The curve on the back is so similar to the curve on the screen, in fact, that if you sandwich a Note5 and a Galaxy S6 edge+ together and look at them side on, they look almost identical, except one has a curved front and a flat back, and the other has a flat front and a curved back.\nAt the same time, Samsung has introduced an incredibly thin bezel to the Note5 -- I don't have my trusty caliper with me here in New York, but the bezel has to be only 1mm wide at the sides -- allowing it to shave around 3mm from the width of the phone. Combine the curve on the back with the thinner width, and you wind up with a phone that's noticeably easier to hold, without any change to the screen size. One-handed operation of the Note, always a problem for an oversized phone, is just a little less problematic on the Note5.\nDisadvantages The drawback to this improved styling and ergonomics is that it has come at the cost of a productivity benefit that many busy people hold dear: you can no longer replace the battery, at least not without sending it off to a shop for a permanent replacement, meaning you can no longer carry a spare to get you through a long, busy day. It's less a problem on the Note than on other phones, due to the extended battery life you get from the phone's bigger battery, but it's going to be a turn off for people who like to hear the sound of their own voice.\nLikewise, the fancy new case leaves no room for a removable SD Card, which is going to be an issue, say for people who travel a lot for work, and who like to use their Note for watching videos when they're away from home. The razer-sharp, 5.7-inch screen on the Note5 make it a great phone for watching videos. The lack of an SD Card makes it a little less so.\nSomething for the note takers As for the note taking functionality of the Note, it's had some handy improvements that will mean a lot to some users and little to many. They will mean especially little users such as Adelgunde, my partner, who use a Note for its big screen rather than for its note taking capabilities. I doubt she's ever pulled the Note's stylus from its holster. But Samsung is hoping to switch such users over to the S6 edge+, leaving the Note for the note takers of the world, like me.\nFor us note takers, there's a new feature that lets you turn on the Note5, unlock it and call up a scribble pad, just by pulling the stylus out of its slot at the bottom of the phone. It works just as fast and as well as you might hope, and will be a boon for anyone who uses the Note to scribble down quick thoughts. (I jot down a lot of column ideas on the Note 4, so that feature will be huge for me.)\nThe quick-to-launch notes are limited to a single screen in length (in fact they're saved as the single-page Action Memos that were in the Note 4, only as far as I can tell without the ability to assign actions to them, at least on the quick-launch screen), but for a quick scribbled note, a single page is generally all you need anyway.\nIf the thought turns into a longer idea, you can probably convert the Action Memo into a regular S Note notebook with a stroke of the pen, the way you can on the Note 4, though to tell the truth I didn't remember to check that feature. I should have written myself a note.\nSpeaking of longer notes, another feature on the Note5 that also looks very handy is the stylus-based screen grabbing, that lets you grab documents a whole document at a time, rather than just a screen at a time the way you can now. It's not implemented as well as you might hope -- you can't just tell the phone to screen grab an entire web page, but rather you have to keep extending the screen grab one screen at a time -- but at least you'll now be able to save long web pages as a single image rather than as five, ten or 20 separate images, the way you have to on the Note 4.\nOther things about the Note5's note taking have been updated, too. The tip of the pen now has a slightly less squishy feel to it when you press it to the glass of the screen, though whether that's an improvement is an open question. I quite enjoy the slightly ponderous feel of the stylus on the Note 4. It feels a little slower, which ironically enough is part of appeal of the Note franchise: it's for people who like the old fashioned idea of writing with a pen and paper, but don't have the time for such a quaint act.\nThe Note5 has a new camera, too, that looks like it will be every bit as good as the brilliant camera on the Galaxy S6. But in the short time I had with the new phone, I forgot to review that feature, too. If only I'd had a Note5 with me when I thinking about what I wanted to look at.\nExpect a full review early next week, filling in the blanks.\nJohn Davidson travelled to New York as a guest of Samsung", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-08-13T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:10:46.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
