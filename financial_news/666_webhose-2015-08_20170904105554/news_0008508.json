Local funds often look to offshore comps as key pricing references even if they lack the currency flexibility to invest overseas.\nThe leads compiled a bumper book in excess of A$3 billion that enabled guidance to be tightened to 65bp-70bp and 110b-115bp without a significant decline in orders before Friday's pricing at the tight end of these ranges.\nDemand was balanced between the two maturities. The A$1.1 billion two-piece four-year consisted of a A$700 million floating-rate note and a A$400 million 2.85 percent August 28 2019 fixed-rate note, priced at 99.887 for a yield of 2.88 percent, equivalent to 96bp over the 2019 Australian Commonwealth government bond. The A$1.15 billion 3.7 percent seven-year priced at 99.939 to yield 3.71 percent, 141.4bp wide of ACGBs.\nWhile Apple's debut is a clear success, previous false dawns have dampened predictions of a surge in corporate Kangaroo issuance. Bankers had hoped that BP's well received A$500 million debut in August 2012 would kick start the market but the UK energy firm's subsequent trade fell flat as it raised just A$300 million from another five-year offering 15 months later.\nFrench energy company Total also underwhelmed with its A$350 million five-year sale in November 2014, two months after state-owned Korea National Oil Corp also raised A$350 million via its five-year debut. A$500 million is seen as the minimum-sized trade to tempt most global corporate issuers to Australia.\nThere have also been sporadic success stories, however, most recently with SABMiller's stunning A$700 million five-year print on July 31. The world's second-largest brewer by revenue showed there is plenty of depth in the Australian corporate bond market for the right name at the right price.\nAlthough the SABMiller issue, through FBG Treasury (Aust), was technically a domestic corporate offering, investors treated it as a corporate Kangaroo because its global parent is the guarantor.\nSimilarly, Anglo-Swiss mining giant Glencore received a warm reception for its A$500 million five-year trade last September that, like SABMiller, was issued via a local subsidiary.\nNeither of these trades gets close to Apple's stellar debut, which as well as being Australia's biggest corporate bond is the first multi-tenor corporate offering in the Kangaroo market. The seven-year piece also represents the longest maturity to date for a corporate Kangaroo.\nImportantly, Apple raised a similar amount in US dollar equivalent terms as it did in its four other overseas ports of call; November 2014's 1.8 billion euros ($1.99 billion) eight- and 12-year trade, this February's Sfr1.25 billion ($1.28 billion) 10- and 15-year sale, June's 250 trillion yen ($2.1 billion) five-year global yen print and last month's 1.25 billion pounds ($1.95 billion) 14- and 27-year sterling issuance.\nOne advantage with Kangaroo trades is they can be lubricated by Australian banks' huge demand for foreign currency funding, estimated this year to be around $40 billion-$50 billion equivalent. Since Aussie banks must pay hedging costs on their foreign currency borrowings to avoid adding to systemic risk, offshore issuers can benefit by taking the other side of the hedging contract when they borrow in Australian dollars.
