Fidelity Investments says the trend has further to go.\nThe extra yield on 10-year notes over two-year securities shrank to 147 basis points Tuesday, the narrowest spread in three months. Traders in the world’s biggest bond market call this a flattening of the yield curve. The figure is less than the average of almost 2 percentage points for the past five years.\nLong-term yields have fallen over the past month as a decline in oil prices curbed the outlook for inflation. Shorter-maturity yields, which are more sensitive to what the Federal Reserve does with its main interest rate, have climbed as the central bank prepares to increase borrowing costs.\n“The most likely path is for short and intermediate rates to rise modestly, while longer rates stay relatively stable,” Fidelity, the Boston-based money manager with $2.1 trillion of assets, said in a report last week. “The yield curve could flatten.”\nBenchmark 10-year note yields were little changed at 2.23 percent as of 10:27 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2.125 percent security due in May 2025 was 99 2/32.\nTwo-year notes yielded 0.73 percent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised investors to get out of the securities as the Fed gets ready to increase interest rates, in a report last week.\nSupport Growth Policy makers have kept their benchmark, the target for overnight loans between banks, in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to support the U.S. economy.\nThere’s a 76 percent chance the Fed will act at or before its December meeting, based on the assumption that the effective federal funds rate will average 0.375 percent following the increase, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nCrude oil has fallen 27 percent from this year’s high set in May, and bonds show investors expect deflation over the coming 12 months.\nThe difference between one-year U.S. yields and those for similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was negative 0.67 percent. It has been below zero for two weeks.\n“We have a flattening yield curve,” said Kim Youngsung, head of overseas investment at South Korea’s Government Employees Pension Service in Seoul, which oversees the equivalent of $12.8 billion. “Oil prices are a really big problem. That is why long-term interest rates are decreasing. For the short term, everybody expects the Fed to increase interest rates in the next couple of months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T04:53:18.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
