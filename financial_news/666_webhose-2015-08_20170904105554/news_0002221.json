Markets expected more dissent within the nine-member panel. \nThe minutes, which were published alongside the Bank’s decision to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5pc and its stock of asset purchases unchanged at £375bn, showed Ian McCafferty, an external policymaker, felt the risks of the Bank overshooting its 2pc inflation target were now “sufficiently to the upside to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate” to 0.75pc. \nAnalysts had expected up to three members, including Martin Weale, who called for a quarter point hike between August and December last year, to join Mr McCafferty. \nThe Bank lowered its near-term inflation forecasts on Thursday, and now expects inflation to remain close to zero for the next three months, rising to just 0.5pc by the end of this year. \nThe pound, which has climbed by 3.5pc against a basket of other currencies in just three months, is also expected to exert downward pressure on inflation for “some time to come, posing a downside risk to its path in the near term”. \nHowever, it also revised up its expectation for UK growth and earnings. Policymakers now expect the UK economy to expand by 2.8pc this year, compared with a prediction of 2.5pc in May. It revised up its forecasts for wage growth to 3pc this year, from 2.5pc in May. \nWhile average weekly earnings growth of 3.2pc in the three months to May was more than one percentage points above policymakers’ expectations three months ago, the MPC said it remained uncertain whether this represented increases in current labour costs or reflected the distribution of past profits. \nMark Carney, the Bank’s Governor, said the path of productivity growth, which was also revised up for 2015, and wage increases would be key components for deciding on interest rate rises. \nThe Bank also expects the unemployment rate to fall at a much slower pace in the coming months. It believes the jobless rate will remain at 5.6pc until the three months to September. In May, the MPC expected the June data to already show unemployment falling to 5.4pc. \nMr Carney described the rapid fall in consumer prices inflation, which has now been below the Bank’s 2pc target since January 2014, as the “most striking development in the UK in the past year”. \n\"The near-term outlook for inflation is muted and the falls in energy prices over the past few months will continue to bear down on inflation at least until the middle of next year,” he told reporters. \nHe said is was possible that the UK could return to negative inflation for in the coming months because of recent oil price falls. However, this is not the committee’s central projection and Mr Carney wrote in a letter to Chancellor George Osborne that this “did not point to a more general deflationary trend”. \nHowever, the Bank also noted that inflation “move slightly above the target in the third year of the forecast period as sustained growth leads to a degree of excess demand”. \nMr Carney said this suggested that the “timing of the first Bank rate increase is drawing closer” and said committee members would look through temporary inflation shocks and focus on developments in core inflation, which strips out volatile price movements in energy and food. The Bank said on Thursday that it expects the drag from past falls in food and energy prices to \"diminish\" in the second half of this year. \n“If the economy progresses broadly in line with this forecast, the decision is going to come. There were some big changes between May and August, but as a whole, in the judgment of the committee we are moving closer to the point where the first interest rate increase might happen.” \nWhile the minutes showed “some members” also saw “upside risks to the inflation forecasts”, they suggested Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, remained the most cautious MPC member. “For one member, the lower near-term outlook for CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) inflation meant that the risk of price and wage expectations falling further remained a significant consideration,” the minutes said. \nMr Carney said policymakers were never likely to be in a position where there were no headwinds facing the UK or global economy. “Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) time we’re in front of you there will be a lot of uncertainties, some of which we haven’t predicted but that’s not a justification for permanent stasis,” he said. \nRoss Walker, chief UK economist at RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) , said the probability of a rate hike in November, when the Bank produces its next quarterly healthcheck, had receded to “a less than 10pc probability”. “We would have expected much clearer signalling if the MPC was preparing for a November 2015 rate rise,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:50:00.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
