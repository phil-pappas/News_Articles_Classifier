Bradley Kanaris by Agnes King Mel Schneider will earn $10,000 more than her peers when she graduates with a commerce degree in four years' time.\nAfter her final year 12 exam in November, Ms Schneider, a top maths student and co-captain of St Paul's Anglican School in Brisbane, will start a cadetship at accounting firm DFK Hirn Newey.\nShe is one of a small but growing contingent of millennials waking up to the fact that a university degree does not guarantee her a job.\n\"Getting out there early will give me an edge over others,\" Ms Schneider said.\nDFK Hirn Newey is not a large accounting firm. It has three equity partners, 35 staff and generates roughly $4 million in fees a year.\nBut the cadetship program DFK has constructed is being heralded by some as the choice model for young accountants at a time when graduate employment is the worst since the 1992-93 recession. Only 71.3 per cent of bachelor degree graduates have secured work four months after completing their degree, according to the most recent data from Graduate Careers Australia.\nGen Y think too much of themselves \"Gen Y have an overinflated view of themselves and their market value, which is fuelled by adults and educational institutions,\" DFK partner Paul Fiumara said.\n \"They think the world is a great open place that will welcome them with open arms – it's not.\"\nDFK has a relationship with four different Brisbane high schools. It grabs their top maths students on the prerequisite they enrol in a university accounting degree.\nIt pays them the clerical award, which is about $450 a week full-time, and reviews their pay every six months.\n\"After the first 12 months they're typically earning $7000 over the award,\" Mr Fiumara said.\nSmaller accounting firms generally steer clear of hiring graduates because they don't stick around long enough to extract value. Firms invest a lot of time and energy in training, and just as graduates become productive, they leave to join bigger firms or travel.\nGraduates likely to leave sooner \"It's one of the reasons we shy away from [university] graduates,\" Mr Fiumara said.\nHe said cadets are more likely to stay locked in for at least four years, plus another two while they do their Chartered Accountants, or CPA, qualification.\n\"After that, if we've done everything right, they stay,\" Mr Fiumara said.\nDFK has put 15 cadets through the program. Of that contingent, nine are still with the firm. Two are at manager level – one rung below equity partner.\n\"Those that have left, generally travel overseas. That still spreads our reputation around the place,\" Mr Fiumara said.\nDFK cadets can earn up to $170,000 over the four years they are studying. Having four years experience under their belt also makes them more marketable.\nToo many to absorb An accounting graduate with one year of experience claims about $50,000 a year. With the four years this jumps to between $60,000 and $65,000.\nMr Fiumara is not alone in his belief that a return to good old-fashioned traineeships would manufacture more job-ready accountants. However, he feels it should be blended with a university degree \"to bed down the technical stuff\".\nIn the face of the official Graduate Careers Australia statistics, educators concede that Australia's tertiary system is producing too many accountants, with the wrong skills, for the current market to absorb.\nIt has reached a crisis point. And it will get worse.\nA report by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, on future proofing the profession out to 2025 , lists a series of mega trends that are vapourising jobs in the sector at a rapid rate.\nTechnology tops the list. Procedural compliance work is being done by computers, not people. This is one of the reasons that graduate intakes at the big four accounting firms PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG have remained relatively static over the past decade while income has ballooned.\nGraduate hires rose approximately 10 per cent across the big four, while annual revenue has surged by 80 to 180 per cent since 2005. Although big four accounting firms still rank among the biggest graduate recruiters in the country, employing close to 2000 youngsters each year, their workforce is not expanding at anywhere near the same rate as their income.\nOffshoring, outsourcing disruptive Offshoring and outsourcing is also a disruptive force. The number of work hours shovelled offshore is roughly doubling every two years, based on anecdotal evidence from a number of big four firm divisional chiefs and managing partners of suburban accounting practices.\n\"The type of capabilities accountants need emphasised are different,\" University of Sydney Business School associate professor Mark Freeman said.\nAccounting is morphing into what economists call \"interaction jobs\", where technical knowledge is assumed and higher value is applied to a person's ability to interact with internal and external clients, identify problems, come up with alternative solutions, determine which are affordable at this point in time and communicate and influence to deliver an outcome.\nIn this environment \"decisions will be taken by transdisciplinary teams,\" Macquarie University professor Roger Burritt said.\n\"They will require consensus from all, not just the accountant,\" he said.\nOther professions are also beating down on what what accounting and finance professionals do. Big data analysts, for example, are competing for jobs that management accountants historically performed.\nAt the same time, teams have globalised, meaning finance professionals now need to have culturally relevant conversations with people from different countries.\n\"They need more higher-order thinking,\" Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand head of academic relations, Professor James Guthrie said.\nHe said the next decade will see a \"hollowing out of the middle class\", in which people in white-collar professions either evolve into highly skilled mobile workers, commanding better salaries, or fall into low-paid casualised jobs.\nTraining organisations are struggling to supply accountants with this new blend of skills. CAANZ is currently undertaking a big program of work that will turn the concept of its professional year and life-long learning on its head.\nAmid all this tumult, Ms Schneider has no delusions about the profession she is joining. Her mum is an inhouse accountant at a pharmaceutical company.\nAccounting's reputation as a \"safe\" a career – or at least a good cornerstone qualification – remains intact, especially since most parallel professions are being bombarded to varying degrees by similar challenges.", "external_links": ["https://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/secure/myCommunity/blogs/jguthrie/education-matters/581/future-proofing-the-profession-preparing-business-leaders-and-finance-professionals-for-2025"], "published": "2015-08-11T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:54:41.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
