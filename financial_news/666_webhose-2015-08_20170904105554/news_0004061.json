BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) slumped after saying it would cut 380 jobs at its Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine in Australia amid challenging market conditions. \nDixons Carphone (Stuttgart: CWB.SG - news ) dropped on news the personal data of up to 2.4 million customers may have been exposed in a cyber attack. \nAnglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) was in the red after a Chilean newspaper reported that a British investment fund will buy the Chilean copper assets being sold by the miner. \nOn the upside, Carillion (Other OTC: CIOIF - news ) gained after saying it has been selected by the UK government for a new facilities management services agreement that could earn the construction and outsourcing company up to £4.1bn. \nMeggitt (Other OTC: MEGGF - news ) advanced after agreeing to acquire the advanced composites business of Cobham (Other OTC: CBHMF - news ) for $200m in cash financed from existing resources, in a deal that is expected to be immediately earnings-enhancing. \nAway from companies, Chinese inflation grew 1.6% year-on-year in July, up from 1.4% the previous month and ahead of estimates of 1.5%. However, the figure remains well below the government's target of around 3%. \nTo add insult to injury, Chinese exports fell by 8.3% - the biggest drop in four months and more than forecasts for a 1% drop - as demand from the EU and Japan showed declines in excess of 12%. Imports dipped 8.1% in July, in line with market consensus. \nThe data is likely to add pressure on China to roll out more stimulus to support the world's second-largest economy. \nMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets , said \"the latest data out of China at the weekend continued to point to an economy struggling to keep its feet, despite four cuts to bank reserve requirements, in the last six months, as well as benchmark lending rates which currently sit at record lows\". \nMeanwhile, Greece continued to make headlines after an official from the debt-ridden country said t is hoping to conclude negotiations with its creditors by early Tuesday. \n\"Efforts are being made to conclude the negotiations, the horizon is by Monday night or early Tuesday,\" a Greek official said. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,201.85 -0.03% FTSE 100 6,677.81 -0.61% FTSE 250 17,612.88 -0.24% FTSE 100 - Risers Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) (SGE) 525.00p +1.16% Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) (TW.) 201.50p +0.95% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 5,345.00p +0.85% Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) (BDEV) 652.00p +0.77% CRH (CRH (NYSE: CRH - news ) ) 1,954.00p +0.67% Meggitt (MGGT) 507.50p +0.59% Carnival (CCL) 3,504.00p +0.55% London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) 2,578.00p +0.47% Direct Line Insurance Group (DLG) 385.70p +0.42% Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) (HL.) 1,185.00p +0.34% FTSE 100 - Fallers BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,160.50p -2.56% Anglo American (AAL) 780.80p -2.46% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 576.00p -2.29% Randgold Resources Ltd.
