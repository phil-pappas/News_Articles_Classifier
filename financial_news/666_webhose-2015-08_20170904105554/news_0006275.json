She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) is also tipped to be on the list of new Tory peers later this month. \nUltimo and its related company, MJM International, said that Ms Mone, who recently relocated to London, \"has new business interests and has recently taken on new responsibilities with the UK Government\". \"As such, Michelle will spend most of her time on these new projects and commitments, leaving limited time for her engagements with Ultimo\", the company said. \nShe has promised to travel the length of the country for her review into business start-ups in disadvantaged communities . The Government has said that it wants to return Britain to being a \"nation of shopkeepers\". \nMs Mone, who has appeared on TV's The Apprentice and Celebrity Masterchef, was thrust in the spotlight after announcing that she would be leaving Scotland after becoming caught up in an \"extremely vitriolic social media hate campaign\" due to her vocal support of the Union during the independence debate. \nThe 43-year-old Glaswegian, said to be worth £20m, was awarded an OBE for her contribution to business in 2010. \nMJM International suffered losses of £780,000 in 2013 before passing its assets to the parent company Ultimo Brands, which also made a loss, with both businesses publishing the accounts of a “small company”. \n\"Ultimo wishes Michelle every success in her new personal projects and public engagements, and thanks her for contributions in the past and for her future support of Ultimo's growth,\" the company said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:27:56.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
