What does it mean?!” And then, hours later: “The market is recovering! What does it mean?!”\nBut counterintuitively , what working Americans saving for retirement really need is a market crash that lasts. \nA little behind saving for retirement? You need a grizzly bear market \nIf you’ve been diligently saving for retirement, say in your 401(k) or IRA, you’ve been buying into a rising market for the past six and half years.
