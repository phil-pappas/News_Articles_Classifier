Four of those companies have already produced share price gains in excess of 100%, more than doubling the money of investors who bought into them on day one of their Aim listing. Tavistock Investments, +215% Tavistock is a financial services business with two sides to its operations. It provides a range of compliance and oversight services to independent financial advisers, as well as a discretionary fund management service to the clients of these firms. The recipe has proved very successful so far - Tavistock listed on Aim on 13 February at a price of 2p a share. By the end of July, the stock was up to 6.3p, a gain of 215.0%. CPP Group, +174% CPP works with retail and white label clients to provide a range of assistance products in sectors such as financial services, telecoms and travel. It suffered a difficult period following a run-in with regulators over an identity theft insurance product, but is making a strong comeback from these problems – it also moved its listing from the main market of the [entity display=\"London Stock Exchange\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"london-stock-exchange\" natural_id=\"fred/company/2656\"]London Stock Exchange[/entity] to Aim earlier this year. CPP joined Aim just two days after this year’s best performer, Tavistock, with dealings opening at 3p a share. At the end of July, the shares were trading at 8.23p, a gain of 174.3% in less than five months. Motif Bio, +164% Motif Bio specialises in developing new antibiotics to treat infections caused by bacteria that have developed resistance to existing treatments, including those linked to strains such as MRSA. It is working with major pharmaceutical companies to develop a pipeline of such drugs. Motif Bio’s IPO took place on 2 April, with the company’s stock initially changing hands for 20p a share. By the end of July, the price was up to 52.75p, a gain of 163.8%. Stride Gaming, +113% Gambling business Stride offers online gaming to thousands of players in regulated markets, most notably in the UK, and specialises in bingo-related games. Its market-leading proprietary software has impressed investors - Stride is the most recent joiner of this year’s top Aim IPO performers having listed its shares on 19 May at a price of 132p, but by the end of July, the stock was already up to 281p. That’s a gain of 112.0%. Only time will tell if these performances are sustainable – and other new Aim joiners may join these four in the 100% plus club. As of July 31 st , 10 companies that listed on Aim in 2014 were showing gains of more than 100% on their issue price, led by Tiziana Life Sciences, the British biotech company, whose shares had risen by an astonishing 1,583.3%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T17:01:25.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
