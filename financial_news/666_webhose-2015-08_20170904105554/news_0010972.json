The new company Paddy Power Betfair will have a market cap of almost £6bn, based on Wednesday’s closing prices, and revenues of more than £1.1bn. \n“I wanted to get closer to technology, I think technology and product are a key determinant in who wins in digital industries and I’m very glad I made that choice,” Corcoran says of his original decision to leave Paddy Power. \nHe has gone on to become one of the most respected executives in gambling. “It’s very rare to find someone with that complementary skill-set,” says Cenkos analyst Simon French, of Corcoran’s understanding of sports-betting and technology. \nAfter shunning CVC’s bid, Mr Corcoran went on to transform Betfair’s fortunes . \n“CVC just wanted to concentrate on high value customers, whereas Breon insisted that it very much had to be about recreational customers,” says French. “The share price today shows he has been vindicated.” \nIndeed, even before Wednesday’s surge, Betfair stock was trading at almost triple CVC’s final bid. Mr Corcoran’s decision to move the Betfair brand away from its more exclusive image and withdraw from countries where gambling regulation is less clear-cut means the company approaches the merger in fine health, just like Paddy Power, which has developed a vibrant online business. \nThe increasingly heavy tax and regulatory burden has spurred a wave of consolidation in the gambling industry this year. \nHowever, the 33pc jump in first-half operating profits to €80m that Paddy Power posted on Wednesday, and the 19pc rise in first-quarter adjusted profits to £41m that Betfair also reported, show the two companies have not been forced into a deal by higher taxes. \nWith both firms looking strong, if Mr Corcoran can successfully integrate the two, the resulting company will be a formidable force in gambling, particulary online betting. “It’s undoubtedly going to be the market leader,” says Mr French.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:58:15.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
