On Tuesday the central bank injected 150 billion yuan ($23.4 billion) into the money market to ease tight liquidity. \nBut dealers said the failure to launch the new monetary easing measures which the market had been hoping for had knocked confidence. \n\"That shows to investors around the world the Chinese are running out of room in terms of being able to support the market,\" Ankur Patel, chief investment officer at R-Squared Macro Management, told Bloomberg News. \nThe dollar remained weak at 119.15 yen, up from 118.51 yen in New York trade Monday but dramatically weaker than 122.06 yen seen in US trading on Friday. \nThe euro stood at $1.1550 and 138.10 yen in Tokyo compared with $1.1606 and 137.55 yen in New York overnight. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for October delivery was trading at $38.97 after closing at $38.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its first below-$40 close since February 2009. \nBrent North Sea crude for October, the international benchmark, was at $43.43 a barrel after closing at $43.04 a barrel in London, its lowest level since March 2009. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) traded at 1,150.75 compared to $1,154.00 late Monday. \nIn other markets: \n-- Taipei added 3.58 percent, or 265.30 points, to 7,675.64. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co rose 7.39 percent to Tw$123.50 while Hon Hai Precision advanced 4.17 percent to Tw$85.0. \n-- Wellington added 0.11 percent, or 5.98 points, to 5,613.29. \nContact Energy (NZSE: CEN.NZ - news ) rose 2.70 percent to NZ$5.32 and Air New Zealand was down 0.75 percent to NZ$2.65. \n-- Manila rose 0.58 percent, or 39.33 points, to 6,830.34 although trading was suspended for much of the day due to technical problems. \nAyala Land (Other OTC: AYAAF - news ) was down 0.74 percent to 33.50 pesos, Universal Robina was unchanaged at 180 pesos and BDO Unibank (Other OTC: BDOUY - news ) was down 0.95 percent at 94.10 pesos (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T14:34:06.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
