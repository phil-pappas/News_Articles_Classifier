The shares closed at 337.6 pence on Monday before the start of the sale process.\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne took a loss on Monday’s sale as he tries to revive investor appetite in the bank, seven years after it became Britain’s biggest casualty of the financial crisis. RBS, which has since shrunk its investment bank, still trades for less than the price the government paid for its stake. Meanwhile, the U.K. has sold part of its Lloyds Banking Group Plc holding at a profit.\n“The right thing to do for the economy and for taxpayers is to start selling off our stake,” Osborne said in a statement on Tuesday. “This is an important first step in returning the bank to private ownership.”\nThe money raised from the sale will be used to pay down the national debt, the Treasury said in the statement.\nThe stock is below the 407 pence at which the government says it would break even on its 45.5 billion-pound rescue. The Treasury published a report by Rothschild in June that said the government would make money from the sum of its total bank bailout program -- even if it makes a loss on RBS. Rothschild acted as capital markets adviser on Monday’s sale.\nCitigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS Group AG managed the offering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T09:54:04.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
