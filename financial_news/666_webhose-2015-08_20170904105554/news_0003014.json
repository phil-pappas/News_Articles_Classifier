Bernie Sanders is now interlacing his long-time call for greater socioeconomic equality with increasing emphasis on racial equality and global equality . \nRepublican candidates also are taking stabs at addressing income inequality . Carla Fiorina is among those at the vanguard of claiming it has worsened under President Obama's watch , and would nosedive even more if any aspiring candidate on the Democratic slate is elected in 2016. But they tend to shy away from marriage and gender equality . \nFor Lawrence Lessig, a widely admired advocate for campaign finance reform who just threw his hat in the ring, \"citizen equality\" is what matters. He already has proposed the Citizen Equality Act of 2017 , a referendum that, if approved, he claims would garner citizens the equal freedom to vote and equal representation, and most and best of all, would provide for citizen-funded elections. \nOne may differ with Lessig's prescription for campaign finance reform as the main way to make citizen equality a reality, and even that it is the root problem. I for one have argued that the most effective, sensible and doable remedy for reviving our republic is one bequeathed to us by our Constitution's visionary Framers -- namely, to vastly increase the number of members of the House of Representatives . This can come to pass by a mere majority vote in Congress (rather than the onerous constitutional amendment he and many others I respect have called for, much less a constitutionally squishy referendum). This would make it possible for virtually anyone to afford to vie for elective office, making obsolete both campaign finance zaniness and the schizophrenic partisan gerrymandering of districts. \nNonetheless, one may thoroughly agree with Lessig's assessment that \"the core problem in American democracy is a problem of equality\" and that we must have \"meaningful political equality for all American citizens.\" \nYet every single one of the candidates for President is completely silent on the matter of political equality when it comes to one of the largest blocs of citizens -- our nation's nearly 74 million children and youth . \nUntil and unless our youngest citizens are given full and equal political rights, our nation's promise will never be realized. \nIn our founding era, our nation's youth often were front and center in the Revolutionary war effort, just as aroused to risk it all for independence as their adult counterparts. They put themselves in harm's way to enlist and serve in our militias, most often as drummers in the thick of battle, helping convey critical signals to American troops that could prove decisive. Andrew Jackson, for one, enlisted at age 13 in South Carolina's patriot militia, and was eventually taken prisoner (when a British officer ordered him to clean his boots and Jackson refused, he was slashed brutally with a sword). \nYet our youngest, then and now, have never been of \"all men are created equal.\" They are left out of the political decision-making process, much to their detriment. As things stand, the number of homeless school-age children is at an all-time high . Children suffering from abuse and neglect has been epidemic . What's more, nearly a third of children have not had a regular source of health care . \nAnd their access to the kind of \"world class\" education that President Obama asserts all our children and youth deserve remains out of reach for far too many. Our educational system remains separate and unequal, , making it nigh impossible for children and youth to develop and discover their talents and contribute them in ways that optimize self and societal flourishing. \nSurely this lamentable state of affairs would change radically if and when they are given equal political right to become a formidable voting bloc to be reckoned with. \nI hear routinely all the arguments against making children and youth equal political citizens -- the two principle ones are that they're too impressionable, and they're too ill-informed on the salient political issues of our day. \nYet I've discovered time and again in my peregrinations holding Democracy Cafe and Constitution Cafe , and Socrates Cafe exchanges that our youngest are often very much 'in the know' on current events - and past ones, for that matter - and deeply committed to righting wrongs. Not only that, studies show that when the voting age has been lowered in other countries, youth rise to the occasion and become even more politically astute. \nOn the other hand, adults can be incredibly impressionable on political matters -- negative advertising works wonders on adults, sadly. \nAnd most American adults do not know even the most essential historical and political facts needed to be knowledgeable political citizens. The Center for the Study of the American Dream at Xavier University found, in a comprehensive survey, that only 65 percent of native-born Americans could answer correctly six of the 10 questions that aspiring naturalized Americans have to answer if they're to become citizens (on the other hand, immigrants applying to become citizens could answer correctly a whopping 93 percent of the questions posed). \nIt is only fair that we include our youngest as full partners in political life. We need kids voting, serving on school boards, as Cabinet members (in a new federal Department of Youth), as equal participants. \nOne might argue that the Republican candidates at least bend over backwards to stress the equal rights of the unborn -- at least, until they actually enter the world, at which time there is little concern over what if any political rights those born in circumstances of tremendous inequality will enjoy. And while they tragically support the rights of children to have access to guns , they've failed to ask kids if this is a right they want. \nAnd there's the rub: no one seeking political office is willing to give kids the political clout needed to have their deepest desires in the political realm addressed. Let's at least ask kids if they want the right to vote, and let them vote on the matter, up or down. \nI want for my two precious young daughters what I want for every citizen -- for their voices to be heeded and heard, to matter and count. For that to happen, we need to lower the voting age. To her credit, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi has proposed that we lower the voting age to 16. That's a good start. I personally believe we should lower it to the lowest documented age that someone enlisted in the American Revolution. \nOur youngest citizens must have the right to be a political force in their own right. Doing so would make ours a nation in which 'childkind' at long last becomes a central part of \"all men are created equal.\" \nFollow Christopher Phillips on Twitter: www.twitter.com/christophercafe More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T01:02:34.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
