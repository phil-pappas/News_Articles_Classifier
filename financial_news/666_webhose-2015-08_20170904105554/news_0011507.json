It seduces us into believing it’s real, but the fact remains it’s still synthetic,” he added.\nLead author Jung-Hyun Kim, with Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea, said the study shows that face-to-face interaction can buffer the negative effects of heavy mobile phone use.\n“Engaging in more face-to-face interaction can work as an antidote to the development of problematic mobile phone use,” Kim said.\nThe researchers examined two pathways for habitual use of a smartphone: To either pass the time or entertain, or to alleviate feelings of sadness or depression by seeking out others.\nIt’s the second reason, David said, that can cause trouble.\n“This suggests that problematic use of mobile phone is fuelled in part by the purposeful or deliberate use of the mobile phone to relieve or alleviate negative feelings whereas habitual or ritualistic use to pass time is not strongly associated with it,” he said.\nDavid and the researchers said that using a mobile phone in moderation – to stay in touch with family or friends, for example – is not a bad thing but it should not replace real human interaction.\nThe study was published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.\n 26, 2015 1:56 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:52:28.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
