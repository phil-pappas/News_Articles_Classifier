Volume was down 14 percent from $9.5 billion in June. Year to date, cumulative new business volume increased 8 percent compared to 2014.Receivables over 30 days were 1.0 percent, down slightly from 1.1 percent the previous month and unchanged from the same period in 2014. Charge-offs remained at an all-time low of 0.2 percent for the 17th consecutive month.Credit approvals totaled 79.0 percent in July, down slightly from 79.4 percent in June. Total headcount for equipment finance companies was up 5.4 percent year over year.Separately, the Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation’s Monthly Confidence Index (MCI-EFI) for August is 67.4, an increase from the July index of 62.6. ELFA President and CEO William G. Sutton, CAE, said, “The consensus forecast for the second half of 2015 is for the U.S. to show modest, if not robust, economic growth. July MLFI-25 data provide evidence of this narrative, in terms of originations, credit quality and headcount. Despite economic headwinds in parts of Europe and China, as well as constant chatter about a looming interest rate hike by the Fed, U.S. businesses in many sectors are investing steadily in productive assets, in the process relying on financing solutions for these equipment acquisitions. Hopefully, this trend continues for the balance of the year.”Harry Kaplun, President, Specialty Finance, Frost Bank, said, “The MLFI-25 continues to support the strength in the equipment finance industry. Growing employment, minimal losses and high approval rates are all indicative of a favorable business climate.”The MLFI-25 is the only index that reflects capex, or the volume of commercial equipment financed in the U.S. The MLFI-25 is released globally at 8 a.m. Eastern time from Washington, D.C., each month on the day before the U.S. Department of Commerce releases the durable goods report. The MLFI-25 is a financial indicator that complements the durable goods report and other economic indexes, including the Institute for Supply Management Index, which reports economic activity in the manufacturing sector. Together with the MLFI-25 these reports provide a complete view of the status of productive assets in the U.S. economy: equipment produced, acquired and financed.The MLFI-25 is a time series that reflects two years of business activity for the 25 companies currently participating in the survey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T21:44:20.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
