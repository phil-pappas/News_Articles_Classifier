Excluding those significant items, underlying profit fell 26 per cent to an expected $22 million. A $29 million drop in the value of global dairy sales, particularly skim milk powder, had a big impact on Bega's bottom line. While profits were lower, Bega said it had responded well to falling prices and strong competition for milk supply. Revenues for the company's packaged goods and nutritional products rose by a combined $72 million, partly thanks to strong demand for infant formula and children's \"growing up\" dairy-based powders. Dairy prices have been falling steadily as heavyweights Russia and China ramped up production, while New Zealand, the United States and Europe have also increased dairy output. Dairy Australia last week estimated milk powder prices had fallen to between $1,500 and $2,000 a tonne, from $5,000.
