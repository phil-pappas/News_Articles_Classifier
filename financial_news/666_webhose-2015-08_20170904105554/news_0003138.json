(NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the general availability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, the latest version of the stable, proven and predictable Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 platform. As the basis for large, complex IT deployments, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 offers enterprise IT teams new capabilities to bolster system security, proactively identify and resolve business-critical IT issues, and confidently embrace some of the latest open source technologies, such as Linux containers, without sacrificing operational stability.\n\nSystem Security\n\nEmphasizing the platform's commitment to stable and secure enterprise systems, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 helps prevent data leakage by allowing read-only mounting of removable media. In addition, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 now includes the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Workbench, an easy-to-use tool that functions as a SCAP scanner and delivers tailored SCAP content functionality. SCAP Workbench, building upon existing SCAP functionality in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, allows customers to measure the compliance of their Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems against their own company-specific security guidelines and criteria.\n\nRed Hat Access Insights\n\nTo enhance the reliability of IT deployments, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 is compatible with Red Hat Access Insights, a new hosted service from Red Hat designed to help customers proactively identify and resolve issues that could impact business operations. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of Red Hat Certified Engineers and Red Hat's award-winning customer support team, Red Hat Access Insights alerts IT administrators to potential problems, like configuration issues or vulnerabilities, and provides a dashboard to help identify, understand and correct these issues before any disruption occurs.\n\nLinux Innovation\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 incorporates many of the latest, \nstable open source technologies, allowing enterprises to \nconfidently deploy recent innovations across physical, virtual and cloud environments. One example is clufter, a tool for analyzing and transforming cluster configuration formats. Available as a technology preview, clufter enables system administrators to update existing high-availability configurations to run on the latest high-availability tools from Red Hat. LVM Cache is now a fully supported feature, allowing users to maximize the performance benefits of SSD-based storage for their business needs while limiting associated costs. Additionally, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 base image is now available via the Red Hat Customer Portal, enabling Red Hat customers to transform traditional workloads into container-based applications that are suitable for deployment on Red Hat certified container hosts, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host, and OpenShift Enterprise 3 by Red Hat.\nSupporting Quotes\n\nJim Totton, vice president and general manager, Platforms Business Unit, Red Hat\n\n\"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is the stable, predictable backbone for business-critical IT deployments across the globe, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 builds upon this foundation with access to new capabilities and services.
