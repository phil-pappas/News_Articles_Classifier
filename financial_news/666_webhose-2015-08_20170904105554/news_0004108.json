China also devalued its currency, suggesting economic growth there was softer and could cause lower crude demand. \nBenchmark U.S. crude fell $1.88, or 4 percent, to $43.08 a barrel in New York. Its previous low for this year was $43.46 on March 17. \nU.S. crude has been declining since reaching a high this year of $61.43 a barrel on June 10. \nBrent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, declined $1.23, or 2.4 percent, to $49.18 a barrel in London.
