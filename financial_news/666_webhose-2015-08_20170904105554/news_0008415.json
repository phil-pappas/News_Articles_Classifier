Between 2008 and late 2013, Hays reported a better performance in its British temporary staffing business than in permanent jobs, as companies shied away from major spending commitments. \nAccording to figures from UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , job vacancies have been increasing by 20pc on last year’s levels since September, with both temporary and permanent roles on the rise. The British jobs market has been growing faster than France, Germany and Australia. \nOfficial figures showed that 354,000 more people were in work by the end of June compared to a year ago, although the overall number of workers fell slightly from record levels to 31.03m people. \nEven Hays’ City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) office has returned to growth in recent quarters, after several lean years following the financial crisis. Overall fees have surpassed the levels seen before the recession, while profits have yet to recover the lost ground. \nPanmure Gordon analysts said last week that staffing firms in many sectors were enjoying “a Goldilocks moment” as buoyant consumer confidence encourages more workers to switch jobs. \nHays’ results came weeks after rival professional staffing firm Robert Walters (LSE: RWA.L - news ) reported a 74pc increase in half-year profits, driven by a 20pc rise in UK fees. Michael Page beat forecasts earlier this month with a 14pc rise in profits striking an upbeat note after a series of profit warnings in the past three years. \nQuestor: What the jobs market is telling investors (Other OTC: UBGXF - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T20:21:18.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
