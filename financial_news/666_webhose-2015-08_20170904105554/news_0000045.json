James Brickwood by Agnes King Sales at KPMG Australia rose 8 per cent, to $1.21 billion, for the 12 months to June 30, spurred by growth in advisory services which now accounts for 49 per cent of the professional services giant's total income.\nThis is likely to be the last year in which heritage accounting services generate the bulk of KPMG Australia's income.\n\"We need to move on from referring to us as an accounting firm,\" KPMG Australia chairman Peter Nash.\n\"Accounting is a small part of what we do.\"\n\"Those who would pigeon-hole us as an accounting firm [do so] to avoid competition, not recognising the broader threat we pose to the professional services industry because of the scope available to us,\" Mr Nash said.\nChief executive Gary Wingrove said the firm's profit improved through a combination of cost control and revenue growth finding its way to the bottomline.\nAlthough KPMG's growth is slightly lower than its peers, Mr Wingrove said it represents a \"sustainable trajectory\" and a \"significant increase on where we were a year ago\".\nErnst&Young yesterday reported a 14 per cent rise in income to $1.29 billion . PwC's full-year revenue has risen 10 per cent to $1.7 billion , while Deloitte's annual billings rose 15 per cent to $1.3 billion for the year to May 31 .\n \"We have very good momentum,\" Mr Wingrove said.\nThe firm's growth rate doubled from five percent in the first half-year to 10 per cent in the final six months.\n\"Linking our trajectory with our investments in new innovation and alliances, we're well positioned moving into next year [2016FY],\" Mr Wingrove said.\nTechnology-led projects provided the trigger for much of the 14 per cent uplift in KPMG's management consulting division.\nInfrastructure deals, inbound foreign investment, demergers, and an active initial public listing sector was behind a 13 per cent surge in sales in KPMG's transactions team.\nThe firm also snatched a number of big audits from their rivals, giving the audit practice a rare seven per cent boost in fees, to $411 million.\nSales in the tax practice inched up two per cent to $206 million. The firm will invest heavily in this area to boost performance, according to Mr Wingrove.\nKPMG is targeting \"high single digit\" growth for the 2015-16 fiscal year.\nMr Nash said captains of industry can be more bullish about growth prospects than the dour rhetoric in the marketplace would have them believe.\n\"There is room for corporate Australia to be a little more expansive and take more risks going forward,\" Mr Nash said.\nMr Wingrove flagged further acquisitions in the year ahead.\nAt the global level, KPMG will launch a second venture capital fund, of between $200 millon to $300 million, later this year, focused on new disruptive technologies to support the delivery of digital services to clients.\nThe first fund, seeded at $85 million and launched in 2013, has been mostly deployed. KPMG acquired six entities through the fund and invested in two home-grown ventures, one of which originates from Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:53:42.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
