The 50-stock index opened marginally higher but made a quick move into the negative. It stayed in the red for almost the entire session. The Nifty broke the 8,500 support but recovered and closed marginally in the red. The S&P BSE Sensex, which opened at 28,225.04 points, closed at 28,071.93 points -- down 115.13 points or 0.41% from the previous day's close at 28,187.06 points. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its third monetary policy review, kept the repurchase rate, or its short-term lending rate, unchanged at 7.25%. Accordingly, the reverse repo rate, or the short-term borrowing rate, was unchanged at 6.25%. The cash reserve ratio (CRR), or the liquid money banks have to compulsorily hold, stood unchanged at 4%. The decision to maintain the status-quo disappointed investors, as a general consensus had appeared that showed that the current review might be the last chance that RBI had to cut rates in this calendar year. Markets are doubtful over the RBI's ability for a future easing of the monetary policy in the hindsight that inflation might spiral up again and the US Fed's decision on its own rates is coming up in September. Sector-wise, healthy buying was observed in metal, automobile and banking stocks. However, consumer durables, oil and gas, information technology (IT), capital goods and technology, entertainment and media (TECK) sectors came under selling pressure. The S&P BSE metal index zoomed by 230.82 points, the automobile index rose 193.07 points and the banking index went up 103.12 points. The S&P BSE consumer durables index declined by 86.33 points, followed by the oil and gas index which receded by 68.23 points, IT index decreased by 65.22 points, capital goods index fell by 64.39 points and the TECK index was lower by 40.25 points.
