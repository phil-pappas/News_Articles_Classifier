They will still make money from the high interest rates but the increased provisions for non-performing loans will have an impact on their performance,\" said Mr Munywoki. \nEquity Bank Group's net earnings grew 12 per cent to Ksh8.56 billion ($83.38 million) from Ksh7.66 billion ($74.61 million), due to better performance of its regional subsidiaries and revenue diversification programmes. \nThe group's net interest income increased 11 per cent to Ksh15.5 billion ($150.98 million) from Ksh14.01 billion ($136.46 million) , while the non-funded income grew 30 per cent to Ksh10.8 billion ($105.2 million) up from Ksh8.3 billion ($80.84 million). \nCfC Stanbic Bank suffered a 42 per cent drop in profits from Ksh3.3 billion ($32.14 million) to Ksh1.96 billion ($19.09 million) due to political instability and lack of cash in the banking system caused by the Central Bank's move to mop up excess liquidity to halt the slide in the shilling. \nIts share price was trading at Ksh95.50 ($0.93) at the close of trading Thursday last week. \nAccording to Johnson Nderi, manager in-charge of corporate finance and advisory at ABC Capital, the higher rate of interest has increased the net interest margin for banks and boosted their profitability, a factor that may also have a positive impact on listed banking stocks. \nDiamond Trust Bank Group, whose stock was trading at Ksh201 ($1.96) per share, reported 11 per cent growth in profit after tax to Ksh3.25 billion ($31.65 million), from Ksh2.94 billion ($28.63 million) in the same period last year. \nThe group earned Ksh11.71 billion ($114.06 million) in interest income, up from Ksh9.85 billion ($95.94 million), representing a 19 per cent growth. \nNon-interest income from fees and commissions grew 28 per cent to Ksh2.36 billion ($22.98 million) from Ksh1.84 billion ($17.92 million). \nBarclays Bank posted 8 per cent growth in its net earnings to Ksh4.55 billion ($44.32 million) from Ksh4.23 billion ($41.2 million) in the same period last year. \nIts interest income grew four per cent to Ksh10 billion ($97.4 million) from Ksh9.7 billion($94.48 million) while non-interest income increased by 12 per cent to Ksh4.78 billion( $46.56 million) from Ksh4.26 billion ($41.49 million) partly driven by the introduction of charges on ATMs. \nIts share price on the NSE dropped 0.34 per cent to Ksh 14.80 ($0.14) on the announcement of the results on Thursday last week. \nUnaudited financial statements show that a bulk of the bank's profit (90 per cent) was generated from the Kenyan operations while South Sudan, Tanzania and Rwanda contributed 6.9 per cent, 1.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. Uganda accounted for 0.4 per cent while Burundi made no money.
