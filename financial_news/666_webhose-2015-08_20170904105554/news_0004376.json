Net sales, on an organic basis, were flat at £10.8bn for the 12 months to the end of June, and overall organic volumes were down 1pc. \nBut Mr Menezes attempted to draw a line under Diageo’s lacklustre 2015 by pledging to return the FTSE 100 company to sales growth, starting this financial year. From 2017, the Diageo boss told investors to expect “mid single-digit organic top-line growth” for three years. But industry experts are divided as to whether it truly marks the start of a turnaround. Some of the problems Mr Menezes is tackling are not of his own making. \nIn May 2013, Diageo announced that the India-born American would succeed Paul Walsh as chief executive. The storm clouds were already brewing: only the month before, Diageo had posted quarterly numbers that showed growth had decelerated across all of its emerging markets. \nThe push into the developing world had been orchestrated by Mr Walsh, who led Diageo for 13 years and transformed it into a drinks-focused business. \nMr Walsh took the helm in September 2000, three years after Diageo was created from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. He swiftly shed Diageo’s food businesses such as Pillsbury and Burger King (EUREX: 18860462.EX - news ) and bulked up the drinks operation through acquisitions. Diageo joined forces with Pernod Ricard (Paris: FR0000120693 - news ) to buy Seagram’s spirits and wines portfolio and purchased Bushmills Irish whisky and a 50pc stake in Ketel One vodka. \nMore recent acquisitions, however, saw the business plunge aggressively into the emerging markets. Diageo snapped up Turkish raki maker Mey Içki, bought Ypióca, a maker of Brazil’s national drink cachaça, lifted its stake in India’s United Spirits (BSE: UNITDSPR4.BO - news ) , and pushed into China’s baijiu market. \nDiageo under Mr Walsh was by no means alone among Western consumer goods companies in pushing into the developing world. But by the time Mr Menezes took over, growth in these markets was stalling. Diageo’s business in China, for example, was hit by a government clampdown on gift-giving. \n“We went through a rocky phase in the emerging markets but we’ve always said the emerging markets are not a straight line,” says Mr Menezes. “We’re staying the course, we’ve not pulled out and I think the consistency of what we’re doing will turn out to be hugely value-creating for the company.” \nWhile Mr Walsh’s push into the emerging markets has subsequently caused headaches for his successor, Mr Menezes must share more responsibility for the other area that has sparked investor concern. The US, which is Diageo’s biggest and most profitable market, has also suffered a slowdown over the last two years. It is a division where Mr Menezes spent much of his Diageo (Amsterdam: DO8.AS - news ) career. \nAfter joining Guinness in 1997, Mr Menezes became president of Diageo’s North American region in 2004, a role he held for eight years until he was appointed global chief operating officer and effectively Mr Walsh’s heir-apparent in 2012. Since he has become CEO, however, Diageo’s Smirnoff and Captain Morgan brands have lost ground in the US, particularly to increasingly popular craft spirits. \n“The consumer is shunning the big brands and going for something different,” says Exane BNP Paribas analyst Eamonn Ferry. \nLast week’s results showed volumes in North America fell 3pc, but Mr Menezes believes the tide in the US is now starting to turn. \n“We’ll get it back I have no doubt about that,” he says. But many in the City are unconvinced. Mr Ferry reckons the challenge posed by craft spirits in what is a key market for Diageo remains a “deep-rooted” issue. \nBernstein analyst Trevor Stirling is also downbeat and says: “This time last year, we thought 2014 was the nadir, and we were clearly badly wrong.” \nHe notes that Diageo recently appointed Deirdre Mahlan, its finance chief, to take control of the North American business. Once she is in place in her new role “there could be a need for more adjustment or disruption from management changes lower down the organisation”. \nMr Menezes, however, is convinced the worst is now behind the spirits giant. “I’m confident we’re on the right track and we’ve come out of the challenging external environment a stronger company,” he says. \nMr Menezes would no doubt celebrate a successful return to growth with a dram of Black Label. But shareholders may not give him the chance to see his plans through.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T21:43:02.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
