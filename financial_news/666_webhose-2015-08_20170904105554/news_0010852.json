Supplied by Peter Fish Spectacular war shields and weathered wooden figures from Papua New Guinea might have stood out in the glamour stakes but it was tiny clam shell charms that scored among the most outstanding prices at a tribal art sale last week.\nSales of Pacific and Oceanic art are often relatively subdued events with many items passed in, but here the clearance approached 98 per cent and prices were in some cases five or even 10 times the lower estimates, galvanised by strong foreign interest.\nThe sale, held by the Theodore Bruce auction house in Sydney's Alexandria on August 17, comprised part of the collection of former Sydney oceanic art dealer and collector Todd Barlin, who is ailing.\nAnother tranche of his collection will go on the market later in the year.\nA fine Queensland rainforest shield and sword club, dating from the early 20th Century, sold at the Todd Barlin sale for $11, 400, almost ten times its estimate. Among the surprises were 100-year-old clam shell charms from the Solomon Islands. A lot comprising eight clam shell plaques from the western Solomons said to date from the 18th and early 19th century brought $4200 hammer price, or $5040 against an estimate of $600 to $800. All sale prices include a buyers premium but estimates do not. These curious pierced and saw-toothed objects, around 9cm to 10cm high and mounted on stands, are said to have been carried on war canoes during head-hunting expeditions. They had a provenance to a sailor on HMS Mohawk in 1898 during a punitive mission to the area.\nA single larger clam shell plaque, some 20cm high and with human figures and ancient patina, brought $4560, while another lot comprising six similar toothed plaques sold for $2640. All came from the Hornshaw collection. Another lot comprising 14 disc-like early shell pendants incised with geometric motifs brought $6000, 10 times the estimate.\nThe auctioneer's tribal art consultant, Jim Elmslie, says the sale achieved close to 98 per cent clearance, with around 70 to 80 per cent headed overseas. Buyers from the US, France, Italy and New Caledonia mostly outgunned local collectors, he says, taking advantage of the weak Australian dollar.\nAdditional attractions were that pre-sale estimates were low and there were no set minimum prices.\n Strong bidding for the Papua New Guinea material included an early 20th century Fly River hair comb, which sold for $7200. An early New Ireland Tatanua mask which failed to sell on an $8000 to $12,000 estimate appeared to be the only major casualty.\nAmong the best prices was a lot comprising a Queensland rainforest shield and a sword club which brought $11,400, almost 10 times the estimate.\nBest price among a host of PNG shields was $5040 for a war shield from the Mount Hagen area collected by an Australian patrol officer in the 1940s, while a buyer paid $5760 for a 19th century parrying club from the eastern Solomons, which had once been owned by the \"snake man\" of Sydney's La Perouse, George Cann.\nAmong several lots sold for $4800 apiece were an imposing 42cm long Solomon Islands ritual baton with shell inlay from the Hornshaw collection, a 19th century Solomons shell money belt and four 19th century carved charms from Marapai, PNG, in original woven bags.\nAlso impressive was the $3120 paid for a lot comprising three Fijian tabua or sperm whale-tooth neck ornaments with rich patination, a gift from the Tongan royal family in 1883.\nA group of Philippine artifacts sold well, with an Ifugao wood figure from northern Luzon fetching $5040 and another at $4080.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:08:02.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
