Photo: Jessica Hromas\nASX Ltd chief Elmer Funke​ Kupper​ says the company will give up more than $30 million in revenue in 2016 due to existing and planned fee reductions if the government allows the exchange to keep its share-clearing monopoly for another five years.\nHe is expecting the government to release its decision in September on whether to allow competition in ASX's \"post-trade\" equities business. He said this will mark the end of the big regulatory ructions since the global financial crisis. Clearing accounts for 7 per cent of the ASX's revenue, or about $45 million a year.\nIf the government maintains the monopoly, the ASX has agreed to overhaul its clearing and settlement infrastructure, including replacing its decades-old CHESS clearing and settlement system and cut clearing fees based on volumes cleared. He claimed this would reduce costs for clients far more than any fee reductions due to competition.\nManaging director Elmer Funke Kupper: The ASX reported growth across most divisions, except for its biggest earner - derivatives and OTC markets. Photo: Paul Jeffers\nAt its annual results on Thursday, the exchange disclosed that it expected fee cuts on equities clearing, which will only be granted if it keeps its monopoly, to cost it $7.3 million in 2016. This will be added to fee reductions on some derivatives products introduced in July 2014 that it expects to cost it $24 million in 2016.\nAdvertisement In 2015, fee reductions on derivative futures contracts led to a $17.8 million loss of revenue, but this was offset by a gain of $6.7 million by ceasing some rebates to clients.\n\"We're absolutely convinced that the existing market structure is the right structure for the size of the Australian market,\" he said.\n\"[But] if the answer is different and there is competition in clearing, then we are going to have work out how to do that because we don't know any [single] market on the planet that has done that.\"\nThe company, however, already appears to be in the throes of preparing for the decision to go in its favour. It is about to appoint a separate head of the clearing and settlement business and is introducing more independent directors to the separate board that its risk management functions, including clearing, already have.\nThis seems to go some way to satisfying rival Chi-X Australia's call for formal internal separation of ASX Clear and a fully independent board if it is not opened to competition.\nThe corporate regulator on Thursday launched a consultation on changing regulations to allow Chi-X to trade warrants and exchange traded funds. Chi-X has also said it wants to offer listings in future. Mr Funke Kupper said he expected more competition. \"We never underestimate our competitors. We always assume they are going to do more and be more aggressive.\"\nThe exchange reported a 5.2 per cent rise in underlying profit for 2015 to $403.2 million, just ahead of analyst forecasts.\nThere was growth across all divisions, except for its biggest earner, derivatives and OTC markets, which declined by $700,000. It reported a 40 per cent jump in the number of company floats to 120, raising $88.9 billion for the year, as well as a rise in equity raisings, particularly by the major banks in recent months.\nInvestors and analysts said the result was a rare one this reporting season because it was in line with expectations. Commonwealth Bank analyst Ross Curran said the one unknown still hanging over the company is the decision on clearing. Even though it is a small part of the ASX's revenue, it would be a surprise if it didn't go its way.\n\"The ASX trades at a premium to the rest of the market because it has that monopoly. It is a well-managed monopoly, but if they start losing those monopoly revenue streams, investors will question if there's more to come.\"\nGeorge Boubouras, chief investment officer at Contango Asset Management, said it is \"overweight\" in ASX and it didn't disappoint, with a \"good, clean, expected result, unlike so many other securities\".\n\"Investment capex is in line, cost growth is broadly in line, so there [are] not too many surprises there, and it has high payout ratios,\" he said. \"Year to date it is up nearly 18 per cent including the dividend in a very flat market.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:27:57.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
