The British pound shot to a seven-week high of $1.5717 against the dollar.\nU.S. housing starts rose last month as builders accelerated construction of single-family homes, the Commerce Department said. Groundbreakings, at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.21 million units, were the strongest since October 2007. .\nThe starts report beat forecasts and added to solid payrolls, retail sales and industrial output data, which suggest the economy got off to a robust start in the third quarter and can handle Fed tightening moves.\nThe dollar index, which had been down on the day, pivoted to a gain after the housing starts report and was last up 0.20 percent in early New York trading.\nThe euro was last off 0.45 percent at $1.1033 against the dollar, which was up 0.02 percent against the yen at 124.40 yen.\nThe British pound was boosted by stronger-than-expected inflation data for July, including an uptick in core inflation, which hit a five-month high.\nSterling rose to a seven-week high of $1.5717 after the data and was last at $1.5676, or a 0.6 percent gain for the day.\nThe inflation numbers bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates in coming months and helped sterling gain more than 1 percent against the euro.\nEarlier, China's main Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen 300 indices both lost more than 6 percent as investors bet that demand in China will cool further, weighing on the trade-reliant economy and throwing more doubts on a global recovery.\n\"There is a risk-off environment, given the drop in the Chinese stock markets. Investors are cautious about whether the Fed will raise rates, given a slowdown in China and global deflationary conditions,\" said Petr Krpata, FX strategist at ING.
