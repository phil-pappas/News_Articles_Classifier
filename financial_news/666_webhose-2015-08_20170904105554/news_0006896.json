Air fares also rose sharply. \nThe Bank of England has said it will monitor this measure of inflation closely in the coming months for signs of stronger domestic price growth. The pound rose by three quarters of a cent against the dollar, to $1.5651. \nAlan Clarke, an economist at ScotiaBank, said: “The Bank is focusing more heavily on domestically generated inflation and core inflation - and there are two clear signs of upward pressure here - clothing and air fares. We need another moth or two to confirm that this was not a one off, but so far so good.\" \n= Rail fare rise = \nTuesday's data also confirmed that regulated rail fares would rise by 1pc in January. \nThe retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which is no longer classified as an official statistic, but is still used to calculate rail fare increases and some pay deals, rose by 1pc in July, unchanged from June. \n= Higher inflation on the way? = \nInflation has been pushed down by a dramatic decline in oil prices. Falling food and fuel costs knocked 0.7 percentage points off the headline rate in July, according to the ONS. \nA sharp rise in sterling against a basket of other currencies in recent months is also expected to bear down on inflation for some time. \nThe Bank of England expects inflation to remain around zero in the coming months, and to rise to around 1pc by next February. \nAnalysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said there was a strong change that the rise in core inflation in July would be reversed in August. \n\"We see risks that this may reverse in August, as clothing prices rebounded sharply in that month in 2014 and are unlikely to have rebounded as strongly this year,\" the ysaid in a note. \"Likewise, air fares feature in the UK core aggregate and are volatile. Within core inflation, we see recreation and culture as worth watching as a bellwether of UK consumer confidence. We do not think that the July inflation data will significantly shift the [Bank of England's] narrative in the near term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T13:54:07.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
