Read the other half, Does Your College-Bound Kid Have These 11 Basics?\nIt’s natural to want to ply your college-bound child with gifts, but one thing to consider is that everything he or she brings to college “must fit in a space slightly larger than a Mini Cooper,” says Harry H. Harrison, Jr. , a New York Times best-selling author of parenting books and books about preparing teens for adulthood, including “1001 Things Every College Student Needs to Know.” For that reason alone, it’s best to choose items that are beautiful, practical or a combination of the two .\nHere are some gifts that say, “I love you” when you can’t be there in person :\n1.

Play any digital song from anywhere and beam it out via wireless speakers. $699\n6. Food containers: There comes a time in many a college kid’s life when the food situation comes down to macaroni and lentils. Food storage jars with chalk-written labels help them properly store and identify their dry food and grains.
