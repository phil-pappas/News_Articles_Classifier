Britain’s strong heritage in racing these small boats makes it an important player on the global dinghy market, and UK production is dominated by three main players, Laser Performance , Topper International and RS Sailing , which build in the thousands. \nHowever, British Marine’s data revealed a “squeezed middle” in the industry with strong growth in the smallest and largest sectors, while just 100 sailboats measuring 25ft or longer more were built last year. Production of motorboats between 25ft and 79ft fell by more than 7pc on the previous year to a total of 820 in 2014.
