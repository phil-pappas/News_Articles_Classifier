New schemes are arriving all the time: Next month, for example, Exeter in southwest England gets its own community cash.\nLike most alternative money schemes, the Brixton Pound, or B£, centers on a small community shopping at local businesses. That means it’s intrinsically a reduction of choice. So why do people use it?\n“They are using it because they want to feel connected to the local area,” argues Tom Shakhli, manager of the Brixton Pound nonprofit. “Every time you use it, you’re like a financial activist. You’re taking part in this act which is subverting the norm, which is to hand over your £10 note very passively.”\n“We’re not making your life easier,” he admits. “[It] can’t match the national currency for convenience or utility.”\nFor some, the growing popularity of such currencies taps into a more general movement to find an alternative to established systems — the same impulse behind “Occupy Wall Street”.\nAt the same time, the popularity of hyperlocal currencies, like the rise of bitcoin and the growth of cashless payments, are seen as a sign of how “money” has changed. And it’s not necessarily a niche interest: The debt crisis in Greece prompted locals to begin using alternative currencies as capital controls were brought in, showing how raw necessity can drive the shift.\nBrixton Pound bills In fact, the purpose of the Brixton Pound is to “present a question” and provoke, says Shakhli.\n“It’s to ask: ‘What is money? Does it have to be either printed by the state or created by the banks? Why can’t money be localized? Why can’t money feature a pop star or a black historian? Does it have to feature establishment figures?’”\nThe eye-catching design means to show these are not your stuffy old banknotes. All of the Brixton Pound bills are uncommonly vibrant, from the Ziggy Stardust-era B£10 “Bowie” to the B£5 featuring the Chicago Bulls’s Luol Deng. It’s maybe no coincidence, too, that the newest bill has a Quote: from Karl Marx’s book Capital on the reverse, to go with the psychedelic front designed by Turner Prize-winner Jeremy Deller.\n“The Brixton Pound has a playful edge to it. It makes people smile. That’s part of its purpose,” said Shakhli.\nIt might be fun — but just how easy to use are these currencies? Can people actually buy something they need with them, and do local businesses see any point in accepting them? MarketWatch decided to visit Brixton’s stores with a fistful of B£s to find out.\nAlternative cash in the real world The first stop for any potential user isn’t the streets but the Internet. There are 200 local businesses participating in the Brixton Pound program, but it doesn’t make sense to just head out in hope of coming across one. The scheme’s website lists the places where its money can be bought with pounds sterling, at a rate for £1 for B£1.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://brixtonpound.org/deller", "https://brixtonpound.org/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/alternative-currencies-flourish-in-greece-as-euros-are-harder-to-come-by-1439458241"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T18:19:26.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
