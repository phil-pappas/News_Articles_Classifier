She recently went to Australia for a long, lazy holiday and discovered some cool food joints for vegetarians in the Kangaroo land.\nBeing a pure vegetarian, how did you manage in Australia?\nThere were hardly any 'pure' vegetarian restaurants there. Being a vegetarian, I had to walk for miles to get 'my' type of food. But being a big time foodie, I really didn't mind it. Honestly there were times when I was surviving only on fruit salad and corn flakes.\nOne food joint in Australia you would like to recommend to vegetarians.\nAustralia has several restaurants that serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. If you are looking for pure-veg Indian cuisine, ISKON's Govinda's is the best option. They have some really interesting options. My personal favorite is \"Opera kitchen\" at Sydney Opera house.\nTips for those who are visiting Australia for the first time.\nIf you are vacationing in winters, you must pack all the warmers that you have in your closet. It is a windy place and it freezes like crazy. Carry pills for common ailments as you won't get your Indian medicines there. Don't forget to pack some homemade food which will help you survive in case you are not in a mood or state to walk that extra mile to grab a bite at your favorite vegetarian restaurant. Do remember to visit the night markets, they are really nice.\nFor more stories, follow us on Twitter and Facebook http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Vegetarian Food in Australia,Vegetarian food,Food,Australia ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/toilifestyle", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOILifestyle"], "published": "2015-08-11T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:33:37.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
