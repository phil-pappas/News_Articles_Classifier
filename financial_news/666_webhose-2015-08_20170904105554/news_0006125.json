Losses which were recorded by the remaining institutions were mainly attributed to increased levels of provisions. These provisions have been narrowing over the period under review,\" said Mangudya. \nThe apex bank chief said in order to enhance earnings performance, a number of banking institutions continued to rationalise operating costs, while simultaneously implementing revenue enhancing measures which include growth of non-funded income through introduction of new technology driven products. \nTotal banking sector deposits have continued on an upward trajectory, increasing by 14,2% from US$4,9 billion as at June 30 2014 to US$5,6 billion as at June 30 2015. \nLoans and advances amounted to US$4 billion, translating into a loans to deposit ratio of 71,4 % as at June 30 2015. \nMangudya said the banking sector's aggregate ratio of non-performing loans to total loans improved from a peak of 20,45% in June 2014 to 13,15% as at June 30 2015, excluding Tetrad which is under provisional judicial management. \nRBZ introduced Zimbabwe Asset Management Corporation which has so far acquired US$157 million of non-performing loans and is currently at an advanced stage in concluding the restructuring transactions of four distressed companies through acquisition of their bank debts amounting to US$58 million. \nThe central bank said Zamco would also play an instrumental role in resuscitating distressed companies through implementation of appropriate debt relief and debt restructuring measures. \n\"The ultimate objective is to prevent the unnecessary closure of companies and accompanying job losses. The goal of Government and the Reserve Bank, is therefore, to prevent companies from winding their operations and needless increases in unemployment,\" he said. \n\"Zamco is, therefore, effectively complementing Distressed Industries and Marginalised Areas Fund(Dimaf) under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to resuscitate distressed companies.\" Zimbabwe \nTHE proposal by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare that the National … see more » Copyright © 2015 Zimbabwe Independent.
