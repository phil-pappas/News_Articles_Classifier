It's going to start mattering.\"\n\"Explain whether you're going to raise rates slowly, which is what [Fed Chair Janet Yellen ] has been saying for a few months,\" urged Fisher, who had held key positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for more than decade, ending in 2001.\n\"A year ago,\" Fisher recalled, \"[Yellen] was saying once they start raising rates they'd raise quickly,\" he warned. \"Now other members of the committee are starting to introduce that. They need to get on one page on the path.\"\nInflation hasn't risen enough to meet the Fed's targets and that's another challenge, Fisher said. \"The policy they've been pursuing is to pump up asset prices in the hope it generates consumer price inflation,\" he said, \"and it hasn't worked for five years.\"\nMorning Squawk:\nCNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Submit Please enter a valid email address To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy .", "external_links": ["http://nbcuni.com/privacy/"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T23:33:23.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
