Deprived of the heart of its industrial sector in the eastern part of the country, lost to separatists, the Ukrainian economy is expected to plunge deeper into recession this year -- a 9.5 percent contraction the government estimates. \nAs gross domestic product shrinks, the country's debt appears on course to reach nearly 135 percent of GDP this year, compared with about 70 percent in 2014. \nUnder its policy, the IMF can only provide financing if a country's debt is \"sustainable with high probability.\" \n- Difficult debt talks - \nTo resolve this headache and satisfy the United States, its largest shareholder, the IMF said that Ukraine needed to find $15.3 billion in debt relief with private creditors over the coming four years. \nBut the difficult debt negotiations, under way for the past several weeks, have so far produced no concrete results and increase the risk of a Ukrainian default that could further drive away investors. \nThe creditors, led by US investment firm Franklin Templeton, have proposed a debt reduction of 10 percent, according to a source familiar with the discussions, far below the 40 percent \"haircut\" sought by Kiev. \nLipton reiterated that the Fund was prepared to continue its program even if debt negotiations with private creditors founder. \n\"In the event that talks with private creditors stall, and Ukraine determines that it cannot service this debt, the Fund could continue to lend to Ukraine consistent with its Lending-into-Arrears Policy,\" he said. \nUS Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the US \"strongly supported\" the IMF's latest disbursement to Ukraine. \n\"We urge the creditors participating in the ongoing debt operation to reach a timely agreement with the Ukrainian authorities that fully satisfies the criteria outlined in Ukraine's IMF program -- including the debt sustainability target,\" Lew said. \nThe IMF points to Kiev's \"commitment\" in implementing reforms, in contrast with the lack of cooperation from the Greek authorities, for the apparent difference in its approach to the two heavily indebted countries. \nSince the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych in early 2014, the IMF can rely on a pro-West government which has been more willing to tackle tough programs, including an increase in gas prices. \nThe IMF notably has been able to count on the Ukrainian finance minister, Natalie Jaresko, an American who worked at the US State Department and became a Ukrainian citizen just before taking her post. \n\"Ukraine has been an incredibly encouraging situation,\" Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, said this week. \n\"We have seen political determination to change the face of Ukraine.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T02:13:50.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
