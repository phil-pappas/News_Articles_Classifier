I had attended primary and junior secondary school there before I went to Bekoji for my high school. After that I joined Addis Ababa University and studied biology. After graduation, I was employed by the university as a graduate assistant. After serving for a year, I started my post graduate studies in applied genetics here in Addis Ababa University. I went to Germany, Munich, for my thesis research as I was by then in-country scholarship holder. I had a postgraduate degree in 1999 and again served one year. Then I went to Sweden for my Ph.D. in 2001. In 2006, I defended my thesis and came back to Ethiopia. Since then I have been teaching and supervising masters and Ph.D. students. I have supervised more than 45 masters students and currently I am supervising about eight Ph.D. students. I am also involved in several projects in my area of research. \nHerald: The issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is now high on the international fora. Some people say it is important to ensure food security. Others critically see it as a danger to the genetic base of countries and it is against the effort to protect biodiversity. How do you think can we reconcile these issues? \nDr. Tileye: To answer this question, let me start from biotechnology. Biotechnology is a very broad concept that we usually classify into modern and old. When we say old biotechnology we are referring, for instance, to baking injera via fermentation. We prepare cheese and wine through biodiversity. This is a technology applied by people for many decades and what we refer to as old biotechnology. \nWhen we see modern biotechnology, it is closely tied with the breakthrough in molecular biology. This breakthrough happened since the 1970s and 1980s. This gave rise to the invention of recombinant DNA technology. This in turn paved the way for the production of genetically engineered organisms. The bacteria, plants, and animals themselves can be genetically engineered and conventionally we call them GMOs. But when we look at them strictly in the eyes of the science they are called genetically engineered organisms. In one way or the other, everything we eat today is genetically modified because the farmers themselves are adapted to select, domesticate and produce a given variety and this by itself is genetic modification. \nWhen we look at genetic engineering, on the one hand, there is the need to be food secure and the fear of its adverse effects on health and the environment on the other. I think people should understand the GMOs in the right way. When we genetically modify a given crop or plant, it has its own strict procedure that we should abide by in the laboratories. There are also strict procedures that should be followed during releasing the GMOs to the field. Hence, bio-safety is the integral part of biotechnology. For this reason, I personally say that there should not be any fear in using them. What matters is well regulation of the procedures at any stage of applying it. One of the fears is related to its effect to health. There is what we may call the bio-safety issues related to health and the environment. There is a task that we call risk assessment. Then we have risk analysis. In addition, we also have risk communication and management. All these tasks should be taken into consideration when we work on the GMOs. Even the kind of gene that we are going to use in the laboratory matters. Components of the food that we produce from the GMOs should also be taken into account. It should not be substantially different from the conventional one. \nIn relation to the environment, there are also procedures and systems that should be followed. Everything should be carefully analysed before it is released into the environment. It is after finishing all the prior works that we have to go the field. On the field, it should be first utilized with in a given confined environment. This also has its own procedures. After checking that it does not have significant risks, it is possible to produce the GMOs. \nHerald: When we read many texts written in relation to this issue, many people are in doubt that the bio-safety procedures that you have stated are not followed by the big companies that are producing and channelling the GMOs in the market at present. Some effects are already detected mainly Latin American countries. Do you think that we can rely on the GMOs of these companies? \nDr. Tileye: Actually, these companies are working for profit. But when they release those GMOs, of course, they have to follow the bio-safety regulation of the country they are situated in. If they do it accordingly, I do not think there will be a problem. Actually, who is responsible if a problem happens? Is it the people who use or the company that produces it? We must check every product before using in our fields. They have to analyse everything in the laboratories. Its food content should be checked whether it is substantially changed or not. We also should know the purpose for which we are using the gene. For instance, when Ethiopia wants to import from Monsanto, the responsible body have to check against all risks before using it. If it has any health effect, it should not be imported and even should not be released from the laboratories. For example, you check the product whether it has allergy or not. If it does have, you are not going to release it from the laboratory. The bio-safety regulatory body needs to have all those documents that indicate it is safe from any health and environmental effects. However, I am not a fan of those seed companies. \nEach country must develop the technology to safely utilize it by following the right procedures for safety. Kenya, Uganda, Sudan and Egypt are working on it. The bacterial wilt disease, which is affecting inset in Ethiopia is devastating the banana in Uganda and they are producing resistant banana GMOs by themselves instead of importing. Ethiopia has now put in place the bio-safety proclamation, which is very restrictive to develop this technology in the country. Concerning the health effects, I have not heard any negative report of the GMO crops so far. \nHerald: Some scholars are arguing that the GMOs have an adverse effect on the global climate and biodiversity. How do you see this argument? \nDr. Tileye: I do not think that is really the way it happens. For me it even contributes to biodiversity instead of eroding it. The fear is that farmers may prefer the GMOs and stop producing the other varieties. But it is the same in the case of conventional breeding. Farmers prefer high yielding varieties in conventional breeding. That is why the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute is collecting different seed varieties from all over the country in the Gene Bank. So, either in the conventional breeding or the GMOs, when they get high yield, farmers usually go for those varieties. To be food secure, we need high yielding varieties. On the other hand, as long as the GMOs can provide higher yield, they can contribute to the biodiversity. When the land is not productive, the farmers always tend to remove the forest and prepare new farmlands. When we remove the forests, we lose a lot of species in the biodiversity. Some of the species may even become extinct. When you provide farmers with high yielding varieties, they can produce more on a small plot of land and refrain from clearing the forest. This in turn contributes to conservation of biodiversity. \nHerald: In relation to your private life, tell us the most challenging moment and also how you managed to overcome it. \nDr. Tileye: After I grew up, there was no considerable problem in my life. But when I was a child, I faced a tremendous problem. My mother died when I was two years old. Imagine how difficult it is to cope up with the demands of life as a two-year old child. It was difficult for my father to take care of me and he had to marry another wife. Meanwhile, my aunt took me with her and I grew up some years with her. But I was extremely homesick that I always wanted to be with my brothers. As a result, I went back to my father and that was a very challenging time. When I reached grade four, the idea to quit school came to my mind as a result of the challenging situations I existed in. Fortunately, my elder brother was attending high school by then. I always remember what he told me when I told him the idea to stop school. He said, \"You are now a grade four student and you are only left with eight years to complete.\" I thought over it and convinced myself that eight years is not too much and decided to continue. My aunt once again took me back with her and I continued my education with her. I was always the leading student in the class but the years until I reach fourth grade were extremely challenging. \nHerald: In relation to biotechnology, what do you think should be done to tap Ethiopia's biotechnology potential more effectively in the near future? \nDr. Tileye: Ethiopia has a very huge potential in the area of biotechnology. We are one of the homes of huge biodiversity in Africa and even in the world. For instance, we do not have a gap for climate change resistant genes. We have different ecological zones which can enable us to produce different crops. It is important for Ethiopia to build its capacity in the area of biotechnology more efficiently and effectively. We can start with genetic engineering as we have, to some extent, the human resource and the facilities and equipment here in Addis Ababa University. For instance, the facilities in Holeta Agricultural Research Centre can enable to embark in such undertakings. We can start tapping biotechnology overnight in this centre. Developing this technology in this country is extremely important for its development. For me, building our capacity should be given priority. What could be, to some extent, challenging will be the task of isolating the gene which is a multi-million dollar project. Usually, the isolated genes are going to be patented for about 20 years. \nFor example, when I was a Ph.D. student, I used a gene called Role B gene. When you insert this gene into a plant, it increases the rooting efficiency. There are horticultural farms which are facing difficulty in rooting and we can improve them by using this gene. In such a way we can build our capacity to produce genetically engineered varieties here in our country. But as I have stated before, there should be no fear as long as we can follow the procedures strictly. At present, the bio-safety proclamation has restricted us from engaging in such projects. We have to learn more from other countries in this respect. \nFor instance, let's take inset, a plant that millions of people depend on for their food. The Bill and Melinda Foundation allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars for the genetic engineering of inset and it is showing fruits. As the proclamation is very restrictive, we in the public universities do not want to engage in such projects. Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Sudan are working on different varieties to improve yield through this way. In the future, there may be exchange of these varieties between farmers of Ethiopia and Sudan mainly in border areas. I hope the parliament shall amend the proclamation and create a conducive environment in the near future to tap our potential in such areas. \nHerald: In relation to our indigenous seed varieties, do not you think that it is necessary to preserve them for the future not to lose our domestic gene base while trying to improve them? \nDr. Tileye: We absolutely need to preserve them. They are very important components of our biodiversity. We may lose low yielding crop varieties while we are trying to increase yield either through the conventional or the GMOs way. In such a scenario, we have to preserve them. The Ethiopian Institute of Biodiversity is actually doing this. They are very useful for future breeding purposes. Hence, it is very important to conserve and save our domestic gene base while trying to improve yield in both cases. However, for some plants it is difficult to preserve their seeds as they loose their viability in short period of time. The Institute of Biodiversity is working on remedies to fill this gap. \nHerald: In relation to the department of biology, where you are working with now, do you think that it is contributing its share in terms of solving the practical problems of the society on the ground? \nDr. Tileye: Here in Addis Ababa University, we are teaching, supervising students, and doing research in various areas of focus. When we look at the contribution of universities from different angels, they are contributing a lot. They are producing the necessary human resource for the research institutes in the country. But there are gaps in terms of solving the problems of the society. There is a considerable gap between research and its application in real life situations. Actually, we are here working on our responsibility to teach, to do research and to publish research results. It is supposed that people will use such research results to solve different problems. This is the way the society in Europe and USA is benefiting from research results. So, the system to benefit from research results should be put in place as we do not have it now. You will get thousands of researches if you go to our library which are not used in the practical day to day life of our society. You need different things to apply a given research to practical life situation of a given society. People in different sectors of the industry and the investor should use the results. \nLet me give you a simple example. We are working on tissue culture. A kilo of apple in today's market costs more than one hundred birr, which is very expensive. One grafted seedling of apple used to cost some years back about one hundred birr. Realizing this, I thought to multiply this seedling by using the tissue culture in the laboratory. I took one masters student to work on this and we started the project at Holeta. Just within short period of time, he produced thousands of seedlings. Using this way you can provide cheap seedlings to those who want to plant them. You can also produce millions of them within short period of time. But I do not have the money and time to engage on such a business. However, the investors and those with huge companies that can work on micro propagation can take the protocol and develop this business. This is the gap we are facing now and it could be bridged if we can put the system in place.
