The following measurements were performed in all patients: midday sleep time, office BP, 24 hour ambulatory BP, pulse wave velocity, two lifestyle habits, body mass index (BMI) and a complete echo-cardiographic evaluation, including left atrial size.\nThe researchers found that midday sleepers had five percent lower average 24 hour ambulatory systolic BP compared to patients who did not sleep at all midday.\nTheir average systolic BP readings were four percent lower when they were awake (5 mmHg) and six percent lower while they slept at night (7 mmHg) than non-midday sleepers.\nManolis Kallistratos of the Asklepieion Voula General Hospital said that reductions as small as 2 mmHg in systolic blood pressure could reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by up to ten percent.\nHe added that their study showed that not only was midday sleep associated with lower blood pressure, but longer sleeps were even more beneficial.\nKallistratos concluded that midday sleep was associated with lower 24 hour blood pressure, an enhanced fall of BP in night, and less damage to the arteries and the heart.\n 30, 2015 3:44 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:25:33.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
