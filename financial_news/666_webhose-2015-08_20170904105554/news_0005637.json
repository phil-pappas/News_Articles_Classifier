Early in Friday's session, a report showed UK construction output rose 2.6% year-on-year in June, missing analysts' estimates for a 3.3% gain. \nEurozone gross domestic product also missed expectations. The EU statistics office said GDP climbed 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and 1.2% year-on-year, short of forecasts for a 0.4% and 1.3% rise respectively. \nSeparately, Eurozone inflation fell 0.6% on the month in July but rose 0.2% year-on-year, as expected, Eurostat confirmed in its final estimate. Inflation remains well below the European Central Bank's target of just below 2%. \nIn the US, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index edged lower in August to reading of 92.9 in August from 93.1 in July, broadly in line with expectations US industrial production rose 0.6% last month, driven by a 10.6% surge in autos production, according to figures from the Federal Reserve, beating estimates for a 0.3% increase. \nPBoC raises reference rate The People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) raised the value of the yuan against the dollar by 0.05% after three days of devaluations. The move came as the Bank tried to soothe the market by promising to work towards a stable currency following a surprise devaluation of almost 2% on Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, the Greek parliament has approved a draft third bailout of about €85bn (£61bn) after a marathon all-night session. \nThe proposed deal involves tax rises and spending cuts, with negotiators having on Tuesday agreed a budget with a primary deficit of 0.25% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015, improving to a 0.5% surplus in 2016, 1.75% in 2017 and a 3.15% surplus in 2018. \nThe proposal has been put to the Eurogroup for a final decision. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said he is hopeful of a deal. \nCompany news Energy-related stocks, including Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and Weir Group , slid as the oil price tumbled with Brent crude down 0.32% to $49.06 per barrel at 1651 BST. \nBP slumped on news it could face a $48m fine after a US regulatory judge ruled that the oil giant's energy traders rigged the natural gas markets in Texas following hurricane Ike in 2008. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) declined after the miner confirmed it has completed the sale of the Tampakan copper project in the Philippines as it sells off assets amid a challenging market. \nVodafone snapped an earlier rise after the company and fellow mobile network Three bought a sizeable piece of UK mobile phone spectrum in an auction of L-band frequency by US-based Qualcomm (Hanover: QCI.HA - news ) . \nTUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) gained after JP Morgan and Jefferies lifted their target price on the stock. \nHome builders Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) and Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) were both up on the back of new UK government funding aimed at building homes for first-time buyers on brownfield sites. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,172.80 -0.07% FTSE 100 6,550.74 -0.27% FTSE 250 17,620.93 +0.14% FTSE 100 - Risers TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI) 1,162.00p +4.31% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,400.00p +2.52% St James's Place (STJ) 980.00p +1.87% Barratt Developments (BDEV) 653.00p +1.79% Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 205.00p +1.79% Persimmon (PSN) 2,105.00p +1.45% easyJet (EZJ) 1,709.00p +1.30% Kingfisher (Amsterdam: KF6.AS - news ) (KGF) 374.50p +1.11% Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) (SGE) 523.50p +1.06% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 177.80p +1.02% FTSE 100 - Fallers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 172.85p -2.23% Smiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) (SMIN) 1,179.00p -1.83% Weir Group (WEIR) 1,462.00p -1.62% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 5,200.00p -1.52% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 906.00p -1.36% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,797.00p -1.34% Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) (OML) 217.50p -1.32% Coca-Cola HBC AG (CDI) (CCH) 1,402.00p -1.27% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,440.00p -1.10% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 756.80p -1.06% FTSE 250 - Risers Computacenter (Swiss: OXCCC.SW - news ) (CCC) 775.00p +5.30% Brown (N.)
