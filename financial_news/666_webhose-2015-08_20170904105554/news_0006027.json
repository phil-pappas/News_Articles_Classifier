With Opposition not relenting, the ministers have repeatedly accused them of “running away” from a debate.\nThe main opposition party has demanded that Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Raje resign for their alleged role in Lalit Modi controversy and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Chouhan quit over the Vyapam scam.\nLeader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad has made it clear that the all-party meeting should be based on what action is taken against Swaraj, Raje and Chouhan.\n“It (the three BJP leaders’ fate) should be on the agenda for the discussions,” Azad has said.\nCongress has also made it clear that its participation in an all-party meeting to break the deadlock depended on a “tangible” proposal from the Prime Minister on the Opposition’s demands.\nAt the CPP meeting, the Congress President is expected to make the party’s stand on these issues all the more clear and also hit out at the government on farmers’ issues.\nThis will be the first meeting of the CPP general body in the Monsoon session, which has seen an aggressive Congress seeking to corner the government on corruption issue.\nCPI(M) has also blamed the BJP-led government for disrupting the House, accusing it of trying to escape from accountability behind the veil of conducting a “debate for debate’s sake”.\nFirst Published on August 02, 2015 9:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T21:13:03.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
