Macy's cut its full-year sales guidance after a double-digit profit decline, Black Diamond widened its loss, and Iconix Brand Group saw its profit halve. \nMacy's US department store retailer Macy's has lowered its full-year sales guidance after reporting disappointing second-quarter results. Net income amounted to US$217m for the three months to 1 August, down 25.7% from $292m in the same period last year. Sales fell 2.6% to $6.10bn from $6.27bn in the prior year, while comparable store sales were down 2.1% year-on-year. The company blamed the decline on the removal of a major Friends & Family event, planned markdowns due to delayed shipments from the West Coast port slowdown, lower demand in many categories, and a stronger US dollar, which impacted international tourist spending. The company expects sales to fall 1%, compared to its earlier guidance of a 1% increase. \nWhile Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe expects near-term weakness at Macy's, he believes the retailer's strategic initiatives, including the sale of its downtown Brooklyn store to Tishman Speyer, will \"play out favourably\" in the longer term. \"We believe Macyâ€™s continued focus on improving the customer shopping experience through both ease of shopping and through a better product assortment, will continue to help the company gain share and drive sales profitably.\" \nBlack Diamond Outdoor equipment and apparel business Black Diamond widened its net loss in the second quarter to US$5.4m from $4.4m a year earlier as a result of restructuring costs. Gross margin increased 280 basis points, despite headwinds from foreign currency, while sales were up 7% on a constant currency basis to $35.1m. \nIconix Brand Group Brand management company Iconix Brand Group saw its second-quarter net profit halve, due to lower revenues. Net income amounted to US$19.4m for the three months to 30 June, compared to $38.8m in the same period a year ago. Revenues fell 17.2% to $98.5m from $118.4m last year, but included a 1% increase in licensing revenue to $98.5m. Licensing revenue was negatively affected by approximately $3.7m due to foreign exchange rates. Excluding this, licensing revenue rose 5%. Chairman and CEO Peter Cuneo said the company's core underlying licensing business \"remains healthy\". \nKate Spade & Co Kate Spade & Co returned to profit during the second quarter, helped by rising sales. Net income reached US$8.5m for the three months to 4 July, compared to a loss of $4.4m. Sales increased 5.7% to $281m, with direct-to-consumer comparable sales growing 10%, or 12% excluding e-commerce. Kate Spade North America saw sales rise 13.1%, while international sales declined 17.3%. Adelington Design Group sales plummeted 44.3% to $5m. \nWeyco Group Weyco Group saw foreign exchange headwinds drag on second-quarter earnings. Net earnings amounted to US$2.1m for the three months to 30 June, compared to $2.5m in the same period last year. Sales, however, rose 2% to $63.9m from $62.9m a year ago. North American wholesale sales grew 7% to $48.1m, while the North American retail segment saw sales fall 5% to $5m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T19:07:06.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
