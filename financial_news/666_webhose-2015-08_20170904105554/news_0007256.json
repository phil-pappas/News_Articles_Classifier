Supplied Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders The chances of Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg launching a second merger attempt with Rio Tinto appear to be fading, with the commodities giant revealing a huge fall in interim earnings, and plans to cut capital expenditure and whittle down its debt to preserve its credit rating and protect dividends.\nGlencore's shares have collapsed about 40 per cent this year to hit an all-time low of 1.70 pence earlier this week. Its market capitalisation has retreated to about £24 billion ($51 billion), about half what it was when it made its first attempt at a \"merger of equals\" with Rio a year ago. Rio's market capitalisation stands at $95.3 billion.\nUnderlying profit for the six month to June 30 fell to $US882 million from $US2 billion last year, 13 per cent ahead of consensus. But Glencore swung to a net loss of $US676 million, from a profit of $US1.7 billion, due to $US1.6 billion in writedowns.\nOn Wednesday, Glencore took the knife to capital expenditure again, cutting 2016 guidance to $US5 billion, a week after cutting 2015 guidance by up to 12 per cent to a \"ceiling\" of $US6bn. The group maintained its first half dividend at US6¢, in line with the year-earlier period.\nChief executive Ivan Glasenberg said the group was taking a \"range of pre-emptive actions in respect of our balance sheet, operations and capital spending/recycling in order to preserve our current credit rating and sustain our track record on equity distributions\".\nLike the rest of the industry, Glencore is hammering down costs and slashing capital spend to alleviate the squeeze the rout across commodities is having on its cash flow, while protecting dividend payouts.\nMr Glasenberg said \"our principal objective remains to grow our free cash flow per share and return any excess capital in the most sustainable and efficient manner.\"\nGlencore's attempt to shore up its balance sheet will go some way to allaying investor and analyst concerns that the trading giant's investment grade credit rating is at risk.\n The Swiss giant's BBB credit rating is two notches away from junk status. It must keep an investment grade rating to facilitate borrowing for its all-important trading arm.\nIt pared net debt slightly, by $US982 million, in the half, to $US29.55 billion in net debt, again beating analyst consensus.\nAnalysts have said Glencore needs to cut net debt by almost half to $16 billion by the end of next year to retain its credit rating.\nIn contrast, Rio's sturdy June half numbers offered no joy for Mr Glasenberg .\nBen Davis, mining analyst at London firm Liberum, told The Australian Financial Review that Glencore still has designs on Rio but will have to wait it out before taking another shot.\n\"I don't think that saga has ended but it is a very unrealistic proposition with the share prices where they are today,\" Mr Davis said.\n\"Glencore would very much like to have another crack at Rio, if iron ore prices go lower and stay there, and copper prices go higher and stay higher. But even then, the chances of success are close to zero.\"\nWhen Mr Glasenberg proposed the Rio deal last year, the trading giant was worth $21 billion less than Rio. That gap has doubled to almost $40 billion.\nMr Glasenberg could try to use a takeover help protect the Swiss giant's market position.\nThe group has been under pressure. In recent days, one of America's most influential activist investors secretly amassed a stake in the trading giant.\nGlencore is expected to run more shutdowns across its Australian coal business in the next six month s, similar to its unprecedented blanket shutdown last Christmas, to avoid selling coal at a loss or heavy discount into a depressed market.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-08-19T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:12:51.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
