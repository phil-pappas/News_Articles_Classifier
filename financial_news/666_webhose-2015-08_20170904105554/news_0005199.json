They are sending a message to investors that they can come to Zimbabwe and operate on cheap labour,\" Ruhanya said. \n\"What is more telling though was Mugabe's response to the whole thing. When everybody expected a vintage Mugabe to come out guns blazing, angered by the ruling that is clearly anti-people, he seemed to accept it,\" said Ruhanya. \"The ruling elite were not surprised by the ruling and seemingly expected -- even welcomed it. It will be foolish for anyone to think that this is an ordinary court ruling\". \nHe however warned that Zanu PF needed to go the whole gamut and accept that liberalisation of the economy alone will not work. \n\"Without a concomitant shift in the political culture, whatever Mugabe has in mind is doomed. His situation differs with that of the Chinese in that he does not have the numbers to support an explicitly cheap labour marketplace. The Chinese, because of sheer numbers, could afford and they have managed to transform to the market economy without corresponding changes to their politics,\" said Ruhanya. \"For them, it was either they reformed or they [would] die\". \nEconomist John Robertson said the Supreme Court judgement was long overdue. \n\"Zimbabwe is using equipment and production methods long made redundant in other economies. This country has become an expensive investment destination because of its strict labour laws,\" Robertson said. \nHe said the issue of retrenchment did not exist in Zimbabwe's labour laws but had become a \"practice\" forced upon business by government. \n\"In the early 80s government forced on employers the issue of retrenchment packages as a form of payment to workers being laid off. Companies were supposed to come up with a plan to retrench that included this gratuity. It was never in the statute books but it then became a common practice and requirement if anyone wanted to lay off workers,\" he said. \nJust days after the judgement, the Supreme Court handed down yet another massive blow for workers when it ruled that allowances could be disregarded if they were not part of an employment contract. \nLawyer and political analyst Alex Magaisa summed up the feeling across the country's remaining formal job market, saying \"the honeymoon for the Zimbabwean employee is over\". \nBut Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions secretary general Japhet Moyo said the Zanu PF government had for years pursued a vicious agenda to destroy organised labour. \n\"The relevance of unions will remain as unquestionable as ever but let us not lose sight of the fact that there has been a brutal war to destroy organised labour because of our decision to form a political party. They have pursued this agenda, if they destroy organised labour then the chances of the dying opposition being revived are slim,\" said Moyo. \nAnother analyst Takura Zha-ngazha said the country's labour federations were \"in trouble\". \n\"If there is anything that we can learn from these unfortunate developments, it is that Zimbabwe is now in a full-fledged age of state capitalism/ neo-liberalism, or as Naomi Klein ably puts it, 'disaster capitalism'. And our courts, by default, are interpreting the law within this ideological ambit. \n\"The latter is characterised by the withdrawal of the state from what should be an obligatory role of protecting citizens from the vagaries of the 'free market'. In this there is rampant privatisation of state assets and limitations on the labour rights of workers especially in times of endemic economic crisis,\" said Zhangazha. \nHe said the role of unions would be diminished. \n\"Add to this, a deliberately diminished role of trade unions and unionism and you have a recipe for an undemocratic laissez faire economic framework that benefits the already rich, those that are politically connected to the detriment of a majority poor,\" Zhangazha said. \"In light of this unfair reality, the ball is firmly in the labour movements' court. It is the struggling Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and its affiliates that have to redefine their agenda in view of the broader disempowering intentions of government\". \nRobertson added that the time had come for workers to take charge of their future than rely on employers' generosity at the end of their careers. \n\"They should also make sure they prepare themselves for other jobs if they think they are in danger of losing the ones they have,\" said Robertson. \"As for NECs and unions, their relevance should begin to be interrogated\".
