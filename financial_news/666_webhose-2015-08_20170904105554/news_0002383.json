Photo: Ryan Stuart\nData collated by Dealogic for The Australian Financial Review reveals the number of mining mergers and acquisitions targeting Australian companies or assets, has steadily declined over the past five years and last financial year amounted to a total value of just $77.6 billion.\nAdvertisement Comparatively, the number of deals globally ticked up slightly during the period and last year recorded a five-year high of $4.2 trillion.\nBut one recently busy space has been the Australian gold sector, which has undergone a significant transformation in the past 18 months, after ambitious local miners including Northern Star Resources , Evolution Mining and OceanaGold , picked up brownfields mines or unwanted assets divested by majors such as Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold.\nPlenty of action The action picked up last week with Oceana lobbing a $C856 million ($893 million) takeover offer for Toronto-listed Romarco Minerals on Thursday. It was swiftly followed on Friday with Barrick's $US1 billion ($1.36 billion) sale of its 50 per cent interest in the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile to Antofagasta, Metals X's bids for gold assets from RNI and Panoramic Resources, and Northern Star Resources completing its agreement to acquire a 60 per cent joint venture interest in Tanami Gold's Central Tanami project.\nMacquarie analyst Hayden Bairstow told clients the recent merger and acquisition activity is a significant positive for the sector and is expected to be a talking point at Diggers.\n\"Potential targets and tie-ups are likely be a key focus of the conference,\" he said.\nVeteran Perth dealmaker and Argonaut chairman, Charles Fear, expects the conference to be an \"interesting\" mix this year, with the gold sector \"sitting pretty\" while companies in coal and iron ore remain in the depths of gloom.\n\"I can't see commodity prices staying this low,\" he said. \"It is hard to call but I think we are at the bottom of the commodity cycle. When you reflect on it, you have seen coal halve in three years, you have seen iron ore halve in 12 months and you have seen oil halve in three months. Base metals have been hammered as well; copper has been hit hard and nickel is not looking too shiny but we need to put into perspective the Australia dollar is low.\"\nNorthern Star Resources managing director Bill Beament​ said after the gold miner \"didn't sit still\" acquiring four mines within six months, it's focus is now firmly on strengthening the life of its projects through exploration around existing infrastructure.\nFive-year celebration On Saturday, the company celebrated five years to the day since it got the keys to the first mine it acquired, Paulsens.\nCelebrating the milestone with staff at the operation, Mr Beamentsaid the project, which Northern Star picked up for $40 million In 2010 with a remaining mine life of less than a year, is a good example of the life left in existing assets.\nThe company is expected to reveal its plans for its newest, and sixth, mine at the conference after completing the acquisition of Tanami Gold's Central Tanami project last week.\nThe falling Australian dollar has also provided some respite for sectors that continues to be hampered by depressed commodity prices but has allowed the local gold sector, which PCF Capital Group managing director Liam Twigger said has already \"had its nuclear winter\", to strengthen its global position, despite a falling gold price.\n\"With the Aussie dollar gold price about $1500 an ounce, there's about a $400 an ounce margin for anyone in the local business,\" he said.\"The gold sector will be there talking up their resilience… and will lead interest because they have their house in order.\"\nThe conference's expected attendance of between 1700 and 1800 is down slightly on the 1900 that attended last year, with anecdotal evidence of free seats on flights and unoccupied hotel rooms, never normally available a few weeks out from the conference, supporting the chatter that this year's Diggers might be a bit quieter.\nMr Twigger said, for the past four years, he and his team had rented a five-bedroom house for the duration of the conference for about $6000 but this year, for the first time, they were able to cancel the accommodation and book cheaper hotel rooms.\n\"We did it within the last three months but normally, you have to book miles in advance to get the hotels,\" he said.\nStrong barometer The number of investors the event attracted will provide a strong barometer for the level of interest in the industry. Diggers director John Langford said a week out from the event, about 18 per cent of attendees are expected to be from banks, brokers and institutions, a statistic in line with previous years.\nBut Lion Selection Group executive director Hedley Widdup said while he still sees value in the conference, the event might not be attracting the usual suspects from the local investment community and plenty of bargain hunters will be in town.\n\"I know quite a few of the guys I expected to go from Australian funds said they aren't this year,\" he said. \"From what I understand there are a few of them that have fires burning and have a few better things to do than jet across the country for who knows.\n\"There are other instos that are better funded or have a longer term view of the price perhaps that can smell the blood and are going across. I know of a few like that coming from overseas.\"\nMr Fear agreed. \"The contrarian investors and the smart money is beginning to come into resources,\" he said. \"Diggers is always a place where a deal is done.\"\nLast year's conference was the genesis for the $36 million merger between gold miner Doray Minerals and developer Mutiny Gold.\nOn the first day of the conference, Mutiny released an updated study of its Deflector gold project which reinforced Doray's interest in the company.\nDoray managing director Allan Kelly said the company did not approach Mutiny until after Diggers but \"we had in our mind that we wanted to\".\nSpies at Diggers \"We had a couple of spies in the audience [at Diggers],\" he said. \"That was really the trigger.\"\nMr Twigger, Mr Fear and Mr Widdup all said they expect deals to emerge from this year's conference – especially on an asset sale level.\nBut while some sectors' cashed up miners may be on the cusp of better conditions, the harshest challenges faced by junior miners and explorers are unlikely to turn around yet, Mr Fear said.\nNew analysis from EY to be released on Monday highlights the current capital squeeze experienced by the industry's junior ranks.\nEY Oceania mining and metals leader Scott Grimley said access to capital is the top ranking business risk for mid-tier and junior companies.\n\"Competition for capital is fiercer than it has ever been, following the 'super correction' to the super cycle which has left junior and mid-tier miners grappling with the challenge of risk-averse equity markets and highly selective lenders,\" Mr Grimley said.\nIn 2014, the total proceeds from capital raisings across the global junior and mid-tier sector were 15 per cent lower than in 2013, falling from $US272 billion to $US231 billion, EY found. So far in 2015, proceeds amount to $142 billion.\nAlso to be released on Monday, the Deloitte WA Index shed 11.6 per cent during the 2015 financial year, driven by an overall slowdown in the state's mining sector and despite the listing of BHP Billiton spin off South32 in May, which added $11.3 billion, or 8.4 per cent, to the market capitalisation of the index.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/mining/gold/oceanagold-in-trading-halt-ahead-of-business-combination-announcement-20150730-ginkhb", "http://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/agriculture/commodity-prices-ride-chinas-sharemarket-rollercoaster-20150731-gioiy3", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/zaldivar-not-on-menu-for-bhp-rio-20150730-giocse", "http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/plenty-of-positives-at-evolution-mining-20150727-gil8j4", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/900m-acquisition-positions-oceanagold-for-low-gold-price-era-20150730-giodnq", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/gold/northern-star-resources-focuses-on-exploration-chapter-20150726-gil1ja"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:06:24.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
