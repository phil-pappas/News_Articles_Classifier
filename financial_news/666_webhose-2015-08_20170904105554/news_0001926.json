It said that overall the crime resulted in more than $100m (£64m) of illegal profit. \nFederal authorities said it was the largest scheme of its kind ever prosecuted. \n\"This case illustrates how cyber criminals and those who commit securities fraud are evolving and becoming more sophisticated,\" Paul Fishman, the US attorney for New Jersey, said at a news conference \nThe US Justice Department said in a statement that the scheme aimed to \"hack into three business newswires and steal yet-to-be published press releases containing non-public financial information that was then used to make trades.\" \nThe hackers created a \"video tutorial\" to help traders view the stolen releases, and were paid a portion of the profits from trades based on information contained there, prosecutors said. \nStarting in 2010, the hackers allegedly gained early access to hundreds of news releases from services including Marketwired of Toronto, Canada, PR Newswire, based in New York, and San Francisco-based Business Wire. \nThe news releases contained earnings figures and other corporate information. \nThe traders then used the information to make trades before the releases came out, exploiting a time gap ranging from hours to three days, prosecutors said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:38:33.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
