Their over 17 years of dedication to socialist principles, wherein centralised planning and management of the economy is one of the key pillars, meant that abolishing the old way of doing business was not as easy as it seemed. It inherently meant going against the very principles that shaped their thoughts in all those years of fighting against one of the heavily armed forces in Africa. Their lack of experience in implementing economic reforms worsened the case. \nIf there was one thing they could count on, it was their popular political support. The defeat of the military dictatorship, which had committed horrendous crimes, in and of itself, was enough a cause for the public to rally behind the Revolutionary Democrats. Their commitment to take a different path, despite frequent infighting and patches of volatility around the country, consolidated the support base in their favour. As if they had read the history of economic crises and state-building rightly, they then leveraged their political support to write off the old ways and take things in the new direction. \nIt, however, soon became apparent that the needs are more than economic reconstruction and consolidation. Bringing the economy, dominated by subsistence agriculture practiced in fragmented landholdings, to the realm of growth was what was actually needed. Equally important was to diversify the growth of the economy towards industry and services. \nIt was all to be accomplished along with ensuring internal peace and stability, shouldering the cost of the war with Eritrea, shifting the logistics corridor to Djibouti, mobilising the support of donors with varying interests, breaking the eight-year cycle of drought for which the nation became known, and building the essential institutional capacity to implement and oversee the whole economic assignment. This, of course, is not to mention the tasks related to establishing the institutional and legal bases of constitutional democracy. \nIt was a life and death case for the ruling elite and for the nation. Owing much to the pragmatism of the Revolutionary Democrats, the results were positive. Certainly, there are critics who argue against the costs paid in this tumultuous journey. They argue that the costs were not warranted. Differences on costs aside, the reconstruction project was largely successful. \nNot only has it helped to take the war-torn economy out of the shadows of malfunction, but it also paved the road to the economic growth of the past 13 years. The growing economy of the nation, which, according to the World Bank, witnessed an average annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expansion of 10.1pc since 2001, has a lot to borrow from the job done during the 1990s. \nNone of this means that the challenges have evaporated. They have rather changed face. As the symptomatic elements of the economy have been addressed, the structural elements have become apparent. The tasks at hand are no more about reconstruction, consolidation or getting onto the growth trajectory. They are, instead, about resolving the structural gaps of the economy and sustaining the growth experienced over the past decade. \nLittle has changed in the structural mix of the economy, though. If anything, the bias toward the service sector that has been displayed over the past couple of years is a new trend. Agriculture is still the mainstay of the economy and much of what happens outside of the sector, depends on the sector. Even within agriculture, the shift from subsistence and smallholder rain-fed agriculture has been slight. \nShocks, such as rain and crop failure, remain to pose considerable challenges for the economy. Built-in household and communal resilience remains very weak. Hence, even temporary variables have considerable impact on the performance of the economy. \nWhen seen in light of these structural elements, the latest lag in rainfall around the nation is worrisome. As projected by the United States National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), much of the country is predicted to have drier-than-normal conditions. Significant moisture deficit is being felt on the ground. \nAbsorbing shocks is essential to sustain growth. As it stands, Ethiopia's economy has gone far in building absorption capacity, compared to where it was decades ago. This has a lot to do with the public investment in infrastructure and institutions. \nNonetheless, there has not been enough investment on upstream agricultural services, such as weather projection, agricultural research and early warning systems. Of course, there have been efforts to embrace all of these as parts of the national endeavour to push agriculture forward. But the bias towards downstream services, such as extension support, persists. \nConsidering the level and frequency of shocks that Ethiopia's economy experiences, it is unwise to overlook key services that would enable communities to build resilience. It is unimaginable to sustain agricultural growth, for instance, without effective and functional weather forecasting and an early warning system. This would be even more important, considering the nation's dependence on its water resources for much of the energy that drives its industrial base. \nUnderinvestment in key upstream services, therefore, raises the risk of inability to prepare to absorb shocks. It is easy to envisage the cost this would entail for the economy that is struggling to take its root to productive equilibrium. \nHaving the institutional and human capital to conduct updated weather forecasting analysis, giving timely feedback to agricultural research and policymaking, integrating it all with early warning and disaster prevention systems is critical to having reliable shock absorption capacity. This also means farmers would be well-informed and therefore able to make timely production decisions. \nAs it stands, though, the capability in these terms remains unreliable. Neither the institutional nor the human capability is comparable to the demands of the economy. This is therefore a weak edge within the agricultural policy area and it has become apparent with the latest lag in rainfall. \nAgricultural policymaking, largely as a direct result of the underinvestment in the upstream services, remains passive. The national early warning system has not reached farmers and hence uncertainty is the dominant feeling within the farming community. \nIf one is to go by the projections, notwithstanding the significant error of commission within such projections, the lag may be a temporary event. This, however, does not mean that the underinvestment in upstream services ought to remain as such. \nThe stakes are too high for the Revolutionary Democrats to overlook upstream services. They have to come to terms with the realistic need for upbeat weather analysis, agricultural research and early warning systems. Only then can they build resilience. And it is only through having a reliable buffer of absorptive capacity, which eventually translates into resilience, that growth can be sustained in an economy with agriculture as a mainstay. It is therefore time for the EPRDFites to broaden their vision and invest equitably.
