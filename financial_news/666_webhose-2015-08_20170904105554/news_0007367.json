Even farmers who have been adhering to good farming practices have this season bowed to unfriendly weather. \n\"This is the worst year I have never seen since I started growing cotton,\" said Mr Mugole Lusungura, a cotton grower in Bunda's Guta Ward. \nAccording to Mr Lusungura, he normally harvests averagely 1,270 kilogrammes of seed cotton per acre but he has managed only 900 kilogrammes from his three acres this season. \n\"It is very disappointing but that is how rain reliant farming activities are--very risky,\" he said with concern. \nHe however blamed the problem on the collapse of contract farming, saying although drought has had it toll on the production, unreliable access to farming inputs has exacerbated the problem. \n\"Frankly speaking, there has been no contract farming in Bunda this season,\" he charged blaming the collapse of the otherwise beneficial system on politics. \nS&C Ginnery's Kinyambwiga-based agent Criford Majura described the crop buying season as terrible, saying he had by last week procured only 34,190 kilogrammes against the 132,000 he had last year. \n\"The season has almost ended and I do not think if I will get even 50,000 kgs,\" said Mr Majura, hinting that in good seasons he buys between 200,000 and 300,000 kilogrammes. \nThe government through Tanzania Cotton Board (TCB) in 2007 embarked on pilot contract farming in Mara's three districts of Serengeti, Bunda and Musoma Rural to help cotton growers to boost production through timely supply of inputs and guaranteed markets. \nThe system however collapsed despite its potential benefits to both farmers and ginners due to what stakeholders describe as vested interests.
