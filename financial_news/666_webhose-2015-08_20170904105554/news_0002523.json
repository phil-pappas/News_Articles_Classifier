On its part, Government will primarily focus on supporting vulnerable household farmers through an input pack scheme. \n\"To capacitate farmers in preparation for the 2015-2016 agricultural season, Government will also prioritise outstanding payments to farmers amounting to $29,2 million for grain delivered during the 2014-15 marketing season. \n\"Furthermore, payment for new deliveries to July 2015 of about 26 950 tonnes of grains valued at $10,5 million under the 2015-16 marketing season will be prioritised,\" he said. \nMinister Chinamasa said Government was co-ordinating all key stakeholders including co-operating partners, input suppliers, financiers and farmers to ensure adequate preparatory arrangements. \n\"In terms of financing, Government intervention will be in line with its capacity, while also playing a facilitatory role in mobilising other resources from private sources in support of agriculture,\" he said. \nZimbabwe Indigenous Women Farmers Association Trust president, Mrs Depinah Nkomo, urged Government to prioritise capacitating the GMB so that it paid farmers on time. \n\"It is disturbing that Government forks out more than $230 million importing wheat when local farmers can produce the crop. \n\"Why not use the money on local farmers? We still have farmers who have not received their money for the grain delivered in 2013 and 2014. \n\"Some farmers have lost their houses after they failed to pay back loans due to non-payment of the grain. Government should consider paying farmers an interest for the late payments as is done with the banks. We are charged interest of above 25 percent for late payment,\" she said. \nMrs Nkomo said Government should make sure that funds mobilised for agriculture are monitored to ensure they are sent to intended beneficiaries. \n\"We have heard of huge funds channelled to agriculture, but we cannot access them as banks are not assisting farmers, \" she said. \nAgriculture economist, Mr Midway Bhunu, said it was critical for all key players on the inputs supply chain to ensure that inputs are available on the market early to enable timely planting. \n\"Access to inputs is a function of availability and affordability of the inputs to smallholder farmers who are mostly financially challenged. \n\"If GMB could improve its payment systems and give farmers their money on time, they are able to put inputs in place well before the onset of the rains. \n\"However, as a country, we need to develop strategies that enhance farmers' access to markets. There is need for sustainable strategic partnerships among key stakeholders with emphasis on high private sector participation in markets development,\" he said. \nLast season, the summer cropping season was affected by erratic rainfall and floods, which affected production. \nThe poor rainfall pattern not only resulted in some of the area under cropping having to be written-off, but also adversely affected the quality of some crops. \nThe impact was most severe on cereals, such as maize and small grains. \nThis resulted in the country facing a maize deficit of 700 000 tonnes of maize and the tobacco target being revised from the initial 222 million kg to 185 million kg. \nThe target was, however, surpassed.
