Photo: Peter Braig\nChildcare operator G8 Education has sweetened its takeover bid for smaller rival Affinity Education, increasing its price to 80¢ a share and allowing investors to take up the offer in cash or shares.\nThe $1.2 billion company put out a supplementary bidder statement on Monday morning, which revealed an improved scrip offer and the new cash bid.\nG8 is now offering Affinity investors one G8 share for each 4.25 Affinity shares, up from one G8 share for every 4.61 shares. The new bid values Affinity shares at 80¢ apiece, the company said, up from the 70¢ a share value contained in the original bid that was made public in early July .\nThe bid values Affinity at $185 million, up from $162 million at the initial bid.\nAffinity urged shareholders to take no action while the board considers the new bid. The company said it had engaged Lonergan Edwards & Associates to compile an independent expert's report for the board.\nThe company said it also held discussions with \"another interested party\" since G8's July 3 announcement.\nAccording to G8's bidder statement, the new offer represents a 48.1 per cent premium to the 54¢ closing price of Affinity shares on the day before the first offer. G8's takeover bid came after a 34 per cent one-day slump in Affinity shares caused by an earnings update that was received very poorly by the market.\nG8 swooped on 16 per cent of Affinity after the share price slump and now controls 19.9 per cent of the company. G8 paid 70¢ a share in its initial raid.\nIf Affinity investors are not interested in swapping their holding in Affinity for shares in its bigger rival, they can also cash out through the new offer. G8 has appointed broker Canaccord Genuity as its agent for the purchase of Affinity shares.\nThe cash offer will open on August 18 and investors will have until September 28 to accept or decline it.\nG8 has been on an aggressive roll-up path buying established centres initially making small acquisitions but then buying competitors with large portfolios, taking its network to 450 sites with more than 35,000 child care spots per day since listing in 2007.\nShould the deal be successful, G8 will add another 161 centres and 12,000 places.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/policy/education/g8-education-lobs-offer-for-rival-childcare-operator-affinity-education-group-20150703-gi489u", "http://www.afr.com/street-talk/g8-education-takes-16pc-stake-in-affinity-education-group-20150702-gi3s8p"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:15:02.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
