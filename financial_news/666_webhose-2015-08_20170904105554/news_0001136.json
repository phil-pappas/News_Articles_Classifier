At 0900 BST, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index and France's CAC 40 were down 0.4%, while Germany's DAX was 0.5% lower. \n\"The main focus today will be on US employment numbers with many considering this as the crucial set of data in regard to when rates will finally go up,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \n\"The Fed might just follow the Bank of England in holding off just a bit longer until next year, which probably would make sense considering there are no price pressures at all in the foreseeable future plus it is still not certain if China and the Eurozone have indeed turned the corner,\" he added. \nData released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose a little less than expected last week. Initial claims increased by 3,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 270,000, compared with expectations for 273,000. \nCorporate news was thin on the ground on Friday. \nIn London, bookmaker William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) was sharply lower after posting a 35% fall in pre-tax profit for the six months to 1 July, as it battled through a period of major regulatory and taxation disruption. \nAllianz edged lower as second-quarter operating profit fell a little short of expectations, although the insurer posted a bigger-than-expected jump in profit and expressed confidence over its full-year targets. \nMining giant Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) bucked the trend, trading higher after Macquarie upgraded the stock to 'outperform' from 'neutral' following the company's strong first-half results. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Italy's Banca Monte dei Paschi (Milan: BMPS.MI - news ) di Siena rallied after the bank's second-quarter earnings beat expectations. \nData released earlier showed industrial production in Germany unexpectedly fell in June. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, output fell 1.4% month-on-month from a revised reading of 0.2% growth in April and compared with expectations for a 0.3% rise. \nUS initial jobless claims are due for release at 1330 BST, along with the unemployment rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T12:40:31.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
