Hikma attributed the decline to greater competition and a tough comparison with the first half of 2014, when it reported an \"exceptionally strong performance\". \nHikma said the “expected\" decline in generics offset good performances in its branded and injectables businesses, which helped generate group revenue of $709m in the six months to June 30. This was unchanged from the year before at constant currency rates, but down 4pc at actual rates. \nHikma's pre-tax profits were down 22pc to $170m. \nJordan-based Hikma, which also makes branded drugs, recently acquired speciality generics business Roxane from German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. Hikma expects the $2.65bn deal to transform its position in the US, making it the states' sixth largest generics company by revenue. \nGenerics are out-of-patent drugs, usually as effective but much cheaper than brand-name drugs. \nHikma entered the FTSE 100 in March, joining other pharmaceuticals groups AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) , GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) and Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) in the top flight. \nDespite the profit fall, Hikma expects full-year revenue to grow by 2pc, or 6pc in constant currency rates. \nSaid Darwazah , chief executive, said: \"We have had an excellent start to the year. Our financial results are in line with expectations and we are making strong strategic progress across the group.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T11:55:20.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
