The move put Shire back on the acquisition trail and let the Dublin-based drug maker reclaim the role of predator rather than prey. \nSeven months on, Mr Ornskov is at it again, and with his $30bn approach for Baxalta, is attempting to pull off Shire’s biggest takeover to date . \nShire has grown dramatically since its humble beginnings in 1986 when it started selling calcium supplements from above a shop in Basingstoke to elderly patients seeking to prevent osteoporosis. \nTen years later, having grown into a pharmaceuticals minnow, it listed on the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) valued at around $100m. When Mr Orskov started at the company in 2013, Shire was worth around $18bn after building itself through a series of acquisitions. \nHe came to the company as a FTSE outsider, unknown to many in the City. Growing up in Esbjerg, a seaside town on the west coast of Denmark, he was spurred into physiology after his father contracted tuberculosis and was moved to a sanatorium. Following years of study at medical school in Copenhagen and Harvard and an MBA from Insead in France. However, his spell at the leading French business school has also quickly taught him the science of deal making. \nLong before Ornskov took the top job, Shire had been an attractive takeover target. However, a sticking point for many acquirers had always been Shire’s blockbuster drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Adderall and Vyvanase. \nShire's blockbuster Adderall drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \nThe drugs had been incredibly lucrative for some time - last year they brought in $1.4bn, for example. But ADHD as a condition has historically been treated with scepticism by Shire’s European counterparts, as different cultural attitudes have made them more hostile towards the overuse of medication for such behaviours. \nOrnskov has sought to address investor concerns about Shire’s reliance on ADHD drugs by turning the company into a bigger story and turbocharging its growth in rare diseases medicines defined as a market with less than 2,000 patients - where the cost of annual treatment can often run in to six figure sums. \nRare diseases now make up around 45pc of the group’s revenues and its rare disease drugs have the additional benefit of being protected from cheaper generic rival producers who lack the incentive to enter such a small patient market. \nDespite these strategic strengths, it was Shire’s Dublin tax base which was the real reason behind US rival AbbVie’s approach. \nLast year, a major driver of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity was an explosion of inversion deals which allowed American companies to cut their corporation tax bills by moving to a lower tax base through a takeover of a company in a country with a lower corporate tax rate. However, following a rash of inversion deals. and the huge publicity of rival Pfizer’s earlier failed £63bn pursuit of Anglo-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) , the US Treasury moved to tighten the screw on such deals. Despite months of negotiations and integration talks already well under way, AbbVie (Xetra: 4AB.DE - news ) took a second look at its numbers following the changes and abandoned the deal. \nThere are some delicious ironies in comparing the AbbVie deal and Shire’s latest move for Baxalta: AbbVie was a US drug maker, spun-off from Abbott Laboratories, pursuing Shire for its tax benefits. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , Shire is pursuing Baxalta, an American company, very recently spun off from Baxter International. In fact the spin-off is so recent that Baxalta was an unknown to many of Shire’s investors before yesterday. \nBaxalta is focused in rare diseases, particularly in haemophilia \nFurthermore, Shire is using its low tax base which promises to reduce the combined entity’s bill to around 17pc as an extra sweetener for Baxalta to agree to a takeover. \nMr Ornskov has learned from his team of highly paid lawyers at Slaughter & May and the impeccable timing of Shire’s approach also bear the fingerprints of Susan Kilsby, the former Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) banker who is Shire’s chairman and an unflappable dealmaker. \nJust nine days after Baxalta demerged from Baxter, Mr Ornskov and Ms Kilsby met with Baxalta’s board. They could not have talked with Baxter before the spin-off, or Baxter would have faced a 35pc tax charge from the IRS. Offering to pay for Baxalta in cash would also trigger a 35pc tax charge - which is why Shire has suggested using its US-listed American Depositary Receipt shares as currency. \nThere are still many hurdles to the deal, however. One is the obvious reluctance from Baxalta’s board, headed by Ludwig Hantson. Prior to Shire’s approach Mr Hantson was enjoying his new found independence. Mr Ornskov indicated yesterday that he understood that the desire of Baxalta’s management team to be “an independent and thriving company” was behind some of the reticence to do the deal. \nThe Shire chief also said that as the two firms were “copy cats” of each other, in terms of their rare disease functions, there would inevitably be huge synergies M&A shorthand for swathes of redundancies. \nSecondly, Shire is still without the blessing of Baxter International (NYSE: BAX - news ) , which continues to own 19.5pc of Baxter. Mr Ornskov confessed that there had been no communication with Baxter, or any other shareholders, prior to its approach. \nOne would imagine that Mr Ornskov and Ms Kilsby are already chartering a flight to Baxter’s headquarters in Chicago. A takeover of Baxalta will transform Shire and its future. While it is being billed as an “offensive” move, it will also defend it from any future advances .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:26:19.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
