He says: “While wholesale energy prices have been tumbling over the last two years, British Gas at first moved prices up sharply in the autumn of 2013, and only later started to pass on savings at a slow pace.\n“The profit increase shows that passing on small, slow, price cuts have been great for business, if not for consumers. If you don’t switch, only your energy supplier will get rich,” he warned.\nA search this week using the Guardian’s energy comparison website found that the average British Gas customer can save around £300.\nThe cheapest tariff is offered by First Utility. It is followed in the tables by several small firms most readers will not have heard of – apart from Scottish Power, which has been beset by billing problems which may discourage many from switching. First Utility has also been the subject of many complaints to the Guardian’s consumer champions.\nGiven these reservations, we would rather go for Sainsbury’s Energy or Ovo. At around £900 a year for both gas and electricity, Sainsbury’s offers a £300 saving over British Gas, which charges the typical dual-fuel customer £1,200 a year.\nWhat is ironic is that the Sainsbury’s deal is offered in partnership with – you guessed it – British Gas.\nFor a slightly higher £916 a year, Ovo comes with excellent customer service reviews – and has the advantage that it is an entirely independent firm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:42:43.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
