Pat Scala by Laura Tingle Even set against the low expectations of recent years, many Australians might feel like we have hit rock bottom in recent weeks when it comes to respect for our politicians and the Parliament.\nBronwyn Bishop's expenses scandal hasn't just made people angry about snouts in the trough, it has made many feel as if politics really does run in a parallel universe.\nPolitics sometimes feels that way even to people engaged in it: whether that be because of anachronistic forms of parliamentary debate that are now so abused and misused or because it doesn't feel like politics is coming to grips with the big issues of the day.\nIt can be particularly dispiriting for younger MPs. Two young Labor MPs from Melbourne, Clare O'Neil and Tim Watts, have written a book in which they move outside the party political orb to consider the big issues we face as a nation and how to re-engage the community in the political system.\nThe freshness of the book partly comes from the fact that the two MPs really are a new generation.They've come up with some radical ideas about how political parties can use technology to give members – and non-members – an unprecedented say in party policies, but also how voters can directly influence what Parliament debates, as well as having very different perspectives on issues like housing affordability.\nThey are proposing a proportion of every parliamentary sitting week be dedicated to citizens' business, \"in which Australian citizens directly propose topics for debate by their elected representatives\", they say in their book Two Futures: Australia at a Critical Moment.\n\"These topics would be selected by the online votes of their fellow citizens\" they say, noting a similar move in Finland, \"and the vote of all members of Parliament on the substance of any motion that attracts more than 50,000 online signatures\".\nOnline vote on issues \"A platform that enables Australians to vote online to determine the issues that their MPs debate would give parliamentarians direct feedback about the strength of community sentiment on particular issues, and give citizens concerned about those issues the satisfaction that their parliament was engaging with them\", they argue.\nSuch changes would encourage people to become more engaged in politics and help them understand the trade-offs that MPs must make every day on policy.\nOn the issue of making Parliament relevant, O'Neil and Watts argue for a radical overturning of many of the conventions and symbols of Parliament, which they say may only alienate many voters: anything from getting rid of the Lord's Prayer or even the speech by the Governor-General at the opening of Parliament. They argue for a roster of ministers and prime ministers to take questions (which was tried under Paul Keating), or even a rotation of topics. Moving Question Time to prime viewing time, they argue, might put more pressure on MPs to behave but also take Question Time tactics out of the cycle of the evening news bulletins.\nThe two MPs think there can be processes that also help re-engage people with political parties. For Labor, for example, they argue the party should develop systems to allow members – and non-members – to run issue-specific campaigns.\nThey are proposing the creation of a new institution within the ALP: an Online Policy Action Caucus (OPAC) to advocate on specific issues (for example, Labor for Equal Marriage), without organisational approval, if they are able to sign up at least 50 existing party members to each group.\n\"A special class of party membership could be created to allow members of the general public to join not the ALP proper, but a specific OPAC, for a nominal fee\", they say. OPACs that achieve a predetermined organising goal, such as signing up 5000 members to their group, could have the right to move an amendment to the ALP platform at the relevant national or state conference.\nThe amendment would then be voted on by elected delegates in the normal way.\nA model like this would give members and supporters an incentive to organise and would allow \"fellow travellers to determine the nature of their engagement with the ALP, enabling them to pursue a specific cause within the party without having to make the full commitment to ALP membership\".\nFor young MPs like O'Neil and Watt, current political structures are as frustrating as they are for voters. In their new book, they've tried to find ways of addressing both the forms of politics and some of our big intractable policy issues like inequality, growth, climate, technology and our relationship with the world.\nThe challenge will be for their ideas to be considered, rather than just become the fodder for political controversy about policy divisions.\nTwo Futures: Australia at a Critical Moment, by Clare O'Neil and Tim Watts with a foreword by Laura Tingle is published by Text Publishing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:36:15.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
