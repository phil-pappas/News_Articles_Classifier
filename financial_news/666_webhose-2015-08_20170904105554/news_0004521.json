(The strike) is going to have a major impact on people today,\" he added. \nLondon Overground and the Docklands Light Railway were running as normal, but they were busier than usual. \nOutside Tube stations, picket lines were, as workers from four unions protested about plans to launch a 24-hour \"Night Tube\" service on some lines at weekends from 12 September. \nMore disruption is threatened unless both sides can settle the dispute. \nConstructive talks between TfL and the unions appear to have stalled after unions refused a deal that included an extra £200 per night shift, a £500 launch bonus for night staff and assurances on work-life balance including amended rotas and new staff. The pay rise alone would have taken the salary of a newly-qualified tube driver from £49,673 to £50,666. \nRMT leaders claimed the offer \"is just a rehash of an earlier package\" which doesn't address concerns about work/life balance, adding that staff have not been properly consulted about the rota changes that night work would bring, leaving them \"at the beck and call of management to plug staffing gaps\". \nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson has insisted that Underground staff are being offered a \"very generous deal.\" He accused the unions of \"holding a gun\" to the head of the travelling public, warning that no further money would be authorised during negotiations – even if it meant delaying the launch of the Night Tube. \nBut Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, has stressed that all workers will still get two days off in every seven, and will have ample opportunity to swap shifts with colleagues if they so wish. \nHis colleague, LU's managing director Nick Brown, said: \"I think, for the sake clearly of our passengers, a resolution has got to come. I hope it comes very soon - but it can't come at any cost.\" \nMeanwhile, the Government has announced nurses, teachers and civil servants will not be allowed to have trade union subscription automatically deducted from their wages. \nNearly four million public sector workers have their fees taken directly from their pay every month but ministers say the approach is \"outdated\" and leaves the taxpayer with a £6.5m bill every year to help fund union payments. \nWorkers will instead have to arrange to make the payments themselves, a move which could see a significant decline in funding for Britain's biggest trade unions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T22:13:58.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
