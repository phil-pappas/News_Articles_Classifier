But the weakened Australian dollar has really put our quality retail assets on the radar of international purchasers,\" Mr Duncan said.\n\"We've seen yields compress dramatically over the last 24 months in Sydney. When we sold the Kings Cross Centre back in 2013, it transacted on a passing yield of 8.3 per cent, and this week it sold at 6.9 per cent.\n\"In line with this, we also recently sold a restaurant site at 2 Phillips Street housing Fratelli Fresh's Caf√© Nice for $5.92 million, being a 50 per cent capital gain over two years for its seller.\n\"Rental income has increased considerably, giving rise to competition for well-leased and well located retail.''\nThe centre's anchor tenant, Coles, is close to its turnover threshold and holds a lease until 2022, while the overall occupancy is 98.5 per cent.\nDevelopment land is also in high demand, which has prompted the listing of a vacant property at 628 Pittwater Road, Brookvale. The 4345-square-metre site is being sold through by JLL's David Mathews and Gary Mason.\nThe property has been held by the Ebsary family since 1954 and is the head office of the family-owned engineering business Ebsray Pumps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:50:11.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
