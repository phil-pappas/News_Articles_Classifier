These include: developing a personal financial plan following submission guidelines, as a semi-finalist presenting the plan via webinar to the IARFC Board Members and finally as a finalist presenting live in front of experienced financial professionals. “Our goal of the plan competition is an educational one,” says IARFC CEO Ed Morrow . “Students need to understand how to present to a real client, in the real world with a real case scenario. Completing this process simulates a realistic career experience.” Universities that participated in the 2015 semi-finals and finals were: Bryant University, Smithfield, RI – faculty advisor Mara L Derderian, RFC®; Shepherd University, Shepherdstown, WV – faculty advisor Nicolas Pologeorgis, Ph.D., RFC®; Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA – faculty advisor, John P. McFarland; Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC – faculty advisor Grace C. Allen, Ph.D; Winthrop University, Rock Hill, SC – faculty advisor Philip Gibson Ph.D.\nWinners for the 2015 competition determined in Charlotte, NC last May were: First Place: Bryant University from Smithfield, RI - team members David Ferraro and Staci Rezendes. Second place: Winthrop University from Rock Hill, SC - team members Kristin Cranford and Victoria Davis. Third place: Bryant University from Smithfield, RI - Nicholas Zacchilli, faculty advisor Mara Derderian.\n“Participating in the IARFC National Financial Plan Competition has definitely broadened my view of the financial world,” relates first place winner Staci Rezendes. “Not only does it help you on your resume but throughout your life because you have to plan for your financial needs as well.”\nThe National Financial Plan Competition relies on Corporate Sponsorship and individual sponsorship from its members. These members are very interested in helping students in financial programs have a real world experience – the financial plan being a core product for a client. The competition also provides opportunities for students to network and gain insight from financial services professionals.\nIn 2016, the semi-finalists will be presenting their plans via webinar to the IARFC Board of Directors on March 3rd. Final judging will be held in Charlotte, NC on April 20th & 21th in front of experienced advisors. Deadline for Plan Submission by students is December 15, 2015.\nRegistration is now open and the IARFC is accepting entries from individuals or two person teams.
