Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The Abbott government has accused big business of peddling propaganda against proposed changes to competition law and says Labor has fallen for it.\nAs the rift widened between the Coalition and its traditional ally, the Business Council of Australia, Small Business Minister Bruce Billson hit back at a campaign against cabinet approving the introduction of an effects test in the Competition and Consumer Act to ban the misuse of market power that has the effect of Â­substantially lessening competition.\nMr Billson has the backing of radio announcer Alan Jones - a key influence on Coalition policy and, while interviewing Mr Billson, called BCA president Catherine Livingstone a \"silly woman\".\nMr Billson said afterwards he did not condone Mr Jones' comments and that he held Ms Livingstone in high regard.\nChris Bowen claims Treasurer Joe Hockey was getting rolled on economic policy. Jessica Hromas He condemned Labor for lining up with the BCA.\n\"I cannot possibly imagine why, other than they have drunk the Kool-Aid that the Business Council of Australia are putting around,\" he told Mr Jones on Tuesday morning.\n\"I have no issue with the Business Council of Australia representing 100 of the biggest businesses in the economy, running their agenda.\n\"There is nothing wrong with that, they are perfectly entitled to run their own case in the interests of their own members.\n \"But what is best for the economy, and for your listeners, and for consumers, and our future prosperity, is to enable efficient businesses, big and small, to have a chance to thrive and prosper in our economy.\"\nThe new test, as recommended by the Harper Review into competition, would set a much lower threshold than the current test, which requires proof of an anti-competitive purpose or intent.\nJoe Hockey 'getting rolled' Proving such a purpose has been a key stumbling block that has led to practically no successful prosecutions under the law.\nThe effects test would change section 46 of the Competition Act so it only had to be shown that the effect, not the purpose of a decision, would be to eliminate competition.\nThe test was to be discusses at a meeting of cabinet in Adelaide on Tuesday. It was unclear whether it was on the official schedule or listed as \"other business\".\nIn a realignment of previous loyalties, Labor supports the BCA, saying the effects test would lead to higher process for consumers.\n\"Families are already facing huge cost-of-living pressures as a result of this government's budget cuts and Tony Abbott is set to announce an economic policy that will see Australians pay even higher prices at the checkout,\" said shadow treasurer Chris Bowen.\nMr Bowen said Treasurer Joe Hockey was getting rolled on economic policy.\n\"This is a policy which is bad for Australian families and business. It will kill competition, not create competition. It will kill enterprise,\" he said.\n\"It will mean board rooms around the country have to second guess the decisions they make, thinking they may end up in court if they make the wrong one. We want an economy in Australia where business is fighting for every last customer.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-04T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:08:24.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
