Economists had forecast a 0.2 percent gain in July.\nThe TIPS market briefly found footing as traders had second thoughts on the weakness of the latest CPI readings, which were due largely to the biggest drop in air fares since 1995.\nTIPS' sell-off resumed, however, as U.S. energy futures slumped on a surprise increase in domestic crude inventory, stoking concerns of oversupply. Oil futures had slumped more than 4 percent to $40.75 a barrel by midday.\nThe yield premium or inflation breakeven rate on benchmark 10-year Treasuries note over 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities shrank 4 basis points to 1.56 percent, according to Tradeweb.\nShorter-dated TIPS breakeven rate slipped below 1 percent before stabilizing.
