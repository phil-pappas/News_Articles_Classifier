To address this problem, African countries are planning to set up the AGCE as a vehicle to ensure the development of skilled personnel and the promotion of sustainable use of geothermal expertise in the continent. \nThe two-day workshop will assess a feasibility study, which catalogues the region's needs for geothermal development, drafts the AGCE's vision and evaluates its long-term sustainability. The meeting, organized by the United Nation Environment Programme's (UNEP) African Rift Geothermal Development Facility (ARGeo) brings together country representatives, African governments, development partners, donors, civil society, private developers, technical institutions and academia. \nAGCE is expected to be established in Kenya, which is the main hub for geothermal technology on the continent, with a natural laboratory and a major geothermal agency ? the Geothermal Development Company. \nAbout UNEP-ARGeo \nThe African Rift Geothermal Development Facility (ARGeo) Project is funded by the Global Environment Facility and implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). ARGeo was officially launched in November 2010, at the opening session of the Third African Rift Geothermal Conference (ARGeo-C3) in Djibouti. \nIt aims at supporting the development of the large, untapped geothermal resource potential in the Eastern Africa region with the main objective of reducing the risks associated with the resource's exploration. ARGeo also aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the adoption of geothermal energy in the region. ARGeo will also help demonstrate that the resource is reliable, cost effective and indigenous as compared to other sources of power in the Eastern Africa region. The utilization of the resource in agriculture and industry will also be promoted. \nFor more information, please contact unepnewsdesk@unep.org Africa \nThe next three years are crucial in the global fight to eradicate the last 1% of polio cases and contain the virus … see more » Copyright © 2015 United Nations Environment Program.
