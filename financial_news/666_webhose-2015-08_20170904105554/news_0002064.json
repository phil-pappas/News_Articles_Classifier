But the price turned out to be negligible — less than half a cent per square metre. The authorities were called in, and they accepted, thinking they’d be arrested if they refused.”\nNow the villagers have lodged a claim under new laws that are similar to native title legislation in Australia, an action understood to be politically unlikely to succeed, but aimed at drawing attention to their plight.\nTwo existing open-cut coals mines near Maruwai have already taken their toll.

When they don’t, we’ll fight to the end,” Suwanto told The Jakarta Globe .\n“It’s not as though people want to live in the bush in the ways they have for millennia,” Ms Denton said. “They appreciate roads and jobs that come with mining. But they’re not getting good prices for the land.”\nMaruwai village head Suwanto says his people have got a raw deal out of mining. Source: NewsComAu\nFriends of the Earth Indonesia (WALHI) executive director Aries Rompas told news.com.au the villagers were unable to take up jobs with BHP because of minimum education requirements, with recruiters asking for a high school certificate — which “very few” of the Dayaks had.\nWALHI is helping with the villagers’ legal case by mapping the area of land they claim as their “traditional territories” under a new Central Kalimantan government customary land rights scheme.\nThe IndoMet project has also fired up environmental activists, who claim it threatens biodiversity in the Heart of Borneo region, which the Asian Development Bank has called “the lungs of the earth”.\nWhile the region does not have protected status, the nations that share it — Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia — have pledged to safeguard it from deforestation and degradation from industrial agriculture, logging and mining.\nThe London Mining Network, a regular visitor to BHP’s annual general meetings, recently delivered a petition of 9000 signatures calling on the company to “withdraw from IndoMet immediately and seek permanent protection for the area”, labelling the project a “disaster in the making”.\n“In a world where coal supply is outstripping demand, there is simply no justification for developing the IndoMet project,” said Global Justice Now campaigner Alex Scrivener.\nProtestors target BHP\nThe IndoMet project, a joint venture with Indonesian mining company Adaro Energy, could eventually produce five million tonnes of coal a year.\nBut some commentators have questioned whether the company intends to push on with the project, reasoning that it may be hanging onto its leases simply to avoid the PR fallout of a less responsible operator taking over.\nA BHP spokeswoman said the company had approached the project “in a cautious manner” while adhering to “world class environmental and governance standards and practices”, and had engaged an experienced Indonesian contract miner, PAMA, to operate the Haju mine.\n“We have maintained respectful and committed engagement with local communities,” the spokeswoman said.\n“IndoMet’s arrangements with local villagers relating to land for the project were finalised more than nine years ago. These processes were at all times undertaken in accordance with legal and ethical business practices.”\nShe added that ”goodwill” payments made to the villagers were based on government guidelines, with land acquisition “undertaken transparently and based on consensus decision making” by landowners.\nCoal trucks line up at the Marunda Graha Mineral mine near Maruwai.
