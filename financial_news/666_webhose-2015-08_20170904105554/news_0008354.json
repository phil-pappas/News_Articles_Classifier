By Bloomberg News Comments Email Print Ã— Bloomberg News A chart prepared by the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York displays the transactions made by the Park Avenue Bank and Charles Antonucci. \nThe first person convicted of trying to defraud the federal bailout program started amid the financial crisis was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for lying to regulators and embezzling bank funds.Former Park Avenue Bank president Charles Antonucci, 64, admitted that he lied to get more than $11 million for the bank through the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, according to prosecutors. The program was passed by Congress in 2008 to prop up threatened banks.Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Tehrani said Mr. Antonucci cooperated with prosecutors after pleading guilty and provided \"substantial and lengthy assistance\" to the government. He said Mr. Antonucci's aid concerning a federal probe of unidentified entities is \"ongoing.\"U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald compared Mr. Antonucci to a bank robber, calculating the sum of his crimes at $54 million.\"Even though he's cooperating, he committed enormous crimes,\" the judge said. \"It isn't enough to say, 'I've been caught, I'll cooperate and all is right with the world' and just say 'I'll go home.' The harm here was $54 million. He literally robbed a bank. Bank robbers just don't leave the courtroom.\"She said she imposed a term of a year and a day on a co-defendant who was also cooperating, Matthew Morris, a former bank vice president whom she viewed as less culpable than Mr. Antonucci. No explanation \nBefore sentence was imposed, Mr. Antonucci apologized for his crimes and asked for leniency saying, \"I have a debt to pay and want to do everything I can to overcome that debt in the future.\"Judge Buchwald replied that a message needed to be sent to those who contemplated committing similar crimes.\"The fact is that Mr. Antonucci committed a number of very serious crimes over a lengthy period of time, when he was a fully formed adult and at a time when he had the capacity to earn a good living lawfully,\" she said. \"Even today, I've not heard an excuse or an explanation for this serious conduct. The only one that comes to mind is greed.\"Mr. Antonucci was ordered to surrender to federal prison authorities on Nov. 2 and directed to forfeit $11.2 million and pay a fine of $54 million. Bribery, embezzlement \nHe pleaded guilty in October 2010 to charges including fraud, bribery, embezzlement and conspiracy. He admitted he took bribes, embezzled money and also participated in a scheme to defraud Oklahoma insurance regulators in the $37.5 million sale of an insurer that was later forced into receivership. The bank failed in March 2010.He was also accused of misleading state and federal banking authorities about the source of $6.5 million he claimed to have invested in the bank out of his own pocket. The money actually came from the bank and had been loaned to Antonucci-controlled companies, which then transferred the funds back to him, the U.S. said.Park Avenue Bank, which had branches in Manhattan and Brooklyn, primarily made loans for small-business clients and had about $500 million on deposit and about $520 million in assets at the end of 2009, according to the U.S.New York banking authorities seized the bank's offices and assets on March 12, 2010, citing ineffective management and a lack of capital. Three days later, Mr. Antonucci was arrested by the U.S. for criminal conduct that prosecutors said contributed to the bank's demise.Mr. Antonucci served as the bank's president and chief executive officer from June 2004 to October 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:24:25.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
