Marco Del Grande Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Apple is coming to the Australian bond market. The tech giant will hold investor calls tomorrow with bond fund managers ahead of a potential maiden Australian dollar bond issue.\nThe investor call is aimed at introducing the Apple credit to investors but it's hardly needed for the world's largest company whose products are, in many cases, more appendages than accessories.\nIts balance sheet is well known too. Apple has a market capitalisation of $US660 billion and the largest cash pile ever assembled at $US 200 billion . Alone, that spare dough is double the size of Australia's largest company Commonwealth Bank at $US100 billion.\nThat a company so flush with cash needs to raise debt at all is a quirk. It's a consequence of the fact Apple's cash resides in offshore jurisdictions that can't be repatriated without an enormous tax bill. As shareholders have pressured the company to return excess funds, Apple has responded by borrowing against the cash in the bond market, a process that began in April 2013 with a $US 17 billion bond issue.\nOver time the company is expected to issue more debt to return money to shareholders but maintain a net cash balance of $100 billion.\nBut why would Apple consider issuing bonds in Australia?\nSome suggest the potential deal is a sign that the brains at Cupertino (or Reno, Nevada rather where the treasury is based) have formed a bearish view on the currency that they can borrow at one level and pay back at a lower one.\nPeripheral funding As much as we'd like to write that, it's highly unlikely to be the case. Apple's motive to sell Australian dollar debt is to spread growing funding task across more markets allowing it to fine tune is funding costs and reduce pressures building up its core funding markets. Its a view that the Australian bond market is deep enough to offer it a peripheral source of funding.\nSince Apple first sold a record $US17 billion in bonds in 2013, it has gradually expanded its borrowing programme beyond US dollars to issue debt in a range of currencies including Euros, Swiss Francs and Yen. The company most likely uses derivatives to hedge the proceeds against currency moves.\nAustralia's corporate bond market may not be one of the biggest but it's proving to be a stable and competitive source of funding for international borrowers. Apple would no doubt have been encouraged by the recent $US700 million raising from global brewer SABMiller.\nIt should also be noted that the Australian market offers one structural advantage to overseas borrowers – a result of the big banks' endless requirement for offshore funding.\nAustralia's big banks still raise billions of dollars in overseas markets to meet a funding gap that arises because their loan books are larger than their deposits.\nSince banks must hedge all their foreign currency proceeds into Australian dollars (if they issued funds unhedged it would create meaningful systemic risk) they create a demand for the hedging contracts, affording an opportunity to borrowers prepared to take the other side of the trade.\nWhat this means is an Australian bank must pay an additional 0.25 percentage points in hedging costs to raise funds in US dollars – but a borrower can save that amount by issuing debt in Australian dollars.\nThe consequence is what we call the Kangaroo bond market; debt sold by foreign entities into the Aussie market, which accounts for a quarter of total Australian dollar bond issuance.\nThe bond issue may however have some signals.\nApple has proved somewhat of a bellwether for the state of the debt markets by virtue of its impeccable timing. Its first ever bond issue was sold at the absolute peak of the bond market just a few weeks before the \"taper tantrum\" allowing them to raise funds at remarkably low rate of 2.15 per cent. That led some to believe the company had special powers beyond making world beating products.\nIts no secret too that Apple has been one of the largest investors in Australia's banks through their short-term commercial paper programs.\nApple also bought Australian dollar assets along with central banks and sovereign wealth funds in search of high yields available from a AAA rated market back in 2012.\nAny changes in their cash holdings would offer more of a clue on its opinion on the currency than their debt-raising plans. The broader significance of Apple's move is that more \"global champions\" are comfortable that the Australian corporate bond market can offer them competitive funding to compliment the larger markets.\nThat's good news for fixed-income fund managers desperate to spread their risk beyond the big banks. A typical Australian dollar bond portfolio manager can now own credits such as global brewer SABMiller, Volkswagen, Toyota, and BP, with the prospect of Apple around the corner.\nWe got excited in October 2012 when BHP Billiton chose to return to the Australian bond market after a 10-year hiatus now the prospect of the world's biggest and best company following suit should kill off the market's complex for once and for all.", "external_links": ["http://www.afrsmartinvestor.com.au/p/national/tech_giants_hoard_reserves_in_HN1wttYNBbrCQUIv3vLxoN", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/big-four-banks-hope-to-sate-us-tech-giants-appetite-for-bonds-20150607-ghijqo.html", "https://twitter.com/johnnyshap", "http://www.afrsmartinvestor.com.au/p/markets/capital/big_australian_boosts_local_bond_Enm4qnpCoPR4jZKWuqOBwL"], "published": "2015-08-17T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:08:10.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
