Qantas's biggest shareholders believed he and his recovery plan should be given a chance, however.\nAlan Joyce's transformation programme is not complete. Photo: Quinn Rooney\nTo get costs down and profits up, Joyce cut job numbers, struck tough enterprise bargains with employees including its pilots, culled old planes from Qantas's fleet and rationalised routes that Qantas itself flies, at the same time increasing overall connections with airline alliances, notably with Emirates.\nThe benefits are now flowing. The restructuring programme realised $894 million of benefits in the latest year, up from $204 million.\nJoyce had some help from outside developments. Lower fuel prices, a lower depreciation charge following a writedown of the book value of the Qantas fleet and the removal of the carbon tax built on the restructuring savings and pushed the total turnaround to $1.6 billion.\nQantas booked a $540 million underlying earnings before interest and tax improvement for Qantas domestic. Photo: Daniel Munoz\nThere's no denying the strength and breadth of Qantas's recovery, however.\nQantas booked a $540 million underlying earnings before interest and tax improvement for Qantas domestic, a $346 million improvement in underlying domestic earnings before interest and tax for Jetstar, and a $746 underlying improvement in Qantas International's earnings before interest and tax.\nThe domestic and international profit combined was the best Qantas has posted since the 2008 financial year, and all of the airline's main businesses produced returns that beat their cost of capital.\nThat is a key measure, because businesses that don't cover the cost of capital are actually destroying value instead of creating it.\nAnd businesses that are creating wealth are businesses that are worth investing in. as well as a $505 million, 23 cent a share capital return, Qantas has announced that is upgrading its fleet by buying eight Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, to be delivered from 2017.\nInvestors who bought into Qantas when its shares were being caned are laughing all the way to the bank now. Its shares are up 57 per cent so far this year, and up 185 per cent since this time last year. The S&P/ASX 200 index is down 4.5 per cent over a year, and shares in Qantas's competitor Virgin Australia are up about 17 per cent.\nCan the Qantas recovery continue? Probably. It's already well underway, but Joyce's transformation programme is not complete.\nThe group says it isn't giving earnings guidance, however because of uncertainty in global economic conditions, fuel prices and foreign-exchange rates.\nThat's a fair call, I think. There are always big variables capable of affecting airline profits, and right now they are more prone to variation that normal.\nThere's no doubt however that Qantas is inherently much more capable now of not only surviving in one of the toughest industries out there, but thriving.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:23:31.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
