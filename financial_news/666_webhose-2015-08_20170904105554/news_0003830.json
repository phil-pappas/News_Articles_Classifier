I think it was more frustration and disgust, to be honest, that we found that monies that we believed were allocated to go to people who need assistance was not coming to those who needed it.\"\nFoundation House, a rehabilitation facility in Sydney, has been operating since 2000 and is funded in partnership with the building industry through a union charity known as the Construction Industry Drug & Alcohol Foundation Treatment Centre.\nThe charity was funded with a clause in workplace agreements that requires companies to pay a mandatory levy, which started at $1 a week for each employee and is now up to $3 a week.\nThe clause dealing with the drug and alcohol levy was changed to include payment for safety work undertaken by the union.\n ​The allegations that the CFMEU used the clause within the agreements to raise up to $1 million for union activities was reported by The Australian Financial Review in 2012 .\nPrior to this, high-profile committee members including Mr Seidler, prominent activist and widow of NSW judge Bob Bellear, Kaye ­Bellear and Bovis Lend Lease executive Colin Huntley resigned after discovering the money had been diverted to the CFMEU.\nMrs Bellear told the Commission on Monday the committee wasn't getting answers as to where the money was going.\n\"And I felt that because of my long involvement or my family's long involvement in the trade union movement, that I did not want to be involved in something that I thought was wrong,\" Mrs Bellear said.\nIn a letter Mrs Bellear wrote to Mr Huntley prior to resigning she requested her name and her late husband's name be removed as patrons of the organisation.\nDevastated by misuse of funds \"I am devastated and disgusted by the misuse of the donations to the Foundation,\" she said in the letter.\nShe wrote it was \"appalling\" that workers and employers believed that they were donating to the Foundation through EBAs when in actual fact the CFMEU was keeping at least leave half of the money.\n​Counsel assisting the Commission Sarah McNaughton SC said it was \"clear that issues of conflict of interest, transparency and accountability are important issues to explore in this context\".\n\"In addition, the circumstances in which the money was obtained by the CFMEU give rise to additional issues including potential breaches of trust and obtaining money by deception,\" Ms McNaughton said.\nCFMEU official Michael Knott, who was one the committee of management for the foundation, told the inquiry he first heard that money from the workplace agreements meant for the charity was going to other areas of the union from then CFMEU NSW secretary Andrew Ferguson.\n\"Foundation House simply received a donation from the levy regularly on a monthly basis,\" Mr Knott said.\nIn his witness statement, Mr Knott said described a $100,000 \"donation\" to Foundation House from construction company Theiss following a worker safety incident was a \"fucking kickback\".\nMr Knott said that he warned another CFMEU official, Steve Dickson, that the union should have nothing to do with it because it amounted to \"corruption\".\nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:16:23.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
