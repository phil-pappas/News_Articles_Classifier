Although the port city has little crude of its own its mercantile economy depends to a large extent on the wealth and economic activity that is created around in Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. \nThese energy superpowers create the economic activity which sustains Dubai and its large service economic which rests on the industrial port of Jebel Ali and the emirate’s position as a transport hub. When oil is trading at $100 per barrel this model works well. International companies base more of their employees in Dubai and this in turn creates demand for real estate and services such as banking and leisure. \nHowever, with oil now trading at around $50 per barrel and some forecasters warning that crude may even drop to levels much lower Dubai’s economy is once again looking extremely fragile. \nAbandoned cars in Dubai were a common sight during the crash \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned recently that Dubai was once again loading up on debt. According to the fund GREs have their net debt positions to around $93bn (£60bn) over the last year, while the emirate’s total debt is arguably unsustainable at around 102pc of gross domestic product. \nAt the same time some key drivers of Dubai’s economy are beginning to stutter. Real estate (OTC BB: REACD - news ) - a key driver for the economy and one partly linked to expat employment - is in reverse. According to JLL transactions fell by almost 70pc in the second quarter. \nOf course Dubai will also be able to fall back on the financial support of Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE. However, the fall in oil prices is now taking its toll on the entire federation. According to the IMF, the UAE’s fiscal balance will turn negative this year for the first time since 2009 with a deficit equal to 2.3pc of GDP expected. \nAlthough this isn’t calamitous and the UAE as a whole has billions of foreign currency reserves the falling oil prices is clearly a major risk . \nJust keep an eye out for abandoned supercars at the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T13:46:25.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
