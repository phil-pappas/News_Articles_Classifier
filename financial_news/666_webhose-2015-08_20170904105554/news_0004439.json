James Brickwood Forbes China Rich List 2014 ranked him at number 220 with a net worth of $US1 billion ($1.36 billion).\nDr Chau spoke very little at the unveiling of the Frank Gehry-designed wing for the University of Technology Sydney named after him in acknowledgment of the $20 million he donated for its construction.\nHis son studied at the university, where he has also given $5 million for student scholarships. His daughter, former Bob Carr staffer Winky Chow, edits his Chinese-language newspaper News Express Daily , which is circulated in Sydney and Guangzhou. His wife lives in Sydney in a mansion in Sydney's Pulpit Point.\nHis flagship company, the Kingold Group based in China, has a diverse range of interests, including hospitality, pharmaceuticals, eco-tourism and media.\n But it was his other Australian companies which made headwinds in the political arena.\nIn 2006-07 and 2007-08, just before the 2007 federal election, Kingold, HK Kingson Investment and a relative's company, Chun Yip Trading, donated about $2 million to both the Labor party and the Coalition, making him one of Australia's biggest political donors.\nJohn Howard, Bob Hawke, Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan have all been guests at Chau's expansive Conghua estate, north of Guangzhou, which includes a 6000-square-metre museum with 20,000 Chinese antiquities, a 27-hole golf course and a temple rumoured to hold the cremated remains of Buddha.\nHe kept a low profile after news of his donations broke in 2009, but in 2013-14 he donated about $900,000 to both Labor and the Coalition through Australia Kingold Investment Development Co.\nWhile little is known about Dr Chau – he gives few interviews – or what he is a doctor of, he has declared his love for Australian wine.\n\"Living in Australia [is] just like tasting the Australian wine: the more you taste it, the more you will fall in love with it,\" he told UTS during the opening of the Gehry wing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:06:43.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
