But on Wednesday, the greenback declined against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen. \n\"China's cheapening of its currency opened a messy can of worms for markets and suggested the global economy may be worse off than previously thought,\" Manimbo said. \n\"Consequently, expectations have diminished for the Fed to raise rates amid fears that slowing growth in China could reach US shores.\" \nCurrency traders are closely eyeing US data the rest of the week, especially Thursday's report on US retail sales for July. A strong report could strengthen confidence that the Fed will hike rates in 2015, perhaps as soon as September. \n2100 GMT Wednesday Tuesday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T00:58:39.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
