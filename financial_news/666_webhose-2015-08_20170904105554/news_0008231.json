Two joint lead manager gigs are up for grabs.\nAs revealed by Street Talk this week , I-MED and adviser Rothschild have been taking face-to-face pitches from leading investment banks over the past two weeks.\nI-MED, which is backed by Swedish private equity firm EQT, is seeking to raise up to $500 million through the IPO, which would value the company's equity at $1 billion. EQT, run by the high-profile Wallenberg family, is expected to retain a significant holding after the float, with the market for essential health care services booming.\nI-MED has 190 clinics and more than 220 doctors, giving the company scale in an industry ripe for consolidation.\nThe company's board boasts some heavy hitters, led by chairman Paul McClintock who is a former Medibank Private chairman and also chairs Myer Holdings.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining/south32-shenhua-in-race-for-rio-coal-20150813-giyfhu.html"], "published": "2015-08-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:12:57.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
