CBS reported on Aug. 25, 2015, the largest online male escort service Rentboy.com was raided in New York City. The chief executive of the firm along with six of his employees at Rentboy.com were arrested on Tuesday on charges that they promoted prostitution. \nJeffrey Hurant has been charged by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn of selling advertisements for high priced male prostitutes for a few hundred dollars and then charging Rentboy.com customers up to $299 a month for access these ads. There was more than $10 million taken in by this operation since 2010 according to the prosecutors. Hurant has been released on $350,000 bond after a brief appearance in court. \nHurant and his lawyer have insisted that his business was a perfectly legitimate companionship service. He says that similar escort websites elsewhere have been operating without being targeted by a federal investigation. Hurant says his firm has done good things for good people by bringing them together. Although Rentboy.com had disclaimers that set guidelines which banned offers of sex in exchange for money the feds claim this is exactly what has been going on. \nThe New York Times reports that 7 people were charged with promoting prostitution by working on the escort website Rentboy.com. The criminal complaint says on the home page of Rentboy.com there were escorts’ profiles which listed sexual services and fees. The headquarters for the firm was on 14th Street at Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. \nKelly T. Currie, acting United States attorney for New York’s Eastern District, says that as has been alleged Rentboy.com made attempts to present a veneer of legality but that it was actually an Internet brothel which made millions of dollars from promoting illegal prostitution. If this is true it appears many of the customers of such a companionship service as is also often seen with heterosexual escort services have been innocent victims of the convincing veneer of legality of the services. This of course can be very embarrassing, costly and dangerous for the victims of such an operation.
