That's why science is coming in,\" says Dennis Kyetere, the executive director of African Agricultural Technology Foundation (Aatf). \nTo rid farmers of the constant headache of dealing with the pest, the National Biosafety Authority recently asked for public comments on whether to approve genetically modified Bt maize. \nThe state agency has in its in-tray an application in which two research bodies, Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Organisation (Kalro) and Aatf, are seeking approval to commercialise the insect-resistant maize. \n\"We ask the public to participate through sending comments, concerns and/or objections to the authority in accordance with the Biosafety Act,\" reads the advert. \nThe advert further states that \"the authority will make the final decision on the application based on risk assessments, socio-economic considerations and comments received from the public.\" \nWOULD BE LIFTED \nAs the deadline for submission of comments draws closer, the controversial subject seems to be receiving government approval. \nSpeaking at the fourth biosafety conference, Deputy President William Ruto announced that the ban on genetically modified organisms would be lifted in two months. \nMr Ruto cited the need for the country to have enough food as a key reason for lifting the ban. \"The government appreciates the contribution of technology and, in so doing, we will lift the ban,\" said Mr Ruto. \n\"In a month or two, we shall be able to do that (lift the ban) and address issues of food security,\" he added. \nThe DP also urged for vigorous campaigns across the country to allay fears associated with GMOs. \"We cannot be left behind when the world is discussing matters biotechnology,\" he added. \nMr Ruto's statement comes at a time when many people are at a crossroads on whether to adopt genetic technology in agriculture or not. \nResearch on genetic technology in Kenya has been stalling since the government's blanket ban on genetically modified products in 2012 following a controversial study by French scientists that linked such products to cancer. \nFindings of the study were published in the journal Food Chemical Toxicology. \nThe findings were, however, recanted after it was established that the authors did not adhere to internationally accepted standards for research. \nFOOD INSECURITY \nBut this did not change Kenya's position on biotechnology. While the government has been hostile to genetically modified foods, its proponents think it is the best thing to have happened. \nTo scientists, embracing genetic biotechnology is the solution to the country's constant battle with food insecurity. \nTo other groups, the push to introduce GM crops is just a ploy by multinational companies to find new markets. \nMs Wanjiru Kamau from the Kenya Organic Agriculture Network says unless the gaps and questions on GM crops are addressed, the country should not lift the ban. \n\"The CS of Health should first make public the findings of the task force on the health effects of GM foods,\" she says. \nMs Kamau, who champions organic farming, believes that the solution to food insecurity does not lie in use of genetic technology. \n\"We do not agree with interference of genes, especially in foods that people consume. GM will not solve the issue of poverty and hunger and, therefore, we do not need it.\" \nShe further says that adoption of GM crops like Bt maize will have a negative impact on the country's economy. \n\"If we introduce Bt maize, we will lose exports of some crops like baby corn to the European market because it will be contaminated,\" she argues. \nVIABLE SOLUTION \nDr Iain Wright, the deputy director of the International Livestock Research Institute (Ilri) does not agree with Ms Kamau's arguments. \nTo him, as long as land is not expanding as much as the population, the only viable solution for the country is to increase its agricultural yield through genetic technology. \n\"Kenya needs to invest in science and technology to improve its agricultural capacity if it is to feed the growing population,\" he says. \nAs if buying into the Deputy President's decision to lift the ban, a section of MPs have warmed up to the idea of introducing GM crops. \nEndebess MP Robert Pukose, while on a tour of research facilities, said: \"Other countries are way ahead in adoption of GMO (genetically modified organisms) technology. We continue to lag behind because of misinformation. Lift the ban,\" he said. Kenya \nThe Ministry of Health has released a list of sweets, cakes and biscuits that it says are laced with bhang. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation. All rights reserved.
