Queensland remains tough, but showing positive signs in the past few months.\"\nMr Monro said Watpac had a total construction forward order book of almost $1.2 billion across a number of sectors, while the mining and civil business continued to deliver profit despite difficult conditions, and had recently converted several contracts.\n\"The focus for us will be more of the same in the coming year, but we do see genuine and sustainable signs of improvement and robustness emerging across the country,\" he said.\n\"There is $150 million in net cash which gives us new-found health in the balance sheet, to be able to pay debt and return equity and bid on new projects.\n\"We remain confident of our strength in contracting, and we will continue to explore opportunities in the resources sector as they come to market.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T04:58:27.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
