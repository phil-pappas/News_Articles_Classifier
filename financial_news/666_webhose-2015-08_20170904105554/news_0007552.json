Most recently BT, Britain’s fixed-line incumbent, has proposed buying a mobile operator, EE, from its parents, Deutsche Telekom and Orange. Vodafone, another British mobile operator, is understood to be talking to Liberty Global, a cable company. \nThe way to make all these mergers work, says Wolfgang Bock of the Boston Consulting Group, is to take out costs while keeping prices constant (and thus customers content). The savings can then be used to invest in improving the networks. The EU’s competition regulators have, of late, accepted this rationale, even though for a long time they had believed that strong competition, among at least four firms, would spur innovation and investment, not constrain them, while keeping prices down. Many national authorities still think that way. \nWhat has changed the climate at the EU’s headquarters in Brussels is a feeling that rampant competition has given consumers cheap prices, but has left its telecoms companies weak. This worries them at a time when powerful American firms seem to be dominating the brave new digital world. Another concern is that Europe is being slow to roll out fast mobile broadband, and the savings from mergers could pay for it to be speeded up. \nPundits are divided over whether or not the first merger, in Austria, demonstrates the merits of consolidation. For Matthew Bloxham of GSMA, it does. Mobile-broadband speeds and 4G coverage have increased since the merger, he says, while average spending per user has stayed relatively constant. Significant growth in data usage has been offset by reductions in the cost per megabyte. \nAntonios Drossos of Rewheel, a Finnish consulting firm, sees things differently. His firm analysed the prices customers paid in Austria and found some had risen by as much as 80% since the merger. “In any event,” he says, “customers should be getting more for less: the cost of mobile gigabytes has plummeted as operators get more spectrum, pay much less for network equipment and build more cells. The question is how much better a deal they would be offered now if a fourth operator were still in the market.” Austria’s national competition regulator, which opposed the deal three years ago, will be releasing a new assessment this autumn. \nMore important, however, will be the view taken on the various proposed mergers by the EU’s new competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager. In office since November, she has yet to rule on a merger between two mobile operators. When she approved the takeover of a Spanish fixed-line firm, Jazztel, by a mobile firm, Orange, she imposed heavier conditions to preserve competition than had been expected. In her public comments so far she has sounded disinclined to buy the argument that competition hinders investment. \nSo, when commission staff return from their summer break next month, industry executives will be waiting to see what she does about the proposed combinations of mobile operators in Italy, Britain and Denmark. Will she move the dial further back towards preserving competition? \nThe first case she will have to rule on is the one in Denmark, her home country. That case may not prove a reliable template for the other decisions. It would result in a greater degree of concentration than either the Italian or the British merger, giving the new firm 45% of a market in which the new third operator is tiny. And she may be wary of attracting the ire of fellow Danes by letting prices rise. She may well let the merger through, albeit laden with conditions to encourage new competitors. That will leave Europe’s policy on mobile mergers murkier than ever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:12:39.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
