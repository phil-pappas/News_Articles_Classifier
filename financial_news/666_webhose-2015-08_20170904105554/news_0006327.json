Karleen Minney by Lucille Keen The militant construction union raised \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" from hidden clauses in enterprise agreements that locked in payments for training, donations and insurance, the union royal commission has heard.\nCounsel assisting the commission Sarah McNaughton, SC, told the hearing the CFMEU gained \"significant commercial benefits\" from the clauses, which on their face seemed to involve payments to independent bodies.\nMs McNaughton said the payments, which ultimately flowed back to the union, could be a conflict of interest and possibly illegal.\n\"Indeed, the question arises as to whether the setting up of complex structures in relation to these three areas — training, contribution to a charity and income protection — was done deliberately to hide the CFMEU's involvement in and or connection with the entities or structures set up to provide these services,\" Ms McNaughton said.\nIn one case, Ms McNaughton said, a training body paid almost $800,000 last year to the Construction Employment Training Welfare Ltd, as trustee for Creative Safety Initiatives Trust.\nACT state secretary Dean Hall said money from the trust did go into the general revenue of the CFMEU, which was used for political donations to the Australian Labor Party and The Greens.\n\"I think my personal view is that workers get a better deal under a Labor government and often conservative governments have aggressive agendas against unions and union members and that drives down their wages and conditions, including safety,\" Mr Hall said.\nMr Hall admitted it was not clear in the enterprise agreement that there was a financial relationship between CSI and the CFMEU such that CFMEU benefited from training conducted by CSI.\n Mr Hall downplayed the union link saying that only 6 per cent of revenue to one of the entities came from enterprise bargaining agreements.\nHe said the union would have liked more training work \"because it would have been even more distribution to the union which we could use to the benefit of the members\".\nLast month, the Commission heard from contractors who claim they were forced into signing union enterprise agreements in fear their work on job sites would be unfairly interrupted by the CFMEU.\nConstruction company director Dennis Milin​ told the commission Mr Hall had said his company would not be able to participate in a $75 million apartment project without the union EBA.\nLast month CFMEU ACT official John Lomax was charged with one count of blackmail for allegedly pressuring building contractors to sign EBAs.\nHe is due to appear in court on Wednesday and a rally, in support of the former Canberra Raiders NRL player, is expected to be held outside.\nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:10:11.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
