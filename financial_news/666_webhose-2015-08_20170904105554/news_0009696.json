Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger Melbourne's inner city property markets could become awash with empty rental apartments according to a new report that identifies a mismatch between offshore appetite to buy off-the-plan and demand from the local occupier market.\n\"It is easier to match assets to a global pool of purchasers, where capital is able and willing to be deployed, than match those same assets with occupiers in the local rental market,\" wrote Jonathan Mayes, an analyst at Charter Keck Cramer.\n\"Developers can clear their stock because of the appetite from international purchasers, but in the rental market there is not that same capacity. It's not as easy,\" Mayes said.\nThe consequence of this could be softening rents and a rise in the number of empty apartments, but is unlikely to have a major impact on off-the-plan pricing so long as offshore demand remains strong.\nThe report noted that offshore buyers are willing to pay a premium for Australian real estate with prices and values determined by \"different means\" than local investors and with \"current prices not dictated by rational yields\".\n\"Australian housing represents a store of wealth that is underpinned by confidence in domestic institutions (property rights, freehold title and transparent markets, among others) which foreign purchasers may pay a relative premium for, but which domestic participants expect and therefore do not attribute any additional value towards,\" said Mayes.\nKim Hawtrey, a director at research firm BIS Shrapnel, said the rental market was being oversupplied broadly in Australia and to an acute degree in Melbourne with the likely result being \"looming softness in the market\".\n\"There won't be a slump or a bloodbath because population growth, while slowing, is still strong and the Victorian economy still reasonably good.\n \"But I would not be investing in an apartment in Melbourne. I'd be looking at detached houses or medium density townhouses. There's very much a need for more detached houses.\n\"Sydney is the only apartment market you can feel reasonably safe about investing in,\" Hawtrey said.\nFigures compiled by SQM Research show vacancy rates currently above 4 per cent in the Melbourne CBD, Docklands and Southbank, double those of Sydney, with much higher levels of stock currently on the market.\nWhile gross yields on Melbourne apartments look relatively attractive at between 5 and 6.5 per cent, net yields would be under 3 per cent when interest and costs are factored in.\nDomain Group economist Andrew Wilson said offshore investors, many of whom did not require financing, were crowding local investors out of the market.\n\"For offshore buyers, it's not question of a property providing a yield. For them the yield is built into the premium they get on their capital from the lower dollar and the lower cost of capital. Some won't even engage with the rental market.\"\n\"It's good news for developers, because it offsets the perception of oversupply. But the Melbourne market certainly is oversupplied from a local perspective.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-08-28T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:12:49.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
