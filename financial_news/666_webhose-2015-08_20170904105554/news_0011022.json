She has still proved she can be influential. Murray Ware by Claire Stewart Before Georgie Somerset accepts a midweek meeting invite in Brisbane, or ponders attending an evening function to upgrade her skills, she weighs the benefits of attending against the 7.5-hour round trip to get there.\nWhile long-distance travel is an accepted part of life outside urban areas, it adds a layer of complexity to building leadership and influence, particularly if that influence is to be wielded among decision makers in the city.\nSomerset says Australia's urbanites need to hear more of the the regional perspective, particularly as they're usually the ones developing the policy that affects regional Australia. But that requires more boots on the ground and more face-to-face conversations.\n\"You have to make an effort to engage regional Australians, because you're not as likely to encounter them incidentally if you're not seeing them at functions or at restaurants or meetings,\" she says.\n\"Women know that it's difficult to be 'incidentally noticed', and even more so for regional leaders … where you need to be in the [physical] space when people are thinking, 'Who would I like on this board? Who do I want on this committee, or to be involved in this focus group?'\"\nLynise Conaghan, who has spent years lobbying for change in access to early childhood resources and teacher numbers for small schools (think 25 children or fewer across eight year groups), is even more isolated than Georgie Somerset.\nOut where Conaghan lives, on the inland road halfway between Rockhampton and Mackay in Queensland, there's no mobile reception and the internet is so slow it's almost unusable.\nLiving in a black spot Both women accept that it's the nature of the beast to be cut off from the blow-by-blow goings-on of peers doing similar jobs or in similar leadership positions as themselves. Teleconferencing and social media engagement helps, to an extent.\nSomerset is selective about what to get involved in, but says technology enables her to manage an increased load. This workload includes running a successful brand in the processed beef market she built with her husband; taking on the presidency of the Queensland Rural, Regional and Remote Women's Network; her role as a board member of the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority; and involvement in various government forums, including the regional telecommunications independent review committee.\n\"I have been teleconferencing for nearly 30 years,\" she says. \"It's fantastic because it does mean you can participate without having to drive there. But at a broader level there is no substitute for being physically present and I think you have to be quite established to be able to participate remotely, effectively.\"\nConaghan, who is also part of a family-run beef feedlot operation, says being in a telecommunications black spot curtails her ability to use social media in the same way that Somerset does – \"like an office water cooler\". She says it's becoming a critical issue.\n\"To a degree, we are getting further and further behind these incredible women in urban locations because of the digital divide. What urban women are doing is amazing, but for us to access some of those amazing things is becoming more and more difficult.\"\nNothing replaces networking Just under a third of Australia's population lives in regional and remote areas. In Queensland it's higher, with nearly 40 per cent of people living outside a major city.\nPart of Conaghan's frustration is with how easily people forget that regional areas have to operate differently. NAPLAN testing may soon be moved online, which is fine for people who have internet access, she says. And a government department put out a new app the other day, she says, which looks fantastic … \"But guess what? We don't have mobile telephone services, so it's no good to us.\"\nConaghan hopes better representation by rural women on boards and reference groups with their urban peers will bridge that gap, because nothing can replace old-fashioned networking and lobbying.\n\"We got the federal funding for Building the Education Revolution. We were told we had to have an undercover area, or a library.\n\"I thought, 'That's really silly; we don't need more buildings because we hardly have any kids. What we do need is a pool so the kids can learn to swim, and qualify for regional competitions which they can't otherwise do.'\"\nIt's easy to imagine the bureaucratic battle, but Conaghan won. Her part of the world might not have a local store, or mail that's delivered more than twice a week, but it now has a tiny school with a brand new 25-metre pool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:04:28.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
