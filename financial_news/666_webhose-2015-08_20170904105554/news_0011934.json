The Russians are difficult, and for their part the Ukrainians stick to their ground too.\" \nThe EU's condemnation on Tuesday of a jail sentence handed down by a Russian court to Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov for \"terrorism\" added to the bad blood ahead of the meetings. \n- Gas war? - \nThe EU wants at all costs to avoid a \"gas war\" with Russia as winter looms, with any stand-off threatening supplies to Europe, around half of which pass through Ukraine. \nExperts say a deal is needed by October to avoid shortages. \nMaros Sefcovic, the EU's Vice President in charge of Energy Union, will on the sidelines of a western Balkans summit in Vienna on Thursday relaunch talks with the Ukrainian side, which has not been supplied by Russian giant Gazprom for several months. \nA meeting with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak is also scheduled for the start of September. \nThe trade talks are less urgent but cover highly sensitive ground, as the trade deal was originally the key part of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement that then-president Viktor Yanukovych backed out of signing in November 2013. \nThat led to the pro-EU Maidan movement which toppled him, and which was followed by Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the fighting in eastern Ukraine which has claimed 6,800 lives. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem is due to bring the relevant parties in the trade talks together in Brussels on September 7. \n\"But trade negotiations are difficult, the Russians have taken a stand on principle, and we have never been able to go into the details and negotiate on concrete matters,\" Vimont said. \nSome Kiev politicians accuse Moscow of planning a new rebel offensive that could rattle the Ukrainian leadership enough to reverse its plans to implement the landmark trade treaty with the European Union at the start of next year. \nRussia has already threatened to expand its list of banned Ukrainian food imports should the agreement go into effect. \nYet Poroshenko has said that he and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have agreed by telephone that the \"free trade zone should be strengthened as of January 1.\" \nThe sanctions that the EU imposed after Crimea were renewed in July, and still poison relations with Moscow. \nPutin -- who persistently denies any Kremlin involvement in the crisis and calls Russian soldiers discovered in the war zone \"volunteers\" -- was notably omitted from the round of meetings between Poroshenko, Hollande and Merkel, despite having been instrumental in arranging the Minsk ceasefire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T16:48:22.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
