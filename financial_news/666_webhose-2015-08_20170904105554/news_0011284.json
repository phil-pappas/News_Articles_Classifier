Solitaire Jester, which is available for the Samsung Gear VR, the South Korean company's virtual reality headset, allows the user to play the card game in a virtual fireplace-lit study. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has been downloaded 4,000 times, according to Recode. \nMr Palm said the company is sitting on seven prototype games and plans to release a fishing-themed game in early 2016. \nThe Stockholm-based company said it will use the funding to produce more games at a faster rate and to continue hiring \"from within Sweden's rich games development talent pool\". \nResolution Games claims this is the largest ever funding round raised by a VR games developer. \nThere is an increasing amount of investment activity in the area. Facebook acquired the virtual reality headset maker Oculus last year for $2bn and has made a series of smaller purchases since. \nIn October, Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) led a $542m funding round for Magic Leap, the glasses that project an image onto the user's eyes, and six months later the virtual reality app store Wear VR raised $1.5m. \nIn the last month, Tencent (HKSE: 0700-OL.HK - news ) led a $10m investment for AltspaceVR, which creates a virtual social environment, and Avegant, the maker of the Glyph headset , raised $24m in its second funding round. \n\"VR is the next big gaming platform,\" said Joe Kraus, general partner at Google Ventures. \"The pace of development in VR will be very high over the next five years , with mobile VR at the forefront because anyone with a smartphone has the core of a VR experience already in their pocket. \n\"Tommy and his team have a proven track record of game development and successful entrepreneurship, and we’re excited about what Resolution Games is going to do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:40:07.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
