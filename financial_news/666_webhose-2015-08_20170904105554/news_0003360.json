Erin Jonasson by Jeremy Chunn Some mysteries in life must be challenged. Babies know they have to walk, and teenagers are compelled to kiss each other. Both experiments end in failure the first few times, but they eventually get the hang of it.\nInvestors who hand over their tax affairs to someone else are pulling a big black hood over their heads. To deflect this annual task is to remain in the dark, fearful of things that go bump in the night.\nIt pays to understand tax. The good news is the government is making it easier.\nIt's the Australian tax return's 100th birthday this year, but today's \"contemporary online experience\" puts us light years ahead of the paperwork of 1915, says Australian Taxation Office assistant commissioner small business and individuals Graham Whyte.\nDoing your own tax may be a yawn, but there's an upside. The ATO's myTax portal is in its second year and lodgements have doubled, he says. Whereas the ATO's e-Tax portal requires software to be downloaded, myTax can be used on any device. \"I've even had a few people come up to me and say they've lodged their tax on their smartphone,\" Whyte says.\nHere are some DIY tax basics, for those who can't face the task.\nCapital gains tax Profit derived from asset sales is what investing is all about, but determining the purchase price to use for a capital gains tax event is not always straightforward, say Taxpayers Australia tax business services manager Lisa Greig and tax technical services manager Andy Nguyen.\n Holdings of listed companies are often accrued over time, and a sale will need to be matched to an entry price. The entry price will vary for each parcel, and the taxpayer can tune a year's capital gains tax net position by picking which entry price to match to a sale. Do not use the average price for the holding. \"You have to be able to identify which parcel you've sold,\" says Nguyen.\nRecord-keeping is made simple if emailed broker orders can be searched by ticker code. If older holdings require delving into a paper trail, so be it.\nGreig says the entry parcel might be chosen to deliver the least capital gain or the highest capital gain, if there is a loss against which to offset it. \"It's all a matter of planning.\" The ATO's general rule, however, is first in first out.\nA capital gains tax net loss from the previous year will be carried forward automatically to the next, but keep a hard copy so you can check it against next year's pre-fill.\nCorporate activity such as share splits or returns of capital can affect the underlying cost base of a holding. \"What you paid [for a share] can change depending on if that share's split,\" Greig says. \"The everyday investor needs to know a little bit more.\"\nLinks to explanations are imbedded in the online return. \"If you're basically a smart person you should be able to follow what you need to do.\"\nIt's a bit hopeful to expect online returns will one day pre-fill capital gains tax events, but Whyte says the Tax Office can sometimes provide an indicator to people that there has been a disposal. \"A bit of a nudge, if you like.\"\nManaged funds This is the first year data from managed investment funds will be pre-filled at the labels, says Whyte at the ATO, which will relieve the pain of knowing how to handle the various types of income managed funds generate. \"We've been working very closely with our third-party data providers,\" he says. The sooner data arrives at the ATO, the less work investors need to do in their returns.\nManaged funds pass all the tax stuff on to their investor clients. Once a fund has totalled its investment income, foreign income and tax credits for the year it divides them among unitholders. It's only really at the end of the tax year that a fund knows what it's received during the year, says HLB Mann Judd Sydney partner tax consulting Peter Bembrick, and the annual tax summary will set out all the tax components. \"It's pretty easy to follow the instructions the fund sends you.\"\nWhere income from a managed fund is declared in the wrong spot, the ATO may issue a \"please explain\" letter. Income from a managed fund may need to be declared as trust income, says Greig at Taxpayers Australia.\nPut the robots to work The deadline for individual returns is October 31, but it's worth waiting until about early September to do your return if you want pre-fill to do as much work as possible. Fund managers will not have sent individuals' data to the ATO immediately on July 1, and data on dividends is delivered in dribs and drabs. Unless you have kept a spreadsheet on franked and unfranked distributions throughout the year, you might want to wait for the robots to do that work for you.\n\"You don't want to accidentally miss something that comes in the day after you lodge your return,\" Greig says, \"and when the ATO checks your return they find [you've left out investment income].\"\nBy late August or early September you'll get most of that information pre-filled. If you're paying a tax accountant, be aware he or she will push the same \"pre-fill\" button as someone at home on a laptop.\nReinvestment plans Dividend reinvestment plans, where income is received as shares, can look like set-and-forget compounding machines but they are an annual tax event. \"Regardless of whether you get cash or shares, you are still taxable on the dividend,\" says Bembrick at HLB Mann Judd. \"The tax treatment is no different to if you were receiving the cash dividend.\"\nDividend reinvestment plans can be a bit of pain when it comes to recording the cost base. Say you've held a stock for 10 years with new shares dribbling in every reporting season, if you sell the lot in one go you may have to plug 20 or so transactions into your tax return, matching the one sale to the multiple buys. \"That's a lot of record-keeping and a lot of calculation when you sell,\" he says.\nTime to reflect Preparing your own tax return isn't exactly exciting, but neither is painting a room. If it takes a friend to guide you through it then that's a start. Next year, you might go it alone. But remember that this year's tax affects next year's tax, says H&R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman. \"You need to keep copies of what you've submitted this year so you've got something to work off when you start again next year.\"\nMucking through your own annual return is a chance to reflect on strategy and question beliefs. Property investors who don't do their own tax returns may be better off if they did ( Smart Investor' s conclusion, not Chapman's) because the all-too-popular negative gearing strategy obviously provides those on higher tax brackets a better outcome than lower-income earners.\n\"When you combine that [the fact that deductions flow in proportion to the tax bracket] with all the additional costs of owning the property, all of a sudden it's not as lucrative as you might have thought,\" Chapman says.\nDIY or not? If investors are a bit complacent, or lazy, about wrestling with taxation once a year, companies such as H&R Block, and many thousands of accountants, are happy to do the job for a fee. If the effort of doing your own tax pays off as drip-feed education about an important cost drag on returns, which is what tax is, it's hard to quantify the cost of having someone else do it for you. But remember: when you claim a deduction for a tax return completed by someone else, you still end up having paid the gross cost less your marginal rate.\nDo not kid yourself that it's been free.\nPwC private clients partner Paul Brassil sees the dark side of the DIY tax habit. \"I liken it to feeling well and never going to the doctor,\" he says. \"Even if you are well, how are you even going to know?\" It's a good question, and may be better pitched to a philosopher. His point is that a tax expert may discover missed opportunity in a seemingly vanilla scenario, or create a little complexity to benefit the client's net position. \"If your tax affairs are relatively simple, maybe that's not so good.\" he says.\nAt Taxpayers Australia, Greig and Nguyen agree expert advice should be sought for complex affairs.\nIf you already do your own return, and have read this far, good for you. You're probably better off for cleaning your own house and ironing your own shirts.\n\"There are people who self-prepare, there always have been,\" says Chapman at H&R Block. \"But a lot of people just take the mindset that no matter how easy the Tax Office makes this for me I'd rather somebody else did it.\"\nThe folk at H&R Block must surely enjoy doing other people's tax, right? \"Absolutely!\" he says.\nWhether or not the annual burden of the tax return will be removed through complete automation, the ATO can't say. \"That's really a policy question,\" says Whyte, who does his own annual return. \"By the first week of August virtually my whole return is pre-filled,\" he says, including salary, investment income and interest income. \"All I need to do is put in the few expenses I have.\"\nIt takes him about five minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T11:00:05.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
