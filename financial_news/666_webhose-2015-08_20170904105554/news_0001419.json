The results compared with a net loss of $26 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier.\nUninsured and charity admissions fell more than 31 percent in six states that expanded their Medicaid programs, Tenet said.\nHospitals are experiencing a rise in patient visits due to the expansion of insurance to more Americans under the Affordable Care Act.\nTenet said its overall adjusted patient admissions, which include both inpatient and outpatient figures, increased 2.3 percent from a year ago at facilities operated for at least one year.\nNet operating revenue, after provision for doubtful accounts, rose 11 percent to $4.49 billion in the second quarter.
