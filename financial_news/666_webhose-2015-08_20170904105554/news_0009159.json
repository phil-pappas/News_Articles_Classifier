The BSE FMCG index was the top performer with 3.1% gains week-on-week.\nThe monsoons have fared better than expectations and are likely to boost demand in rural markets for FMCG goods, thereby improving the prospects for the sector in the near term, analysts said. The trend was witnessed in June quarter corporate earnings. Three — Godrej Consumer, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur India — out of four major FMCG companies announced results that met Street expectations. Godrej Consumer touched new highs during the week.\nPharma shares too ended the week in the green. The healthcare index on the BSE rose 1.25%.

Despite the oil price deregulation, the margins for oil marketing companies (OMCs) have not improved significantly.\nLondon-based HSBC said, “The state refiners have earned better margins only in the period when international oil prices were trending down. However, once the prices started to go up, the margins cameunder pressure. Hence one cannot assume that oil companies will earn a superior margin post diesel deregulation.”\nTata Steel, Bharti Airtel and ONGC were the biggest weekly losers as shares fell by 6.7%, 3.6% and 3.5% respectively.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 12:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:17:08.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
