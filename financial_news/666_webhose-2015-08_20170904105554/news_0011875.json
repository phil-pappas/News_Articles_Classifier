Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority requires drone operators to have an \"operator's certificate\", and huge demand for such certificates has seen wait times blow out to as much as 10 months.\nMr Lilleyman also warned that drones would only be as good as the humans behind them.\n\"Anyone can buy a drone and they're easy to operate, but the trick is having the best minds working out what you do with them. We're constantly thinking outside the box to imagine how they can be integrated into our mining operations to make complex tasks safer, quicker and cheaper as well as working with regulators to meet their requirements,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:23:27.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
