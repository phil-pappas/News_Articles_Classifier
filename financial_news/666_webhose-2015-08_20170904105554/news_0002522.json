It also assigned Access Bank a Counterparty Risk Assessment (CRA) of Ba3 (cr)/Not Prime(cr). \nThe ratings are underpinned by a b2 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) which measure an issuer’s standalone financial strength. According to the agency, “Access Bank's b2 standalone profile reflects (1) solid asset quality metrics, underpinned by tangible improvements in loan underwriting standards and risk management in recent years; (2) robust capital and liquidity buffers, supported by sustainable internal capital generation; and (3) a stable liability structure predominantly funded with deposits.” \nThe agency further stated that these strengths are balanced against Nigeria's challenging operating environment, which takes into account the strong growth potential of the system and institutional and structural weaknesses,as well as the concentration risks on the Bank's books, including to the oil and gas industry. However, the agency noted that Access Bank is very well positioned to weather the macroeconomic challenges and they expect its standalone credit profile to remain resilient. \nCommenting on this news, the Managing Director of Access Bank Ghana, Mr Dolapo Ogundimu noted: \n“The Bank’s impressive ratings from both international and domestic rating agencies continue to assure all our stakeholders, whether in Ghana or abroad, of our strong financial condition. This new rating demonstrates that the Bank’s Management has remained committed to best practice in the areas of corporate governance and risk management”. \nAccording to Moody’s, the long-term deposit and issuer ratings of Ba3reflects the Bank's Systematically Important Bank (SIB) status in Nigeria as the 5th largest bank in the industry. The Ba3 rating assigned to Access Bank is at the same level as the country’s sovereign rating, which is the highest any local bank in Nigeria can attain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T13:27:07.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
