But because of the sudden market drop, many analysts have indicated that the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates as soon as previously expected. \nTurning to the rand, Birkenstock said that although it dropped like all emerging market and commodity-based currencies, it has in fact fared better than some emerging market currencies - contrary to public opinion in South Africa. \n\"The rand was weak prior to the market drop and has weakened further due to the risk off approach which is a factor outside the South African political, economic and social environment,\" said Birkenstock. He believes that in the short term, the currency will strengthen if markets recover while if they drop further, the rand will follow. \nBirkenstock believes it is far too early to make any real assessment of the effect of the sudden market drop on global and South African inflation. \"Cheap commodity prices lower inflationary pressures, while some of that is lost in SA due to the rand's drop at the same time.\" \nIf the rand stays weak or falls further, inflation will go up as South Africa is mostly an import-driven country. Electricity price hikes and other government entity increases such as road levies and petrol tax increases will also not help local inflation, Birkenstock said. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T15:35:45.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
