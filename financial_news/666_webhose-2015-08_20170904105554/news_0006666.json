Meanwhile, Hills announced that it was moving into the online lotteries market with the purchase of a 29 per cent stake in US-focused business NeoGames. The group said that its half-year results had been dragged down by the effect of the \"point of consumption tax\" on online gambling as well as the hike in duty on fixed odds betting terminals from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. It also said its \"profit progression\" had been hit by the Machine Games Duty increase, as well as new controls on the way customers who wish to stake more than STG50 on gaming machines may bet. Meanwhile, the group said the introduction of the National Living Wage for workers over 25 is expected to cost it STG1 million to STG2 million in 2016.
