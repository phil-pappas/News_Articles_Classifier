Removal of \"entrenched union rights in relation to governance of superannuation funds\" should also be considered, the paper says.\n \"The view has tended to be ... that employees require the 'collective muscle' of trade unions for effective negotiation,\" the paper says.\n\"However, there is an equally valid concern that measures which on the face of it protect the collective muscle of workers simply serve to empower trade union officials at the expense of members' interests.\"\nAustralia could look to New Zealand, where changes in the 1990s put collective and individual bargaining on a similar footing, the paper says.\n\"Opening up trade unions to greater competition is not an anti-union measure. Rather, as New Zealand's experience following the introduction of the Employment Contracts Act in 1991 showed, removal of entrenched powers led to a market shakeout that ultimately benefited both workers and some trade unions,\" it says.\n\"Trade unions that proved to be effective bargaining agents, and that gained a reputation for helping employers to achieve productivity growth that was shared with their members, managed to grow their membership despite the underlying decline in unionisation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T11:57:42.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
