( http://on.wsj.com/1PiYX6D ) \nThe bank is in negotiations with the New York Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission and a deal could come as early as the next several weeks, the paper said. \nRepresentatives at Credit Suisse, the SEC and the New York Attorney General's office were not immediately available for comment. \nThe settlement under negotiations would be the biggest fine ever levied against an operator of a private trading venue, the WSJ reported, adding that talks could still fall apart. \nLast year, the New York attorney general brought a lawsuit against Barclays Plc (LSE: BARC.L - news ) accusing the bank of misleading clients in its dark pool. \nIn April, Barclays failed to persuade a U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing it of defrauding shareholders about the trading platform. \nDark pools were designed to let people quietly trade shares before investors in the broader market could learn about and bet against their trades.
