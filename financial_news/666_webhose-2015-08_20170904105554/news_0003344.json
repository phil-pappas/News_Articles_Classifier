one more about corporate benefits than boosting economies and development. \nBut backers say the modern global economy needs new rules of the road to protect intellectual property-dependent 21st century industries not covered in traditional free-trade forums like the World Trade Organization. \nTrade ministers were keen to talk up the positives. \n\"Good progress was made this week, but a number of challenging issues remain, including intellectual property and market access for dairy products,\" said New Zealand's Tim Groser, touching on two of the outstanding sensitive issues. \nAkira Amari, Japan's minister in charge of TPP negotiations, told reporters it would take another ministerial-level meeting to clinch the deal. \n\"According to my understanding, it is our common view that we will hold a meeting by the end of August,\" Amari said, according to public broadcaster NHK. \n\"If we can't conclude it next time, it's going to be very hard.\" \nAustralian Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb said they were \"on the cusp,\" with \"provisional decisions on more than 90 percent of issues.\" \n- Into political maelstrom - \nSeveral prickly issues were believed to have held up the talks this week, including differences over agricultural markets, auto trade and protection for drug-makers. \nAlso under negotiation are better copyright protection, workers rights and environmental protections. \nLawmakers who wrote the legislation giving the US Congress a final up-or-down vote on TPP were cautiously upbeat about the latest round. \n\"While our trade negotiators were able to make significant progress this week, it is important that the United States stood firm to ensure America secures the best deal from our international trading partners,\" Republican Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch said. \nBut delays could put trade front and center in the election debate. \n\"Unless something happens it might get pushed to 2016 and become an issue that all candidates for president, for Senate, for the House are going to contend with more directly in the races,\" Justin Krebs, campaign director for MoveOn.org Civic Action which is part of the anti-TPP coalition, told AFP. \n\"That just gives the growing progressive movement and the growing anti-corporate movement more time to make a case.\" \nMost of the 17 Republican candidates have signalled their backing for Obama's trade push. \nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is sitting on the fence, while her top nomination rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley are opposed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T02:58:36.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
