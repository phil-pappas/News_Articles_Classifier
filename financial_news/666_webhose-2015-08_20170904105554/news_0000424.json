What that means is that every time you stick a debit card into an ATM slot you just may be giving your information to a crook who has inserted a “skimmer” that gathers your card data. The crook then prints out a fake card with your data. Usually PINs are also collected via tiny pinhole cameras. Credit reporting group FICO has reported that attacks on ATMs on bank property jumped 174% year on year in the first part of 2015. Attacks on non bank machines jumped 315% in the same period. Matters are so grave that leading ATM maker NCR on July 23 issued an alert to its customers that said, “NCR is tracking an increasing frequency of card skimming attacks in both the U.S. and in Mexico.” An NCR spokesperson said that direct losses globally due to ATM skimming is $3 billion. It gets worse. Until recently many skimmers were crude and attached directly on top of the ATM card slot. For them, the usual self defense prescription has been to shake the slot. If something comes off in your hand it’s probably a skimmer. No more. Owen Wild, an NCR expert, said that NCR is seeing more skimmers that are inserted down into the card slot and thus are invisible on the exterior. There also is a rising incidence of cases where a criminal drills a hole into an ATM, inserts a copying device, then covers the hole with a decal. Wild said many of these devices are slick enough that they defeat some anti-skimming technologies in use on ATMs. Momentarily, we'll tell why there is an explosion in skimming but by now you want to know what your liability is. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:47:48.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
