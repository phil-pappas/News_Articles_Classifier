HD-TVI offers more pixels, superior resolution and the ability to zoom like no other. \nThe HD-TVI provides 614% MORE pixels than a traditional analog camera which translates to an AMAZING picture quality and allows you to zoom into the image after the fact without the same distortion as typical analog. \nVisitors to the stand of VSA at the just ended Habitat Fair held by MultiTV were overawed by Crisp, Clear, Un-pixelated images on display. \nTriple Technology RecordingIntelligent Video Inputs with the HD Triple Technology Recorders offer a tremendous amount of flexibility to utilize your HD-TVI security system to its fullest potential. \nTechnical officer at VSA, Thomas Mensah Adorkor, said one can connect 1080p/720p/SD Analog to ANY Input + Additional Bonus OMNI IP Channels. \nHe said the unique feature of the system is that it is easy to install and operation over almost any wire with the ability to run long distances over coax is possible. “This can be new coax or coax that is already existing for a simple system upgrade.” \nAccording to him, the system can run more than 1500 Feet on RG6; more than 1000 Feet on standard RG59 Coax and more than 500 Feet on UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair). \nThe HD TVI can be installed as a New System or Easily Upgraded as an Existing System. \n“One smart thing about HD-TVI is that it will work if you are installing as a new system or if you have an existing system and would like to upgrade to HD-TVI equipment. \nYou can install as a new system with new HD-TVI cameras and HD Triple Technology recorders; upgrade existing systems by utilizing existing wire and replacing the cameras and DVR for a simpler and more cost-effective installation; upgrade existing systems by utilizing existing wire, and replacing the DVR with an HD-T DVR and retaining existing analog cameras. \nWith HD-TVI it is easy to keep some of the existing analog cameras on your system and upgrade priority cameras with newer HD-TVI technology. Then when you are ready (and after you see the difference in quality) you will want to upgrade them all! \nOne bonus quality, Thomas insisted, is that HD-TVI Offers Superior Image Quality at a Very Cost Effective Price - HD TVI CCTV is up to 40% cheaper than Analogue CCTV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T03:51:58.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
