The debate over whether the government will get back the 502p per share it paid back in 2008 for Royal Bank of Scotland is pointless, Tempus said. \nThere is little point in investors sitting on their hands until RBS shares reach a hypothetical Â£5 figure, because they may not, the column said. \nRBS has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with a common equity tier 1 ratio at 12.3%, and the bank has said it would return excess capital to investors. \nTempus said the company's share sale should focus attention on RBS to shares' benefit. \nThe Financial Times ' Lex column said Irish firm Shire (Amsterdam: QB8.AS - news ) 's offer to buy Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) puts the American pharma company in play for other suitors. \nAllergan (NYSE: AGN - news ) , which is like Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) also based in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) , could be another suitor for Baxalta, Lex said, as could Canada's Valeant. \nThere is a reasonable fit between Shire and Baxalta, Lex said, but ultimately taxes are central to the deal Irish headquarters provide tax benefits. \nSo far Baxalta has been cool to the offer, Lex said, and suggested it better idea could be to just find a partner with a low tax rate. \nPlease note: Digital Look provides a round-up of news, tips and information that is impacting share prices and the market.
