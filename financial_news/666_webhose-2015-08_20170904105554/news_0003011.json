Joosep Martinson Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl ANZ Bank chief executive Mike Smith and Papua New Guinea prime minister Peter O'Neill make an unlikely sort of unity ticket on the benefits of a commodities downturn for an economy that has become used to blue sky projections.\nBut the banker with a big resources lending book and the politician from a highly prospective country seem to be singing from the same songbook when it comes to how PNG should deal with the curious phenomenon of an economy growing at 10 per cent plus - largely thanks to gas exports - even as its budget deficit blows out.\nSmith says the resources boom allowed PNG to paper over weaknesses in the system and so the downturn now is \"not such a bad thing.\"\nAnd O'Neill actually says he welcomes the changed outlook because too many people in the government had become complacent about forecasts that the country would grow up to 20 per cent this year as the $10 billion Exxon PNG LNG project came on stream.\nPapua New Guinea needs to diversify its economy into new areas including tourism. Alamy An important new debate has suddenly broken out about the economic outlook for Australia's biggest aid recipient in the past two weeks following the country's regular mid-year budget review.\nAnd the debate about the sustainability of the country's economic policies is even more important given that PNG has assumed a greater significance as an aid recipient following the May budget cuts to aid for Indonesia and O'Neill's steady push to have a greater say over how the aid is dispersed.\nAPEC leaders coming At the same time work is now well under way in Port Moresby for the country to host the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders summit in 2018, which would cement O'Neill's stature as a regional leader â€“ assuming he can hang onto the top job at the election due in 2017 before the summit.\n But the summit will also likely be seen as measure of Australia's regional capacity as regional leaders all the way up to the US president get a chance to reflect on the state of development in the one country in the world where Australia has had the main aid role for more than half a century.\nPaul Flanagan, a former Australian Treasury official in PNG and now an academic, says the country faces a budget crisis as commodities revenue has fallen faster than expected and alternative revenue sources, such as privatisation, have proven slow to emerge.\nO'Neill is hitting back, saying he is well aware of the challenge and that he has a special Treasury taskforce going through the country's accounts to create a better cost structure and recover tax revenue that is overdue.\nNo mass budget cutting But he says he won't be resorting to indiscriminate budget cutting. The last time PNG did that, after a similar crisis more than 15 years ago, it undermined the country's ability to maintain infrastructure or provide basic services like education.\n\"It has taken us many years to rebuild the public service to a level our country requires. Critics say we should rush to a mini-Budget. But I don't think that's a necessary course of action. It's about taking realistic steps to deal with expenditure,\" he said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review in Port Moresby this week.\nMany observers say this promised calm budget review over a couple of years is an unlikely scenario because the country has already shifted into an election cycle after O'Neill's two-year protection from a no-confidence vote in parliament expired earlier this year.\nBut he says the budget management is not going to be side-tracked by traditional pork-barrelling before a poll. \"It's not about an election. The people need to see a government that is consistent in its decision-making. We are laying important foundations in education and healthcare. The next few budgets need to look to the long term.\"\nThe evidence on the ground is that O'Neill is delivering on basic education, healthcare and infrastructure building, which may well pay-off at an election. But critics ask whether expensive new roads in Port Moresby - driven by the security needs of the APEC summit - are really justified when commodities revenue is slumping. And these changes will take a long time to impact on PNG's poor development indicators.\nMike Smith a frequent visitor Smith, who has just completed his eighth visit to PNG since taking over as ANZ CEO, says he remains optimistic about the country's future, which explains why ANZ has now funded two large studies by Port Jackson Partners on diversified economic growth and alternative electricity generation.\nHe says his discussions with senior economic officials makes him confident that useful progress is being made on a sovereign wealth fund, a sovereign bond issue and banking regulation. And he cuts O'Neill some slack on budget repair, saying: \"We are in a democracy here. There are political pressures.\"\nThe dual challenges facing a banker trying to build a broader lending base and a politician trying to maintain growth with less budget resources are perfectly encapsulated by the state of electricity provision in PNG.\nIn recent years state-owned PNG Power has built several hundred kilometres of new electricity transmission lines from rural development funds provided to members of parliament but connected very few new subscribers to the network.\nOnly 15 per cent have access to power Despite half a century of Australian aid oversight and extensive investment by Australian companies that makes PNG a bigger recipient of Australian investment than China, only 15 per cent of the population is serviced with electricity. That compares with 31 per cent of Cambodians and 49 per cent of people in Myanmar.\nIt is a parlous situation for a country trying to escape the impact of the commodity price slump by diversifying its economy into more job-rich sectors, such as agriculture and tourism.\nAnd it explains why O'Neill has taken the creative decision to put the businessman credited with building PNG's successful Digicel mobile phone network, John Mangos, in charge of the power company.\nMangos has already shaken up the system by promising to connect 100,000 new electricity customers in two years. To be funded out of internal land asset sales, this would almost double the amount of customers the company has now.\nThe ANZ-Port Jackson Partners report on using more decentralised, newer power generation sources such as mini-hydro and solar won't help Mangos shake-up the system in the short term. But it does provide the basis for the sort of technology leap-frogging pioneered by Digicel in telecommunications.\nAnd using phones and power to keep people employed in new industries, often in their home villages, would go a long way to dealing with the development challenges which will be under scrutiny when the APEC leaders turn up.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl"], "published": "2015-08-13T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:02:00.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
