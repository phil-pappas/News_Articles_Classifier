While one of them was Narayan Murthy, another was Anand Kumar,” said Murali, who has received Infosys excellence award for people development and honorary citizen award from Government of China.\nAnand said it was a big thing to get appreciation from a personality like Narayan Murthy. “It is bigger than any award for me, as I feel overwhelmed with his kind words,” he added.\nPatna-based ‘Super 30′ has groomed 300 students who have qualified for the coveted IITs ever since Anand launched the initiative in 2002.\nUnder the programme, 30 students from the extremely poor families are coached free of cost to crack JEE to secure admission to IITs. The initiative had made its way to the list of ‘Best of Asia – 2010′, prepared by Time magazine of the US. Newsweek Magazine had also taken note of the initiative of Kumar’s Super 30 and included his school in the list of four most innovative schools in the world.\n 17, 2015 10:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:43:37.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
