It said Friday more than 50 of its employees were injured in the explosions. \nThe death toll in the port city hit 112 on Sunday with 95 people still missing, the official Xinhua news agency said, suggesting the toll could rise significantly. \nTianjin is the gateway to northeast China, though which about 40 percent of China's imported cars enter the country. \n(Reporting by Maki Shiraki; Writing by William Mallard; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T19:30:57.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
