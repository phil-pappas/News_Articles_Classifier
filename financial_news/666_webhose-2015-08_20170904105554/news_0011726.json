news ) 's Wall Street's slump... that appears to be setting the pace for the UK market and, as is often the way after these excessive moves, this volatility appears likely to be with us for some time yet.\" \n- 'Full-blown crash' - \nChinese stocks have lost more than 40 percent of their value since a year-long, debt-fuelled rally collapsed in June, prompting Beijing to unleash unprecedented market support measures, including using state-backed vehicles to buy up shares. \nWhile the slump in Shanghai may have a limited impact on the broader economy -- worth some 13 percent of world output -- it reflects investors' views that the sky-high valuations of quoted companies are not justified. \nSome analysts see Beijing's handling of the market slump as a further litmus test of the government's ability to guide the economy to a more market-oriented model after the shock devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago. \n\"If problems on China's financial markets and real economy deepen, and the authorities fail to contain the situation, a full-blown financial and economic crash in China could ensue,\" said Christophe Donay, chief strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. \n\"This is currently the biggest risk for the global economy and financial markets.\" \nChina's central bank on Tuesday warned that the \"economic growth rate remains under pressure\", adding the cuts were meant in part to \"support the real economy to continue to develop healthily\". \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) (PBoC) cut its benchmark lending and deposit interest rates by 0.25 percentage points each and its reserve requirement ratio by 0.50 percentage points. \nThe bank has now cut interest rates five times since November in a bid to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year. \nBut international investors said more would need to be done to fully reassure markets, especially as the US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade by the end of 2015. \nThe head of the PBOC's research unit Tuesday blamed the US for the market volatility, saying expectations for a US rate rise in September had been the \"trigger\" for the wild swings in world markets, Xinhua reported. \n\"A circuit-breaker is needed to dispel excessive pessimism and restore confidence,\" Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg News. \n\"Further support measures in the coming weeks and months will be needed.\" \n-- Bloomberg News contributed to this report --", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:10:56.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
