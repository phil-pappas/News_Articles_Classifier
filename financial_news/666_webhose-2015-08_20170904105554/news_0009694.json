Photo: Edmond So \nRatings agency Moody's Investors Service put Nanyang Commercial Bank on review for downgrade just a day after China Cinda Asset Management said it had made a bid for the lender owned by Bank of China (Hong Kong). \nNanyang's A1 rating on its deposits was partially based on ownership by BOCHK, Hong Kong's second-largest bank. The potential downgrade was connected to the possibility of less support from the potential new owner, should the deal with Cinda go through. \n\"The potential change in ownership will likely lead to less support in Nanyang's ratings, given Cinda's lower issuer ratings compared to Bank of China (Hong Kong),\" Moody's said. \nCinda on Thursday said its wholly owned Cinda Financial Holdings was the only firm that had made an application to the Beijing Financial Assets Exchange by the August 25 deadline to bid for NCB, which is being sold by BOCHK for an asking price of HK$68 billion. \nCinda was launched by the central government more than 15 years ago to help digest an overload of bad debt in the Chinese banking system, earning it and three other peers the title \"bad bank\". The firm's primary line of business was still distressed debt management, adding to some concern at Moody's over how the bank would be used. \nNanyang has a baseline credit assessment of Baa1 but that could come under fire if the buyout changed the bank's current business model, Moody's said. \n\"This could arise both from aggressive financing of the acquisition by Cinda that may result in pressure on Nanyang's capital and from potential changes in Nanyang's business model if it is used to support Cinda's core business of distressed asset management, Moody's said. \nCinda's share price in Hong Kong closed up more than 6 per cent on Friday after falling an intraday 9 per cent on Thursday, the same day it announced the potential Nanyang takeover. \nThe acquisition, which is still pending several approvals, would add Hong Kong and mainland banking licences to its growing suite of licences for businesses such as securities and futures broking, insurance, real estate and financial leasing.
