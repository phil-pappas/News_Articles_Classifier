Photo: Louie Douvis\nAll sides of the usually fractious superannuation industry have rallied behind a call from the head of Westpac's wealth management business to remove decisions about super policy from the yearly budget cycle and link them to to the five yearly intergenerational report.\nBT Financial Group chief executive Brad Cooper said the retirement age and the super preservation age should rise automatically with increases in life expectancy to \"allow our system to adapt itself to Australia's changing demographics and not be reliant on the politics of the day to make changes\".\n\"I think everyone can agree that super policy needs to be taken out of the budget cycle and hands of politicians. That's an idea the former Labor government floated and one we have supported for a number of years,\" Industry Super Australia chief executive David Whitely said.\nAs foreshadowed by Fairfax Media, Mr Cooper made the call in a speech that outlined his vision for super policy at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle function in Sydney on Friday .\nAdvertisement Association of Super Funds of Australia chief executive Pauline Vamos also said it was \"especially great to see\" support for linking changes to superannuation policy to the five yearly intergenerational report.\nMr Cooper also proposed that retirement income earned from super should not exceed that of twice the average weekly ordinary earnings, currently $75,000 a year per person. That would allow people to have a maximum of $2.5 million in superannuation, drawing down $150,000 a year.\nAlthough Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees chief executive Tom Garcia said, \"a cap with such a large dollar amount of $2.5 million is window dressing.\"\nMr Cooper acknowledged the $2.5 million cap idea would affect only about 0.5 per cent of Australians in the super system. But he said putting a defined limit on how much people could save with the tax benefits of super would provide a helpful starting point for making other changes.\nThe Labor party has proposed taxing annual retirement income from super over $75,000 per year.\nThe Abbott government has repeatedly pledged not to make any \"adverse, unexpected changes to superannuation this term\".\n\"We should use this promised period of policy stability to talk about what the design of the mature superannuation system should be from 2025 onwards, when the compulsory contribution rate is set to hit 12 per cent,\" Mr Cooper said.\nHis call to retain the low income super contribution, a government top-up of up to $500 per annum to help low-income earners on less than $37,000 a year that is due to be scrapped from 1 July 2017, received broad support.\n\"This is something I hope the entire superannuation industry can get behind and put pressure on the government to reconsider instead of steam rolling ahead with plans to scrap the low income super contribution - that will have a negative impact on around 3.6 million people,\" Mr Whitely said.\nFinancial Services Council chief executive Sally Loane said she saw merit in Mr Cooper's suggestion to tax womens' super contributions at a lower tax rate to offset the average 17 per cent gender pay gap.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/personal-finance/superannuation-and-smsfs/westpacs-wealth-chief-brad-cooper-says-cut-superannuation-tax-breaks-for-rich-20150730-ginkpe"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:15:18.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
