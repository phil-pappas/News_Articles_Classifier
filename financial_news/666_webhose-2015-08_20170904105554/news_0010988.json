In previous years he has been able to counter muted growth in places like continental Europe with booming demand in Brazil, China and Russia. \nResults on Wednesday showed the opposite effect, with net sales growth of 3.5 percent in North America in the second quarter, compared with just 0.7 percent from Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe. \nSorrell said he expected the strong performance in the U.S. to be maintained, despite a raft of media planning contracts from huge global brands that have come up for review, sparking increased competition. \nThe strong performance in the U.S. echoed the recent updates from Omnicom and IPG, which were also helped by buoyant corporate demand in their home market. \nOn a like-for-like revenue basis, the measurement used by WPP's rivals, the British firm was up 4.9 percent, compared with 5.2 percent at Omnicom and 6.2 percent for Interpublic. Publicis reported growth of 1.2 percent. \n\"WPP's ongoing ability to navigate treacherous economic conditions is likely to consolidate its favoured market rating, with the consensus of the shares as a strong buy likely to remain intact,\" said Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers. \nShares in the group were down 1.4 percent, on a par with the FTSE 100 Index. \n(Editing by Sarah Young and Keith Weir) UK International News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:45:17.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
