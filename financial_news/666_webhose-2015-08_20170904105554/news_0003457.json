The deal comes just months after Berkshire Hathaway teamed up with Brazilian outfit 3G to seal the $50bn merger between Kraft Foods (NasdaqGS: KRFT - news ) and Heinz . Berkshire’s largest deal, prior to its Precision takeout, was the $26bn takeover of the US railways group, Burlington Northern Railroad, in 2009. \nPrecision, which was founded in 1949, makes industrial components such as turbine blades and fasteners for aircraft makers including Airbus and Boeing and has annual sales of $10bn. It also makes equipment for power stations and the oil and gas industry. \nLast month Precision’s quarterly profits missed Wall Street expectations on the back of supressed demand from its power customers and the fall in oil prices, which caused the group’s shares to fall and provided a ripe takeover opportunity for Mr Buffett. \nBerkshire Hathaway is offering $235 in cash per Precision share, a 21pc premium to the Portland, Oregon-based company’s share price last week. Mr Buffett already owned 3pc of the company after steadily increasing his stake in the industrials group. \n“I’ve admired Precision’s operation for a long time”, the Sage of Omaha said. “For good reasons, it is the supplier of choice for the world’s aerospace industry, one of the largest sources of American exports. Berkshire’s board of directors is proud that Precision will be joining Berkshire.” \nMark Donegan, Precision’s chairman and chief executive, said: “We see a unique alignment between Warren’s management and investment philosophy and how we manage Precision for the long term. \n“We believe that as part of Berkshire Hathaway, Precision will be exceptionally well positioned to support our customers’ needs into the future. This transaction offers compelling and immediate value for our shareholders, and allows Precision’s employees to continue to operate in the same manner that has generated many years of exceptional service and performance to our customers.” \nThe deal requires Precision’s shareholders to vote in favour of the deal and clearance from US regulators as well as approval from global competition authorities. \n= Inside Warren Buffett's extravagant 50th anniversary event =", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:42:29.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
