The passenger yield decline has been much bigger than expected,\" airlines analyst Daniel Tsang, told AFP. \n\"I think the yield will continue to come under intense pressure in the second half given the yuan devaluation which will affect the average return Cathay manages to get from the Chinese market,\" Tsang said. \nBeijing's central bank shocked financial markets by devaluing its currency last week, sending the yuan plunging by the most in over two decades and raising concerns fewer Chinese will travel abroad. \nStill, Cathay said passenger capacity for the period was up 6.4 percent compared to the same period last year, helped by new routes. \nAir cargo capacity also saw an increase by 8.9 percent for the period, although demand \"slackened\" in the second quarter and the business is now facing \"overcapacity\". \nA fall in fuel prices and a rise in the number of flights that are filled to capacity means airlines are expected to make collective profits $29.3 billion in 2015, the International Air Transport Association said in June. \nHowever, the global aviation body warned the Asian market was mixed, with some carriers seeing their cargo business \"in the doldrums (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) \".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:34:00.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
