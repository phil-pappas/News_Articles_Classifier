The Securities and Exchange Commission this week adopted a new rule requiring public companies to disclose how much money CEOs earn in comparison to typical employees. \nPart of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, the rule has been applauded by many, including The New York Times editorial board . \nThe Times said the requirement could help shareholders make decisions on company performance based on things like morale and turnover. \nBut when it comes to Wall Street firms — which the rule was presumably designed for, since Dodd-Frank is a Wall Street reform law — it may not show a great deal. Defining 'typical' \nThe pay gap rule has already received criticism for a number of reasons. For example, it requires companies to compare chief executive pay with the median employee compensation, rather than the mean. \nCompanies will be allowed to choose their own methodology for identifying the median employee, including using samples of the employee population rather than the full body. \nThe concern, as voiced by Fortune's S. Kumar , is that companies could throw in a few higher-paid employees and exclude some lower-level workers when calculating the median. That would ultimately reduce the wage gap. Scoresheet \nBut even if the SEC had required companies to take the average pay of all employees, it would still be hard to glean anything from the results — especially for firms with sizable investment banking arms. \n(REUTERS/Jason Reed) \nWe calculated the pay gaps for six of the biggest banks, based on average employee pay. To do that, we looked at 2014 CEO compensation data from proxy statements, total employee compensation in 2014 from balance sheets in quarterly and annual reports, and the total number of employees at each bank. \nHere's what those pay ratios look like: \nGoldman Sachs Total executive compensation for CEO Lloyd Blankfein: $24 million Total compensation expenses: $12.69 billion Total number of employees: 34,000 Average employee pay: $373,235 CEO pay is 64.3 x that of average employee. \nMorgan Stanley Total executive compensation for CEO James Gorman: $22.5 million Total compensation expenses: $17.8 billion Total number of employees: 55,802 Average employee pay: $319,415 CEO pay is 70.4 x that of average employee. \nBank of America Total executive compensation for CEO Brian Moynihan: $15.3 million Total “personnel” expenses: $33.8 billion Total number of employees: 233,000 Average employee pay: $145,008 CEO pay is 105.5 x that of average employee. \nCiti ​ group Total executive compensation for CEO Michael Corbat: $13 million Total compensation expenses: $24 billion Total number of employees: 243,000 Average employee pay: $98,596 CEO pay is 131.9 x that of average employee. \nWells Fargo Total executive compensation for CEO John Strumpf: $19.3 million Total compensation expenses: $29.9 billion Total number of employees: 266,000 Average employee pay: $112,563 CEO makes 171.5 x that of average employee. \nJPMorgan Total executive compensation for CEO Jamie Dimon: $27.7 million Total compensation expenses: $30.16 billion Total number of employees: 265,359 Average employee pay: $113,657 CEO pay is 243.7 x that of average employee. \nWhoa, right? JPMorgan's compensation gap is four times that of Goldman Sachs. \nThe thing is that each bank has a different business model. JPMorgan is not just an investment bank . It has a huge retail banking wing — Chase — with staffs of lower-wage employees, from branch managers to tellers. \nBanks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have far fewer employees than JPMorgan, and none of those employees are tellers. Many of them work in higher-paid positions — for example, in trading, wealth management, or in the investment banking division. \n(Reuters/ Natalie Behring ) Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. \nCitigroup has brick-and-mortar retail branches and almost as many employees as JPMorgan, but the wage gap at Citi is smaller. That is primarily because CEO Michael Corbat's pay package was smaller than that enjoyed by his Wall Street peers in 2014. His pay was cut about 10% last year because the bank's profits nearly halved, largely due to legal costs. \nSo even based on average employee wages, rather than median, we still don't have a very clear picture. What does it matter? \nThe real question that arises from the new disclosure rule is: So what? \nThe whole point of the requirement is to increase transparency at companies and maybe embarrass the bosses. \nBut on Wall Street everyone already knows what the boss makes. And they have a pretty good idea of your comp package, too — based on whether you're an analyst, an associate, a VP, or an MD. \nAt investment banks , where everything is a competition and money is the prize, knowing that your boss pulls in more than anyone else on the Street will not weaken employee morale. It's more likely to be a point of pride, or something to aspire to. \nDisclosing the gap wouldn't change any of that. \nNOW WATCH: This animated map shows the largest company by revenue for every state More From Business Insider", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T16:26:39.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
