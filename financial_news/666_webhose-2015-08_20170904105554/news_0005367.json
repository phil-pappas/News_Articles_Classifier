Production, which started in 1998, is at around 120,000 barrels per day, according to BP's website. \nThe North Sea has struggled in recent years to attract investment due to high operating costs, an unattractive tax regime and decreasing output in the basin, whose production peaked in the late 1990s. Many companies are seeking to exit the region, further pressured by the halving of oil prices to $50 a barrel over the past year. \nTrade body Oil & Gas UK welcomed the investment. \n\"Given the harsh business environment upstream oil and gas companies currently face...industry as a whole is putting a great deal of effort into improving the performance of its assets,\" Oil & Gas UK Chief Executive Deirdre Michie said in a statement.
