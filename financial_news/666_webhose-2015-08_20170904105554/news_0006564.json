Beyond the A-listers are the droves of media, fashion and entertainment industry elite, as well as ordinary folk like me, who make a sweaty exodus from Manhattan (via car, train, bus or private jet) in search of ocean breezes, white sandy beaches, and stylish bars and restaurants.\nMontauk, or \"The End\" as locals call it, in reference to its location at the farthest end of Long Island, is touted as the Hampton's hottest haven, and it is where we find ourselves on a balmy July night.\nMontauk was where Andy Warhol had a mansion \"Eothen\" (currently on the market for $85million) in the early 70s and hosted guests including Mick Jagger, Jackie O and John Lennon.\nThese days Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon has a waterfront home here, as does old-time crooner Jimmy Buffett, musician Paul Simon, and actor Robert de Niro. Consciously uncoupled couple Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, who own a place in the neighbouring Amagansett, are regulars in Montauk, often spotted with their mate Cameron Diaz.\n The pool at Topping Rose House, in The Hamptons. Mark Jordan \"It reminds me a lot of Byron Bay,\" says Aussie-born New York chef Chris Rendell, who has a waterfront restaurant at the Surf Lodge in Montauk.\nHe is referring to the laid-back surf town vibe which merges with a stylish edge, and a young, cool, good-looking crowd. (Rendell's seafood-centric menu includes a watermelon and feta salad, sea scallops and freshly shucked oysters.)\nSeaside dining delight For top-end dining in Montauk, there is the newly unveiled Scarpetta on the Beach (Scarpetta has outposts in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Las Vegas). Perched at an outdoor table, the ocean so close we can hear the crashing waves, we delight in a meal that transports us to Italy: creamy burrata, perfectly al dente tomato and basil pasta, and branzino with guanciale, maitake mushrooms and a white asparagus vinaigrette. It's worth a visit for the gratis bread basket alone.\nDinner at Aussie chef Chris Rendell's restaurant, The Surf Lodge, the Hamptons. Scarpetta on the Beach is part of the newly renovated Gurney's Montauk Resort & Seawater Spa, which this year opened five restaurants, cafes and bars, as well as unveiling 38 shiny new oceanfront suites. It also boasts America's largest Olympic-sized seawater pool.\nWe were in 401, a stylishly designed suite with an enormous private terrace which delivered breathtaking views of the Atlantic ocean.\nDuring the day, there was lunch (don't miss the famous burger) at the oceanfront Tillie's, and casual eats from the Beach Club on a private beach. Rent a day bed or book a massage at the hotel spa.\nA 10-minute drive away is the popular surfing beach, Ditch Plains, where Coldplay's Chris Martin is often spotted. No rockstar sightings for me on this day, but my focus was on learning to surf, and I did, thanks to some expert one-on-one tuition from Gavin at Corey's Wave.\nFor families, the calm bay of Navy Beach is popular by day and at sunset, snare a spot on the sand at Navy Beach Restaurant, for beer or champagne as the sun dips down.\nThe locally caught seafood is equally sublime.\nOur next stop on our Hamptons jaunt was Shelter Island, an exclusive beachside enclave which has a St Tropez air to it, replete with effortlessly stylish people (just without the French accents).\nReached by car ferry only, it was once a sleepy town (which is how the residents liked it) until hotel mogul Andre Balazs (who owns the famous Chateau Marmont in LA) transformed a 1970s motel into Sunset Beach, a chic hotel with fashionable bar and restaurant.\nOn weekends, it is the place to be seen, a cool party vibe sets in during late afternoon as the crowd basks in what is without doubt a truly magical sunset.\nFor our last day in the Hamptons we headed inland, passing first through East Hampton where luxury designer stores line the street and pretty houses are framed with white picket fences, and then on to Bridgehampton.\nA lush and charming town, it boasts the only five-star hotel in the Hamptons, Topping Rose House.\nA grand 18th century establishment, the boutique hotel has 22 beautifully furnished rooms, and luxury facilities including a lap pool, yoga rooms and event spaces (the Clintons have held party fundraisers here).\nTopping Rose House Restaurant remains a major drawcard and non-hotel guests like us are most welcome. With a small farm on site, the chef has ready access to organic ingredients as well as local seafood, which were highlighted in dishes such as Darjeeling tea-steamed fluke with farm vegetables, a roasted striped bass, and risotto with garden peas, chanterelles and parmesan.\nSipping on a crisp white wine from a nearby Long Island winery, our evening felt relaxed, seductive, and posh – much like the Hamptons.\nNEED TO KNOW\nGetting there: Car hire is your best bet. From Manhattan take the Long Island Expressway to the South Fork, about two hours drive. Another option is the Long Island Railway, or the Hampton jitney, a regular luxury motor bus coach service from Manhattan ( www.hamptonjitney.com ).\nStay: Gurney's Montauk Resort & Seawater Spa.
