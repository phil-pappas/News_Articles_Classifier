David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd The arrival this week of secured loans in the peer-to-peer lending space is the ideal backdrop for Labor Senator Sam Dastyari's show trial in the Senate over credit card interest rates .\nIt does not seem to have dawned on Dastyari that instead of focusing Senate resources on an age old problem from the 20th century he ought to be seeking bipartisan support for increased competition in lending.\nIt is now proven that competition based on financial technology or fintech can provide higher returns to savers, lower costs to borrowers and unplug the bottlenecks in lending caused by the banking oligopoly.\nThe availability of secured car loans on the Ratesetter peer-to-peer platform in partnership with Stratton, a subsidiary of Carsales.com.au, should sharpen the competition in the $45 billion automotive lending market.\nIt should also have a flow on effect to the $45 billion credit card market because cards are often used as a source of revolving credit.\nMajor players in the financial system are taking the latest Dastyari inquiry seriously even though it places little emphasis on encouraging competitive solutions to a problem that has been raked over for more than 20 years.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia's submission to the inquiry helpfully points out that while issuers compete actively for credit card customers, the card interest rates remain high and do not closely follow changes in funding costs.\nThe best known academic study on this issue was written by Lawrence Ausubel from the University of Maryland in 1991, according to the RBA. \"The study notes the apparent paradox that a market with few barriers to entry and the presence of 4000 competitors could be characterised by very sticky interest rates and card issuers making much higher rates of return on their credit card lending than on other lines of business,\" the RBA submission says.\n An explanation for the paradox The central bank, which regulates the payment system, says the apparent paradox can be explained by \"the existence of a significant number of consumers who are either not well informed or (for various behavioural reasons) are reluctant to switch banks or seek a lower rate\".\n\"At the same time, banks may have little incentive to lower interest rates, given that rates are not a determining factor for many individuals who may (possibly mistakenly) not expect to build up significant balances, while in the case of other individuals, banks may worry that lower rates may attract lower-quality borrowers.\"\nThe actual spread between bank funding costs and the interest rates charged on their credit cards is around 9 percentage points, according to the RBA.\nIt says the spread for those borrowers who are paying interest is about 14.75 percentage points. The RBA says these spreads rose significantly in the global financial crisis and have remained at that level or drifted modestly higher since.\nIt is safe to predict that these extracts from the RBA submission will form one of the final conclusions of Dastyari's inquiry. But where does that leave consumers?\nThere are competitive solutions to the credit card problem which should be explored including federal government action that could be pushed through parliament with the bipartisan support of Dastyari and his colleagues.\nOne obvious source of policy inspiration is the United Kingdom where Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is providing about Â£200 million in support to peer-to-peer lenders as part of a plan to make the UK the fintech capital of the world. Osborne is not only using government money to provide alternative financing solutions for consumers and small business he is actively trying to break down the credit information monopoly of the banks. In a speech last year, he said he had already introduced legislation so fintech companies could get access to credit data on small businesses, access payments systems and compete more effectively in business lending.\nBill offers alternative pathway He later introduced the Small Business Bill which requires the big UK banks to pass on information on small businesses they reject for loans, so that fintech companies and alternative lenders could offer finance instead. UK figures show that a small business will be suitable for finance, but 70 per cent only approach one bank and nearly 40 per cent give up at the first attempt.\nOsborne is known to be close to the CEO of Ratesetter in the UK, Rhydian Lewis. Ratesetter in the UK owns 20 per cent of the Australian Ratesetter business.\nAustralia's track record of nurturing more competition in lending is reasonable. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission work with Ratesetter and another peer-to-peer lender, SocietyOne, to provide a workable regulatory framework.\nRatesetter's local CEO, Daniel Foggo says the big breakthrough in competition will come when the government forces the Big Four banks to share the consumer credit data they hold.\nIn the meantime, the availability of secured loans through the Ratesetter platform should provide thousands of people with a competitive alternative to the banks. Stratton CEO Rob Chaloner says his firm had been knocking back about 100,000 loan applications for car finance in amounts less than $15,000 each year.\nHe says these applications could now be met through the Ratesetter platform provided the borrowers met the lending criteria. Personal loans through banks to buy a car are usually about 14 per cent whereas Ratesetter is currently lending unsecured for three years at 9.9 per cent.\nFoggo estimates that someone borrowing to buy a car using a secured loan through Ratesetter would save between $500 and $1000 a year.\nAt the same time, banks may have little incentive to lower interest rates, given that rates are not a determining factor for many individuals who may (possibly mistakenly) not expect to build up significant balances, while in the case of other individuals, banks may worry that lower rates may attract lower-quality borrowers.\nIn a recent submission to the federal Treasury, Ratesetter highlighted many potential benefits to the economy from increased competition from fintech companies. That same theme has been pushed quite hard in the United States by former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers who is a director of the Lending Club, a $US4.99 billion peer-to-peer lender.\nSEEK's patient capital SEEK chief executive Andrew Bassat, is right to highlight the short-term horizons of Australian institutional investors .\nHe says Australian companies are going to be losers in the global expansion game because we are competing with US companies that are happily backed by fund managers with three to four-year investment windows.\nAmazon and Google did not get where they are through satisfying the short term interests of investors wanting the next dividend or buyback.\nBassat says there are a combination of factors which are holding back the international expansion of Australian companies.\nThe first is the short termism of investors. The second is the short tenure of chief executives and the third is peer group pressure to maintain a low risk profile.\nBassat says SEEK deliberately took a long-term view of its investment in China and it continues to do so. The end results will be much greater than the short term benefits to the share price from not making the capital investments.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-08-19T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:04:53.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
