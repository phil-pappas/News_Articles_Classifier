Supplied Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan In images reminiscent of the 1998 waterfront dispute, Hutchison Ports has engaged a balaclava-wearing security guard outside its Port Botany terminal after sacking 40 per cent of its workforce by email.\nAs the International Transport Workers Federation warned of damage to the global standing of the Hong Kong-based operator, Labor and unions on Monday attacked the company's use of security guards outside its Sydney and Brisbane terminals.\nThe Fair Work Commission has ordered industrial action, which started after the company sacked 97 workers by text and email last Thursday , to cease.\nAt a hearing on Monday night, the commission amended the order to include the Maritime Union of Australia.\nReferencing the tactics used by Patrick during the 1998 waterfront dispute, Labor senator Doug Cameron asked Employment Minister Eric Abetz in Parliament on Monday whether \"midnight text messages and emails have replaced balaclavas and dogs as the preferred method of sacking waterfront workers\".\nSenator Abetz sought to justify the use of balaclava-wearing security guards during the 1998 dispute.\n\"As I understand the sorry history of the Australian waterfront over many decades, the balaclavas were used by certain workers to protect themselves from being identified from retaliatory action by the MUA,\" he said.\nThe MUA acknowledged on Monday that it had only seen one security guard wearing a balaclava during the current dispute.\n A photograph of a burly balaclava-wearing security guard during the 1998 dispute was used by the union movement to claim Patrick had engaged in \"un-Australian\" workplace tactics.\nPaddy Crumlin, the union's national secretary, said he was appalled by Hutchison's tactics, which included employing about 40 security guards outside its two terminals since Friday.\nMr Crumlin, the president of the International Transport Workers Federation, said its conduct in Australia would have a negative impact on its relations with its workers in other countries.\n\"There is a tidal wave of opposition,\" he said. \"That will be translated into a whole lot of dysfunctional outcomes.\"\nSenator Abetz, who has come under attack from unions over his reaction to how the employees were sacked, called on the workers to abide by the interim decision of the commission.\n\"It is not for industrial parties to pick and choose which of the umpire's rulings they will abide by,\" he said.\nThe dispute is scheduled to return to the commission on Friday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-10T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:11:48.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
