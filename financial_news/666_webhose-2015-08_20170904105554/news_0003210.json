Heathrow will start a six-month trial in mid-September that will see planes come in at 3.2 degrees, a sharper angle that it hopes will lessen the roar heard by residents living within the final 10-mile approach. \nThe government-appointed Airports Commission concluded last month that building a third runway at Heathrow offered the best solution to tackling Britain’s aviation capacity crisis. \nMinisters must now decide whether to press ahead with the commission’s recommendation and are weighing-up objections to Heathrow expansion. The din caused by aircraft and worries about increased air pollution are among the biggest concerns raised by opponents of a third runway . \nIntroducing a 3.5 degree angle of approach was among the noise reduction measures that Heathrow included in its successful submission to the commission for expansion. Separately, adopting a steeper angle was also one of 10 measures that formed part of the noise reduction “blueprint” that Heathrow published last December. \nFrankfurt, one of Heathrow’s main rivals, has already implemented sharper approach angles in an effort to relieve local residents from the roar caused by planes (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:20:03.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
