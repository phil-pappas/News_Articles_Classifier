The ACCC recently found a number of websites, in particular those comparing energy plans, included information that may mislead consumers about the extent of the comparison service, the amount of savings that could be achieved and the impartiality of the comparisons. Following contact by the ACCC, website operators quickly implemented appropriate changes to remove or amend the potentially misleading information. The ACCC has previously won more than $2 million in penalties against comparison website EnergyWatch for misleading advertising, and more than $10,000 from Comparethemarket in relation to claims it made about its health insurance service. After the release of the guidelines, Comparethemarket chief executive Matt McCann said his company would use them to provide \"clarity around the most ethical approach\". \"It is now incumbent upon the industry to adopt these guidelines as a minimum, or to take the responsibility to do even more to ensure consumers continue to get the best outcomes when using comparator services,\" he said. The ACCC's guidance is available on its website.
