Photo: Bloomberg\nThe planned shutdown of uneconomic power stations in NSW and South Australia could lead to power shortages across those two states, as well as Victoria, by the end of the decade.\nAn annual assessment by the Australian Energy Markets Operator has found that as much as 4550 megawatts of generation capacity is expected to be withdrawn across the national energy market over the next 10 years, which is equal to 9 per cent of installed capacity.\nSince 2014, 1077 megawatts of capacity has been idled, the largest being the Pelican Point No 2 unit and the Playford B power stations in South Australia, which are both 240 megawatts.\nAnother 3500 megawatts of capacity is earmarked to be closed - the Liddell power station in NSW (2000 megawatts), and in South Australia the Northern Power station and Torrens Island (a combined 1000 megawatts).\nAdvertisement As a result, Victoria and South Australia could face power shortages by 2019-20, just four years away.\nThe expansion of the connection between the power grids of Victoria and South Australia, which is to be completed by year end, will link these two regions more closely so high-demand periods in South Australia will absorb more power generated in Victoria.\nFor NSW, the forecast estimates it could face blackouts within six years, by 2021-22.\n\"NSW, SA and Victoria may be at risk of breaching the [National Electricity Market] reliability standard,\" AEMO chief executive Matt Zemaâ€‹ said.\nThis standard requires minimum levels of reserves to meet demand surges at times of extreme heat or cold.\n\"Should today's market conditions continue, previously projected surpluses in all regions will be reduced as these withdrawals place greater reliance on imports from other regions,\" Mr Zema said.\nAs much as 21,689 megawatts of new power generation capacity is being planned, nearly all of which is for renewable energy and which is contingent on federal government renewable energy policy settings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T04:42:14.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
