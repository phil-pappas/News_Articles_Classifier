Locally, a lot of the major economic indicators are set to be released this week. First up on Monday will be data on home prices, job ads and inflation, while retail spending and international trade figures will be out on Tuesday, followed by job market figures on Thursday. \"And on Friday we've got the housing finance and tourism data (so) basically all our top-shelf economic indicators will be released over the week,\" Mr James said. Capping it off \"in fine style\" will be the Reserve Bank's quarterly statement on monetary policy, which investors are always keen to see, he said. \"Certainly we'll have a good indication about how the economy is faring by the end of the week.\" Another focal point on Tuesday will be the RBA's monthly meeting on interest rates, which are widely expected to remain unchanged at a record low of two per cent. \"We don't think the Reserve Bank has got any need to be thinking about changing interest rates, so it could be a pretty straightforward meeting,\" Mr James said. Issues such as Greece's debt crisis appear to have been resolved for now and the RBA has shown it's not overly worried about \"wobbles\" in Chinese shares. \"And here at home, inflation is under control, the jobs market looks like it's modestly improving, the economy is going at a reasonable pace without going gangbusters ... so overall the Reserve Bank should leave interest rates unchanged,\" he said.
