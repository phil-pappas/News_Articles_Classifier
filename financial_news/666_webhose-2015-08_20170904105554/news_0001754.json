I have asked several questions, the responses of which largely inform my decision,\" Peters said. \n\"It is worth noting that the AG's office has previously produced reports regarding financial management at Prasa. I have thus requested the AG's office to look into those past reports and immediately attend to identified areas of concern.\" \nRikhotso said the Prasa board, management, staff and other parties were expected to co-operate with the AG's investigation. \nOn Thursday, former Prasa group CEO Lucky Montana laid fraud charges against a number of Prasa executives. \nOne of the charges relates to a R209m tender to fence Prasa's depots. \nHe opened a fraud, blackmail, and corruption cases against Prasa chair Popo Molefe, and two other Prasa executives. \nMontana was fired from Prasa with immediate effect on July 16. He regards his dismissal as illegal. \nHis removal came amid reports that Prasa had paid R600m for 13 Afro4000 locomotives imported from Spain, which were apparently too high for local conditions and could damage overhead power cables. \nMillions gone \nOn Friday, Netwerk24 reported more than R17m had disappeared from Prasa's coffers. It had apparently been spent on renting land that had been provided to the parastatal for free. \nThis was among the findings contained in a provisional report by the AG on Prasa's finances for the 2014-15 financial year. \nThe AG identified accounting errors in Prasa's books amounting to R4 billion, of which around R790m was irregular expenditure. \nThe R17m spent on rent relates to an operating lease for Prasa's Gibela factory site, near Nigel in Gauteng. The Alstom-led Gibela consortium intends to build a manufacturing facility for Prasa's R51bn passenger coach tender on the site. \nEkurhuleni metro spokesperson Themba Gadebe told Beeld newspaper that a lease agreement between Prasa and the metro, concluded in November last year, stipulated that Prasa was exempted from paying rent for the first two years of the lease period. This was in exchange for the considerable economic benefits the new facility would bring to the metro. \nPublic Protector Thuli Madonsela is busy finalising a report into Prasa. She said on Friday that she has delayed the release of the report to consider further inputs her office received. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T18:28:47.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
