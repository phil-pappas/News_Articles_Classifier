This excludes equity investments worth about 117000 as well as settlement of the final 9 tranche from the sale of the Hayes Creek Uranium assets that is due by 30th October 2015.\n \nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:18:15.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
