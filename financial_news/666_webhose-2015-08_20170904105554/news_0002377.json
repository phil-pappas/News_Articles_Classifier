The new fares would be Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 30, Rs 40 and Rs 50, a Metro official privy to the developments said.\nDelhi Metro Rail Corporation Chief Mangu Singh has repeatedly written to the Ministry of Urban Development since 2012 in this regard, which has administrative control over the body.\nEarlier this year, Retired Justice AK Shrivastava was named as the head of the fare fixation committee, but it was scrapped later.\nDelhi Metro can revise its fares only on recommendation of the three-member committee constituted by the Union government from time to time.\nApart from a person who is or has been a high court judge, the committee comprises of the urban development secretary and Delhi’s finance secretary.\nA Metro official said the fare revision has been “proposed sometime ago but no action has been taken till now. The round figures would also help us tackle the shortage of coins which is rising by the day.”\nFares were last revised in 2009 when the minimum fare was raised from Rs 6 to Rs 8 with the maximum fare being raised to Rs 30 from Rs 22.\nOfficials say, since then there has been more than 94 per cent rise in power tariff.\nDMRC director (operations) Sharat Sharma had also stated that almost 40 per cent of Metro’s overall expenses go towards paying electricity bills.\nFirst Published on August 02, 2015 1:24 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T21:09:14.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
