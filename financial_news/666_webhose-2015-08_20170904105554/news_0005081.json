Reuters Share on twitter by John McDuling Apple Inc held conference calls with Australia's heavyweight bond fund managers on Tuesday morning, ahead of a highly anticipated debt issue that's been the talk of the town this week.\nThe device giant, which happens to be the most valuable and profitable company in history, shed some light on how its business is performing, and explained why it makes sense for a company with a mountain of cash on its books to borrow in Australia .\nApple's representatives told fund managers that while it expects to continue increasing its massive cash pile, it faces \"prohibitively high taxes\" from the US government on the profits it makes overseas, which makes it difficult for the company to repatriate that money to its home market.\nWe already knew this, of course, but it's still cool to hear Apple articulate its extremely sophisticated funding strategy. And the comment on taxes is interesting, since Apple has been heavily criticised for not paying much tax in this country .\nApple's mountain of cash At the end of the last quarter, Apple had amassed more than $US200 billion ($271 billion) in cash on its balance sheet. Some investors in the US, including notorious corporate raiders Carl Icahn and David Einhorn, have complained about Apple hoarding this money.\nSo, to keep them happy, Apple borrows money in the bond market, and uses the proceeds to pay dividends and buy back stock. It usually does this in the US but to keep a lid on interest rates and diversify its funding sources, it's increasingly borrowing in offshore markets such as Europe, Japan, and soon, it seems, Australia.\nIt's an incredibly exciting development for the Australian bond market. Yet fund managers told Fairfax Media that there wasn't really that much earth-shattering information provided by the company on the call. Representatives from Apple said the App Store had a record month, in terms of revenue, in July, and that its new streaming music product, Apple Music, already has 11 million subscribers â€“ two nuggets of information that are already in the market.\nFirst pow-wow a little boring \"There was nothing specific. They talked about their Australian operations, their long presence here but nothing about why they are coming to the Aussie debt market. Except that if they were to do a debt issue here, that any proceeds would be for general corporate purposes, including dividends and buybacks,\" said Perpetual Investments deputy head of fixed income Vivek Prabhu, who was on one of the calls.\nApple wouldn't be drawn on a potential tax holiday in the US that could allow it to return money to the country at no penalty, a person on one of the calls said. There was no information about the maturity or structure of bonds it might issue, either.\nSo Apple's first pow-wow with Aussie investors might have been a little bit boring. But that doesn't mean excitement about an Australian iBond has died down already.\n\"It's very hard to actually find something with a credit rating that's AA+ that's not a financial [company]\", said Aberdeen Asset Management's head of credit research in Asia-Pacific, John Manning. \"So [an iBond] will be very attractive to investors throughout the Asia-Pacific.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/apple-readies-first-australia-bonds-issue-20150817-gj0jom.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/apples-803-million-australian-tax-bill-revealed-20150126-12yrqq.html", "http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/07/apples-app-store-saw-1-7b-in-billings-and-broke-customer-records-in-july/#.mwrpd0:fHOj", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling"], "published": "2015-08-18T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:14:56.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
