Two-thirds of the nearly 180 million population live on less than a dollar a day. \nBuhari has accused the previous administration of Goodluck Jonathan of leaving the treasury \"virtually empty,\" and is struggling to reinvigorate an oil-dependent economy weakened by the halving of crude prices since 2014. \nHe has ordered a review of oil-swap contracts, alleging 250,000 barrels of crude a day were stolen during the previous regime, with the profits going into individual bank accounts. \nThe Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), a New York-based independent watchdog, said in a report earlier this month Nigeria was failing to recover the full value of oil sold by the NNPC amid poorly structured deals and unaccountable spending. \n- 'Shadowy deals' - \n\"Inside NNPC Oil Sales: A Case for Reform in Nigeria\" is described as the first in-depth, independent analysis of the \"complicated and shadowy deals\" through which NNPC sells Nigeria's oil. \nThe report details how the corporation has been increasingly withholding large sums of money from the Nigerian treasury. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) retained an estimated $12.3 billion from the sale of 110 million barrels of oil over 10 years from a single block controlled by a subsidiary, NRGI claims. \nOil buyers are often unqualified intermediaries who capture margins for themselves while adding little value to deals, it said, while oil-for-fuel swap agreements and other contracts are opaque and contain unbalanced terms. \nIn 2013, the treasury received only 58 percent from $16.8 billion worth of oil NNPC had earmarked for its underperforming refineries, NRGI said. \n\"Oil sales are Nigeria's biggest revenue stream, but management has worsened in recent years,\" said Aaron Sayne, co-author of the report. \nAlexandra Gillies, who also worked on the analysis, said the combination of a new government and budgetary shortfalls offered Nigeria \"its best chance in years\" to overhaul NNPC oil deals. \n\"Everyone -- from trading companies to Nigerian citizens -- is waiting to see how the new government will approach these transactions, including the allocation of new export or swap contracts,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T10:32:03.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
