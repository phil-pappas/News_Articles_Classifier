The number of companies in both business parks now totals 269. \nWorld renowned names such as Pfizer Amgen PepsiCo Bayer ThermoFisher and First Solar are located within the free zone providing an innovative community for all businesses looking to utilize the best in class infrastructure and cutting edge research and development facilities. The free zones support both start-ups and international firms looking for a regional base for their Middle East or global operations. \nIn response to continued year-on-year increases in new business partners plans were revealed last year for a new DuBiotech Headquarters to be completed in 2016. The development will consist of two iconic high-rise towers and provide over half a million square feet of office space. \nMarwan Abdulaziz Executive Director of DuBiotech and EnPark said \"New business partner growth at DuBiotech and EnPark continues to rise steadily each year a feat that we are extremely proud of. Our business community is as active and vibrant as ever. The 45 new business partners we welcomed in the past year is a testament to our state of the art facilities and world class business communities. I expect demand to remain strong as the opening of our new Headquarters in 2016 grows closer.\" \nSyed Jafry senior vice president and president Asia-Pacific and Emerging Markets for Thermo Fisher Scientific a biotechnology product development company said\"The opening of our Customer Experience Centre in Dubiotech during April marked an important milestone in our growth strategy in the Middle East. With the help of our trusted channel partners and the wider Dubiotech community we have been able to support our growing regional customer base and their evolving demands.\" \nTECOM Investments announced last year an investment of AED 4.5 billion as part of a broader Dubai National Innovation Strategy. DuBiotech and EnPark both support Dubai's goal of becoming one of the most innovative cities in the world by providing a dynamic and vibrant community for business partners to operate. \n\nWAM/Majok", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T13:17:15.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
