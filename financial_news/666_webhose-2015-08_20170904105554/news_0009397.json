He added he wants to lower taxes for the middle class.\nBiden not sure family ready for run: Joe Biden says he’s uncertain his family has the “emotional fuel” for him to run for president again . The vice president made the comments in a conference call with the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. The call was intended as a pitch for the nuclear containment deal with Iran, the Times writes, but the first question Biden got was about whether he was prepared to join the presidential race. Were he to run, he would “have to be able to commit to all of you that I would be able to give it my whole heart and my whole soul,” Biden said, “and right now, both are pretty well banged up.” Biden has been in mourning for his son Beau, who died on May 30.\nClinton on Biden: Give him space. Hillary Clinton, whom Biden may challenge for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Wednesday Biden should be given “space” to make up his mind about a presidential bid . Clinton also said she hadn’t been making “behind-the-scenes” moves as the vice president mulls a decision, according to National Journal. She said she hadn’t been in touch with Biden privately to discuss 2016, and she is continuing to run her campaign and “do what I believe I should be doing.”\nIran win near: President Barack Obama is on the cusp of winning the votes he needs in Congress to keep the nuclear agreement with Iran on track despite fierce opposition from Republicans, the Financial Times writes. A steady trickle of Democrats has come out in favor of the deal in recent days, giving the White House almost enough votes to prevent Congress from blocking the historic agreement. The Financial Times reports Democratic congressional aides say party leaders are working hard to convince undecided members to support the deal and are still wary new revelations could alter the debate. But they are growing increasingly confident the agreement will survive.\nObama to urge climate action: President Obama travels to New Orleans on Thursday to celebrate the progress made in the 10 years since Hurricane Katrina.

Obama told New Orleans TV station WWL the anniversary should focus national attention on the extreme weather events happening with increasing frequency as global temperatures rise. Louisiana Gov.

Jindal, a Republican, is running for president.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/08/27/celebrating-new-orleans-obama-urges-climate-action/32455279/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/us/politics/joe-biden-isnt-sure-family-is-ready-for-run.html?hpw&rref=politics&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well&_r=0", "http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/hillary-clinton-talks-potential-joe-biden-run-gun-violence-20150826", "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-26/donald-trump-says-he-wants-to-raise-taxes-on-himself", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b5a1706-4c04-11e5-9b5d-89a026fda5c9.html#axzz3k0iILplV"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T15:23:53.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
