Devastation was widespread throughout the city, with floodwaters as high as 12 feet in some areas. Thousands were left homeless in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida by the storm. The 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina is Aug. 29. Above, on Aug. 31, 2005, two days after the storm hit the city, two men paddle in high water near the Claiborne Bridge in the Lower Ninth Ward.\nMario Tama/Getty Images Slide 2 of 13 Ten years later, in the same location, a school bus drops off a student in front of the Claiborne Bridge in the Lower Ninth Ward May 12 in New Orleans.

Cooper housing project in New Orleans practice flips using mattresses two years after the storm. Before Hurricane Katrina, B.W. Cooper held about 1,000 families and was the city’s largest housing project, but ended up more than 80% empty. About 10,000 public housing residents in New Orleans were unable to return to their apartments because of storm damage. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development decided to tear down B.W. Cooper and other major New Orleans housing projects and replace them with mixed income developments.\nMario Tama/Getty Images Slide 8 of 13 In May of this year, rubble remains at the site of where the B.W. Cooper housing projects stood, The low-income housing development will eventually be replaced by two-story, townhouse-style buildings.
