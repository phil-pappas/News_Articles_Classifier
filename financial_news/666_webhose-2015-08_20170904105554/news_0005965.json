Jim Young Share on twitter by Karen Maley As investors watched on with dismay as the US share market slumped overnight , a tweet from bond king Bill Gross highlighted the growing risks from the deepening emerging markets crisis.\nGross: Emerging Market currency debacle. Deflationary winds becoming stronger. Risk assets at risk.\nâ€” Janus Capital (@JanusCapital) August 6, 2015 Janus Capital @ JanusCapital\nThe US share market's decline reflects woes in the media sector, as investors worry that viewers are cancelling their cable subscriptions and instead turning to the Internet for their viewing. These fears are stripping the glamour from former US share market darlings such as Viacom, Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox.\nBut the sell-off is also fuelled by fears that next month the US Federal Reserve might lift its key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade. Earlier this week, Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said he believed the US economy was ready for such a move , and there was a \"high bar right now to not acting\".\nBut as Gross, who founded the giant bond fund PIMCO before his acrimonious departure to join Janus Capital last year, notes in his tweet, the US market's weakness also reflects the carnage in emerging market currencies which are suffering their biggest decline since the financial crisis.\nSlowing growth in China, the world's second-largest economy, has caused the prices of commodities, such as oil and copper, to tumble. This has led to steep drops in the currencies of commodity producers such as Brazil, Russia, Malaysia and South Africa that are heavily dependent on raw material exports. This nervousness has spread to the currencies of other emerging markets such as Turkey and South Korea.\n At the same time, foreign investors, worried about the steep slide in emerging market currencies and believing that US rates could be headed higher, have started pulling capital out of these markets. And this has put pressure on emerging market share markets. The MSCI Emerging Market Index slid a further 0.7 per cent overnight to hit a fresh 52-week low, having now lost 16.2 per cent in the past year.\nAt the same time, the withdrawal of foreign capital has pushed emerging market bond yields higher, which feeds into higher borrowing costs for both governments and companies in these countries.\nBut Gross's tweet also points to the vicious circle at work. The plunge in emerging market currencies makes their exports even cheaper, fanning deflationary pressures in the US and the rest of the developed world. What's more, as the spike in borrowing costs slows growth in these countries, their demand for imports shrinks, forcing producers in countries such as the United States and Europe to cut prices in order to boost sales.\nThis puts the Federal Reserve in an awful dilemma as it weighs up whether to raise interest rates next month. Gross argues that the US central bank is becoming uncomfortably aware that its policy of keeping US rates close to zero is creating distortions in financial markets, while failing to boost economic growth.\nAs a result, the US central bank is inclined to raise its key interest rates at its September 16-17 meeting , even though there is no sign of any inflationary pressures. Instead, the problems in emerging markets are once again raising the spectre of deflation in global markets.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JanusCapital", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm", "https://twitter.com/KarenMaley", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=629314515847397376", "https://twitter.com/JanusCapital/status/629314515847397376"], "published": "2015-08-07T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:07:34.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
