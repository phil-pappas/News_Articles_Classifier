This is not new to the Egyptian society, as the contemporary history shows the depth and the penetration of the idea of participation in the Egyptian national fabric, which clearly appeared during the construction of the High Dam, the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and the revolutions of January 25,2011 and June 30, 2013. \nHowever, professor of geography Dr. Gamal Hamdan confirmed, in his book \"The Suez Canal ...The Pulse of Egypt\" (1975), that the canal, to a great extent, is considered the history of modern Egypt, it could be argued that the new Suez Canal is the most accurate expression of the reality of the situation in contemporary Egypt, which managed to change the hard times into great expectations. \nIf the inauguration day of the new canal crowns a year of firm determination to achieve broad goals, yet, in fact, it is considered a beginning of a new phase of the national action based on the investment of this vital artery to push the comprehensive development with its economic and social dimensions. \nChairman of State Information Service \nAmbassador/ Salah Abdel-Sadeq", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T22:47:55.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
