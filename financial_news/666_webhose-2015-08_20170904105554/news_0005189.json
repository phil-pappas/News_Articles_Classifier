In July, Hillary Clinton finally rolled out her solution, a targeted overhaul on capital gains taxes aimed at incentivizing investors to think long-term. \nUnfortunately, it’s a dud. \nFor top income earners, the only bracket Clinton’s proposal would affect, capital gains are currently taxed as income (at 43.4%, including the 3.8% investment income surtax) if investors sell in less than a year, with a steep drop-off to 23.8% for all investments held longer. Clinton’s proposal would extend the period of time that investments qualify as income out to two years, with a tiered system eventually declining to a 23.8% tax rate after six.

Calling it “quarterly capitalism,” Clinton has joined an increasing number of economists who argue that companies have become far too concerned with elevating their own share prices to the detriment of long-term investments such as equipment, research and employee pay. \nEconomist William Lazonick, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, characterizes this plan in terms of shifted incentives. Increasingly since the 1980s, he explained, executives have become compensated with stock packages, and the rules on individual shareholders have been loosened. Today once-unusual practices like stock buybacks (when a company purchases large volumes of its own stocks from the public market) are commonplace as investors demand the highest return on their investment in a relatively short period of time. \nLazonick is one of many economists who argue that this has become a primary reason for growing inequality and wage stagnation. Companies only have so much capital, and the more they spend on keeping stock prices elevated quarter-to-quarter, the less they have left for anything (or anyone) else. \nSometimes it can lead to outright plundering, as many argued when the Tribune Company was pushed into bankruptcy by a massive stock buyback that enriched its top shareholders. \nThe companies themselves rarely even benefit from their immense investment into elevated share prices. Despite the popular image of stock price as a barometer of a company’s health it’s relatively easily manipulated, at least over short periods. And, as Berkeley economist Alan Auerbach explained, in the long term a company mainly benefits from a high stock price in the relatively rare event that it wants to raise capital by issuing new shares. \nA plan to fix quarterly capitalism would actually make a real difference in the lives of average Americans by helping to push corporate assets back into more productive channels such as research, purchasing and wages. \nThis plan won’t get that job done. It’s not ambitious enough, it’s just a piece of social engineering masquerading as a tweak to the tax code. \nRaising the income threshold for top-end earners will certainly bring in some new revenue for the government, but it won’t catch the attention of most short-term traders. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:49:03.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
