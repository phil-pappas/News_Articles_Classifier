Regardless, the region's news remained on the positive side... allowing the DAX and CAC to maintain the growth,\" said Spreadex analyst Connor Campell. \nAccording to the new figures, the Greek economy posted zero growth in the first quarter of the year after having contracted 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2014 -- thus averting two periods of decline that would constitute a recession. \nThe figures showed second quarter growth up 1.4 percent compared with the same period the previous year. \nThe data comes as Greek lawmakers hold an emergency parliament session Thursday for a crucial vote on ratifying a hurriedly concluded bailout deal, but Germany -- Europe's defacto paymaster -- has cast doubt on the agreement. \nGreece and its creditors are under pressure to finalise the 85 billion euro ($94.8 billion) deal by August 20 when Athens must repay some 3.4 billion euros to the European Central Bank. \nIn New York, Wall Street stocks opened modestly higher Thursday after a report showing solid US retail sales in July spurred speculation that the Federal Reserve could soon hike interest rates. \nFive minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 0.04 percent up at 17,409.39 points. \nThe broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.06 percent to 2,087.25 points, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.35 percent to 5,062.06. \nOverall US retail sales rose 0.6 percent in July from June to $446.5 billion, a slightly bigger increase than the 0.5 percent gain projected by analysts, according to the Commerce Department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:25:48.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
