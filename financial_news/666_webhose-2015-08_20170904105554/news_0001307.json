By Sophie Jamieson | Telegraph – 57 minutes ago SVLPF 15.41 \nSinger Taylor Swift is rumoured to be purchasing an eight bedroom castle in Perthshire, Scotland, to be near her beau Calvin Harris \nThis is the £4.6m Perthshire castle that Taylor Swift is rumoured to be buying to be closer to her Scottish boyfriend Calvin Harris. \nThe US singer is expected to sign on the dotted line for the sprawling eight bedroom property , which comes with a swimming pool, two tennis courts and a private golf course. \nThe multi-million pound price tag should not be a problem for Ms Swift, who earned an estimated £41m in 2014 alone . \nOK! magazine in the US reported that the 25-year-old fell in love with the property “the minute she saw it”. \nWith its fairytale turrets, Tower of Lethendy is reminiscent of the Disney-style castle that featured in the video for her hit single Love Story. \nThe location, seven miles from the nearest station, would provide a secluded getaway for Ms Swift, who has admitted walking backwards in the past to shield her face from paparazzi lenses. \nThe property, marketed by Savills (Other OTC: SVLPF - news ) as the “ultimate Scottish residence”, is believed to be near to Calvin Harris’s parents’ home. Swift has been dating the Scottish DJ since earlier this year and told fans at a gig in Glasgow: \"I happen to love Scottish people, personally.\" \nThe home comes with 39 acres of land near the Grampian mountains and the Vale of Strathmore. \nLiving on the estate, the Shake it Off singer could take up some traditional Scottish pastimes, from salmon fishing on the River Tay to grouse shooting in the Highlands and skiing on the nearby slopes of Aviemore and Glenshee. \nThe rural estate even has its own 18-hole golf course, as well as two gate lodges and two cottages in the grounds. \nInside, the house is equally opulent with a billiards room, sweeping staircase and sauna and massage room. \nA spokesman for Savills said the estate agents would not comment on speculation so could not confirm or deny whether Swift had an interest in the property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T16:30:18.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
