Indicatively, trade sources estimate kharif pulses’ production at 5.3 million tonne and rabi pulses at 2.2 million tonne which add up to 7.5 million tonne for the crop year 2014-15, a decline of 2.28 million tonne over last year. Sumer Singh Rajput, official in charge of pulses at the Agriculture Research Centre, Jalgaon, says the late sowing and poor rains are likely to affect productivity.\nAs per data available with the Agriculture Department, in the kharif season, usually around 22,46 lakh hectares come under pulse production. This year too a target of 25 lakh hectares was set. However, around 17 lakh hectares came under cultivation and resowing operations also have not been very successful, officials said.\nThe area under tur dal has gone down by 15%, urad dal by 45% and moong dal by 32%. Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar districts has 60% area coming under pulses. Marathawada, Latur, Osmanabad regions have 67% area under pulses.\nOfficials said productivity could also drop to less than 20 kg per acre for moong dal. Less prodcutivity is expected for tur dal as well. At present, the prices of tur dal have touched R9,000 per quintal while both urad and moong have touched figures of Rs 100 per kg.\n 26, 2015 12:06 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:55:09.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
