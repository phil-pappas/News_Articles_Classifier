Picture: Macca\nThe local market had been shaping up for another horror show after America’s benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 3.6 per cent overnight on Monday and European bourses suffered average falls of about 4.7 per cent.\nInstead, Australia proved the glittering jewel of the Asia Pacific, leaving in its wake Japan’s Nikkei, down 4 per cent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, up just 0.7 per cent.\nAnalysts said China’s government appeared to have bitten the bullet on attempting to prop up shares, conceding the move was proving too costly.\nCMC Markets chief strategist Michael McCarthy said the swift recovery on the ASX 200 indicated investors had their eyes on America’s stuttering bull market rather than China’s economic slowdown.\n“It is not weakness in China that is driving the global sell-off. It is the fact that the US share market has run without a correction since the first quarter of 2012 ... that’s a very long period without a breather,” Mr McCarthy said.\nMontgomery Fund chief investment officer Roger Montgomery said the volatility meant the US Federal Reserve would be unlikely to lift interest rates next month and risk derailing its economic revival.\nAt home, the Reserve Bank also appears locked into record-low rates, albeit with a small chance of a further cut before January. “As disappointing as it sounds, central banks are listening to the markets,” Mr Montgomery said.\n“There is a concern that if share markets fall, consumers are less inclined to borrow and spend money.”\nChina’s growing pains have dominated headlines but ANZ chief executive Mike Smith, who has spearheaded the lender’s push into Asia, said he wasn’t concerned.\n“Fundamentally, looking at the medium and long term, China has still got huge potential ... should we be worried about it? I don’t think so,” he told a conference on Tuesday.\nOn Tuesday, China’s central bank said it injected 150 billion yuan ($32.1 billion) into money markets, giving banks more freedom to lend cash in hope of stimulating investment.\npaul.gilder@news.com.au\nWITH AAP\n ASX 200 leads way in $37 billion bounceback", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/08/25/1227498/676884-e0bbb374-4b04-11e5-ba64-b40512aab75c.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/asx-200-leads-way-in-37-billion-bounceback/story-fni0dcne-1227498677331"], "published": "2015-08-26T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T17:29:12.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
