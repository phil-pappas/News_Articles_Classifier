During a stop in Singapore, Kerry said that the Southeast Asian nation is an “important strategic partner” in not only the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but also in the broader rebalance of the United States toward the Pacific Rim. ADVERTISEMENT “The United States will continue to work with our partners to promote a stable, rules-based order for the Asia Pacific, and the TPP will spur momentum in that effort,” Kerry said during remarks at Singapore Management University. He praised Singapore's leaders for teaming up with the United States on some of the region’s toughest issues, from climate change and energy policy to international trade and security in the South China Sea. He argued that the completion of the TPP represents more than simply raising global trading standards. “It will send a message to people within the TPP and outside of support for good governance, transparency, accountability,” Kerry said. “It will bear witness to what we have seen in both Singapore and the United States — that sustainable development and prosperity are nurtured by the freedom to innovate, experiment and compete economically on a level and open playing field.”To that end, Kerry outlined a multi-pronged plan for the region that includes higher quality U.S. investment, setting clean energy goals, better connecting a growing middle class to global markets, improving economic prospects for women and tackling the region's lack of infrastructure. Kerry also announced the launch of a U.S. program that will help the region's young entrepreneurs as well as government officials to support them. The first stops for a U.S. delegation will be Indonesia and Vietnam.Since Obama began the “pivot” to Asia in 2009, the United States has ramped up its engagement in the region from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. “After all, the United States is also a Pacific nation,” Kerry said. “We have been for centuries, and we are proud of that. And we know that our security and our prosperity are increasingly linked to this region.”Kerry said TPP negotiators made progress — but didn't complete — an agreement during the latest round of talks that ended Friday in Hawaii, delivering a blow to President Obama’s plans to complete his trade agenda before leaving office in 2017. “So we have to face the world and all its challenges, frankly, with the confidence in the road we have traveled, in who we are, in our ability to compete,” he said. “I think Singapore understands this,\" he said. \"And I am confident as I look around this room today and I look at the purpose and the investment of this institution of learning, we will create stronger partnerships, we will move toward more sustainable growth, more prosperity, more opportunity, and we will be able to do that not for some, but for all of the people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T12:38:18.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
