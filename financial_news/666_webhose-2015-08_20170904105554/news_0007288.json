Wall Street was expected to open firmly in red again later having already lost more than 2.5 percent this week. \nEurope's bourses were also being beaten up. The pan-regional FTSEurofirst was down more than 1.5 percent as traders shrugged off some reassuringly solid euro zone manufacturing and services data in a third straight day of selling. \nBritain's FTSE 100 was 1.2 percent lower, Germany's DAX, which is having its worst month since 2011, was down just under 1.4 percent and France's CAC 40 was off 1.1 percent. \n\"Markets are going to continue to be somewhat disappointed by the implications for Chinese growth ... and I don't have a great deal of comfort to offer there,\" said Michael Kurtz, Global Head of Equity Strategy at Nomura. \nIn the FX markets, the euro regained some of its overnight momentum having been pushed to a two-month high by those looking to get out of battered Asian currencies and China proxies such as the Aussie and Hong Kong dollars. \nThe latest rout had been triggered as the Caixin/Markit manufacturing index showed activity in China's factory sector shrinking at its fastest pace in almost 6 1/2 years in August as domestic and export demand dwindled. \nThat decline, coming on the heels of weaker-than-expected data in July, plus this month's turbulent changes in the yuan , and a brutal stock market plunge, heightened fears. \nShanghai stocks dropped 4 percent to below the 200-day moving average for the first time since July 2014. That brought losses for the week to 11 percent. \nThe Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was down 2.4 percent for a weekly loss of 7.4 percent. Japan's Nikkei declined 2.9 percent, 5.2 percent on the week. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) all left MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) emerging markets index at its weakest in four years and the 45-country \"All World\" index down more than 3.2 percent on the week and heading for its worst of 2015 so far. \nPRECIOUS GAINS \nChina's woes continued to roil commodities. Oil resumed its downward trend. U.S. crude was at a more than 6-year low, on track for its eight straight weekly decline as it slipped 0.5 percent to $41. Brent nudged $46 a barrel. \nOil's torrid run of weekly losses is its worst since 1986 when OPEC ramped up production and sent it as low as $10 a barrel. \nAmong currencies it was a similar story. The Australian dollar, considered a liquid proxy for China demand, slid to $0.7285 at one point and was last trading at $0.7335, down 0.2 percent for the day. \nThe Malaysian ringgit MYR= hit a pre-peg 17-year low and South Korea's won fell again to take its losses to 1.8 percent against the dollar this week. \n\"The perfect storm that has enveloped EM local markets looks set to continue,\" analysts for Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a note. \nAll the market ructions sent gold, seen as a good asset to hold in difficult times, to its highest level in more than a month. \nSafe-haven U.S. Treasury yields also slipped further. They were already feeling a downward pull after minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting this week offered little clue of a near-term rate hike. \n\"The U.S. markets have held up well of late, being viewed as somewhat of a safe haven,\" wrote Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) in Melbourne. \"This view seems to have deteriorated somewhat with the S&P 500 closing below its multi-month trading range - a fate the credit markets and the U.S. yield curve have been screaming for some time.\" \nLower Treasury yields and the stronger euro in turn weighed on the dollar. The currency traded at 122.68 yen, the lowest in more than five weeks, after sinking from an overnight high of 124.16. It was at Â£1.1278 to the euro.
