Today they generally get delivered to our email accounts. If you are one of the few fortunate ones who still has pen-friends who send you postcards, this post is for you. Instead of having those boring mailboxes, we teach you how to upgrade your old letter box and turn it into a classy mail holder. \nMaterials needed \nShovel Wood Cement mix Cast stone post Old mail box Spray paint Screws Address sign \nMethod \nStep 1 \nIt’s best to place your mail box in your lawn. So the first thing you will need to do is to dig a 4×4 deep hole using a shovel. It doesn’t need to be perfect, just deep enough to hold a log of wood. Once the hole has been dug, place the wood and secure it with some cement. \nCheck for instructions that come with the ready to mix cement and prepare a mixture. Once the cement is ready, pour the concrete mixture into the hole around the log and secure it. Let is sit for over an hour or until it has hardened. \nStep 2 \nUsing a spirit level, check the level of the log which has to be straight. Now either you could paint the wooden log, cover it with pebbles or hide it using a store bought cast stone mail post. If you are purchasing one from a store then remember to check its size. \nNow carry the cast stone post and place it over the log and secure it well. If your post is bigger – you could fill it up using the remaining concrete mixture. Now place the cap stone on the top and let is dry overnight. \nStep 3 \nNow give your old mail box a makeover by spray painting it with some bright colors. Using some screws, place your mail box onto the post and secure it. Now you could either spray paint your address or put up a signboard that has your address on it. \nSo instead of sending your loved ones ‘emails’ how about sending them postcards or letters, so you could wait for a mail too! \nNidhi C Thacker for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: http://www.beneathmyheart.net/2013/04/mailbox-makeover-improving-curb-appeal/ Don't have an account yet? - Register now Ask the Experts Get your Personal Finance queries answered Select Topic If I put Rs 2 lakh in PPF, how much tax rebate I will get?
