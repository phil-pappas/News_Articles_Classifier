Source: News Corp Australia\n“Many banks, building societies and credit unions offer transaction accounts which allow you to use their ATMs free of charge. Some allow you to use other banks’ ATMs free of charge,” he says.\nPlanning in advance will reduce the fee impact. Private machines at pubs, cinemas and shops are usually going to charge you more than a bank ATM.\n“Visit your bank’s website to find out where the closest ATMs are to your home, workplace and places where you often withdraw money, such as shopping malls,” Larbey says.\nPeople’s Choice Credit Union spokesman Stuart Symons says it’s often cheaper to withdraw cash when making EFTPOS transactions.\n“Depending on the retailer, there may be a limit to how much cash you can take out,” he says.\nHow much is that $50 withdrawal actually costing you? Source: Supplied\nDon’t use your credit card for withdrawing cash at an EFTPOS terminal as you are likely to be hit with cash advance fees and high interest rates, Symons says.\nIf you splash cash regularly and use ATMs too much, schedule larger regular withdrawals to avoid many smaller unplanned ones.\nGoing digital is another option, Symons says. “Think about whether you really need cash and consider a digital alternative. Contactless payments with your card or mobile phone are perfect for purchases under $100 that you would typically pay cash for, like your morning coffee.”\nASIC’s Larbey says there is no reason to stick with your existing back account if you are unhappy with excessive fees. “It is now easier than ever to switch to an account that has lower fees, easier access, better service or a higher interest rate on savings ,” he says.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+to+beat+pesky+ATM+fees&c=YOU+may+be+paying+up+to+%24500+a+year+in+ATM+fees.+There+are+ways+to+keep+the+convenience+but+cut+the+costs.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/pay-fewer-fees-when-withdrawing-from-atms/story-fnagkbpv-1227473821023?sv=8146b748f47de67c7ee0a25021e33874", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/guide/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=avoid-atm-fees", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/pay-fewer-fees-when-withdrawing-from-atms/story-fnagkbpv-1227473821023?sv=8146b748f47de67c7ee0a25021e33874", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/credit-cards#itm_t=story&itm_l=avoid-atm-fees", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/banking#itm_t=story&itm_l=avoid-atm-fees", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/pay-fewer-fees-when-withdrawing-from-atms/story-fnagkbpv-1227473821023?sv=8146b748f47de67c7ee0a25021e33874", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/banking/debit-card#itm_t=story&itm_l=avoid-atm-fees", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/pay-fewer-fees-when-withdrawing-from-atms/story-fnagkbpv-1227473821023?sv=8146b748f47de67c7ee0a25021e33874&title=How+to+beat+pesky+ATM+fees", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/pay-fewer-fees-when-withdrawing-from-atms/story-fnagkbpv-1227473821023?sv=8146b748f47de67c7ee0a25021e33874&h=How+to+beat+pesky+ATM+fees", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/pay-fewer-fees-when-withdrawing-from-atms/story-fnagkbpv-1227473821023?sv=8146b748f47de67c7ee0a25021e33874&title=How+to+beat+pesky+ATM+fees"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T17:04:38.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
