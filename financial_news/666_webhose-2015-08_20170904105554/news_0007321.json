They began collecting such ephemera in 1991, and have turned their enterprise into an unlikely cottage industry, a celebration of the Middle American random—from home movies to gonzo commercials and instructional videos. The program focuses on eccentrics, with live commentary from Messrs. Pickett and Prueher.\nENLARGE The Quay Brothers’ ‘Street of Crocodiles’ (1986) Photo: Zeitgeist Films The Quay Brothers in 35mm\nFilm Forum\n209 W. Houston St., (212) 727-8110\nThrough Aug. 25\nChristopher Nolan curates a selection of three films by Philadelphia’s innovative stop-motion animators the Quay Brothers—Stephen and Timothy—to be shown in 35mm. The program includes Mr. Nolan’s short film, “Quay,” which takes viewers inside the studio run by the identical twin artists, along with the brothers’ “Comb” (1991), “In Absentia” (2000) and “Street of Crocodiles” (1986)—each a disturbing and fascinating foray into the uncanny. The Quays will be present at 7 p.m. screenings Thursday through Saturday.\nENLARGE Carlen Altman in ‘The Color Wheel’ (20112), directed by Alex Ross Perry Photo: Cinema Conservancy The Films of Alex Ross Perry\nMuseum of the Moving Image\n36-01 35th Ave, Queens, (718) 777-6888\nSaturday—Tuesday\nBrooklyn filmmaker Alex Ross Perry is all over the city this week, leading up to Wednesday’s release of his psychodrama “Queen of Earth,” which he and star Elisabeth Moss will preview at a four-film retrospective of Mr. Perry’s sophisticated, vitriolic character studies. On Monday, he also presents and discusses Joseph Losey’s “Secret Ceremony” at IFC Center. The “sight unseen” event is the first time the director has glimpsed the 1968 movie, which parallels his own, with Mia Farrow and Elizabeth Taylor as two women who share a strange bond isolated in an old mansion.\nENLARGE Krisha Fairchild plays the title character in ‘Krisha,’ directed by Trey Edward Shults.

First up is “Krisha,” a bracingly sharp debut feature by Trey Edward Shults that took both the Grand Jury and Audience prizes at this year’s South by Southwest film festival. Krisha Fairchild (the director’s aunt) commits feverishly to the title role: a black sheep gingerly reuniting with estranged family at a Thanksgiving gathering. Every ticking moment brings the movie closer to a train wreck, anticipated with technical polish and wicked turns of dialogue. Saturday’s closing night event features farewell-themed short films at Industry City in Sunset Park.\n‘Being Evel’\nVillage East Cinema\n181-189 Second Ave., (212) 529-6998\nFriday—Aug. 27\nLike some caped superhero, the daredevil motorcyclist Evel Knievel (1938-2007) electrified audiences in the 1960s and ‘70s with his improbable jumps, including a failed 1974 leap across the Snake River Canyon in a steam-powered rocket called the Skycycle X-2. Director Daniel Junge (“Saving Face”) explores the dark and wild life of a self-made American icon in appropriately entertaining fashion, blending archival thrills with commentary from the likes of George Hamilton (who played the risk-taking rider in a 1971 biopic) and superfan Johnny Knoxville, also one of the documentary’s producers.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX604_NYFILM_P_20150819125130.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX604_NYFILM_M_20150819125130.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX615_NYFILM_P_20150819125609.jpg", "http://www.movingimage.us/", "http://www.bam.org/BAMcinematek", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX615_NYFILM_M_20150819125609.jpg", "https://www.citycinemas.com/villageeast/showtimes-and-tickets/now-playing", "http://rooftopfilms.com/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX603_NYFILM_M_20150819124959.jpg", "http://www.foundfootagefest.com/", "http://filmforum.org/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX603_NYFILM_P_20150819124959.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-20T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:00:51.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
