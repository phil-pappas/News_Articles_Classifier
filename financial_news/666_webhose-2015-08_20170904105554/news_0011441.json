We just have to watch…,” she said.\nIn the recently released annual report, RBI raised concerns over lower-than-expected monsoon and said it could have an impact on the growth and inflation outlook.\nTalking about the economy, Bhattacharya said the country is now moving off the bottom.\n“We had come down very sharply on account of very many reasons. And, I think slowly we are working through those road blocks. We are de-blocking many-may of things that were stopping our road and I think it will slowly pick-up,” she said.\nBhattacharya, however, also said there was no magic wand and it was better that improvement in macroeconomic parameters happen slowly and steadily.\n 28, 2015 10:01 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T03:25:45.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
