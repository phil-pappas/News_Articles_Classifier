Or is it possible to use a corporate trustee for an SMSF without the annual and ongoing company compliance and costs?\nA: While a company that is a trustee of a self-managed super fund is governed by corporations law, a tax file number (TFN) and Australian business number (ABN) are not required. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission also charges trustee companies a reduced annual fee of just $46 a year.\nGST registration is also unnecessary unless you have commercial rental income in excess of $75,000 a year, as you will be collecting GST. This excludes rental income from residential property and income from share dividends.\nMost accountants will recommend a company structure as it provides the best protection and most flexibility for the fund. For example, under the new penalty regime, the trustee may be fined. With individual trustees, each individual (up to four members) may be fined so the corporate structure provides some protection and cost minimisation.\nAlso, it is much easier to replace a member under a corporate structure than with individual trustees.\nIt is worth discussing the advantages and disadvantages of both structures with your accountant or administrator to help you decide the best one for you and your family.\n Q: My wife and I are both 58 and retired with our DIY super fund in pension mode. I have a balance of about $1 million, 40 per cent of which is tax free. When I turn 60 I'd like to withdraw about $600,000 and add this to the proceeds from selling our old home so that we can live in a new, low-maintenance apartment.\nCan I just withdraw the 60 per cent taxable component (about $600,000) and resume the pension on the leftover tax-free component, or do I have to withdraw $600,000 in the ratio of tax-free to taxable assets now in the fund?\nA: Unfortunately you will be required to withdraw your taxable component in proportion to your non-taxable component. Fortunately, at age 60 you won't pay any tax on your super fund withdrawal but no doubt you are trying to reduce your taxable component and maximise your non-taxable component for estate planning purposes (that is, to avoid the quasi death tax when assets are passed on to independent adult children at death).\nBut here's a thought: assuming you are 60 and have reached a condition of release (over 55 and retired, for you), there is no restriction on how much you cash out of super. You may also contribute to super without having to meet the work test while you are younger than 65.\nSo, why not cash out 100 per cent of your super ($1 million), pay no tax and recontribute $400,000 as a non-concessional amount back into your fund? You are eligible to make up to a $540,000 non-concessional contribution to super using the three-year bring-forward rule. The $600,000 can still be used to fund the new unit.\nThis would ensure your super remains non-taxable in the future, thus avoiding a virtual death tax when your independent adult children inherit the balance in the fund.\nAnother alternative for SMSF trustees came about in 2007 when the government introduced the $1 million contribution to super. Some trustees set up a second do-it-yourself fund to take the $1 million non-concessional contributions, ensuring these would remain tax free forever.\nQ: Can I set up a self-managed super fund if I am an Australian citizen working overseas and can I set one up before I begin working overseas and keep it? I am looking at doing one or the other in order to buy a house in the fund. Also, does it complicate it or make it easier in terms of the SMSF if my wife remains in Australia?\nA: The Australian Tax Office needs to ensure that central management control of the SMSF remains domiciled in Australia. You may travel overseas for up to two years or even longer but the Tax Office would want to see the fund being managed in Australia. Your wife may take that role.\nThese are the questions that you will need to answer with your accountant or adviser. It is important that they define each of the terms for you so know and understand your options:\nWas the fund established in Australia? Is central management control of the fund ordinarily in Australia? and Do Australian residents hold at least 50 per cent of the superannuation interests or funds? If your answer to these questions is no, you will need to close the fund and roll it into an industry or retail fund.\nAnother alternative may be to consider a small APRA fund and have an external trustee and administrator act for you until you return.\nOr you could get someone to act in your place via a power of attorney structure, thus abdicating your role as a trustee. This could be a family member or friend but they would need to be up to speed with the laws and regulations of operating the fund.\nFinancial planner and Henderson Maxwell chief executive Sam Henderson will be answering your questions while The Australian Financial Review's veteran DIY superannuation columnist John Wasiliev is on indefinite medical leave.
