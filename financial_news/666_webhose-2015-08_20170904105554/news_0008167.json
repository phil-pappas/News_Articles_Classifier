A recent selloff saw Alerian briefly touch under $14 a share — the fund’s lowest level since it launched in August 2010. As a result, the fund now yields about 7.6% annually.\nOil futures signal weak prices could last years (3:33) Congress may lift a ban on oil exports in September, which could impact the economy and global oil market as oil futures continue to look bleak.

But remember, these companies are basically pass-through entities where the profits are delivered directly to “unitholders” in the partnership. That means a growing level of distributions indicates better cash flows and a healthier underlying business.\nViewed this way, it’s puzzling that MarkWest Energy Partners LP MWE, +3.13% has hiked its distribution from 76 cents quarterly at the start of 2012 to 92 cents now — a 21% increase in less than four years — while shares are actually slightly in the red over that time frame due to recent declines.\nSimilarly, pipeline giant Energy Transfer Partners ETP, +0.26% has seen distributions increase from 89.38 cents in mid-2013 to $1.035 currently — a roughly 16% jump in two years — while the stock is down by double-digits in the past 24 months.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T15:28:37.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
