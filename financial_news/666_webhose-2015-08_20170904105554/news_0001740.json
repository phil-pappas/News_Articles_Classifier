That is why we are pushing other member states - and the whole of the EU - to address this problem at root.\" \nSeveral people have been killed trying to enter Britain, where they believe they have better prospects of a new life. \nThe joint (NasdaqCM: JYNT - news ) plea came as Britain, where the crisis is heaping pressure on Prime Minister David Cameron to take action, detailed some of the extra security measures agreed with French President Francois Hollande on Friday. \nCameron's office said Britain would fund a significant boost in the number of private security guards patrolling the French entrance to the Eurotunnel (Paris: FR0010533075 - news ) -operated under-sea rail link. New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) fences, security cameras and infra-red detectors would also be used to improve security. \nFrench authorities have already increased the number of police in the area. \nThe official response to the crisis was on Sunday criticised as lacking humanity by Church of England Bishop Trevor Willmott, whose diocese covers the English side of the 30 kilometre (18.64 miles) sea channel separating the countries. \n\"We've become an increasingly harsh world, and when we become harsh with each other and forget our humanity then we end up in these stand-off positions,\" Willmott said in an interview with the Observer newspaper. \nBritain and France said their efforts were not limited to beefing up security, and that they had led efforts to break up the criminal gangs who seek to profit from the flow of migrants. \n\"Ultimately, the long-term answer to this problem lies in reducing the number of migrants who are crossing into Europe from Africa,\" May and Cazeneuve wrote. \n\"Many see Europe, and particularly Britain, as somewhere that offers the prospect of financial gain. This is not the case - our streets are not paved with gold.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T13:34:34.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
