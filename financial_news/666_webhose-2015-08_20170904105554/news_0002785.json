Following last weekâ€™s dip to 3.98% the new survey posted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) saw a decrease of an additional seven basis points to come in at 3.91%. Obviously this is good news to consumers as many posted an increase in mortgage applications as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America (MBA). Those figures were a 5% increase in reviewing week over week data. \n\"Despite recent concerns about the economy, both purchase and refinance applications increased strongly in response to lower interest rates last week. Refinance activity was the highest since May when rates were last at this level. The increase in purchase activity was also notable for this time of year, up 23 percent relative to a year ago.\" Lynn Fisher, MBA's Vice President of Research and Economics. \nThe rates reported are for the benchmark 30 year fixed rate mortgage. Across other product lines rates fell as well, as the popular 15 year mortgage dropped to 3.13%. The drop in rates is within the range of typical movement, however for many the trend or direction is the barometer used in measuring consumer appetite. \nAll Eyes on July Jobs Report \nPrior to the announcement of the July employment report some experts pointed to the overall economy on why the rates fell. \n\"All eyes are on the upcoming July employment report, as the Fed has made it clear developments in the labor market will affect the timing of any potential rate hike. But early signals indicate Friday's employment report will not look so good. The employment cost index rose 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the lowest quarterly increase in its 33-year history and ADP's Private Employment Report missed expectations for private jobs in July. Uncertainty about the economy helped drive down Treasury yields early in the week, and thus mortgage rates fell 7 basis points to 3.91 percent, the lowest level since June 4th.\" Sean Becketti, chief economist Freddie Mac \nCoincidently, following yesterday's release of the jobs report the attitude was while the numbers missed analyst expectations the decrease in jobs was not enough to raise major concerns. Many still see rates rising, although slightly in the weeks ahead. \nFreddie Mac and MBA post weekly survey data which is highly popular among industry professionals as well as consumers. The data is compiled from their broad lineup of clients across the nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T23:00:35.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
