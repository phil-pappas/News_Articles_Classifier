Jim Rice Share on twitter by Michael Smith There has been a lot of noise over the past week around plans to cut Myer's brands and permanent staff numbers.\nThis will be just the tip of the iceberg as new chief Richard Umbers finalises a new strategy to ensure the country's biggest network of department stores has a future.\nThe new strategic direction , which will also see Myer reduce its store footprint over time, will not be announced until after the retailer posts full-year results in September. For now it is business as usual as the company prepares to stage its spring summer fashion show in Sydney next week.\nStaff, unions unhappy Staff and unions are understandably not happy about plans to reduce permanent staff in 42 stores and cut the hours of part-time staff, warning service standards will deteriorate further .\nMyer is wrapping up applications for voluntary redundancies this week.\nBut Myer has a greater percentage of full-time staff than other department store groups and says this needs to come down so it can improve its service by having a more flexible workforce. About 11.5 per cent of Myer's total sales staff are full-time workers, according to Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency data for 2013-14. This said 44.6 per cent were part-time, while 44 per cent were casual.\nDavid Jones , which is owned by Woolworths Holdings of South Africa, has not provided a break-down. The EOWA figures suggest its percentage of full-time staff was 1.4 per cent at the time, which was before David Jones' change of ownership, with part-time contract making up 74.9 per cent and casuals making up 23.8 per cent of the sales workforce.\n But more recent data suggests around 70 per cent of the David Jones' sales workforce are part-time permanent staff who work between 25 and 37 hours a week. While 1.1 per cent of sales staff were permanent, about 70.2 per cent were part-time and 28.7 per cent casual.\nWoolworths Holdings chief Ian Moir has outlined plans to increase the number of full-time sales staff at David Jones, and says improved service helped lift sales in the second half. But David Jones is doing this off a lower base than Myer, which had more full-time sales staff at the time.\n\"When you look at the proportion of permanent staff we have in a lot of our stores it is way out of kilter with what you need to run a store,\" Myer chairman Paul McClintock says.\n\"The program is very targeted, it is only some stores, everyone can be reassured we all know everything we are trying to do with Myer going forward is built on better service. We would much prefer to take the bottom line down than compromise on the service which we know has to get better, not worse.\"\nOverhaul overdue If Myer's current level of service was exemplary there might be a case for not changing things. But it isn't and Umbers and McClintock know it must improve. Flexibility is the key and Umbers also wants to find ways to incentivise the best people to stick around. The talent pool for casual and part-time workers is also much larger.\nIt is hardly surprising a new chief executive of an underperforming company is making cuts. His challenge is to stop costs rising faster than revenues. The overhaul of Myer's brands is also overdue.\nMcClintock cites Charles Dickens' Micawber principle around spending more than you earn to illustrate why he thinks Myer can turn things around.\n\"It is a bit of a Micawber comment about spending more money than you earn, but if you can increase sales in real terms by just 1 or 2 per cent it makes a profound difference,\" he says.\n\"It sounds like it is a bit turnaround and it is but in fact it is a $3 billion business and it doesn't take that much to make a difference of $10 million up or down.\"\nThe talent pool for casual and part-time workers is also much larger.\nRevitalisation Service is just one step in the work needed to revitalise Australia's department stores, which are underwhelming compared to what is on offer in other parts of the world.\nOn a recent visit to London McClintock spent time touring the city's top stores such as Debenhams and John Lewis. He says he was impressed with what he saw.\nComparisons with London or New York's top stores maybe unfair as it is hard replicate the level of in-store experience here because of the costs involved. Many department stores in London inject a lot of money into their flagship stores but neglect others.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR\nï»¿", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@MikeSmithAFR", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-08-05T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:07:45.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
