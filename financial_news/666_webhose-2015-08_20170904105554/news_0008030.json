Brands, including Lindeman's, will either be relaunched, refreshed or promoted in new marketing campaigns. \"Our business is not just Penfolds... we are not reliant only on Penfolds,\" TWE chief executive Michael Clarke said. \"We are really coming forward with some amazing new innovations for all our geographies (regional markets) globally.\" Among the new products that TWE will launch in the first half of fiscal 2016 are a new label from the Wolf Blass portfolio called \"Blass\", a new entry-level label from Penfolds, and the new \"Gentleman's Collection\" from Lindeman's. Mr Clarke said the Lindeman's Gentleman's Collection would probably be TWE's largest ever global launch, targeting \"millenial\" consumers. The Lindeman's brand is TWE's flagship \"commercial\" wine, which are wines priced at $5 to $10 per bottle. But TWE has created the Lindeman's Gentleman's Collection as a more profitable \"masstige\" wine - mass prestige wines priced at $10 to $20. \"We're not just using Australian wine, we're using American wine also,\" Mr Clarke said. \"That will bring people back to the Lindeman's franchise.\" Mr Clarke said the new Lindeman's Gentleman's Collection would contain either all US wine or all Australian wine, identifiable by a batch number, but all bottles would look the same. He said sourcing the wine from both Australia and the US would give the new Lindeman's range flexibility as the label grows. \"Because we have a great portfolio of winemakers around the world we've been able to design the wine in a way that there is a consistency in the taste,\" Mr Clarke said. The new Penfolds entry-level wine is called \"Max's\", after former Penfolds chief winemaker Max Schubert, and will be prices at around $30 per bottle. The Max's range will include cabernet, shiraz, red blends and chardonnay.
