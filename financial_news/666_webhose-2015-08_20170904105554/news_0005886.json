Photo: Supplied\nStruggling iron ore miner Atlas Iron has revealed it has very little room to manoeuvre within its banking facilities after slumping deep into the red with a $1.4 billion loss.\nAtlas, which was forced to seek emergency capital earlier this year, has been hurt by plunging iron ore prices, which it blamed for write downs across its Pilbara assets totalling $1.1 billion.\nIt has pushed Atlas dangerously close to a key covenant covering its $US268 million ($363 million) debt pile.\nUnder the terms with financiers Atlas must maintain a two-to-one ratio of total asset value to secured debt.\nAdvertisement In accounts posted to the Australian Securities Exchange at 7.30pm AEST Thursday, Atlas revealed it held total assets of $775.5 million against secured debt of $349 million at June 30, representing a ratio of about 2.2 times to one, keeping it just out of the firing line of its lender group.\nCiti analyst Clarke Wilkins said Atlas had \"not yet breached\" the covenant because the positive affect of the falling Australian dollar on cash flows and asset value had offset the rising value of US dollar denominated debt.\n\"Despite lowered costs, higher production and an equity raising, funding risk remains a key concern at our bearish iron ore forecasts of about $US40 a tonne for the next few years,\" Mr Wilkins said in a note to clients.\n\"At our bearish iron ore prices we expect further cash burn in FY16 and FY17, potentially breaching debt covenants after the shortfall in the equity raising.\"\nDespite a softening currency increasing the burden of the miner's debt, Atlas managing director David Flanagan said it was \"all upside in downside for the dollar\".\n$A revalues \"Yes, the Aussie dollar impacts the size of the secured debt, absolutely,\" he said.\n\"What it also does is it puts more cash in the bank and it revalues upwards the value of the total assets of the business. Yes you cop it on one side but we actually cop a greater benefit on the other side so it is a positive to the business to have the Aussie dollar fall.\"\nAtlas fell short of a $180 million capital raising earlier this year, collecting just $87 million of which $53 million was new cash.\nAtlas said it \"may be required to source additional funds through debt or equity markets\" if its iron ore price assumptions are not met.\n\"In this regard the directors are reviewing other funding options, such as unsecured debt, convertible notes and offtake agreements with financing elements,\" Atlas said.\nMr Flanagan told Fairfax Media the company has been examining alternative funding options for about six months and is examining potential asset sales.\nBell Potter Securities senior investment adviser Giuliano Sala Tenna said Atlas is \"alive at the will of its debt holders at the moment and the fact their contractors have agreed to participate with a bit of services for equity swap\".\n\"We continue to be impressed by Atlas's management in endeavouring to look for solutions,\" he said.\n\"But the reality is they are in a corner and they only have difficult solutions and difficult decisions to make and at this stage, any solution that can be put on the table should be to see if they can buy themselves more time to see if the iron ore price can sustain some sort of rally.\"\nAtlas's auditor KPMG warned if \"recent volatility experienced in the Australian dollar iron ore price\" continued and resulted in a sustained decline from Atlas' forecast prices before its debt matured in December 2017 there was \"significant uncertainty\" about whether Atlas could refinance terms and \"continue as a going concern\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:40:21.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
