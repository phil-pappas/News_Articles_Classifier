Carbon Tanzania said in a report on its website that the two villages, Domanga and Mongo wa Mono successfully kept deforestation at bay using traditional patrol guards known as Walinzi wa Jadi. \n\"Of the 38m/- paid by Carbon Tanzania to Domanga and Mongo wa Mono villages in the first half of 2014, 7.2m/- was paid directly to the Walinzi wa Jadi using M Pesa, both creating employment and ensuring patrolling and enforcement of the project area,\" Carbon Tanzania said in a report. \nThe Arusha based company whose operations this year have focused on monitoring, financial planning and preparing the way for project expansion, said the Hadzabe have contained land conflicts which poaching remains a minor problem. \n\"Our monthly monitoring systems are essential to allow us to understand the situation on the ground and document land incursions, political discourse and poaching events. \nThe anti-poaching and data gathering teams, or Walinzi wa Jadi, patrol within the 20,200ha project area, the core area for the Hadzabe to utilise,\" the company noted. \nWhilst poaching incidents continue to occur, those involving weapons declined from seven in mid 2013 to zero in mid 2014, this excellent result is due mainly to a number of arrests made by the Walinzi Wajadi supported by the district game officer and Ujamaa Community Resource Team (UCRT), the report added. \nCarbon Tanzania which works in partnership with UCRT and Dorobo Safaris Limited to strengthen accountability and refine how money reaches the community and how it is spent, pointed out that several clients especially tour operating and travel companies are paying to offset carbon footprint of tourists. \n\"Along with Dorobo Safaris and Haydom Lutheran Hospital we have set up a dedicated heath fund for the Hadzabe which allows individuals to obtain free medical treatment from the hospital,\" the report noted. \nCommenting on the same report, Dr Kilahama who is also Chairman of board of trustees of Mpingo Conservation and Development Initiative said it's high time that global leaders strike a deal on carbon trading during the forthcoming Paris Climate Change Summit. \n\"Initially we thought carbon credits would save the environment by being an incentive to the farmers to conserve and manage the forest properly. But this hoe is fading away after seeing that the negotiations since 2007 (in Bali Indonesia) until today have not been fruitful,\" Dr Kilahama lamented. \nHe warned that increasingly, selling carbon credits is becoming a business entity other than being a service to enhancing environmental stability. \n\"In addition to that the capacity of villagers to handle own situation is low hence, destruction of forests is rampant when global communities had thought to keep the forests and woodlands intact and through REDD+ financial support to poor and developing countries to enhance the protection of forests and woodlands would have been provided,\" Dr Kilahama pointed out. \nThe retired Director of Forestry and Beekeping and Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism further lamented that after eight years of global negotiations, nothing concrete has been attained and worse still the language has changed from support and incentives to local communities to enable then protect and manage the forests and woodlands properly to performance base carbon credit payments and, or technical and financial support. \n\"Since it is taking too long for the global community to reach an legally binding agreement on the matter through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); it is doubtful in carbon credits will be beneficial to Tanzania and other developing countries,\" he observed. \nThe UNEP report titled, 'Investing in Forestry Sector Can Reverse Estimated US$3.5 Billion Economic Drain of Deforestation, Alleviate Poverty in Tanzania,' released last month said deforestation in the country could cost the national economy over 5.5bn/- based on 2013 exchange rates) between 2013 and 2033. \n\"Forest ecosystems in the transition to a green economy and the role of REDD+ in the United Republic of Tanzania took into account the market value of timber resources as benefits that arise from deforestation, and costs in terms of lost timber forest products in the future, as well as other forest ecosystem services that will be lost as a result of deforestation,\" the report stated.
