There are lots of things that come into play, not just currency,\" he said. \n\"What is true is that the Chinese vendors will have the ability to cut price a bit more if they so choose.\" ($1 = 0.9056 euros) (Additional reporting by Lionel Laurent, Sudip Kar-Gupta, Alistair Smout and Martinne Geller in London and Leila Abboud in Paris; Editing by David Holmes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T23:19:54.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
