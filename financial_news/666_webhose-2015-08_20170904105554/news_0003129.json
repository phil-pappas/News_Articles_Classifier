Mr Kirkpatrick will become the challenger’s managing director of regional banking. \nBoth new hires will join the executive team at Metro Bank. \nMr Kirkpatrick said he embraced Metro’s alternative to the big banks. \n“I'm delighted to have the opportunity to join such a genuinely customer-focused organisation as Metro Bank, especially at such an exciting time in its growth,” he said. “The culture throughout the business is very unique and one I have admired for some time, so I’m looking forward to becoming part of the banking revolution.” \nThey follow Metro’s own chief executive Craig Donaldson who previously worked as RBS’ managing director of retail products, after a career at HBOS and Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) . \n= New Unity Trust chief = \nMeanwhile Unity Trust Bank, which was established in 1984 and focuses on socially responsible finance, has hired HSBC’s European head of wealth management Margaret Willis as its new chief executive. \nUnity Trust provides services to organisations including charities, trade unions, councils and voluntary associations, and Ms Willis said she wanted to support customers with social and environmental targets, rather than solely pursuing profit. \nIt is Unity Trust’s second major hire of an HSBC veteran this year its chairman Alan Hughes joined Unity in May, and was chief executive of First Direct, HSBC’s online-only bank, more than a decade ago. \n“I am delighted that Margaret has taken up leadership at Unity, ensuring the bank continues to deliver on its founding principles to support social enterprise,” said Mr Hughes, who is also the chairman of peer-to-peer lending platform RateSetter . \n“Her years of banking and leadership experience will be invaluable in taking Unity to its new phase of growth and development. We very much welcome Margaret to the business.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T15:25:47.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
