Palm prices have shed 15 percent this year. \nMalaysia and Indonesia, which together account for about 85 percent of global palm oil output, have pledged to improve the perception of the tropical oil, including its nutritional and sustainable production, according to a statement by Malaysia's ministry of international trade and industry (MITI). \nMinisters from Indonesia's ministry of maritime and resources and Malaysia's MITI led a delegation from the two countries in a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, where the agreement was reached, the statement said. \nIndonesia's ministry of maritime and resources, and its trade ministry, could not be immediately reached for a comment. \n\"Any collaboration between the two biggest producers in the world should be positive to the industry,\" said Alan Lim, an analyst at Malaysian Industrial Development Finance Research. \n\"If implemented successfully, the discount between crude palm oil and other vegetable oils should be reduced. This is especially true for soybean oil and rapeseed oil, hence leading to better palm oil prices in the long run.\" \nPalm is currently trading at a more than $150 per tonne discount to its main rival soyoil. \n($1 = 4.2180 ringgit) (Reporting by Emily Chow; Editing by Himani Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T13:45:36.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
