By the end of the week, however, markets had rebounded, with U.S. benchmarks finishing the week in the green. A key shift backing the rebound in U.S. stocks: Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley’s statement Wednesday that the likelihood of a rate rise next month has dimmed. Investors remain on alert for further clues about what the Fed will do at its September meeting. At the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole on Saturday, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer, said Fed officials shouldn’t “wait until inflation is back to 2% to begin tightening.” \nThe Fed Takes a Last Look at Jobs \nThe Labor Department is scheduled to release August’s jobs report on Friday. Another solid month of job gains would signal steady domestic growth and could nudge Fed officials closer to raising interest rates at their mid-September policy meeting. But many economists now think the central bank is more likely to hold off due to international turmoil. Officials also will scrutinize details on labor-force participation, underemployment and wages. \nChina Holds a Military Parade \nChina will hold a World War II Victory Day parade Thursday, but notably absent from its guest list are leaders or troops from the U.S. and other major Western powers that fought alongside China in the war. The parade marks the first time China is commemorating the allied victory with such an event. Some have suspected the country of taking action to ease markets to give investors something to cheer ahead of the high-profile parade. \nObama Visits Arctic, ‘Front Line’ of Climate Change \nPresident Obama will travel to Alaska to address a meeting of Arctic nation foreign ministers Monday. The visit to the region, the first ever for a president, coincides with a growing public consensus that the earth is heating up and that humans have something to do with it. “I’m going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century—climate change,” Mr. Obama said earlier this month. \nEarnings to Watch \nA wide array of companies are scheduled to report earnings this week. Campbell Soup, among the big U.S. food companies, is up Thursday. It has been one of the most aggressive about responding to rapid changes in how Americans eat, but its embrace of simpler, more natural products has so far had limited payoff. Others reporting next week: Dollar Tree, H&R Block, Planet Fitness and Medtronic.
