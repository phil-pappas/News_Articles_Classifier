The level adds 1,700 square feet and about 150 seats. Large windows line the mezzanine and offer views toward the summit chair-lift plaza. \nTwo new restrooms will be added to the main floor of the Summit House. \nThe exterior of the Summit House is also getting an overhaul with stone and corrugated metal, wood beams and red siding with brown trim. Other buildings on the resort slopes will get the same treatment for matching facades. \nNearly 26 years have passed since the Summit House was last remodeled. It was built in 1985 and first renovated in 1989. \n“It’s been something we’ve known that we needed,” Polumbus said. “We’ve been focused on other projects in the past two years, but this has definitely been on the wish list.” \nThe second item on the summer checklist is the new Ski Patrol building, formerly located in a 175-square foot cabin that was torn down earlier this summer. \nA new, two-story, 800-square foot building is being installed next to the top of Chair Seven. \nThe new facility includes an office space and plumbing, two new assets that will allow the patrol to better assist skiers, Polumbus said. \nPolumbus estimates the construction will be complete before the resort’s opening day in early December. Montana Creative designed both projects. \nA third project underway on Big Mountain involves drilling a new water well at the top of the “Fill Hill” ski slope. \nA massive drilling rig was brought to the summit via Forest Service Road 9790 at Taylor Creek. Well drillers had been hitting depths of more than 600 feet. \nThis summer’s work is part of continuing improvements at the resort. During the last two years, the resort focused on opening the new Flower Point lift and runs. \nThe resort also expanded the base lodge and reconfigured the kitchen and food court areas inside. \n“It’s just ongoing improvements to areas that have been a big part of the resort. We’ve had some big numbers in recent years between day visitors and season passes held,” Polumbus said. \nThe Summit House is open during renovations but will close for a three-day window installation this week. \n“It’s really exciting,” Polumbus said. “Anyone who’s been coming up here to visit can notice the differences day by day.” \nDaily operations at Whitefish Mountain Resort end on Labor Day before moving to a weekend schedule through September. The lift will shut down to the public on Sept. 27 until opening day in early December. \nFor more information, call 406-862-2900 or visit www.skiwhitefish.com . \nReporter Seaborn Larson may be reached at 758-4441 or by email at slarson@dailyinterlake.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T10:10:44.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
