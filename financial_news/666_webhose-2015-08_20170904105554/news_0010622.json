Sure, you want to cover your six, but you have to be rational. \n“Don’t let something push you off course,” said Craig Brimhall, vice president of wealth strategies at Ameriprise Financial in Washington, D.C. “This too shall pass.” Similar advice is echoed by just about every financial advisor. \nBut on August 24, when the Dow Jones at one point was down a record-breaking 1,000 points, the advice was widely ignored.
