The new gay paradise.\" \nMost popular destinations so far for Mi Cayito Cuba's clients are Havana, the verdant heaven of Vinales in the western province of Pinar del Rio, and Varadero beach, Castillo said. \nMi Cayito Cuba's website is available only in Spanish, but Castillo said it has been visited by clients in Germany, the United States, Russia, Spain and Latin America who have the choice of tours like \"Havana Gay\" or a service of personalised guides. \nMore than two million tourists have come to Cuba so far this year. \n\"Changes in Cuba have become an incentive and have increased demand,\" Castillo said, adding that his company expects a flood of US visitors as a result of the thawing of relations between Washington and Havana and the restoration of diplomatic relations after more than 50 years. \nCuba has not always been so welcoming to gays and lesbians. In the decades following the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro, the Cuban government derided, persecuted and jailed them. \nIn a 2010 interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, Castro acknowledged that he bore ultimate responsibility for the persecution and expressed regret about the policy. \nHomosexuality was decriminalised in Cuba in the 1990s and the island's free public health service began offering sex-reassignment operations in 2008. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook New home sales rebound in June AAP \nNew home sales have bounced back, posting a fifth rise in the first six months of 2015.
