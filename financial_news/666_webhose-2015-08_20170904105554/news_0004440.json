Given the scope of the FinTech sector, topics will range from mobile payments, crowd funding platforms and peer-to-peer lending to challenger banks and digital currencies. \nIn the promotional materials, the university remarks: “Understanding FinTech and the role it plays to the UK economy is vital for people seeking to build a future career in banking and alternative finance. The value of the industry is estimated to be worth £20 billion pounds to the UK economy – a figure which is expected to increase as more talent and investment pours into the country.” \nLiz Moody, Senior Lecturer, Executive Education at The Open University, says: “The brief for this course was to demystify a new era of financial services unfolding in the UK.” \n“Traditional banking models and financial systems face uncertain futures and startup founders seeking a foothold in the marketplace will be encouraged to think critically about the implications and opportunities of changes happening in the FinTech ecosystem.” Got a news tip?
