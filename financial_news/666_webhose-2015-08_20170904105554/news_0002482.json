I'm very optimistic,\" he said. \nIf a deal is reached, Greece is expected to receive around €13bn in immediate aid to meet its debt obligations, including a €3.2bn payment due to the European Central Bank (ECB) next week. \nA further €10bn cash injection into the country's beleaguered lenders is expected to follow shortly after. \nBut in a blow to Athens, ministers said the issue of writing-off some of Greece's debt would not be discussed until October. \nThe IMF has stated that it will not participate in another bail-out programme unless it receives an “explicit and concrete agreement” on debt relief. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, took part in discussions last night by phone. \nHowever, Mr Schaeuble and other countries are seeking a \"binding\" commitment from the Fund to join the rescue programme in October, as he refused to rule out a second bridging loan for Greece to allow more time for talks. \nMr Stubb said ministers would work hard to \"square the circle\". \"Maybe we need to provide guarantees [for Greek debt] to ensure the IMF can come on board in October,\" added Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup. \nA leaked Brussels memo highlighted \"serious concerns\" this week about the sustainability of Greece's debt mountain. \nThe country's debt share is expected to balloon to 201pc of gross domestic product (GDP) next year and only fall to 175pc by the end of the decade. \nFinland, Germany and Slovakia have voiced fierce opposition to any nominal haircut, but have said tentatively that they are open to giving Greece more time to repay its loans. \nApproval of a third bail-out deal came at a high price for the government, which lost his constitutional majority after just 118 of its own MPs backed the new rescue programme. \nSyriza MPs accused Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, of \"throwing away his comrades like dogs\" and bowing to \"eurozone dictatorship\". \nThe bill passed through the Greek parliament thanks to support from opposition parties, with 222 votes in favour and 64 against. Greek media said Mr Tsipras was expected to call a vote of confidence in his government. If he loses this vote, snap elections are likely to follow. \nHowever, Mr Tsipras defended his decision to back another rescue programme. \"We took the decision to remain alive instead of committing suicide and complaining how unfair it was,” he told parliament. \nOlga Gerovasili, a spokesman for the government, said any confidence vote would take place after August 20, when the ECB payment is due. \nMeanwhile, Benoit Coeuré, a member of the ECB's executive board, said on Friday that it could restore normal funding lines for Greek banks by October if a deal is reached. \nGreek banks have relied on emergency funding to keep them afloat after the government's rejection of new bail-out terms prompted the central bank to remove a waiver that allowed low-quality sovereign debt to be used as collateral. \n“We could potentially act earlier,” he told the Boersen-Zeitung newspaper in Germany. \n“Greece’s new program contains a large number of prior actions. The question for the Governing Council will be whether these preliminary measures are sufficient to meet our criteria,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T22:00:46.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
