I don't think we need stimulus measures \nnow, but this could become more likely heading into next year.\" \nExports destined for China, Japan's largest trading partner, \nrose 4.2 percent in July from a year ago, compared with June's \n5.9 percent annual increase, finance ministry data showed. \nShipments to Asia rose 6.1 percent year-on-year in July, \nversus a 10.1 percent annual increase in the previous month. \nIn one bright spot, Japan's exports to the United States \nrose an annual 18.8 percent in July, more than a 17.6 percent \nannual increase seen in June, thanks to larger shipments of cars \nand medicines. \nImports fell 3.2 percent in year-on-year in July versus the \nmedian estimate for a 7.9 percent annual decrease as the cost of \ncrude and liquefied natural gas fell. \nThe trade balance was a a deficit of 268 billion yen ($2.2 \nbillion), versus the median estimate for a 56.7 billion yen \ndeficit. \nThe economy is expected to resume growing in the current \nquarter if consumer spending bounces back, but weaker exports \nsuggest that the overall pace of expansion may not be enough to \ngenerate the price growth needed to banish the risk of returning \nto deflation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T04:08:23.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
