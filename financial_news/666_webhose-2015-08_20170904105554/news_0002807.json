Risk markets have since regained some composure, with Tokyo's Nikkei bouncing back 0.7 percent.\nThe sag in the debt market did little to dampen investor demand at Thursday's 2.5 trillion yen ($20.1 billion) five-year JGB sale, with the bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand at auctions, rising to 3.45 from 3.2 at the previous offering last month.\nDealers said the new five-year JGBs drew bids from domestic banks and foreign investors seeking alternatives to short-term paper, made scarce in the market by the Bank of Japan's aggressive purchases.\n($1 = 124.3500 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Prateek Chatterjee)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T07:35:16.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
