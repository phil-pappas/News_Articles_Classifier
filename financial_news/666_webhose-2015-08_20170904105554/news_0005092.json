Profits are up, customer numbers are up, earnings per share is up, the dividend is up ... you might say it was a pretty 'up' first half!” said Henry Engelhardt, Admiral’s outgoing chief executive. \n\"The UK business turned in a very solid result helped by positive claims cost development, with modest growth accompanying price increases.” \nCardiff-based Admiral continued to add customers, taking the total number of people on its books from 4.05 million to 4.19 million. The firm took in revenues of £1.06bn, up £20m on a year ago. \nConfused.com, the firm’s price comparison site that launched in 2001, halved its profits to £4.8m. Increased spending by rivals such as Compare the Market and Go Compare have kept the site under pressure in recent months. Spending on a new US site resulted in a total loss of £4m for Admiral’s online platforms. \nThe group’s international business, which has been expanding in Italy, Spain and France under Mr Engelhardt’s watch, narrowed its losses slightly to £11.2m. Admiral now has 631,700 vehicles insured overseas. \nAdmiral kept up its policy of paying almost all of its earnings as dividends, raising its interim payment by 3pc to 51p per share. The firm's shares rose more than 4pc in early trading. \nAdmiral also announced that it will switch auditor next year, in keeping with many FTSE 100 firms changing their contract ahead of new UK and European rules intended to encourage independent audits. Deloitte will take over from KPMG next year, subject to shareholder approval.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T13:30:14.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
