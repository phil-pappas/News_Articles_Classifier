Global supplies are growing at “breakneck speeds”, according to the International Energy Agency, with supply outstripping consumption by about 3m barrels per day in the second-quarter. \nJack O’Brien, of Liberum, also listed cost cutting by miners and negative data from China among the mounting headwinds weighing on the company’s performance. \nBrent crude touching a six-and-a-half year low at $48.8 per barrel did little to alleviate investors’ fears. The stock slid 24p, or 1.6pc, to £14.62. \nAs the oil price tumbled, oil companies became the biggest casualties in the FTSE 100. Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) lost 19.5p to close at £18.14, while BP was off by 3.9p at 379.3p. Joshua Mahony, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , pointed to another negative in the oil price space: “All dollar denominated purchases of oil just became 3.6pc more expensive, after the Chinese yuan devaluation.” \nAfter a chaotic week across global equities, during which the People’s Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) devalued the yuan , investors fled to the sidelines. European bourses recorded their biggest weekly drop in over a month with the CAC in Paris and the German DAX recording weekly losses of 3.9pc and 4.4pc, respectively. The FTSE 100 fell 167.75 points, or 2.5pc, this week, as commodities and luxury goods stocks retreated following the move by China. * How China devalued the yuan for the first time in two decades, and why it matters \nAhead of its interim results next week, Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) hit a fresh low of 172.9p, down 2.2pc, after it sold stakes in three mines for around $290m. Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) also targeted the miner, revising its price target down to 270p, citing lower than expected commodity prices. \nElsewhere, tour operator TUI AG (LSE: TUI.L - news ) enjoyed a second day as FTSE favourite as JPMorgan Cazenove lifted its target price following Thursday’s robust half-year results . The stock rose 48p, or 4.3pc, to £11.62. \nElectronics distributor Premier Farnell (LSE: PFL.L - news ) made gains of 1pc to 135.9p after it announced chief executive Laurence Bain was stepping down with immediate effect. Chairman Val Gooding said: “The company’s recent results have been disappointing and the board has concluded that the time is right for a change of leadership.” In July, shares sank to their lowest level in six years after the FTSE 250 company issued a profit warning as sales growth slowed in UK and Northern American markets. \nOnline gambling company Sportech (LSE: SPO.L - news ) leapt 10.6pc to 69.3p, a one-year high, as it confirmed it received a takeover proposal from Canada’s Contagious Gaming (CDNX: CNS.V - news ) . The company said any recommended offer would be at a premium to its closing share price of 62.63p on August 13. \nFinally, intellectual property group Tekcapital (LSE: TEK.L - news ) climbed 7pc to 46p after it acquired the licensing rights to a portfolio of nine patents that make air conditioning up to 25pc more efficient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T21:37:41.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
