Geeorge Fetting by Jeremy Chunn It's easy to feel all patriotic when looking back over the past 30 years' performance of the Australian, international and US share markets. If the orange line is at the top right-hand corner, it means we've beaten everyone else in the world. Again!\nAbout this time of year investment stalwart Vanguard sends around its index chart. It compares the fortunes of six major asset classes and inflation to show how $10,000 would have fared if invested in one or the other over three decades, with all income reinvested and no tax to worry about.\nIt's a terrific poster for the office of any fund manager with a mandate which restricts it to be invested up to its neck in Australian equities, as the results are hard to argue with. Over the 30 years to June, Australian shares returned 10.8 per cent a year.\nThat beats US shares, at 10.3 per cent, and international shares, at 8.6 per cent.\nOver 30 years' the Australian sharemarket has outperformed other global markets. Geeorge Fetting Diversification matters The six asset classes appear to be pretty tightly bunched, with Australian bonds returning 9.3 per cent, listed property 9.4 per cent and cash 7.5 per cent. Small differences in annualised returns make a big difference when the data is collected over a long period. If anything, the 30-year totals illustrate the raw power of compounding. Add to that the discipline of reinvesting income no matter what happens and you have a strong case for taking a long-term view.\nOf course, no one should be wholly invested in any one asset class. A diversified portfolio will draw like a less-jagged line through the cluster of lines on the chart, somewhere between cash and Australian equities, depending on your risk profile and chosen allocations.\nIf you believe Australian equities will always be number one, you have nothing to worry about. Just keep doing what you're doing. And let's not pay too much attention to the big grey vertical bar, which shows we haven't had a recession since 1992.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:15:44.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
