This room is not very big.\"\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called for \"significant debt relief\" for Greece, describing this as a condition for its participation in a third bailout for Greece that was approved by euro zone finance ministers late on Friday.\nGermany is very keen to keep the IMF on board but has repeatedly ruled out a writedown of the face value of Greece's debt through a so-called \"haircut\".
