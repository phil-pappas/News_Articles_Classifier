At a policy dialogue entitled \"Implications of the Falling Oil Price for Policy in Nigeria\" organised by the Centre for Public Policy Alternatives, the former Minister emphasised a need for a hedging mechanism. \nAlso, the Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Mr Muda Yussuf said there was need for diversification of the country's sources of revenue in the light of the unfolding scenario of declining crude oil prices globally and the challenges confronting local production. \nHe expressed regret that the economy is currently structured in a way that makes it susceptible to external shock. \"All these create a gloomy revenue outlook for government which is a major cause for concern. A critical factor in this regard is the creation of an enabling environment that will enhance productivity and efficiency in the non-oil sector of the economy,\" he said. \nInevitably, oil and gas companies globally have been adversely affected by the falling oil prices with their revenues and profits on the decline. For instance, Seplat Petroleum Development Company's after tax profit amounted to N4.83 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2015, which represents a drop of 33.4% year-on-year. Full year outlook indicates after tax profit in the region of N20.21 billion for the company in 2015. \nIt is speculated that the company may lose as much as half of the profit figure of N40.48 billion it reported in the preceding year. In April this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that BP's UK version of net income fell 40% from a year earlier and its cash flow plunged by more than 75%, while Total SA of France net profit fell by 20%. \nBoth companies reported lower revenue from oil sales as crude traded for about $54 a barrel in the first quarter of 2015, half its price a year earlier. The publication further stated that, to demonstrate how challenging the market has been for big oil companies, these numbers were considered better than expected by analysts. In January, Total reported a $5.7 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2014, while BP's losses totaled almost $1 billion. \nCompanies have taken to proactive measures to cushion the effect of the downturn, including cuts in capex, downsizing of operations and cancellation or suspension of contracts. For instance, at the end of 2014 Shell said it was deferring spending in many areas and this would result in a reduction in capital investment from 2015 to 2017 of over $15bn. \nChevron Corporation announced a $35bn capital and exploratory investment programme for 2015, 13 per cent lower than the total investments for 2014. ExxonMobil said it would slash its capital spending by 12 per cent to $34bn from about $38.5bn last year, while French oil major, Total, reduced capital spending from last year's total of $26.4bn. \nOn Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell, announced that it was cutting 6,500 jobs and will slash its capital spending budget by 20 per cent this year, as it prepares for a \"prolonged downturn\" in crude prices by scrapping and delaying billions of dollars in energy projects. The company said it would reduce investment by $7bn from last year's levels to about $30bn in 2015, a bigger drop than was foretold three months ago and a sharper reduction in capital spending than many of its rivals. \nIn Nigeria, there has been reduction in Joint Venture budgets. In third quarter of 2013, the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) ordered a 30% - 40% reduction in the JV budget, followed by a similar directive in Q1, 2015, which led to the suspension of several ongoing projects. \nNew opportunities have also been deferred or cancelled, leading to a significant drop in the Nigerian rig count from 51 in September 2013 to 27 in June 2015 - a 47% reduction. \nExperts say the drop in rig count has had a negative effect on other manufacturing and services businesses such as drilling fluids and chemicals, drill bits, casing services, and marine vessels among others, leading to multimillion dollar losses to indigenous services companies who have made substantial investments towards acquiring assets, technologies and capacity to execute projects. \nPerhaps, the highest losses are being incurred by indigenous rig owners who are stipulated by the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act of 2010 to acquire by direct purchase at least 50% of deep water assets. These local companies are expected to demonstrate this ownership at the tendering stage with no guarantee of contract commitment. Tendering is unusually a lengthy exercise because of bureaucracy and outdated manual processes with cases of tendering going on for over five years with no conclusion in sight. \nA combination of falling demand for rigs and cheaper foreign options has led to local rigs being left idle, according to a February 2015 report. Industry analysts have also said that this is the worst oil rigs market they have seen globally since 1985. \nThe Group Lead of the NNRC Expert Panel Core Sector group, Mr. Gbite Adeniji said oil companies were beginning to renegotiate contracts, adding that some clients were delaying payments. \nAccording to him, \"there is a general waiting game in the industry. In the service sector, several companies will go out of business. Borrowing from the banks in this kind of environment is almost suicidal... Contractors are beginning to lay off staff. The implications remain that projects will be cut, while the optimism that brought those indigenous companies into the industry is dampening.\" \nThere were a number of indigenous companies that have gone into extinction following which the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) took over their assets because they could not break even due to inherent pressure traceable to the oil glut. \nIndustry operators are of the opinion that the new government of President Muhammadu Buhari should gird its loins with a view to saving the oil and gas sector from the terrible shocks occasioned by the oil glut as well as chart a salutary economic path for the nation. Nigeria \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration was seriously looking for ways of cutting down the cost of … see more » Copyright © 2015 Daily Trust. All rights reserved.
