Alex Ellinghausen She defended the finding in the RBA's submission to the inquiry last month that households in the top 40 per cent of incomes hold 80 per cent of investor housing debt.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey shrugged off the Reserve Bank's call for a review of negative gearing , made in its submission to this inquiry in July, insisting that middle-income earners are the major beneficiaries of the tax break.\n\"More policemen negatively gear than specialised tax accountants, management consultants or university lecturers,\" Mr Hockey has repeatedly said.\nThe Property Council has cited Australian Taxation Office statistics to prove cutting negative gearing would hurt many people on low and middle incomes. It says 66.5 per cent of investors who made a loss on a rental property had taxable income of $80,000 or less.\n But Dr Ellis said the RBA analysis was based on the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics survey which covers all income and all households while the Tax Office data cited by the Property Council only looked at the taxable incomes of people who lodged tax returns.\nDr Ellis said because of these limitations the ATO figures do not capture the fact that many negatively geared properties are owned by people with low taxable income but high \"actual income\", mostly because they were drawing untaxable income from superannuation.\nHome buyers thinner on the ground The chairman of the inquiry and Liberal MP John Alexander has complained that \"uber-landlord\" investors are driving young home buyers out of the market in Sydney and Melbourne.\nDr Ellis agreed that recently investors had made almost half of all residential property purchases and the share of owner-occupiers had fallen.\nBut she said this was a recent trend and the overall split between owner-occupiers and investors had been roughly stable for the past few decades.\nBanks were still being cautious in their approach to lending against property. \"It isn't just, 'Hello, you can fog a mirror. Here's a loan,' like in the US,\" Dr Ellis said.\nShe said the rate of home ownership among young people had fallen but this was largely because they were taking longer to finish studying and settle down, and not because of the rise in prices.\nDr Ellis said the concessions for capital gains-producing investment in Australia were more generous than most developed countries but not overwhelmingly so. She said, for example, New Zealand was more generous.\nAsked if winding back negative gearing breached the general principle that costs of doing business should be deductible, Dr Ellis said many countries looked at it differently.\nShe said under negative gearing an individual could deduct the loss from a rental property business against a separate business activity. She said corporations could not transfer income losses so easily.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:10:27.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
