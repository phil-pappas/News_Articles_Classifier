Nicholas Rider by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Too small. Too expensive. Unfair to retail shareholders.\nBattle lines are drawn in the Big Banks' capital debate and barbs were flying at ANZ Banking Group as investors and analysts took pot shots at the bank's $3 billion equity raising on Thursday.\nBut whatever the complaints, no one could accuse ANZ of acting too slowly. Or selling shares into a spoiled market.\nAnd ANZ - with an extra $2.5 billion in its pocket thanks to brokers Citi, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan - doesn't have to care.\nAFR Graphic It's no longer the bank with the biggest capital hole heading into a new regulatory regime. And it will not be raising equity in a market that assumes there are more big bank deals to come.\nANZ priced the $2.5 billion placement, revealed by Street Talk Online , at $30.95 when the domestic book closed on Thursday. Its brokers, said to have been called in on Wednesday, were seeking to attract offshore bids late into the night. But with the deal already covered and the price fixed, it's hard to see how they would have been too motivated to beat the drum.\nA deal at the floor price probably wasn't the strong result ANZ had hoped for - but the raising took a heavy toll on rivals, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp.\nThe two banks have yet to take material steps in addressing their capital position and, all of a sudden, the market is discounting them for a potential equity raising. CBA shares dropped 3.2 per cent on Thursday, while Westpac fell 3 per cent.\n The pressure is on CBA, which will outline a capital plan at its full year result next week. Before ANZ's deal, the market expected Australia's biggest bank to lean on its dividend reinvestment plan to make up its $5 billion-plus capital hole.\nAll of a sudden, though, the equity raising calls are getting louder. And CBA is understood to be listening. How long can CBA delay what most in the market now see as inevitable?\nThe big investment banks would be tripping over themselves to underwrite a $3 billion to $6 billion deal for CBA. It's Australia's most liquid stock and has about a 6.5 per cent grossed-up yield, predictable earnings and strong retail investor demand. Goldman Sachs is close to the bank, while UBS did its last major raising in 2008.\nFinally, CBA has promoted Dan Huggins to oversee everything to do with its home loans business, which makes up about one-third of the retail bank's profit. Huggins has been given the title executive general manager, home buying, and will report to head of retail banking Matt Comyn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:04:56.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
