Barclays' ADS price fell 12 percent the next day. \nShareholders said the depressed Libor submissions caused Barclays to understate its borrowing costs. \nThey also said defendant Robert Diamond, then Barclays' president and later its chief executive, deceived them on an Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) . 31, 2008 conference call by denying that Barclays' borrowing costs were higher than those of rivals, and saying: \"We're categorically not paying higher rates in any currency.\" \nLibor underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions, and is used to set rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages. \n\"We're very pleased that the judge is allowing us to move forward,\" said David Rosenfeld, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the lead plaintiffs. \nSeveral other banks have also settled with U.S. and European regulators over alleged Libor manipulation. \nThe case is Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of St Louis et al v. Barclays Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-05329. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Christian Plumb)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T06:16:16.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
