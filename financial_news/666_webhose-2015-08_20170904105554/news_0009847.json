Tricking customers into spending more is an age-old tactic, but now, firms are having to invent even sneakier ways to coax us into spending more money. \nRecently our mailbag has been bursting with readers’ complaints about various tricks, cons and quirks that companies (and ordinary people) have used to try to rip them off. Here are eight of the ruses on the rise in 2015: \n= 1. Trapping you with direct debit payments = \nDirect debit is a tool increasingly treasured by a number of companies from dating websites to insurers. Previously, one way of ramping up profits was to let customers spread their payments over a year, paying a little every month but with a punishing rate of interest applied on top. Bills were sometimes pumped up by 30pc with these interest charges applied. \nThen it became more sophisticated. Many insurers now instead let you pay by direct debit for the first year without an interest charge but then, with you safely signed up to monthly payments, apply a punishing rate of interest in the second year. The direct debit automatically rolls on unless you spot the difference in your renewal documents. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if you stop it in the second year it can reappear in a third year. \nMeanwhile, other companies, such as Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) and dating website connexionsdating.com, force you to call up if you want to cancel your contract. You can of course stop your payments by cancelling your direct debit with the bank, however you’ll still be contractually obliged to pay for the service so this could result in fines. \nAction: Set yourself diary reminders every year when a direct debit is coming up to a year and check your policy. If you have problems getting companies to cancel a contract over the phone threaten to post your frustrations on social media and email the chief executive. \n= 2. Ebay (Xetra: 916529 - news ) sellers tricked by dishonest buyers = \nA major worry with using sites like eBay has traditionally been handing money over to unscrupulous sellers in return for second-rate goods or nothing at all. But since eBay launched its “Money Back Guarantee” scheme in 2013, the tables have turned. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is by far the most complained-about issue found in our postbag with the majority of the complaints now coming from sellers. \nThe policy promises to refund the buyer with the cost of an item if it does not arrive or is not as described. If such a refund is made the seller has the money deducted from their account. EBay says the guarantee “ensures buyers can shop confidently, with the knowledge that they will receive the item they purchased or their money back”, but in practice sneaky buyers are using it to trick sellers. \nAction: Sellers should check buyers'd feedback ratings before accepting an offer. If you have a bad experience leave a review to warn other sellers. \n= 3. Costly \"warranties\" shops flogs to customers - even if items are protected by law = \nA common ploy retailers are increasingly adopting to rip you off is by misleading you into buying useless warranties which supposedly cover items for damage and faults but are actually useless. In fact, shops have a legal obligation to repair or replace faulty goods for up to six years after purchase, although there are some caveats to this rule. \nAccording to consumer campaign group Which?, online marketplace Amazon and High Street retailers Currys, Argos, Richer Sounds and John Lewis are giving misleading information to customers. The general advice is that shops selling you a warranty which lasts longer than a year is a complete waste of money. \nAction: Be very wary of buying a warranty that lasts longer than a year - it's likely to be a waste of money. \n• Two-year EU warranty: five myths about consumer rights \n= 4. Airport shops pocketing your tax-free discounts = \nProminent retailers including WH Smith (LSE: SMWH.L - news ) , Boots and Dixons have come under fire recently for failing to pass on to customers tax discounts for goods at airports. \nBoarding cards are used to identify travellers leaving the EU so shops can claim back the 20pc VAT. Angry customers said they should receive this money. \nSome stores have stopped demanding to see boarding cards but the ruse is still there. \nAction: Refuse to show your boarding pass if you're asked for it at an airport shop. \n= 5. Rip-off rail fares that confuse consumers into paying peak rates = \nWhen it comes to buying rail tickets, train companies use all kinds of tactics to avoid offering passengers the cheapest tickets. \nPassengers are routinely denied the cheapest fares when using self-service machines, which are used to purchase almost a quarter of all tickets. They bury the cheapest deals and do not apply discounts for groups or families. You can end up paying double the price, a Channel 4 investigation found. \nStaff working on ticket booths at stations have also been found to deliberately not offer customers the cheapest tickets. \nAction: Book trains in advance if you can, or question whether the price you've been quoted at the station is definitely the cheapest. Also don't forget some railways offer discounts for group travel and other concessions. \n= 6. Rip-off phone apps that slyly charge you every month = \nMost of us have apps on our smart phones these days, and more people are falling foul of a rip-off. 'Free' games for smartphones and tablet computers which are targeted at children and entice them to buy extra features, and rack up substantial bills, were investigated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), but they are still very much alive and rinsing parents’ bank accounts. \nWe’ve also been inundated with complaints about strange charges from apps people say have never signed up to leading to suspicions that it’s possible for expensive rogue apps to sign you up using only your phone number. We had hoped this was on the decline after a number of readers have written to us after we covered it in 2012. In 2012, customers who had suffered these phantom bills from gaming app Buongiorno discovered a loophole in which anyone was able to sign anyone else up for premium rate services. \nFresh complaints about this app suggest the loophole may have been reopened - or that it was never properly closed. \nAction: The lesson here is to always thoroughly check your bill. You can un-sign up for apps through your phone's app store, or simply tell your bank to stop payments. \n= 7. Restaurants keeping the 12.5pc service charge you give to \"tip\" staff = \nFrench restaurant chain, Cote, recently hit headlines following accusations that it does not pass on the optional 12.5pc service charge on to staff, pocketing it instead. Meanwhile other big chains including Pizza Express take a cut of tips your pay to staff by card. MPs have weighed into the debate, saying restaurants must give service charges straight to staff, however even if they do launch an enquiry as they have threatened, it’ll be a while before you can be sure your service charge is going on service. \nAction: If you want to be sure the staff are getting the tips, refuse to give 12.5pc service and pay it straight to the waiter in cash. \n= 8. Packaged bank accounts with extras you don’t need = \nSelling you chargeable bank accounts with add-on features you don’t need is an up and coming way for banks to make money out of you. Packaged bank accounts offer additional benefits such as insurance and cheaper overdrafts, in return for a fee. Average packaged accounts cost up to £150 a year, but this often represents poor value. A rising number of people say they have been sold them unwittingly and didn’t need the add-on products in the first place so they’re effectively paying for nothing. \nAccording to the Financial Ombudsman, the number of people complaining about being sold packaged bank accounts has “soared this year”. Some 25,500 people complained about the issue in the first six months of 2015, which is more than in the whole of 2014. \nAction: Don't be pressured into getting a new bank account. If you think you're paying over the odds look for a better deal on a comparison website such as moneyfacts.co.uk. \nHave you been caught by any of these rip-offs? Got any tips for avoiding them?
