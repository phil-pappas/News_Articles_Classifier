China is not a member.\nBashir, who rejects the court’s authority, has managed to travel within Africa and the Middle East.\nIn June, he was forced to flee South Africa, however, after a court ruled he should be banned from leaving pending the outcome of a hearing on his possible arrest.\nSudan’s foreign ministry said Bashir would visit China for a commemoration of the end of World War II.\nBashir, who has ruled Sudan since a 1989 Islamist and army-backed coup, has not travelled outside the Middle East or Africa since 2011, when he also visited China.\nHe is due to travel to New York in September for the United Nations General Assembly, Sudan’s deputy UN envoy said earlier this month.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:19:35.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
