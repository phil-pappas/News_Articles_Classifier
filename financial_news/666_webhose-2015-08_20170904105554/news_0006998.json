(HFF) announced today that it has closed the sale of and secured $150 million in financing for the acquisition of 520 Fifth Avenue, a premier development site located at the southeast corner of 43 rd Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. \nA joint venture between Ceruzzi Holdings (Ceruzzi) and Shanghai Municipal Investment USA (SMI USA) purchased the property.
