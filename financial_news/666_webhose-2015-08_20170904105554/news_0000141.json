Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Results August 11, 2015 17:32 ET | Source: Carver Bancorp, Inc. \nNEW YORK, Aug. 11,   Carver Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CARV ), the holding company for Carver Federal Savings Bank (\"Carver\" or the \"Bank\"), today announced financial results for its quarter   the first quarter of its fiscal year 2016. \nThe Company reported net income of $178 thousand, or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.05, for the quarter, compared to net income of $173 thousand, or basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.05, for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. \nMichael T. Pugh, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, said: \"We are pleased by the results of our new business efforts and prudent expense management, as well as the incremental growth in net interest income for the current quarter. Our priorities remain centered on growing the loan portfolio, improving asset quality, maintaining a sound capital position, and increasing core deposits. Since June 2014, our loan portfolio has grown $98 million, or 25%, while our non-performing loan ratios continue to improve and are nearing industry norms. Our capital ratios remain strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.41%. With core deposits of $330 million, we have stable, low-cost funding for profitable and meaningful lending in the communities we serve.\" \n\"As an example of meaningful lending, we have seen strong growth in our loans to local women and minority entrepreneurs, providing capital access to this vibrant and growing segment of our footprint. With strong products and services, efficient operations driven by our enhanced banking platform, and deep community ties, we are well placed to serve these customers.\" \nMr. Pugh concluded, \"We look forward to building on our progress throughout fiscal 2016.\" \nStatement of Operations Highlights \nFirst Quarter Results \nThe Company reported net income of $178 thousand for the three months   compared to net income of $173 thousand for the prior year quarter. This change is attributed to lower non-interest expense and higher net interest income, offset by an increase in the   for the current quarter. \nNet Interest Income \nNet interest income increased $384 thousand, or 8.1%, to $5.2 million for the quarter, compared to $4.8 million for the prior year quarter. \nInterest income increased $450 thousand, or 7.8%, to $6.2 million for the quarter, compared to $5.8 million for the prior year quarter, driven by a $90 million, or 22.6%, increase in the Bank's average loan balances. \nInterest expense increased $66 thousand, or 6.7%, to $1.1 million for the quarter, compared to $992 thousand for the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to a $54 thousand, or 7.5%, increase in interest expense on deposits as the Bank grew deposits. \nProvision for Loan Losses \nTo reflect growth in the Bank's loan portfolio, the Company recorded a $117 thousand   for the first quarter, compared to a $781 thousand recovery of loan losses for the prior year quarter. The prior year period also included net recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Net charge-offs of $487 thousand were recognized for the first quarter, compared to net recoveries of $614 thousand for the prior year quarter. \nNon-interest Income \nFor the quarter, non-interest income remained relatively unchanged at $1.2 million, decreasing $10 thousand, or 0.8%, compared to the prior year quarter. Lower depository fees were partially offset by other non-interest income during the quarter. \nNon-interest Expense \nNon-interest expense decreased $509 thousand, or 7.8%, to $6.0 million for the quarter, compared to $6.5 million for the prior year quarter. Two factors drove this decrease: federal deposit insurance premiums dropped after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency lifted its regulatory order on the Bank in November 2014, and the Bank had lower expenses associated with delinquent loans and loan workout in addition to lower other non-interest expense. \nIncome Taxes \nIncome tax expense was $13 thousand for the three months   compared to $16 thousand for the prior year quarter. \nFinancial Condition Highlights \nAt June 30, 2015, total assets were $670.8 million, reflecting a decrease of $5.6 million, or 0.8%, from total assets of $676.4 million at March 31, 2015. This change was primarily driven by decreases of $9.5 million in the investment portfolio and $5 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase of $9.1 million in the loan portfolio net of the allowance for loan losses. \nTotal investment securities decreased $9.5 million, or 8.4%, to $103.6 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $113.1 million at March 31, 2015. Held-to-maturity investments increased $4.7 million as the Bank redeployed excess cash by purchasing securities, while available-for-sale investments decreased $14.2 million due to calls and maturities during the quarter. \nNet loans receivable increased $8.7 million, or 1.8%, to $491.9 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $483.2 million at March 31, 2015, following growth in mortgage and business loans from loan purchases and originations. \nLoans held-for-sale (\"HFS\") remained unchanged at $2.6 million at June 30, 2015. \nTotal liabilities decreased $4.9 million, or 0.8%, to $616.5 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $621.4 million at March 31, 2015, following the maturity of short-term borrowings, partially offset by increased deposits. \nDeposits increased $18.8 million, or 3.6%, to $546.6 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $527.8 million at March 31, 2015, due to an increase in certificates of deposits and money market accounts. \nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and other borrowed money decreased $25.0 million, or 30.0%, to $58.4 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $83.4 million at March 31, 2015, as new deposits replaced maturing short-term borrowings. \nTotal equity decreased $691 thousand, or 1.3%, to $54.3 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $55.0 million at March 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by an $868 thousand increase in unrealized losses on investments, partially offset by net income earned for the quarter. \nAsset Quality \nAt June 30, 2015, non-performing assets totaled $14.9 million, or 2.2% of total assets, compared to $15.3 million or 2.3% of total assets at March 31, 2015, and $14.9 million or 2.3% of total assets at June 30, 2014. Non-performing assets at June 30, 2015, consisted of $5.1 million of loans 90 days or more past due and nonaccruing, $3.0 million of loans classified as a troubled debt restructuring, $3.7 million of other real estate owned, and $2.6 million of loans classified as HFS. \nAt June 30, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $4.1 million, representing a ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans of 47.9% compared to a ratio of 53.3% at March 31, 2015. Reflecting a 2.9% drop in our non-performing assets during the first quarter, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.8% at June 30, 2015, compared to 0.9% at March 31, 2015. \nAbout Carver Bancorp, Inc. \nCarver Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Carver Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered stock savings bank.
