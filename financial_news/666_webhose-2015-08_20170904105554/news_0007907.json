But for South Africa this scenario is least likely, because of all the domestic issues plaguing the country. \nVan Papendorp thinks the SA Reserve Bank will continue with inflation targeting. \nOn economic growth, MMI sees somewhat of a recovery in GDP for this year. \n\"We don't particularly see consumer or investment spend as being very strong. However, we expect firms to start building inventory again,\" Packirisamy said. \n\"The consumer is a large driver of GDP (gross domestic product) in SA, but the confidence of consumers has plummeted. They are now more pessimistic than during the global financial crisis and conditions for them are now less favourable than during the global financial crisis.\" \nShe said MMI is not expecting consumer spend to be downright negative, because of positive real wage settlements. \n\"We don't think consumer growth will exceed 2% as some of the credit dynamics look unfavourable. The outlook on GDP does not bode well for jobs. Net hiring intentions remain weak across all sectors. \n\"However, the the upper income group remains the most insulated against job losses as this is where the skills pool is usually to be found.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:00:50.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
