It's fun and a really great app.\nReliving Tamagotchi Oh, I see you'd like to relive the incessant nagging, beeping and shitting of an amorphous, digital blob? Great! Well Tamagotchi Classic is available for your iPhone, Android and your Apple Watch.\nYou feed it, you play little games like Bullseye with it, you bathe it, you clean up it's mess. And now with the advent of the Watch extension, it can alert you when it needs things!\n If you miss the incessant nagging of your Tamagotchi there is an app for you. Supplied Which is all the time!\nSince its creation in 1996, more than 76 million Tamagotchi units were sold world wide. There was something cute about having that egg shaped toy in your palm. But I need that palm for my phone now.\nDon't bother downloading this app, no matter how nostalgic you are.

There aren't the attack-chain combos like the console game. App Store And aha! The tenth instalment of that sweet, gentle wholesome game Mortal Kombat was released in April.\nThis franchise has been going for 23 years. The release of the new game was generally agreed to be a critical success and there are lots of groovy fatalities. There's also the Terminator. And an app version!\nNow I'm not a game reviewer and I'm not claiming to have any insights into the deep, complex, highly intellectual world of gaming, but for a regular joe this app is sweet.\nAll the fighting is done through touchscreen taps and slashes. There aren't the attack-chain combos like the usual console game, but there are fatalities. Not too many though which is a bit of a bummer as that was the most satisfying part of the game.\nBut the sleek and graphic deaths are a pleasure to watch.
