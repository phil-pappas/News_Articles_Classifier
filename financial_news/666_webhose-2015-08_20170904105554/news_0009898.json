Chris Hocking by Fiona Carruthers Pip Coates Adam Rollason El Nino weather patterns usually spell a 50 per cent chance of below-average natural snow. But it seems this year the predictions haven't turned out quite so badly. After a steady winter season, spring skiing is looking more than promising with 47cm of new snow falling over the past week at Thredbo and Perisher in NSW, and 20cm at Victoria's Falls Creek.\nThe Melbourne-based Bureau of Meteorology manager of climate monitoring and prediction, Dr David Jones, says so far the 2015 season sits somewhere between below average and average for snowfall. But it's still a good deal better than the previous El Nino cycles of 1982, 1994 and 2006. Once the snow started falling in July, it has done so reasonably consistently. Plus there is still a chance it could jump above average.\n\"The next few days are certainly quite cold with snow showers and quite wintry conditions,\" says Jones. \"Perisher, for example, is looking at 2 degrees during the day and -5 or -6 overnight with snow showers adding to snow base. Next week it could get up to 5 degrees during the week, but weather can be changeable. We have seen some very dynamic weather over Australia in past few weeks.\"\nCertainly the late blast has given ski nuts something to get excited about, if the crammed Instagram feeds of snow flurries are to believed. Indeed, spring skiing in Australia has rarely looked so good for those contemplating a final mad dash for the slopes.\nA traditional sabre opening for Mumm champagne at Thredbo in August. \"There's a natural base of more than one metre with continuing flurries,\" says Anthony O'Shea, head of marketing for Merlin Skifields (Falls Creek and Hotham). \"We're in great shape going into this weekend, which looks like superb weather, with cold temperatures, light winds, sunny breaks and more snow showers.\n\"September looks like being a beauty.\"\nThe upside of El Nino has been the consistently clear, dry and especially cold nights this season that has allowed for maximum use of expensive and expanded snowmaking facilities across Australian resorts.\nSteady snow dumps Perisher still boasting plenty of cover. Visit Snowy Mountains general manager Gregg Quinn says most leading Australian resorts experienced dumps of up to three metres of snow at the end of June last year. However, this year, the falls have been more steady all the way through.\n\"The snow has been a lot more consistent this year, meaning the skiing over the past four weeks has been exceptional,\" Quinn says. \"It's almost back to the glory days of the 1980s when you could pretty much rely on skiing into late August being really good.\"\nAt this stage, Fall's Creek, Thredbo and Perisher plan to stay open until October 5, while Hotham tends to close towards the end of September after the Victorian school holidays, but already NSW resorts are flagging they possibly could be open until mid October.\n\"One of the most pleasing things this year is we had no hot weather until now, which bodes well for September skiing,\" says Quinn. \"The quality of snow has been better than we expect this time of year. All resorts are still top-to-bottom skiing and with 100 per cent of lifts still going and that looks like it will continue for the next four weeks, before things start to wind down.\"\nFalls Creek has a natural base over the metre mark, with up to 1.7m in snowmaking areas. Chris Hocking The only problem could be spring crowds. Visit Snowy Mountains is up 13 per cent (year-on-year) for accommodation bookings for late August, while September pre-bookings are up 7 per cent. Falls Creek Reservations Centre's bookings for September are up by about 15 per cent on last year. \"We've seen a similar increase in advance sales of lift, lesson and rental products, with confidence about snow conditions in September encouraging more people to purchase,\" O'Shea says.\nBattle for global ski pass hot as ever As the Australian 2015 ski season draws to a close with strong snow falls, the battle of the global ski pass remains as hot as ever. An announcement is expected soon on the outcome of ongoing negotiations for Falls Creek and Hotham to join the Aspen Mountain Collective.Thredbo is already a member, meaning its season pass holders can ski a range of American ski fields for a limited number of free days and additional days at 50 per cent off, including Aspen Snowmass.\nThe biggest ski news this year, however, remains Vail's purchase of Perisher from James Packer for $177 million back in March. The deal led to Perisher joining Vail's competitive Epic Pass, which offers skiing in Australia (Perisher), the United States and select European and Japan ski fields all for the one price.\nMonday August 31 is the deadline to secure the cheapest price for the Epic Australia Pass (2016 Australian ski season at Perisher and the 2016-2017 US season) at $749 for adults.\nMeanwhile, Telluride has just joined forces with Snowbasin in Utah so you can have three days free skiing at Snowbasin with every Telluride season pass â€“ priced at about $US1150 ($1610) an adult. The pass also provides discounts on a range of offerings, including accommodation, dining, retail and ski school.\n\"The industry is doing as many partnerships as possible,\" says Quinn. \"The northern and southern hemispheres see a lot of strategic value in partnerships through Vail Epic or Aspen Mountain Collective passes. They're also simply making their own smaller scale partnerships, like Telluride.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:11:28.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
