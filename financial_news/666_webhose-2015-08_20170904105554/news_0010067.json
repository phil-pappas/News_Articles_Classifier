The pending class action lawsuit against Conner Logistics, Inc., is currently pending in the Fresno County Superior Court, Case No 15CECG02546. To read a copy of the Complaint, please click here . The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and other employees working as truck drivers for the company in California performed the manual task of transporting goods for Conner Logistics, Inc. and were allegedly paid on a piece-rate basis. Additionally, the Complaint claims that the truck drivers were not paid minimum wages and alleged federal overtime wages to which they were entitled to because of Defendant's alleged failure to record all time worked. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the truck drivers should have been paid minimum wages for their non-driving time, the time spent working during pre-trip and post-trip inspections and time spent allegedly waiting for Defendant's loads to be ready for transport.\nThe pending class action lawsuit against Conner Logistics, Inc. also alleges that the transportation company did not have a policy or practice which provided a full off-duty, thirty minute uninterrupted meal break to the Plaintiff and other California Class Members. The Complaint claims that the company's alleged failure to provide the legally required meal and rest breaks is evidenced by their business records which contain no evidence of these breaks. Consequently, truck driver employees working for Conner Logistics, Inc. allegedly forfeited meal and rest breaks without additional compensation.\nFor more information about the class action lawsuit against Conner Logistics, Inc. call (866) 771-7099 to speak to an experienced Sacramento labor law attorney today or click here for more information.\nBlumenthal, Nordrehaug, & Bhowmik is an employment law firm with law offices located in San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, and Riverside Counties.
