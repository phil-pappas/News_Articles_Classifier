While I didn't agree with everything Mark wrote, he has played a significant role in Australian public life and brought rare personal insight into his writing.\"\nLast week's AFR BOSS cover featuring from left: Mike Baird NSW Premier, Rosie Batty Australian of the Year and Catherine Livingstone head of the Business Council of Australia. Nic Walker After losing to John Howard in 2004, Mr Latham began what became a regular Financial Review column in the lead-up to the 2007 election.\nMore recently, he strongly defended former prime minister Julia Gillard over her relationship with the Australian Workers' Union in the 1980s that ended up being probed by the current Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.\nMr Latham also has controversially covered social issues from a self-styled western Sydney perspective, including sharp critiques of feminism, the medicalisation of mental illness and anti-domestic violence campaigns. He even criticised the past two Australians of the Year, Rosie Batty and Adam Goodes.\nLegal action by Lisa Pryor Fellow Financial Review columnist and Institute of Public Affairs executive director John Roskam on Monday said Mr Latham's resignation suggested the public debate had gone \"beyond creeping political correctness to outright authoritarianism\". Matthew Piper Former columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald's Good Weekend magazine, Lisa Pryor has taken legal action against a Financial Review column Mr Latham wrote about her last year.\nFeminist websites and activists have campaigned against Mr Latham's columns, including by complaining to Westpac, which presents the successful Women of Influence awards with the Financial Review .\nMr Stutchbury accepted there was always a line that responsible publications must not cross.\nBut he defended the Financial Review's right, and even duty, to publish provocative opinions that some might find offensive, as this was a hallmark of a vibrant democracy. No person or idea should be out of bounds for criticism because that would prevent them from being properly tested by the marketplace of free speech, he said.\nIn June, a Latham column scolded Ms Batty, who has become a campaigner against domestic violence after her 11-year-old son was murdered by his disturbed father.\nIt criticised her talking about her personal tragedy on the paid speaking circuit and accused left-wing feminism of depicting domestic violence as the result of a patriarchal gender power imbalance rather than a function of social disadvantage.\n'Serious issue of public importance' Mr Stutchbury said the Financial Review's editors carefully considered this column before publishing but judged that Mr Latham had raised a serious issue of public importance.\nThe masthead gave generous scope for others to respond to Mr Latham's critique. And, on Friday last week, Ms Batty was pictured on the front of the inserted BOSS magazine as one of the magazine's 2015 \"true leaders\", chosen by an independent panel of judges. A Financial Review editorial praised her leadership contribution.\nAsked about Mr Latham's columns last month, Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick indicated that she had been asked by women whether they should avoid the awards because of the association with the Financial Review .\nMs Broderick, who is the overall winner of this year's awards, said she supported free speech but suggested that Mr Latham's columns were damaging the Financial Review's brand.\nFellow Financial Review columnist and Institute of Public Affairs executive director John Roskam on Monday said Mr Latham's resignation suggested the public debate had gone \"beyond creeping political correctness to outright authoritarianism.\n\"And that's a comment from someone who has only ever agreed with 30 per cent of anything Mark Latham has written,\" he said. \"Mark has that special capacity to have you either violently agree or violently disagree with him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:57:20.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
