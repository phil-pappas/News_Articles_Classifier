And it's the only business I know where you get paid whether you make somebody money or not .\" \nMonks served as the chairman of Spinnaker Trust , managing more than $1 billion in assets. He was also chairman of proxy services provider Institutional Shareholder Services and the founder of Atlantic Bank. \nWhile most Americans use mutual funds to save for retirement and fees are coming down, Monks said expense ratios remain stubbornly high and the companies still do not report a lot of expenses like trading costs. \"They are supposed to be very simple instruments, and I don't know if you have ever read a prospectus for a mutual fund, but I would not recommend it,\" said Monks. \"They are supposed to be written in plain English, but often they obscure what the fees are and what the conflicts of interest are by using difficult language to read.\"Monks said the problem with low-cost index funds is that they enable irresponsible corporate behavior by not wielding their power over a company when a major issue comes up for a vote like executive pay. In his view, this is one of the factors driving the widening inequality in the country between CEOs and employees. \"A lot of the time we don't actually know what is in the index fund,\" said Monks. \"They are so big and so vast, we have no idea what stock we are invested in and some investors could be invested in stocks they don't agree with or with companies that do things they don't like.\"Finally, Monks said the solution to these problems is for investors to \"engage\" their money managers and find out the true cost of their services. And if they don't like their arrangement, they can surely find a cheaper and more effective alternative because they are indeed out there.
