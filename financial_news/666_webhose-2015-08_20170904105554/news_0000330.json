Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl Trade Minister Andrew Robb is planning to lead a major trade mission to Indonesia in November in the first significant sign of an improvement in business relations since the row over executions.\nThe move comes as the government will on Friday urge Australian businesses to take economic opportunities in south-east Asia more seriously but also against a background of fears about a growth slowdown in China, which have been fed this week by the currency devaluation.\nMr Robb will release a new government guide to business opportunities in the ten countries covered by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) group, which is due to formally start a limited form of common market from the beginning of next year.\nThe minister will tell the launch at PwC in Melbourne: \"Doing business in ASEAN requires sound risk management and sophisticated due diligence. The rewards are there for those that invest in relationships, think long-term and are alert to local partnerships.\"\nHe will emphasise that collectively ASEAN is a larger trading partner for Australia than any country other than China and accounts for more than 15 per cent of total trade.\nBut the region with a population of 620 million and economic output of US$2.5 trillion, accounts for less than 5 per cent of Australia's total outward foreign investment.\nThe government business guide says: \"ASEAN political leaders have committed themselves to achieving a single market and production base in the near future, pushing ASEAN to become the third great emerging driver of global prosperity, after China and India.\n\"ASEAN's diversity presents a range of opportunities for Australian business â€“ from Singapore's sophisticated services-based economy to frontier markets in Laos, Burma, Cambodia, the rapidly modernising economy of Vietnam and strategically significant consumer centres such as Indonesia.\n \"Australian exporters and investors should take the time to understand the developments in the region and what they can mean for their businesses. Australia's competitors in the region are already recognising the opportunities presented by ASEAN's growth and economic integration.\"\nMr Robb's trip to Indonesia with a planned group of 200 Australian business figures in late November will seek to rebuild business ties after the ministry reshuffle by President Joko Widodo and restart delayed discussions on an economic partnership agreement between the two countries.\nThe government has already lifted the limit on ministerial visits imposed after the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran and it is likely that Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will travel to Indonesia before Mr Robb.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl"], "published": "2015-08-13T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:38:03.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
