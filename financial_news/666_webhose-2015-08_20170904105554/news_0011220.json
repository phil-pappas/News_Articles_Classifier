The recent developments could lead to some downgrades to the ECB’s consumer-price forecasts, which are due next month.\nConstancio said the central bank’s quantitative easing program to buy 60 billion euros ($69 billion) a month of euro-area debt is “open ended.”\nAt the same time, he said the slide in euro-area inflation expectations in August was due mainly to renewed declines in oil prices and is not in itself a cause for further action, such as extending the duration of QE beyond its initial end-date of September 2016.\n“Monetary policy cannot and should not try to correct, because those effects will disappear one day,” he said. “ The price of oil will not go down to zero.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T15:06:30.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
