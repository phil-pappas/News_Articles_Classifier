The firm's Goldman Sachs Special Situations Fund bolstered the Swisse balance sheet in August 2013 with $70 million and is set to prosper if a sale follows.\nAs one observer put it, Goldman's special situations team will \"make out like bandits\" should the auction find a buyer at a price acceptable to the vendors. And if there is a deal, it would signal a remarkable turnaround in the consumer goods company's fortunes.\nIn 2013, Swisse reported $232 million revenue and $2 million earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Its 2014 forecast of $16 million in EBITDA was tied to ambitious margin growth projections through planned cost reductions in marketing, better commercial terms with retailers and efficiencies from greater scale.\nAt the time, Swisse was targeting the United States, through an ill-advised marketing campaign spearheaded by daytime TV queen Ellen DeGeneres and ads showing Nicole Kidman wandering around a garden in short shorts and cowboy boots.\nHowever, it is understood the vitamins company has had a lot more success on China and it is this China story which has drawn bidders into the data room.\n One of the over-arching trends driving sales in the vitamins market at a retail level is large volumes of vitamins being purchased by Chinese expatriates in Australia, who send them to relatives and friends in China, according to Swisse executive chairman and former Foster's Group boss Trevor O'Hoy.\nIt comes amid a lack of confidence in the quality and manufacturing practices of some China-based health food and vitamin supplement makers. Some people in China prefer the vitamins made by companies in the Western world, with perceptions in part fuelled by scandals involving contaminated milk powder in China.\nIt is understood Swisse's online sales to China are also booming, although some buyers are known to be sceptical about the sustainability of Swisse's earnings made via Alibaba's online marketplace in China.\nASX-listed Blackmores, one of Australia's biggest vitamin and natural health foods groups, has experienced an extraordinary rise in its share price up 150 per cent to $87.96 this calendar year.\nSwisse is majority owned by the founding Ring family, while chief executive Radek Sali , a former Village Roadshow executive, and former chief Michael Saba each own a 15 per cent stake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:06:19.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
