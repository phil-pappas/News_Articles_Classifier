I crunched the numbers (see bottom of post for details), and found that [tweet_Quote: display=\"1 in 4 married men in the United States were on Ashley Madison.\"]one in four married men in the United States were on the Ashley Madison site.[/tweet_Quote: ] One in four. You know four married men. I know way more than four married men. At least one in four of them was on Ashley Madison. Of course, there are a zillion other ways to find sex or romantic companionship with someone who is not your wife. I don't need to spell them out, because you are an adult, and you live in the real world where everyone knows that people cheat, all the time. And yet, when we hear figures like half of men cheat, or 15 percent of married women cheat, as New York Times bestselling therapist M. Gary Neuman told me for this article about Ashley Madison and the impending divorce boom, we all exhibit shock and awe and skepticism at these very high numbers. We can mark that all up to quaint American Puritanism (which has always barely veiled our very naughty ways), but there is real financial fallout from women choosing to ignore the facts about how fragile their marriages really are. Despite the fact that divorce rates have remained relatively steady at about 50 percent for decades, women continuously fail to safeguard the financial futures (and therefore that of their children, since the two are statistically intertwined) by abandoning their careers, failing to maintain financial autonomy, and banking on lifetime alimony.As devastating as infidelity is to the individuals involved, and nearly always ends the marriage, and according to Neuman, the sheer vastness of the [tweet_Quote: display=\"Ashley Madison hack should be a wake-up for women who say their marriage is fail-proof. via @forbes\"]Ashley Madison hack should be a powerful wake-up call for women who tell themselves that their marriage is fail-proof, and they don't have to take responsibility for their own financial wellbeing[/tweet_Quote: ] . They're wrong. Here's how to turn that around: Never, ever abandon your career. Sure, you might want to scale back or slow down when you have your kids. But technology and the nature of the economy means it is more critical than ever to maintain your hard-earned skills, network and certifications. Plus, when you put 100% of your entire family's financial eggs in their husband's basket, you increase risk of financial woes two-fold. Plus, couples that depend on a single income are twice as likely to divorce, according to one study, and couples in which both partners are happy at work are more likely to be happy in their marriages. Further, opting out of the workforce puts you at very high financial risk in the very likely chance that you do divorce. Cheating and divorce are extremely likely. You buy life insurance in the teeny tiny likelihood that you should die before you kids graduate college. What are you doing to safeguard your financial future in the very real chance your husband will cheat, or you will otherwise find reason to want out of the marriage? Never assume alimony will support you in the event of divorce. Increasingly, judges limit alimony payments in term of time and amounts paid, and expect women to work for their livelihoods, as I wrote about here . Remember: more and more judges are women -- women who worked while their kids were growing up and have little sympathy for women who expect men to support them indefinitely. Plus, if your husband looses his job or becomes disabled, no more alimony. Sorry. Be actively involved in the family finances. One financial planner specializing in divorce told me: \"It amazes me how often women have no idea what is going on with the family accounts.\" You should have bank and investment accounts in your own name, and together with your husband keep a close eye on household finances. That way you know if hundreds of dollars (or more) each month are flying out the window on dinners, hotels and dating sites via secrete credit cards, or join accounts you choose to ignore. Plus, in the event of a split, you will be in a better position to support yourself and your kids while the finances are sorted out, and have a lower chance of your ex blowing through joint funds or ruining your credit. 1 in 4 U.S. Married Men on Ashley Madison: 37 million Ashley Madison member names leaked-5.5 million female names", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T19:10:25.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
