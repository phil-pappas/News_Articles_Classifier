Source: News Limited\nOtherwise, if you want a more complex style, have time to spare or are prepared to be a bit adventurous, why not head to a local hairdressing college, TAFE or school.\nThey are always looking for people who are happy to provide students with experience for a fraction of the cost of a fully qualified stylist.\nMobile hairdressers who come to you door can also be cheaper than many salons.\nDon Steele used to have a salon in rural Victoria but gave it away and decided to take his tools to the customers rather than the other way around.\n“I’m actually cheaper than the average hairdresser because my overheads are a lot lower; no shop rental, rates, power bills or staff.”.\nOtherwise look out for deals from new salons opening in your area, search online for deals and be prepared to shop around.\nOr if you are happy to let your hair hang a bit longer than usually, spread out the time between snips. Having a $20 cut every eight weeks instead of every four could save you $43 — or more than two cuts — every year.\nMORE: COMPARE INTEREST ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-save-money-on-getting-your-next-haircut-so-it-doesnt-break-the-bank/story-e6frfmcr-1227502435487?sv=1db0ad4fe121ab25a0f7f6c4c56f63da", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-save-money-on-getting-your-next-haircut-so-it-doesnt-break-the-bank/story-e6frfmcr-1227502435487?sv=1db0ad4fe121ab25a0f7f6c4c56f63da", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-save-money-on-getting-your-next-haircut-so-it-doesnt-break-the-bank/story-e6frfmcr-1227502435487?sv=1db0ad4fe121ab25a0f7f6c4c56f63da&h=How+to+trim+the+cost+of+a+haircut", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=haircuts", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-save-money-on-getting-your-next-haircut-so-it-doesnt-break-the-bank/story-e6frfmcr-1227502435487?sv=1db0ad4fe121ab25a0f7f6c4c56f63da&title=How+to+trim+the+cost+of+a+haircut", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+to+trim+the+cost+of+a+haircut&c=HAIRCUTS+are+a+regular+expense+but+no+matter+your+style%2C+gender+or+colour+preference+there%26%238217%3Bs+always+a+way+to+shave+a+few+bucks+off+your+barber%26%238217%3Bs+bill.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-save-money-on-getting-your-next-haircut-so-it-doesnt-break-the-bank/story-e6frfmcr-1227502435487?sv=1db0ad4fe121ab25a0f7f6c4c56f63da", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-save-money-on-getting-your-next-haircut-so-it-doesnt-break-the-bank/story-e6frfmcr-1227502435487?sv=1db0ad4fe121ab25a0f7f6c4c56f63da&title=How+to+trim+the+cost+of+a+haircut", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=haircuts"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T13:03:54.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
