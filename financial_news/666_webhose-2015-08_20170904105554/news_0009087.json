Apart from the present administration which is still new in office, several administrations in the past have treated the teachers with neglect and disdain. \nThe primary school is supposed to be the foundation base of the educational system of any given society that is ready to attain rapid development, but in the case of Benue, the reverse is the case more so that attention is given more to private-owned schools. But this trend has rather contributed immensely to the abysmal collapse of the primary education system. \nInvestigations revealed that primary schools in the food basket state have the worse infrastructure; they lack manpower and the welfare of the teachers is not given serious attention. This has, however, reduced the population of the schools as parents prefer to admit their wards in whatever manner of private schools than the public-owned institutions which in the past, was the foundation to all especially to those who have attained prominent heights in the society today. \nThis translates that government at all levels ought to direct more pointers to revamping the dilapidation of the primary school system, improve the remuneration of teachers and ensure that their salaries and allowances are properly and promptly paid. The governments ought to by now, stop to play lip service but to resolve permanently the demands of the teachers. \nHowever, going by what has played out in the past, the teachers are not motivated and they are not able to impact the best morals into the pupils who are generally perceived as leaders of tomorrow. The teachers have laid claims that it is where one works, his welfare is derived from but the past administrations appeared insensitive to this regard. Therefore, no meaningful progress has so far been attained in meeting the yearnings of the teachers within the generally acceptable standards of education. \nRetrospectively, the sufferings of the primary school teachers in Benue State can be traced to the non-payment of salaries and total neglect of government to comply with the implementation of salary structures which has been since the creation of the state. Both military and democratic governments in the past have not been able to meet the yearnings of the teachers satisfactorily. If there are civil servants that have not enjoyed the reward for labour, they are the teacher. Hence, it is often said that their reward is in heaven but some teachers are now crying out that they want have some of their rewards here on earth first. \nRecall that during the former Governor Aper Aku-led administration, the primary school teachers had their share of prolonged strike due to non-payment of salaries. The ugly trend continued with the military administrations that followed till the return of democracy in 1999. The former Governor George Akume-led administration, apart from enhancing the welfare of the teachers through provision of motorcycles, their salaries were being owed and that resulted to series of strike actions which even saw the death of several teachers during violent protests. Critical to mention was the owed June/July salaries of the primary school teachers popularly referred to as JJ. \nWhen the administration of former Governor Gabriel Suswam came on board, it had quickly cleared the owed JJ hence it was a campaign promise made to the aggrieved teachers. Aside that, the former governor also increased the basic salaries of the teachers. Unfortunately though, as is very usual with previous administrations , the good start-footing of the Suswam administration deviated and the teachers were not implemented the new minimum wage from 2011 till 2015, even as all other civil servants in the state including local government staff enjoyed the salary structure all along. The situation caused incessant strikes and protests from teachers. To add pain to injury, the administration further failed to offset salaries owed the teachers for several months till the tenure elapsed in May, 2015. \nThe new administration of Governor Samuel Ortom was instituted. The governor quickly commenced the payment with May and June salaries, beginning from when the government was inaugurated. The governor also effected the implementation of the new minimum wage. What is more worrisome for the teachers and which is the controversy is that their owed monthly salaries beginning from January to April, 2015 has been skipped. \nThe chairman of the Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) in Benue State, Comrade Godwin Anya, told LEADERSHIP Weekend that, \"Immediately after inauguration, Governor Ortom implemented the new minimum wage of primary school teachers which was not affected by the previous administration since 2011 because many of our teachers died and their wards pursued from school but the governor has ended our suffering. \n\"The monthly salaries which the past administration owed since January, 2015 has been looked into. We have been paid have May/June salaries and the governor has promised to explore possible avenues to clear the salary backlog and for now, we are ensuring the cooperation.\" \nAt the moment, the contention is whether the present administration would live up to its promises and match words with actions to clear the backlog of salaries of the teachers. At the other hand is uncertainty of whether the primary school teachers would not embark on another strike as state government is making efforts towards offsetting the owed salaries. \nTo this end, Governor Samuel Ortom has assured during an interview that, \"I am a product of public school and you know that some time ago, I had dropped out of school due to lack of school fees. On that note, I know the value of education and it is one of the cardinal development points of my administration. Just as we quickly implemented the minimum wage when we took over as government, for payment of salaries, we shall ensure sincere compliance in order to end the prolonged sufferings of the teachers.\" \nHowever, the special adviser to the governor on Media and ICT, Mr Tahav Agerzua said, although the Ortom administration has inherited not just an empty but a deficit treasury, it would not exhibit ineptitude over payment of salaries especially that of the primary school teachers. He appealed to the teachers to be patient and cooperate with government to succeed and enhance rapid development in the education sector. \nAs it is, while the teachers await the fulfilment of government's promise to settle their salary arrears, it is left to be seen if the present administration would live above board and really match its words with actions.
