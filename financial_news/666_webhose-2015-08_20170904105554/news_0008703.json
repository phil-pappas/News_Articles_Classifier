Written by: Chuck Bolotin 08/22/15 - 9:23 AM EDT \nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- You've probably seen lots of articles about how great it is to move overseas. And, while some of what you read seems plausible, other parts may come off as a thinly veiled promotion. As a result, much of what you read, you don't believe to be true. In many cases, you're right: what you read is not true. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nThe truth is that opinions vary.For many people, moving overseas is, in their words \"The best thing I ever did,\" while, for others, it's a horrible experience. Which group would you be in?

I always interview expats separately, so that the answers I receive from each are not influenced by the opinions of others. I also ask open-ended questions. This allows me to receive answers that are the most revealing about how an expat really thinks and feels. The question I asked was along the lines of \"What's it like to live in Matagalpa?\" \nOne expat offered good detail in complaining about the increase in people panhandling (especially children) and how that annoyed him. Other than that, he had very little else to add. The other expat, Jewel Hoff, from Las Vegas, told me a story about how, the previous day, she was driving in her jeep and saw a poor Nicaraguan woman holding some flowers. When Jewel stopped to tell the woman how beautiful her flowers were, the woman thanked her and offered the flowers as a gift.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T00:04:58.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
