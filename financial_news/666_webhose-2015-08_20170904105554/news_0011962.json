His remuneration included R12,2m in “fringe and other benefits”.\nAt Telkom’s annual general meeting on Wednesday, Mabuza said bluntly that Telkom’s remuneration committee “does not support contracts of that nature going forward”.\nHe said the board was not admitting any wrongdoing, but said “it is an acknowledgment that the ex-CFO was paid in terms of the contract that he had. The point we are making is that we don’t have those contracts going forward. But there were contracts that were in place that were binding, and we paid.”\nMabuza added: “In my role as chairman, I will continue to ensure that Telkom adheres to the highest standards possible of corporate governance and performance.”\nSchindehütte was suspended on 24 October 2013 and quit the group on 8 August 2014. A disciplinary process brought against him was later abandoned with no reasons given, with Telkom agreeing to allow him to retire from the board with full benefits accruing.\nNeither Schindehütte nor Telkom ever revealed why he was suspended. However, he consistently denied that a R6m loan granted to him by the company, which he used to buy shares in the operator, was behind the suspension.\nThere was also talk at the time that he traded shares during a sensitive period. He bought R6m in shares just 10 days before Telkom published a trading statement that sent the share price rallying higher.\nSchindehütte declined to comment on the share trade beyond saying that he would not have traded if he believed he had access to sensitive information about Telkom that had not already been shared with the market.\nSchindehütte told TechCentral that he had been offered the opportunity to resign before being suspended, but doing so would not have been “congruent” with his “value system”. He said at the time that he respected the decision of Telkom’s board to institute disciplinary measures against him.\nTelkom said previously that it had received a number of allegations against its former finance chief and that the board had tasked an independent legal firm to investigate them.\n“A report was completed and presented to the board by the law firm. The board considered the report, applied its mind and took professional advice,” Telkom said.\n“In October [2013], the board determined that the fairest way forward was to provide Mr Schindehütte the opportunity to defend himself in a disciplinary hearing.” — © 2015 NewsCentral Media\n*This article was originally published on TechCentral.
