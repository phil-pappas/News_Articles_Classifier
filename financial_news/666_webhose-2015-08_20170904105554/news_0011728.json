However, given the exorbitant prices of properties and automobiles, taking a loan is usually the only option available when one wants to buy a house or car. \nWith interest rates on loans in India being high when compared to other developed countries, the amount of interest paid by the average Indian borrower over the tenure of the loan is considerably high. Here is where the prepayment option can be availed. It is possible to prepay the loan, either entirely or in part before the maturity of the loan, in order to reduce the interest burden and cash outflow. \nLet’s take the example of Pradeep, who had taken a home loan from his trusted bank. Pradeep had borrowed INR 40 lakhs as home loan at an interest rate of 10% per annum for a tenure of 20 years. The total amount to be repaid over the 20 year period amounted to INR 92.6 lakhs, with interest alone being INR 52.6 lakhs. The EMI amounted to INR 38,601. Wishing to reduce this burden, Pradeep decided to opt for the prepayment option. \nHow to prepare for a prepayment? \nThe RBI has waived prepayment penalty on home loans with floating rates. It is therefore possible to prepay the loan any number of times during the tenure of the loan. When one receives a windfall or lumpsum amount, it is recommended to use this to prepay the loan. \nIn this case, there is nothing specific to be done other than visit your bank and make the payment. However, it may also make sense to plan for a prepayment. In the case of Pradeep who wants to prepay regularly, he can save a fixed amount every month in a liquid fund. He can then make the prepayment in quarterly or half yearly intervals, to reduce the outstanding principal. \nWhen should you prepay and when should you not? \nWhen one receives a lumpsum payment, the dilemma is usually if the amount should be used to prepay the home loan or if it should be invested. A simple way to decide is to compare your home loan interest rate and the post tax interest rate of the proposed investment. \nLet’s say Pradeep received a bulk amount of INR 3 lakhs. The interest he pays on his home loan is 10%. Therefore if he uses this amount to prepay the loan, he can save approximately INR 30,000 annually on interest outflow, as the amount prepaid is entirely used towards reducing the principal outstanding. \nSuppose Pradeep invests this amount in a bank fixed deposit, he can earn a post-tax interest of around 8% per annum. This means he will earn INR 24,000 as interest annually. On the other hand, if he plans to invest in an equity mutual fund, which can yield a return of 12% per annum, he will earn an annual income of INR 36,000 from his investment. \nTherefore, Pradeep could prepay the loan rather than investing in a bank fixed deposit. On the other hand, if he does not mind investing in equity which can yield a higher return, he can choose this option over prepayment. While the above calculation is the general rule of thumb, there are other factors to be considered while making the prepayment decision. First, it may make more sense to prepay the loan in the initial years when the interest component of the EMI is very high, as the tax benefits can be fully availed. Second, consider your investments for critical goals. If you are lagging on this, it may be worthwhile to invest the amount in a high yielding asset for the long term goal rather than prepay the loan. \nThird, consider the interest rate scenario in the economy. If rates are likely to harden, your home loan interest rate also will go up, indicating a higher EMI burden. In this case, prepayment will ease your monthly cash flows. Fourth, and most importantly, consider the tax benefits which your home loan offers. \nTax benefits on loan—an important factor to be considered \nWhen you avail a home loan, you can use the principle and interest payment as a deduction from the total taxable income. Principle repayment is allowed upto INR 1.5 lakhs a year under Sec 80C, while interest payment is allowed upto INR 2 lakhs a year under Sec 24B. \nAgain, in the case of an education loan, you can claim the interest portion repayment as a deduction from your income and there is no maximum limit on this. When you decide to prepay your loan, remember not to lose out on these benefits. That is, the prepayment makes sense till your principal and interest payments for a year are above the exemption limit. \nIn the above example, Pradeep pays close to INR 4 lakhs as interest during the initial years of the home loan. However, the annual interest amount paid reduces as the loan tenure progresses (as low as INR 24,000 in the last year of the loan). Therefore the prepayment should be timed keeping in mind the tax benefits. Options on loan prepayment \nWhen you prepay the loan, you can either reduce the EMI amount or the loan tenure. Although reducing the EMI amount can ease your monthly cash flows, it makes more sense to reduce the loan tenure, as this will help in reducing the total interest outflow over the full tenure of the loan. \nPrecautions to be taken on prepayment \nCheck with your lender if there are any prepayment penalties before you make the prepayment.Some banks allow online prepayment of loans. However, if your bank does not allow this, then remember to carry all requisite documents to the bank when you prepay the loan. Also remember to take an acknowledgement of the prepayment.Sometimes, you will need to show the source of funds for the prepayment to avoid penalties. Remember to carry your six-month bank statement for this purpose.A loan prepayment can improve your credit score. Remember to check your credit report after about 2-3 months of prepayment, to check if this has been updated with the prepayment details.If you have issued cheques or standing instructions for EMI payments and your EMI amount changes post the prepayment, remember to issue fresh cheque leaves or standing instructions to reflect the new EMI amount.Read more Home Loan and Insurance articles on the BankBazaar Blog, the definitive word on Personal Finance. \nABOUT BANKBAZAAR: \nBankBazaar.com gives banking a smarter online platform.
