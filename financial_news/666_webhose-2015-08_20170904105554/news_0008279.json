Onion prices are on the rise due to mismatch in supply and demand. In the national capital, the retail prices of onion have risen to Rs.60 per kg. A similar trend prevails in other parts of the country. The prices are rising due to the fall in production and sluggish supply of stored onions, meant for meeting the demand during the lean period of July-September, the ministry said in a statement. Total onion production is estimated to be less than 189 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June), down from 194 lakh tonnes last year. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are the top three onion producing states.
