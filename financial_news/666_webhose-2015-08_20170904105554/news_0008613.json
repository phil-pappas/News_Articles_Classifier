That's all they say,\" a French investor told AFP last year at a creditors' meeting in Tokyo. \n\"They seem to refuse to make public more precise information about MtGox's own (information) and how and when it was stolen, if it was really stolen.\" \nKarpeles had reportedly refused to travel to the United States, where he was being asked to appear for questioning in connection with MtGox's collapse. \nRegulators have scrambled to respond to the use of Bitcoins, with the European Banking Authority last year calling on the region's banks not to deal in virtual currencies until rules are developed to stop them being abused. \nLaunched in 2009 by a mysterious computer guru, Bitcoin offers a largely anonymous payment system and can be stored either virtually or on a user's hard drive. \nBackers say virtual currencies allow for an efficient and anonymous way to store and transfer funds online. \nBut regulators argue the lack of legal framework governing the currency, the opaque way it is traded and its volatility make it dangerous. \nRoss Ulbricht Silk Road mastermind \nAfter MtGox, Bitcoin's reputation was also damaged when US authorities seized funds as part of an investigation into the online criminal enterprise Silk Road t hat made millions of dollars from drug sales and other criminal enterprises. \nDuring the trial of the man accused of masterminding the network, a witness said investigators once suspected Karpeles of running the online black market - a claim he firmly denied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T11:35:58.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
