Here, panda Weiwei leans on ice blocks at a zoo in Wuhan, Hubei province. Reuters by Vesna Poljak Fears the crash of China's sharemarket could spread into the wider economy have faded as authorities have arrested the slide in equities for now, and more measured views dominate the mood among investors.\nThe news out of China has softened after the shock of a severe contraction in manufacturing activity for July, revealed at the start of the week.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia weighed in with its quarterly policy update on Friday, saying: \"The recent volatility in Chinese equity markets is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on consumption, given the relatively limited exposure of households to equities.\" But risks and uncertainty in the broader economy are still very real, the Reserve Bank warned.\nDays earlier, the Chinese economy's services sector delivered some stronger results, with the highest reading since August 2014 coming out of the China services purchasing managers' index survey for July.\nShare ownership in China \"is only a small portion of society … it's still marginal for them,\" St George chief economist Hans Kunnen said.\nHe said the Reserve Bank's concerns did not lie in equities but in longer-lived threats, which could come from the property sector or the borrowing of local governments.\n\"The RBA still have concerns about other aspects of the Chinese economy,\" he emphasised. \"There is room for policy error and overshoot.\"\nRisks remain to the financial system, too. Credit Suisse found that since the plunge in A-shares – stocks listed in mainland China and priced in renminbi – debt levels in the sharemarket have declined by about 40 per cent since June's peak. But they are still high.\n The Reserve Bank puts the level of margin loans in comparison to the market value of freely traded Chinese shares at 6.5 per cent, down from 10 per cent (the state still controls big stakes in some of China's largest listed companies that constrain the size of tradeable equities).\nCrucial parts isolated And evidence is mounting that crucial parts of the Chinese economy will be largely isolated from the damage inflicted by the sharemarket collapse.\nCapital Economics found that fears of a repeat of the 2007 property price crash were \"overplayed\" because monetary policy was still accommodative, unlike during the global financial crisis, and only one in 30 people is estimated to own shares, which should keep households sheltered.\n\"Although property and equity prices have both risen in recent quarters, there is little evidence of a direct link between the two,\" said Capital's economist Julian Evans-Pritchard. He believes that the correlation between property and equities in China has more to do with the fact that both sectors have been beneficiaries of loose monetary policy. Policy can stay loose because inflation is low.\n\"A key reason for the stock market fall in 2007 was a step-up in the pace of monetary tightening, which also pushed up mortgage rates,\" Mr Evans-Pritchard said. \"In contrast, the latest falls in equity prices have not been driven by a shift in monetary policy, which is still being loosened.\"\nHe is not the only one to take the view that China – in the face of still significant imbalances and slowing growth – will survive the rout in its stockmarket.\nANZ's China economist Li-Gang Liu looked at the country's financial system and concluded that its banks will be unharmed in spite of providing a large source of margin loans for investors. Had the bull market run longer, the dangers would have been graver, he countered.\n\"While the stock market fallout will not result in a financial crisis in China, according to our assessment, banks may reduce their lending to the real economy because they are asked to support the securities market,\" the ANZ economist said.\nANZ cites a reported estimate of ¥1.3 trillion ($280 billion) that has been lent by banks collectively to the China Securities Finance Corporation, a known buyer in the market over the past month, is keeping share prices afloat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:03:52.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
