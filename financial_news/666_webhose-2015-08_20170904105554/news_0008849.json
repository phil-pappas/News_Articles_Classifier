Share on twitter by Jamie Freed ï»¿ Travel agency group Helloworld expects to report a \"substantial increase\" in adjusted profit before tax in the current financial year amid strong momentum in sales from winning the entire whole of Australian government travel contract and good inquiries for 2016 in its leisure business, says outgoing managing director Elizabeth Gaines.\nHelloworld on Friday reported its full-year loss had widened to $198 million from the year-earlier $63 million, driven by $205 million of write-downs disclosed to the carrying value of intangible assets from legacy transactions earlier this month.\nHowever, the company met its operating earnings guidance, with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation and impairment of $27.5 million, within its forecast range of $27 million to $28 million.\nMs Gaines said the company would now give guidance on the basis of adjusted profit before tax now that it had transformed its brand and taken necessary impairments. Helloworld's adjusted profit before tax rose to $6.9 million in the last financial year, from a $1.7 million loss a year earlier.\nThe company's total transaction value fell 3 per cent to $4.7 billion and it did not pay a final dividend, the same as the prior year. But Ms Gaines said total transaction values had risen in the second half of the financial year, giving it a good start into the current year.\n\"That momentum in the second half with total transaction value increasing was very important,\" she said.\nHelloworld's QBT division in December won the rights to be the sole travel manager of the whole of Australian government travel contract and it will receive the full-year benefit of that in the current financial year.\nIts retail segment reported a 4 per cent decline in transaction values and a 37 per cent fall in adjusted EBITDAI, in part because of higher operating costs from investing in marketing to expand the Helloworld brand.\n It also reflected the full-year impact of an 8 per cent fall in agent numbers following the Helloworld transformation which began in July 2013. The company said there had been a slight reduction in the retail network over the last financial year but it had stabilised at close to 1700 locations across Australia and New Zealand.\nMs Gaines said leisure travel agents were receiving \"good inquiries\" for bookings in the 2016 calendar year, including to the United States, despite the fall in the Australian dollar.\n\"The airfares [to the US] have never been better,\" she said.\nHowever, she said domestic bookings were also strong, assisting the company's wholesale division. The wholesale and travel management segments reported slight rises in EBITDAI, with the latter driven by the whole of government travel contract.\nMs Gaines in June resigned from her role , but said she would remain in charge during the term of her six-month notice period ending in December unless the board found a successor earlier. \"The board are doing a search now,\" she said on Friday. \"That search process is well advanced.\"\nQantas Airways is the largest shareholder in Helloworld with a 28 per cent stake.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed"], "published": "2015-08-28T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:09:05.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
