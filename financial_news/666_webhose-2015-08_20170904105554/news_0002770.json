As such, the 7/29 high is important and can be used as a pivot (bullish above and bearish below).” -The 7/29 high was a decent pivot as crude has plunged over 10% from that high. 43.30 could provide downtrend support (downward sloping trendline). A break outside of the near term downward sloping channel (downtrend resistance) is needed to suggest that even the very short term move is no longer down. That is about 46.80 on Friday. \nDailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.Learn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from FXCM . @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Related Headlines McDonald's trialling table service in UK AAP \nMcDonald's will offer table service for the first time in the UK as it seeks to ward off competition from upmarket … Terms \nQuotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.
