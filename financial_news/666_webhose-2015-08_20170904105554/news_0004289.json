We have a formula that will steer you to the best buys.ETFs are the funds with shares that trade like shares of corporate stock. Most of them are index funds, passively tracking an index. That makes cost the focal point of your search. Your search will be well rewarded, since competition in the $2 trillion ETF industry has given rise to some screaming bargains in money management.If you want a diversified mix of U.S. stocks, either the Vanguard or the Schwab product is a fine choice. The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ( VTI ) will cost you only $46 over a decade per $10,000 invested, we calculate. The Schwab U.S. Broad Market Index fund ( SCHB ) is almost as good at $50.You want a portfolio of small-company shares? The story gets better. Funds from Schwab (its U.S. Small Cap ETF , SCHA ) and BlackRock (its iShares Russell 2000 , IWM ) are so efficient that their costs are negative.How does a fund wind up with a negative cost number? By dint of our three-part cost analysis. The first element is the expense ratio, the annual assessment imposed by the vendor to cover its overhead. Next is the bid/ask spread, which will be incurred by an investor on a round-trip trade of the ETF’s shares.The third element is the offset to overhead costs coming from the fees brought in from lending out pieces of the portfolio to arbitragers and short-sellers. At some funds, the lending fees are more than enough to cover the overhead.Costs, costs and costs—these are the things that matter in picking an exchange-traded fund that tracks an index. Here are three things that don’t matter: performance, tracking error and premium/discount.Past performance of a fund is irrelevant if the fund is a passive one. You don’t buy a long-term bond index fund or an emerging markets index fund because it went up last year. You buy it because you need some fixed income or some India in your portfolio.Tracking error is the day-to-day discrepancy between the index being followed and the ETF’s portfolio. It might matter to a day trader. It shouldn’t matter at all to a long-term investor.Two factors make up the tracking error. One is the expense drag—but you already have that matter taken care of in our cost formula. The other is the difference in results between the long list of stocks or bonds in the index and the somewhat shorter list used in the fund’s portfolio. This is a random number. It can be positive or negative. It’s statistical noise. Ignore it.Then there is the premium (or discount), the spread between the liquidating value of an ETF portfolio and the price at which it’s trading. An ETF share may be trading at $60 but have a theoretical value of $60.50 given what’s inside. That looks like a 50-cent discount, but the value you see on a computer screen may be based on stale prices. If the market makers are quoting the ETF at $59.98 bid, $60.02 ask, you can be sure that the true value is very close to $60. The discount is an illusion.If you are buying and selling this ETF, though, you should care about that gap between bid and ask. You’ll give up 4 cents to the market makers when you go in and out of the fund. We figure it into our cost analysis.The numbers in our survey assume a $10,000 investment in a fund held for a decade and then sold. They do not include commissions, which vary from broker to broker and are often zero. They assume a 5% annual appreciation.The winners in this competition are not hotshot managers. They are efficiency experts. Vanguard Group, the 40-year-old vendor of low-cost mutual funds, makes a strong showing at the top of the cost tables. So does Charles Schwab & Co. So does BlackRock, with its iShares funds. Although some BlackRock funds are a bit pricey, in diversified bonds the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ( AGG ) wins the efficiency prize. The cheapest fund out there shows up on our list of sector funds: Guggenheim Solar ( TAN ).This survey is limited to ETFs whose net expenses (expense ratio less the offset from securities lending) are no higher than 0.4% and whose assets as of May 15 were at least $50 million. Morningstar supplied the asset and expense ratio data; the bid/ask spreads are an average of Quote: s pulled on different days off Bloomberg, and the securities lending numbers came from fund distributors.
