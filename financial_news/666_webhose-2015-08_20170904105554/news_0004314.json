Following these steps can help you avoid trepidation about costly and frustrating repairs down the road and purchase a reliable and safe vehicle . \nProof of Water Damage... The Federal Trade Commission Seeks University of Phoenix Documents in Investigation \nIdentifying previous damages caused by flooding or hail damage can be a tricky issue. Flood damage can be common from storm-ravaged areas, especially coastal areas. During the past five years, several major floods have occurred in various cities throughout the U.S., which “dramatically raises the potential of encountering flood-damaged cars in the used vehicle market,” said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book, the Irvine, Calif. company that provides resale value of vehicles. “Buyers should thoroughly inspect any used vehicle prior to purchase, ideally through a per-purchase inspection (PPI) performed by a trained vehicle expert.” \nStart by looking for rust inside the car, especially on the seat rails and other metal parts throughout, said Chris Basso, a used car expert for Carfax, the Centreville, Va.-based company which provides vehicle history reports. Check also for water lines, silt or mud residue either in the trunk or engine and push down on back seats to see if they’re damp or water bubbles up through the cushions, he said. \nOther tell-tale signs of minor or serious flooding include fogged headlamps or discolored carpeting, said Ron Montoya, the consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based car shopping website company. \n“Be sure to check the car's vehicle history report,” he said. “A flood title specifically alerts future buyers that the car has damage from sitting in water deep enough to fill the engine compartment. Keep in mind the adage, ‘if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.’” \nSit in the vehicle and try out the seat tracks to see if they move or are rusty, said Lisa Copeland, managing partner of Fiat of Austin in Texas. Look under the caps as well. If you find rusted bolts, it is likely the vehicle was flooded previously. \nTake a look at the oil because if a car's been submerged in water, it will be a different color, sometimes compared to coffee with milk or a chocolate milkshake, she said. \n“The oil may be pale when it should be dark,” Copeland said. “Oil that’s been affected by flooding may also feel sticky to the touch.” \nIf the car has one, inspect under the spare tire, said Kenny Walters, who owns Kenny’s Lakes Area Automotive in Walled Lake, Mich. \n“It’s one of my favorite tricks, because it is usually a place that is forgotten and the damage still shows,” he said. “If a buyer is trying to clean up or even hide the fact that a vehicle has had flood damaged, they may often forget to check.” \nWhile hail damage is not as prevalent, examine the hood and roof for distinct pockmarks and observe to see if the windshield is cracked or if there is a non-factory replacement windshield, Basso said.
