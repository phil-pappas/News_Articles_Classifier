A reading above zero indicates expansion.\nThe survey's index on future business conditions, however, rose to 33.64 from 27.04 in July.\nThe survey of manufacturing plants in the state is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions.\nThe new orders index was in negative territory for a third month at -15.70 from -3.50 in July, while shipment activity declined to -13.79 from 7.88 in July.\nThe survey's gauge on the average employee workweek dropped to -1.82 from 4.26 and the index for the number of employees fell to 1.82 from 3.19.\nThe prices paid index fell to 7.27 from 7.45 July, while prices received fell to 0.91 from 5.32 the previous month.
