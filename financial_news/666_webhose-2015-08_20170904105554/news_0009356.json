Yes I do.\" \nHong Kong's Monetary Authority maintains the peg by buying U.S. dollars, or selling Hong Kong dollars, a system that some analysts believe will come under severe pressure amid China's economic slowdown and capital outflows following expected U.S. rate hikes this year. \nSpeculation about the future of the peg comes amid a broader debate over Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, after huge pro-democracy street protests last year raised doubts about the stability of the Chinese special administrative region. \nLaura Cha, chairman of the FSDC and non-executive deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings (HKSE: 0005.HK - news ) , said Hong Kong could thrive as an international financial centre even without universal suffrage. \n\"Of course, it would be nice to have, and we want, and the central government and Hong Kong people want to have universal suffrage. That hasn't happened for a variety of reasons, but it shouldn't stop us from moving forward,\" she told Reuters. \nCha stirred controversy last October after likening the Hong Kong protesters' demands for democracy to the emancipation of slaves.
