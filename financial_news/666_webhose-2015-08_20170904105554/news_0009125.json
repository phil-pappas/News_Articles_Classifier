Do not insult them. If this goes on mothers will stop sending their children to the borders,” Vishwas told reporters.\nHe said the sight of the veterans taking to the roads for what was “their due” was “painful” and urged Modi to take immediate steps in this regard.\n“It was painful to see them sitting. They are the ones who have braved all odds at the borders and the war front. They are asking for their right. I want to urge our wise Prime Minister to take steps and not compel these brave hearts to sit on the road demanding what is their due,” he said.\nIn an attempt at political point-scoring he said the AAP government in Delhi has ensured highest compensation to the families of brave hearts who have laid down their lives for the country after coming to power.\nEarlier, AAP MLA Col (retd) Devinder Sehrawat had skipped the President’s at-Home reception on Independence Day over the ‘One Rank, One Pension’ (OROP) demand.\nHe wrote to President Pranab Mukherjee seeking his intervention on behalf of the protesting ex-servicemen.\n 19, 2015 7:31 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:19:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
