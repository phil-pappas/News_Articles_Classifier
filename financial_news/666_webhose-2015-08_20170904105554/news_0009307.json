The question is: where is their like now? Instead we have to go back to the past, to a new collection of the works of Max Beerbohm. John Spooner by Dwight Garner It's only in retrospect that we can recognise the 1980s as a great decade for contrarians and curmudgeons, for cheerful and sophisticated loathers of every sort of vanity and humbug.\nLiterary critic Paul Fussell and art critic Robert Hughes were publishing their best cultural and social criticism; P.J. O'Rourke had not yet become predictable; Spy magazine had made its debut in New York; Christopher Hitchens and James Wolcott were dashing freshmen on campus; and Clive James, at the Observer in London, was searing on his griddle the crispiest television criticism the world had ever seen.\nEach of these humans seems to have been guided by the principle articulated by novelist Kingsley Amis: \"If you can't annoy somebody with what you write, I think there's little point in writing.\"\nNowadays, we have many writers who can rise to the occasion when called upon and, like volunteer firefighters in reverse, burn a stupid thing to the ground. But we have far fewer essayists of the sort you can point in almost any direction and be certain they'd return merrily gnawing on the bones of the topic as if it were a tub of fried chicken.\nBy the time he was 25, Max Beerbohm's writing had made such an impact that Vanity Fair caricatured him, in 1897. University of Virginia Fine Arts Library What killed the dinosaurs? Was it the internet? Global warming? Gluten? There's been a journalistic version of Dutch elm disease.\nThis is my lonely way of suggesting how much I looked forward to The Prince of Minor Writers: The Selected Essays of Max Beerbohm , a new selection of this writer's work which is as British as marmalade, edited by Phillip Lopate.\nRailing against children If we can't have new contrarians, then we can revere our much older ones.\n Writer Christopher Hitchens, like many great curmodgeons who came into their own in the 1980s, \"seems to have been guided by the principle articulated by novelist Kingsley Amis: 'If you can't annoy somebody with what you write, I think there's little point in writing.'\" Rocco Fazzari Beerbohm (1872-1956) was born in London and studied at Oxford. He wrote all manner of things – theatre criticism, parodies, essays, fiction. He was a social animal; he dressed well; he was a member of good clubs. Yet he didn't put on airs.\nHe had, as his admirer Virginia Woolf wrote, a voice that surprised and charmed readers because it \"seemed to belong to a man no larger than themselves.\" Woolf liked it that Beerbohm \"had no gospel to preach and no learning to impart\" yet transmitted so much of his personality on paper.\nThis volume – at the start, at any rate – brought out the malcontent in me. Lopate's introduction is, strange to say, too long and too good. He Quote: s so many of Beerbohm's best lines that he steps on them. It's like going to the movies and seeing two trailers for a film that's about to start.\nAlso, this book is front-loaded with a few of Beerbohm's lesser pieces. This may put off a wary reader who peeks in. I would have omitted three of the first five essays and several other of the longer ones. Beerbohm was usually at his best at about 1200 words.\nI soon settled in, though, and this book began to deliver deep pleasures. As curmudgeons go, Beerbohm was a gentle and self-effacing one. There are very funny broadsides here against walking, against the cult of children, against writing boring letters and against literary toadyism.\nBeerbohm was politically conservative (he called himself a \"Tory Anarchist\") but opposed stuffiness in all its forms. \"Only the insane,\" he wrote, \"take themselves quite seriously.\"\nHe disliked overexposing himself. \"I admire the plungingly intimate kind of essayist very much indeed,\" he wrote, \"but I never was of that kind, and it's too late to begin now.\"\nBut an intimate kind of warmth does blossom beneath the surface of many of these pieces; he is a man with a full and rippling heart.\nHe is good on social topics like the duties of being a host versus those of being a guest, and laughter and friendship. He reports: \"I like the social tradition that we must not poke a fire in a friend's drawing-room unless our friendship dates back full seven years.\"\nHe is a close observer of the expressiveness of clothes: \"The silk hat of Mr Whistler is a real nocturne, his linen a symphony en blanc majeur .\" About another dandy, he deposes: \"Melodrama crouches upon the brim of his sombrero. His tie is a Publisher's Announcement. His boots are Copyright.\"\nBeerbohm was not born into wealth and never amassed much of it. Thus he can write vividly about the terror (we've all felt it) of not having enough money to cover the cost of a dinner to which we've invited others. About the arriving restaurant bill, he says: \"I wished always it were not brought to me folded on a plate, as though the amount were so hideously high that I alone must be privy to it.\"\nIn one essay, about the site of a favourite rural inn at night, Beerbohm reminds you, because of lighting restrictions: \"These words are written in wartime and in England.\" During World War II, Lopate notes, Beerbohm gave radio talks for the BBC and became \"a spokesman for all that was most worth fighting for.\"\nPièce de résistance The pièce de résistance in The Prince of Minor Writers might be a satirical essay about the excellence and beauty of raging fires. When a wharf begins to burn in London, there is a \"strange glamour in the sky\" and Beerbohm has his cabdriver take him to witness it.\nWhen firemen begin to put out the blaze, Beerbohm is aghast. He grabs one of them by the arm and \"bade him sharply desist from his vandalism. I told him that I had driven miles to see this fire.\"\nThe piece just gets better and better. \"The sentimentalist may prattle of lifesaving,\" he writes, \"but we must think, rather, of the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\"\nHe schemes to start his own volunteer brigade to thwart firemen. His prose takes on a wicked glow. \"Each one of us will trail a sinuous hose. It will not be filled with water. It will be filled with oil.\"\nBeerbohm reminds us: \"Nothing is easier than to be an incendiary. All you want is a box of matches and a sense of beauty.\"\nThe New York Times\nThe Prince of Minor Writers edited by Phillip Lopate, New York Review Books Classics, distributed in Australia by Random House Books, $37.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:03:19.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
