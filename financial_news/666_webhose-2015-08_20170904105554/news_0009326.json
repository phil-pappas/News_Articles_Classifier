A divided three-judge panel of the court rejected challenges to the law that claimed it violates constitutional free speech rights. \nThe law signed in 2011 by Gov. Rick Scott prohibits doctors from asking patients about gun ownership or recording such information unless it is medically necessary. Doctors and their supporters say asking about guns, particularly if children live in a home, is a safety issue and could save lives. \nThe court has not yet decided whether to rehear the case. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T13:19:39.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
