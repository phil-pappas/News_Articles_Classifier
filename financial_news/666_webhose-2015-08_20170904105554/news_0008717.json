Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: India-focused private equity fund CX Partners is leading a consortium of investors to buy a 48 per cent stake in Cremica, a homegrown maker of biscuits and bakery products, for $100 million, or about Rs 650 crore, people directly familiar with the matter told TOI. The consortium, which includes some of the international backers or limited partners of CX partners, will buy out the shares held by Motilal Oswal and one of the promoter family siblings. Motilal Oswal's private equity arm had purchased a 20 per cent stake in the Ludhiana-headquartered company five years ago. Cremica, founded by Rajni Bector as a backyard enterprise back in 1978, was controlled by three siblings - Anoop, Akshay and Ajay Bector - with equal shareholding. As part of a 2013 family settlement, Anoop took charge of the biscuits and bakery unit, while Akshay now helms the condiments business. Ajay Bector, who owns a stake in the bakery company, is expected to trim down his stake as part of the impending transaction. Investment bank o3 Capital is advising on the transaction. When contacted by TOI, Anoop Bector and Motilal Oswal Private Equity's CEO Vishal Tulsyan declined to comment on the story. Ajay Relan of CX Partners could not be reached immediately for a comment. CX Partners, spearheaded by the former Citigroup veteran Relan, is expected to invest about $40 million from its fund, while the remaining capital would come as co-investments from international investors who are called limited partners (LPs) in private equity parlance. CX, which had raised $515 million in its maiden fund, is close to announcing commitments for its new fund. Cremica reported an over Rs 600-crore turnover selling biscuits, breads, sauces, bread spreads, ready-to-eat curries, mayonnaise, snacks and syrups. It owns the Mrs Bector trademark but garners a large part of its revenue from institutional sales to top food & beverage and hospitality clients. The list includes McDonald's, Starbucks , Cafe Coffee Day, Domino's Pizza and Jet Airways , among others. Private equity investors had poured top dollar into domestic food product companies in India, buoyed by the consumption story. However, over the past two years, the deal flow has considerably slowed down in the sector. The Cremica deal, which has been in the making since 2013, would be the first big-ticket funding in the space which seems to have lost its sheen among investors. The year so far has emerged as one of the best for exits by private equity and venture capital investors in India, with them realizing $6 billion of returns via share sale, largely led by technology, financial services and telecom in the January to July period according to a recent report released by Venture Intelligence.
