The iPhone maker's shares were up 1.5 percent at $116.36.\nEight of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the technology index's 1.19 percent rise leading the advancers. The consumer discretionary index lagged as Walt Disney weighed, while the energy index fell as gains in oil prices remained muted.\nInvestors will assess earnings reports from a number of companies on Wednesday, including Tesla Motors, GoDaddy , Fitbit and CBS.\nEtsy slumped 22 percent to $15, a day after the crafts shopping website operator's quarterly loss doubled due to higher marketing expenses.\nHandbag maker Kate Spade rose 6.7 percent to $22.09 after same-store sales beat estimates.\nTime Warner fell 7.2 percent to $81.39 after the company left its 2015 earnings forecast unchanged.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,510 to 1,450.
