Early adopters are going to face a high price tag for fully autonomous vehicles, which will command a $10,000 premium at least the first few years, according a recent Boston Consulting Group analysis. That’s not pocket change, but its an amount that could be recouped by consumers in just a few years thanks to the reduction in ownership costs associated with the cars. Here are four ways that owning a self-driving car will save you money.\nYour fuel efficiency will go up. Driverless cars will communicate with each other, eliminating the needs for slowing down and stopping at every intersection. On highways, driverless cars will “platoon,” driving more quickly and more closely together to eliminate wind resistance. t Insurance premiums will go down . Insurance start up MetroMile estimates that self-driving cars could save consumers an average $1,000 per year, given their near perfect safety record. If self-driving cars really do live up to the hype and eliminate collision-related crashes, then drivers will only have to pay for insurance for things like break-ins and acts of god. t You won’t get any more tickets. Say goodbye to speeding tickets, texting fines, or parking violations. With a driverless car, you’ll never have to worry about having to pay for subpar driving or worrying about traffic laws, since the car itself will be making such decisions for you.The reduction in tickets is expected to be so great that local governments are concerned about the potential drop in their revenue. “The hundreds of millions of dollars generated from poor driving-related behaviors provide significant funding for transportation, infrastructure… and many other public services,” according to a recent report by the Brookings Institute . t You may not need more than one car per family. The majority of families own multiple cars, but they don’t use them at the same time. A driverless car with a “return to home” mode would eliminate much of the need for the second car, since the first car could simply drive itself home to take the next family member where he or she needs to go. That’s the finding of a report by Brandon Schoettle and Michael Sivak at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute . They found the average household’s car ownership rate would likely fall from its current 2.1 to 1.2, following the widespread adoption of self-driving cars.In the 15 percent of incidences when family needs overlap, the wheel-less family member could always call a driverless Ube r.", "external_links": ["https://www.metromile.com/blog/self-driving-car-insurance/", "https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/automotive-consumer-insight-revolution-drivers-seat-road-autonomous-vehicles/?chapter=5#chapter5_section3", "http://www.umtri.umich.edu/what-were-doing/news/driverless-vehicles-fewer-cars-more-miles", "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2015/05/29-local-government-strategic-trends-desouza/desouza.pdf", "http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2015/0522/Why-Uber-s-driverless-car-has-been-spotted-all-over-Pittsburgh", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/41e0f6cee767486b9b61de7908dbadfe/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-08-18T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T13:12:44.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
