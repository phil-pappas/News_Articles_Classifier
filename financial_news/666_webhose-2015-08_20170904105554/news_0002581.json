Photo: Bloomberg\nThe bull market's base just lost another brick.\nAmid a collapse in breadth and the threat of falling earnings, add a correction in Apple shares to the concerns facing investors. The iPhone maker slipped 2.4 per cent to $US118.44 today, extending its decline since February to 11 per cent and dropping below another chart threshold, its 200-day moving average, for the first time since 2013.\nIt's good news for neither Apple bulls nor the larger market, where the stock makes up 3.7 per cent of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and 13 per cent of the Nasdaq 100 Index. Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company have fallen nine of the last 10 days, the first time that's happened since May 2012.\n\"Any time you get that type of a market leader with that big of a following, it is disconcerting to see it break trend,\" said Peter Sorrentino, a Cincinnati-based fund manager at Huntington Asset Advisors, which oversees $US1.8 billion including Apple shares. \"It is a popular stock and it had to lose speed, but for the broader market it makes one wonder if we are staring down a price correction.\"\nThe iPhone maker's shares had spent 471 sessions above the 200-day threshold, last falling below it in September 2013. It entered a correction territory today after coming within 40 cents of one on July 9 before rallying. A correction is when a stock falls more than 10 per cent below its high over a short period of time.\nApple's latest decline is another blow to US equities, which have struggled to break out of a 90-point range since February as market leadership has thinned. Apple's stock has been responsible for more of the S&P 500's bull market gains than any other stock, with its 10-fold increase accounting for 5.3 per cent of the run since March 2009.\nThe last time Apple slipped more than 10 per cent was in December during a decline that lasted 13 days. The S&P 500 dropped 4.8 per cent over the stretch before rallying to fresh records at the end of the month.\nApple's latest drop began on July 21, as the stock recorded its steepest post-earnings tumble since January 2013 after disappointing iPhone sales rekindled concerns over whether the company can keep making must-have products. While chief executive officer Tim Cook has succeeded in introducing an entirely new category with the Apple Watch, sales remain modest, indicating that Apple will have to keep relying on the iPhone to fuel growth.\nLosses in Chinese equities, where almost $US4 trillion was erased from June to July, may leave consumers with less money to buy gadgets in a market Cook expects to become Apple's biggest. Apple got 17.4 per cent of its revenue from China in its last full-year reporting period, Bloomberg data show.\nFor a large stock such as Apple breaking down, \"it would give any investors a cause of concern,\" said Albert Brenner, who helps manage $US5.6 billion as director of asset allocation strategy at People's United Bank Wealth Management in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\nAt the same time, \"the market has held up while Apple is trading down\", he said. \"Investors have to come to terms with if it reflects a change in either market sentiment or company fundamentals, or both.\"\nThis earnings season has been less than an overwhelming success for S&P 500 technology firms, ravaged by a strong US dollar and the decline in personal-computer demand. They've beaten analysts' earnings estimates at a 71 per cent pace so far in the season, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate is lower than for the entire S&P 500 - at 74 per cent - with notable misses including Yahoo! and Oracle.\nIn the Nasdaq 100, companies have swung up or down an average of more than 5 per cent immediately after reporting results in the past three weeks, the highest since 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Those that disappointed investors tumbled 4.8 per cent while those pleasing them gained 5.3 per cent.\nApple \"has had an incredible run over the last several years and the earnings were mildly disappointing to some people, so there were some extreme momentum players that used that as an excuse to lighten up\", said Marshall Front, the Chicago-based chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. \"We've been in a correction of sorts so it's not surprising that even the strongest companies with the brightest prospects can get nixed.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:51:14.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
