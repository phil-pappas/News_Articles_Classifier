MUMBAI: The seven-pronged PSU banks' revival plan 'Indradhanush' could help the lenders register higher growth rate than earlier estimated and effectively deal with the issue of NPAs, rating agency Crisil said today. As per Crisil, the plan to provide a clear roadmap on capital infusion by the government and maintaining a capital buffer beyond the regulatory minimum reinforces the rating agency stance that the credit ratings of public sector banks would remain in the 'high safety' category in the near term. The government on Friday had said it would infuse Rs 20,088 crore into 13 PSU banks within a month's time with country's largest lender SBI cornering a hefty Rs 5,531 crore. \"The proposals can help public sector banks effectively deal with the malaise of NPAs (non-performing assets), and potentially grow faster than our earlier estimate of 12 per cent annually till fiscal 2019,\" Crisil said in a statement. The agency said Indradhanush makes a realistic assessment of the capital needs of public sector banks, but it is highly dependent on the market for raising the money. \"This means banks would have to gain the market's confidence by materially improving performance, which in turn, will be a slow, multi-year process,\" it added. Crisil noted that the clear timeline given for the setting up of a Bank Board Bureau and the announcement inducting professionals as non-executive chairmen would eventually drive qualitative changes in governance, strategy formulation, capital efficiency, and human resource practices. Further, allowing bonus and stock options for senior management will make public sector banks competitive and go a long way in attracting right talent. \"A successful implementation of Indradhanush and a simultaneous deepening of the corporate bond market will vastly improve India's investment and growth potential,\" Crisil business head Raman Uberoi said.
