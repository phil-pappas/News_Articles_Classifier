Samsung has increased it space at Sydney Olympic Park, while McConnell Dowell has signed for another 7 years at the Vantage, Melbourne site,\" Mr Blackmore said.\nThe focus on costs saw the gearing maintained at 28.9 per cent with a low weighted average cost of debt of 4.8 per cent. The fund has also activated its distribution reinvestment plan (DRP) for the June 2015 distribution.\n\"The result reflects the strong position of the fund which has a high quality portfolio of six A-Grade metropolitan and business park office properties. Over the eight months to 30 June 2015, the portfolio has experienced a $24 million uplift in asset value ,\" he said.\nMr Blackmore said Australian metropolitan office markets have been tracking in line with economic growth, with the strongest markets in Sydney and Melbourne.\nHe said that while incentives in lease contracts, such as office fit out and rent free period, accounted for about 27 per cent, there was also genuine \"net face and effective\" rent increases.\n\"Market fundamentals indicate a stable outlook for metropolitan office markets across Australia. This is having a positive flow-on impact to capital values of assets in metropolitan office markets,\" Mr Blackmore said.\n\"In the Sydney metropolitan office markets, where the fund has 54 per cent exposure, we have seen office demand and rental growth continue to strengthen, supported by an improving NSW economy.\n\"The Victorian economy, which was the fastest growing in Australia, was expected to support office employment growth which, when combined with low supply, indicates solid rental growth opportunities in Melbourne metropolitan office markets.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:40:17.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
