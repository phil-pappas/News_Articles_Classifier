Their second daughter, Hannah, was born earlier this year. David Mariuz by Primrose Riordan Phillip Coorey Tony Abbott has dismissed calls to hold his proposed plebiscite on gay marriage in conjunction with the next federal election because the issue could cloud the broader election fight.\nAs Labor slammed the plebiscite as a delaying tactic designed to ultimately kill off the gay marriage push in Australia, Mr Abbott, who only recently opposed a plebiscite, said it was the fairest way to proceed.\nThe Australian Christian Lobby, which wants to kill off gay marriage, has been advocating a plebiscite for several months.\nGay marriage lobby groups, Liberal MP Warren Entsch who drove the failed push inside the Coalition, and others all called for the plebiscite to be called alongside the election due next year. Some Liberals, even those who oppose gay marriage, believe it should be held before the election to get the issue of the agenda.\nCold as ice!! @JoeHockey and @SenatorWong cross paths this morning after #MarriageEquaility status quo decision:\n https://t.co/mrJAU9Z2K0\n— ABC News (@abcnews) August 12, 2015 But Mr Abbott held firm to a post-election plebiscite.\n\"My disposition would not be to hold this people's vote concurrently with an election because, again, I think that people ought to be able to focus on the differences between a strong and competent Government and an Opposition which hasn't learned and can't change,\" he said.\n\"(I) think really the next election will rightly be a contest between two political movements, two very different political movements, and then I think we can have a separate discussion about where we should go with this important subject.\"\nLabor Senator Penny Wong accused Mr Abbott of using \"any tactic\" possible to delay the popular tide towards legalising gay marriage, and was even willing to \"tear his own party apart\" to stop a free vote.\n Ms Wong also said a plebiscite on same sex marriage would be \"divisive\" for the wider community, and the decision is one for the Parliament in line with a 2013 High Court ruling.\nBut she warned: \"there will be a vote on this, it's the next election\".\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten, who promising a vote on gay marriage within 100 days if elected, rejected a referendum as too costly and a vehicle to defeat the push.\nHe lampooned Senator Eric Abetz's argument inside the party room that all gay people did not really want to get married, citing Italian fashion designers Dolce & Gabbana as an example.\n\"Senator Eric Abetz is a clown,\" Mr Shorten said.\nSources said Senator Abetz told the party room on Tuesday night : \"lots of homosexuals don't want to get married, Dolce & Gabbana never got married\".\nMr Abbott has sided with conservatives and vocal gay marriage opponents, the Australian Christian Lobby, in the move, who said on Wednesday that a referendum or plebiscite in the next term of Parliament \"gave breathing space for ordinary Australians\".\nPro-same sex marriage lobby, Australian Marriage Equality, and Mr Abbott's sister, Christine Forster, said if there was to be a plebiscite it should occur at the same time as the next election.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey rejected this outright, saying the election should hinge on issues of \"much broader interest\" to the electorate.\nMr Abbott also signalled the cross-party private members bill, supported by Liberal MP, Warren Entsch, may not come to a vote.\n\"Look, let's see where things go we don't actually know what the bill provides,\" he said when asked about it.\nAccording to estimates on Tuesday night's meeting, about half of Liberal frontbenchers spoke in favour of a free vote.\nWith some PMs threatening to cross the floor if the bill did come to a vote, Mr Abbott said that was disappointing but within the party's rules for a back bencher to do so.\nHe said, however, ​his ministerial colleagues they would have to resign from the frontbench if they were to vote in support of same-sex marriage\n\"It is nevertheless the standard decision of our party that if a front bencher cannot support a party's policy, that person has to leave the front bench,\" he said.\nMr Abbott said putting the matter to the people in the next parliament was appropriate considering how new the concept was.\n\"Same-sex marriage is something which has only very recently come into our intellectual and cultural parameters,\" he said.\nMr Abbott, who has previously said a decision on gay marriage was \"the preserve of the parliament\", said he had changed his mind as it emerged the party room was increasingly in favour of a plebiscite.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SenatorWong", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarriageEquaility?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/abcnews/status/631256642416349185", "https://twitter.com/redneckninja/status/631076942653960192", "https://twitter.com/JoeHockey", "https://t.co/mrJAU9Z2K0"], "published": "2015-08-12T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:15:01.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
