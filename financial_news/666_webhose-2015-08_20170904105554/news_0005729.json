Subsequently Ed Miliband quit as Labour leader.\n\"When Ed Miliband talked about 'we've got reform politics' and it was just, 'ok, whatever'. He never really connected with people. It's about improving things, fixing things, making lives better,\" Mr Crosby told an audience at the Australian British Chamber of Commerce.\nHe pinned Labour's loss to the party's inability to come up with reform, instead focusing on individual crises.\n\"Edward Miliband was a first-year economics student type person who became an expert on everything, he was offering blame about all sorts of issues all the time. [Conservative David] Cameron copped abuse from his own party, [but] he delivered the economic reforms, Mr Crosby said.\n\"He talked about more jobs created in Britain than all of Europe put together, rising real wages, record number of small businesses, record number of apprenticeships, so that increased stability became incredibly important while others were trying to blame individual crises.\"\nRelated Core agendas Mr Textor said Mr Abbott's policy should focus on the core agenda he put forward as part of the election, rather than being sidelined by distractions such as politicians' pay.\n\"He should be set in the course he's set for himself: a low-tax environment, encouraging business, encouraging enterprise.\n\"If you're looking for a pollster to tell you what to do, you're in serious trouble.\"\nMr Textor declined to comment on when he last spoke to the Prime Minister, saying \"that's a private matter\".\nHow to sell GST To sell major reforms like increasing the GST to 15 per cent may involve marrying the GST increase with a direct tax cut in order to reward voters, he said.\n\"Voters are like investors these days.\"\n\"And when you look at what [New Zealand Prime Minister] John Key did, he essentially tied those two together. The benefits of tax reform weren't fluffy and five years in the future. So there was more of a direct risk/reward relationship and equilibrium than there has been in recent days,\" he said.\nNew Zealand increased GST from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent while cutting top personal tax rate to 33 per cent and the company tax rate to 28 per cent.\n'Addicted to polls' Mr Crosby added the public's addiction to polls harmed the election process in the UK.\n\"In the two years in the leadup to the general election I think there were over 600 polls published. And because there are a large number of newspapers in the UK, they really report on those things and they really become news story of themselves and it made it increasingly difficult to communicate with voters.\n\"They overwhelmed the campaign. They define the whole campaign and I think the process is undermined.\"\nThe opinion polls inaccurately predicted a close election but the Conservative Party won the election outright. He said he picked up the limits of these opinion polls as early as November 2014.\n\"The first time we picked that up was November of 2014, when in focus groups people said Ed is a very weak man, if SNP [the Scottish National Party] does really well and he relies on them to govern, they'll push him around.\"\nMr Textor agreed, saying he does not read polls in newspapers unless he is in a campaign and politicians should focus on the motivations of voters rather than poll numbers.\n\"We've had 25 years of growth, we're anxious about where to go next. Have you seen one poll that describes that paradigm? No.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:54:31.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
