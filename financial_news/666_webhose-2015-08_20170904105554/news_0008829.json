He added that the fire did not affect air quality in the region.\nCanada's oil and gas industry is facing mounting criticism from conservation groups about its environmental performance. Companies are also facing economic challenges because of slumping oil prices, which have prompted thousands of layoffs in recent months.\nEarlier this month, Syncrude released a presentation that estimated it was losing about $6 for every barrel of oil it produces.\nThe Alberta Energy Regulator is also investigating another incident in August at Syncrude's Mildred Lake oil sands mine site, where about 30 blue herons were found dead.
