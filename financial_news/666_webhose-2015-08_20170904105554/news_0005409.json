Present taxi services will be amalgamated in the new taxi scheme. Black and yellow taxi will be retained as it is and also All India Tourist Permit Taxi.\n“There is a shortage of taxis in the city and the scheme aims at giving last mile connectivity to the people,” Delhi Transport Minister Gopal Rai said while announcing the scheme.\nAccording to the new scheme, vehicles having capacity of 600cc onwards can register with the government. Until now, only those vehicles which had capacity of 750cc or more were issued permits.\nLicenses will be given to individuals, groups as well as the taxi aggregators. The Delhi government will also allow transfer of permits from Economy Taxi Scheme (2010) to New City Taxi Scheme.\nRai said the move will enable auto driver’s shift to low capacity vehicles like Reva and Nano.\nTaxi under this scheme will come in white colour with provisions of advertisements on both sides. LCD display will be installed on top of the vehicles in green and red colour for availability and occupied category.\n“Small size taxi between 600 CC to 749 CC will have minimum flag down rate of Rs 25 for first two kilometres, which is same in the auto rickshaws. After two kilometres, passengers will have to pay Rs. 10 per kilometre,” he said.\nAuto rickshaws at present charges Rs 8.50 per kilometre.\n 17, 2015 8:11 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:30:29.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
