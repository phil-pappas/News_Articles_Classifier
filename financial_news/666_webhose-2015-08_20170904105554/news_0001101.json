Jorge Branco Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan The Federal Court has halted the controversial sacking of 97 Hutchison Ports employees, granting an injunction sought by the Maritime Union of Australia.\nAfter the ruling, the MUA said on Thursday it would end its pickets of the company's Brisbane and Sydney terminals which started after the employees were sacked by email and text last week .\nThe injunction applies to the week beginning August 31 and the union will seek to have the workers returned to their jobs as soon as practicable.\nWarren Smith, the union's assistant national secretary, said on Thursday that the decision represented justice for the workers.\n\"It's a decision everyone out there on the picket line wanted to hear and it's a decision that every member of the Australian public who stands up for justice and stands up for a fair go wanted to hear as well,\" he said.\nMr Smith said the union hoped the company would start to engage \"in some real fair dinkum negotiations to get across the problems that do exist\".\nHe said Hutchison should recall the vessels that the operator has sub-contracted out to other stevedores since the sackings took place.\nThe union case drew on a memo sent by Hutchison to staff last month outlining the job cuts.\n The memo said the company did \"not have a concluded view on the individuals and/ or the timing\".\n\"We would not in these circumstances simply ask people to leave immediately. Before any position is made redundant, we will meet with the affected person. We will give this person an opportunity to respond.\"\nBut the company angered the labour movement by informing employees via late-night text messages and emails that they had been made redundant.\nThe union alleged Hutchison did not adequately consult the MUA and the workers before sacking employees.\nMUA lawyers also alleged Hutchison ignored a dispute resolution clause in the agreement.\nThe court orders were being finalised on Thursday night", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-13T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:36:15.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
