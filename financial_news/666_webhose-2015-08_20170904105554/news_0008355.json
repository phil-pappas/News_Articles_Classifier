Issues of identification of Mobile Money patrons-both physical and electronic identity will thus become a major challenge in combating money laundering if stakeholders do not marshal forces to adequately regulate this sector,' he said. \nHe added that efforts being made by stakeholders to ensure uniformity of customer identification procedures on the mobile money platform needs to be commended. \n'In particular, effectuating the provisions of the National Identity Register Law, 2008 (Act 750) with respect to mandatory use of the national identity card in conducting transactions and registration of SIM is very crucial. Accordingly, the National Identification Authority (NIA) needs to shore up its operations to achieve the desired mandate,' he noted. \nAlbert Antwi-Boasiako, Founder and Principal Consultant at e-Crime Bureau, also disclosed that it was important to create awareness of the risk that the Mobile Money platform poses in order to put the necessary mechanisms in place to avert any unforeseen events relating to security. \n'Security implications of mobile money have to do with identity of mobile money patrons. 'We have instances whereby criminal suspects have actually used fraudulent documents to register SIM cards and other things. We need to come to terms to know what is coming in the industry so that we stay one step ahead of the fraudster,' Mr Antwi-Boasiako said. \nHe said the electronic platforms required constant monitoring and auditing to ensure that they are fit for purpose. \n'Security is work in progress. We also need to be aware of the emerging dimensions, share best practices on how to prevent and detect some of these issues. The risk we are exposed to is technology like hacking threats, software configuration issues and insider related attacks, among others,' he disclosed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T19:21:24.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
