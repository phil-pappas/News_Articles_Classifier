Spending plan: Get a clear idea about how much money is available for college expenses. Create a workable monthly spending plan that balances income, loans, and gifts with anticipated expenses. \n2. Records: Use an app to track expenses or monitor expenses online. Tally the running balance daily and balance financial statements every month. Tracking expenses might reveal some surprises and provide opportunities to change direction. \n3. Credit cards: Commit to paying credit card bills in full and on time each month. Using credit wisely teaches you how to live within your means while creating a positive credit record that could help when buying a car, renting an apartment, obtaining insurance, and even landing a job. \n4. Organization: Keep all financial records, bills, and account statements in one location. This will help you pay bills on time, avoid late fees, and keep an unblemished credit score. \n5. Personal information: Learn about the different forms of identity theft, the kinds of personal information you need to protect, and how to protect informationeven, and especially, from friends and roommates. Learn the pitfalls of careless, unprotected use of social media. \nThere are many apps that make personal finance easy. Your credit union might have its own money-management app. Or, there are others that might help as well: YNAB (You Need a Budget) , Toshl Finance , Dollarbird , Left to Spend , Mint , Better Haves (for couples) , Spendee , and BillGuard .
