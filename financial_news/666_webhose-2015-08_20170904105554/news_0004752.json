Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Share-economy companies Uber and Airbnb are the latest multinationals to be dragged into a potentially embarrassing grilling by a parliamentary inquiry into corporate tax avoidance.\nThe Senate standing committee on economics will this week write to Uber and room-sharing service Airbnb inviting them to make a written submission to the inquiry into the use of offshore tax havens by multinational companies.\nThe next step will be to invite company representatives to appear at hearings as \"guests\" of the inquiry.\nLabor's Senator Sam Dastyari said Uber's company records suggested it did not pay income tax in Australia and it was important to set a precedent to stop a wave of similar share-economy companies making profits in Australia sending the money to offshore subsidiaries.\n\"If you don't get the settings right now for these companies, we have the potential to lose tens of millions of dollars in the future,\" he said .\n\"It defies belief that a company like Uber is engaged in some of the most aggressive tax minimisation practices, that it is an international company with a distribution area in the US and not an Australian taxi business.\"\nThe taxi and limousine industry is estimated to be worth $5.5 billion, generating $1 billion in profits, according to market researcher IBISWorld.\nStagnant revenue growth and heavy regulation have dogged the industry over the past five years but the introduction of new technology, like smartphones, is expected to drive compound annual growth of more than 2 per cent of the next five years.\n The IBISWorld report highlighted the fact Uber drivers were able to provide transport for a fee without the expense and red tape of obtaining a tax licence.\nLast month, the Australian Taxation Office insisted Uber drivers must begin collecting GST from August 1, despite Uber launching a legal challenge in the Federal Court.\nOther sharing-economy ­services – such as Airbnb, or letting car-parking or doing odd jobs for payment – will also be required to pay GST, but only if their annual income from the services exceeds the GST-free threshold of $75,000.\nIncome tax difficult to collect Senator Dastyari said the issue was not just GST, but income tax which has been difficult to collect because invoices to passengers are issued from a company outside Australia.\nIn July, the committee wrote to eight companies including Santos, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Caltex, BP, Woodside, Origin and Viva Energy, asking for information about the relationship between their Australian operations and operations in foreign jurisdictions, particularly Singapore.\nExecutives from technology giants including Apple and Microsoft, along with BHP and Rio Tinto and pharmaceutical empires Novartis and Pfizer, have already been grilled publicly in front of the parliamentary inquiry.\nThe inquiry is due to report on November 30.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-08-17T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:04:21.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
