The wraps were scheduled to come off during a Monday campaign stop in Exeter, N.H. \nCalled the New College Compact, it would take effect over ten years and cost an estimated $350 billion, with its benefits going chiefly to state institutions. Its goal would be to reduce the dependence on student loans--but not eliminate them or make college \"debt free\" across the board. Outstanding Federal loans are worth about $1 trillion. Federal and private student loans combined are edging toward $1.3 trillion. \nMoney to pay for the plan would come from a tax on upper-income earners, who would have new limits placed on itemized deductions on their tax returns. Clinton's plan would have to pass a Republican-controlled Congress. State governments would also have to buy in.
