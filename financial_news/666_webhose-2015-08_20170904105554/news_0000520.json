The product analyzes customer order flow, and based on a brokerâ€™s pre-set criteria, automatically regroups traders into different hedging groups. Available for MetaTrader 4 brokers, the solution can move traders who are in a B-Book group to A-Book or vice versa, depending on their trading habits. \nAccording to Takeprofit, the Detox tool conducts the analysis in real time, with automated group changes made as quickly as 10 seconds. For market maker brokers, Detox is aimed at providing them automation for which traders they want to act as the counterparty to and what order flow to send to external liquidity providers for hedging. \nThe release comes as Finance Magnates has seen an increase of risk management products being launched over the last two years. As brokers have been lowering spreads to distinguish themselves, it has caused greater for market makers to identify which traders to hedge and what order flow to warehouse internally, in order to maximize revenues. In addition, the January 15th Swiss franc move exposed risks related to simply operating a pure STP agency model, which has led some brokers to reevaluate market making for at least a portion of their order flow.
