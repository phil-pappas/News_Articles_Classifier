The bubble that is founded on increased usage of smartphones and the cloud will produce another bust.\nGranted, these new forms of identifying bargains, purchasing goods, topping up your phone and paying the electricity bill are convenient and some players will not only take advantage of the trend but also generate solid shareholder returns.\nUnfortunately, there isn't enough space for all of the new entrants to survive. Demand for cloud technology and apps will be sustained but many of the newcomers claiming to have the next best thing will fall by the wayside.\nHowever, it isn't all gloom and doom. There is substantial interest in tech stocks with real business models and visible earnings, as evidenced by corporate transactions such as the $170 million takeover of Oakton and consolidation by long-established players that have been waiting for the tide to turn.\nAs opposed to a few years ago, there is evidence of profit upgrades from companies with history and prospectus outperformance from new entrants.\nFrom an industry perspective, it has been a lack of business confidence that has stifled spending and when that pent-up demand finally materialises it will be the companies with big clients and robust revenues that deliver strong earnings growth.\nThere was some stimulus for small business in the most recent federal Budget where purchases up to $20,000 could be claimed as an immediate tax deduction. This continues until June 30, 2017.\n Aconex\nAconex has been quick to get into stride since listing in December with an IPO price of $1.90, which has since doubled.\nThe group released an impressive fourth-quarter update last week with management saying it had achieved record volumes of new business, negotiated enterprise agreements and generated positive cash flow of $4.7 million in the three months to June 30.\nThe company provides a leading cloud collaboration platform for the global construction industry. This technology provides owners and contractors in the construction, infrastructure, energy and resources sectors with project-wide visibility and control.\nManagement recently highlighted it has more than 60,000 user organisations and about $1 trillion of project value across 70 countries, making it the industry's most widely adopted and trusted platform.\nSince the end of June Aconex has negotiated agreements with leading global engineering and construction firms including Bechtel, Lend Lease and John Holland. At the same time the company has been busy on the corporate front acquiring Worksite, a provider of cost management IT solutions in the construction industry.\nAnalysts at Citi viewed the quarterly update favourably, noting cash receipts were $46.5 million, up 21 per cent on the first half of fiscal 2015. The broker reaffirmed its buy recommendation and 12-month price target of $4.42, adding that Aconex was its top pick across its current coverage universe.\nAltium\nAltium develops and sells software and hardware for the design and development of electronic products and it is one of the largest global providers of printed circuit board design software.\nBell Potter estimates the group is one of the top five players in that field and its position should only be strengthened with the release of new products.\nWhile the broker noted the group's fiscal 2015 trading update was mixed, the main underperformance was in the area of sales which were up 8 per cent to $US82 million compared with Bell Potter's forecast of $US83.7 million.\nThis wasn't a big miss and as management highlighted, revenue is a better indicator of the performance of the business as it takes into account the material impact of transactions irrespective of the size and term of the deal.\nThough Bell Potter downgraded earnings per share slightly and reduced the 12-month price target from $5.50 to $5.15 it maintained its buy recommendation. Deutsche Bank also has a buy recommendation on the group with a 12-month price target of $5.60.\nGiven the company's shares have fallen from a 15-year high of $5.31 in May they could present a buying opportunity.\nThough trading on a forward price-earnings multiple of about 20 relative to fiscal 2016 consensus forecasts, Altium has the growth profile to justify a premium multiple with earnings per share expected to increase by 20 per cent per annum over the next two years.\nAppen\nWithin four months of listing on the ASX Appen provided shareholders with some promising news, upgrading revenue and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) forecasts to mid ranges of $65.5 million and $7.8 million respectively. This represented increases of about 20 per cent compared with prospectus forecasts.\nThe award of an important contract by Microsoft at the start of July was a significant development, given it came after the profit upgrade.\nAppen provides speech and search technology services across more than 150 languages, partnering with leading technology and e-commerce enterprises in developing new offerings and in doing so assisting their expansion into new global markets.\nFollowing the revised profit guidance analysts at Bell Potter increased earnings per share estimates between 2015 and 2017 inclusive and upgraded their 12-month price target from 85¢ to 95¢.\nDespite volatile market conditions Appen's shares have continued to trade in the vicinity of 70¢ implying a substantial discount to Bell Potter's price target.\nData 3\nData 3 has been one of the major post-global financial crisis casualties in the IT sector as business confidence and corporate spending slowed. That said, the group demonstrated its resilience following the tech crash as there was only one year (2001) when its earnings slipped into negative territory.\nOver the past 12 years Data 3 has paid a dividend in every six-month period and consistently generated strong returns on equity, more often than not outstripping its peers. This is important given general manager Lawrence Baynham, who takes over the reins in December from long serving managing director John Grant, has had an active executive role in the company over that time.\nThere are already good signs emerging with Data 3 announcing in recent weeks that it was expecting a mid-range net profit of $10.5 million, a year-on-year profit growth of about 40 per cent, well ahead of the expectations of Morgans CIMB who were forecasting growth of 15 per cent.\nManagement referred to a particularly strong fourth-quarter and continuing strength in its performance, suggesting a promising result in fiscal 2015 could be the forerunner to better times ahead.\nWhile Data 3's shares rallied strongly following the profit guidance, they are trading broadly in line with Morgans' 12-month price target. Should management provide positive guidance for the upcoming period, this may provide further share price momentum.\nMelbourne IT\nThe transition from generating a substantial share of revenues from the sale of domain names to a vertically integrated business has been at the heart of Melbourne IT's turnaround.\nManagement views the group as the go-to company in terms of enabling customers to be successful in the web-focused and e-commerce environment through its design, engineering and operational expertise in the provision of online solutions.\nThe group has made several acquisitions which have enabled it to provide a broader service offering and target sectors with substantially improved margins compared with its traditional business.\nThese included the purchase of cloud services provider UberGlobal Group which is anticipated to generate EBITDA of about $2 million from revenues of $15 million in fiscal 2015. This acquisition provided the company with increased access to government clients, as well as 70,000 additional business customers.\nThe most important recent agreement involved the acquisition of 50.2 per cent of the shares held in privately owned Outware Systems for $21.7 million with put and call options in place which could see the company move to full ownership over the next two years.\nAnalysts at Bell Potter responded positively to the development, increasing earnings per share forecasts for 2016 and 2017 by 5 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. While acquisition costs will negatively affect the fiscal 2015 result it is likely investors will look to the group's potential growth prospects in coming years.\nBell Potter has a buy recommendation on the stock with a 12-month price target of $1.95, broadly in line with the group's recent trading range. As indicated, Melbourne IT is more of a 2016 story and the broker's price target implies a conservative price-earnings multiple of 13.8 relative to its forecasts for that period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:12:42.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
