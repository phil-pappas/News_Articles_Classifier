We have grown from a small size and we know the hurdles that developers can face while developing products,” Facebook Director Product Platform Partnerships Ime Archibong told PTI.\nThrough this initiative, Facebook wants to help take care of certain aspects, so that the developers can focus on building world-class products, he said.\nArchibong added that India is an important market since the country has the second highest number of developers after the US under the FBStart initiative.\n“More developers are building apps with Facebook in India than any other country outside the US and today, more than 75 per cent of top-grossing apps in India are integrated with Facebook,” he said.\nOut of USD 50 million in benefits distributed to Asia Pacific startups through FbStart, more than USD 20 million went to startups in India, Archibong added.\nDelhi-based app Cardback and Hyderabad’s Samosa that offers a curated collection of clips from popular movies were among the beneficiaries.\nIn Asia, Facebook has more than 1,000 members as part of the FbStart programme.\nFacebook has started its FbStart World Tour, an event series across 20 cities to meet mobile developers across the world.\nIt has held events in London, New York, Mexico City, Hong Kong, Seoul and Taipei. In India, it is hosting these events in Bangalore and Gurgaon.\n“With millions of people still not yet connected to the Internet in India and around the world, there is a huge opportunity for mobile developers to build some of the first experiences people have with the Internet,” he said.\nArchibong said that through programmes like FbStart and Internet.org that opened its platform to developers, Facebook aims to help build better mobile experiences that demonstrates the power of Internet.\n 11, 2015 3:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:27:11.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
