In addition to working closely with their department supervisors, MidAtlantic’s interns are given the opportunity to visit customers’ farms, which allows them to learn more about the agriculture industry and the continuing need for credit in producing food for a growing population.\nAll three of the students are sales interns and will work with the loan staff to learn how to support new and existing customers, while being trained on the various products and services the association offers. The interns will also be exposed to the association’s loan servicing procedures, while becoming familiar with customer service and competition review practices. During their internship, they will also have the chance to travel to Washington, DC to meet with Department of Agriculture staff and the Farm Credit Council (FCC).\nBrianna Fedorkowicz, of Selbyville, Delaware, graduated from Delaware State University in May 2015 with a degree in agriculture. During her time in school, she was a member of the women’s equestrian team.
