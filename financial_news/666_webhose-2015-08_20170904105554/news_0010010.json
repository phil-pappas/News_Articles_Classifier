I think we are probably keeping in touch, just. We are up against the hottest brand in the world right now in Netflix.\" Netflix doesn't reveal its Australian customer numbers, but Roy Morgan Research estimates that in July, 737,000 households had used the US service since it entered the local market in March, though many early customers were on free trials. Seven and Foxtel have not published customer numbers for their Presto streaming joint venture. Mr Gyngell said Stan will stand out from its rivals by offering a lot more Australian content, with the first locally made program for Stan to be made available by early November, and more coming in 2016. But whether it makes money is another matter. \"(We're) seeing if we can carve out a profitable alternative and a local alternative to what Netflix will be, and that's yet to be seen,\" Mr Gyngell said. \"Netflix is yet to be seen if it's going to make money. \"We don't see Stan being the saviour of this company long term, we see it as an adjunct to content acquisition and original content deals.\" ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Stan+is+holding+its+own%2C+says+Nine&c=NINE%27S+boss+David+Gyngell+admits+the+Stan+streaming+service+is+up+against+the+biggest+brand+in+the+world+right+now.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/stan-is-holding-its-own-says-nine/story-e6frfkur-1227501055269?sv=74c857c62467b32f4af12f84da2e00c2", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/stan-is-holding-its-own-says-nine/story-e6frfkur-1227501055269?sv=74c857c62467b32f4af12f84da2e00c2", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/stan-is-holding-its-own-says-nine/story-e6frfkur-1227501055269?sv=74c857c62467b32f4af12f84da2e00c2", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/stan-is-holding-its-own-says-nine/story-e6frfkur-1227501055269?sv=74c857c62467b32f4af12f84da2e00c2&title=Stan+is+holding+its+own%2C+says+Nine", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/stan-is-holding-its-own-says-nine/story-e6frfkur-1227501055269?sv=74c857c62467b32f4af12f84da2e00c2&h=Stan+is+holding+its+own%2C+says+Nine", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/stan-is-holding-its-own-says-nine/story-e6frfkur-1227501055269?sv=74c857c62467b32f4af12f84da2e00c2&title=Stan+is+holding+its+own%2C+says+Nine"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:43:37.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
