Singapore tightens growth forecast after Q2 contraction AFP â€“ 27 minutes ago View Photo \n\nSingapore on Tuesday narrowed its full-year economic growth forecast after the trade-reliant economy contracted in the second quarter owing to weakened global demand. \nThe full-year growth forecast was trimmed to 2.0-2.5 percent this year from 2.0-4.0 percent previously after a 4.0 percent quarter-on-quarter contraction in April to June, the trade ministry said in a statement based on final data for the quarter. \nThe second quarter contraction reversed growth of 4.1 percent in the previous three months, the ministry said. \n\"Several key downside risks in the external economic environment remain,\" it said in the statement. \n\"The global economy performed weaker than expected in the first half of 2015. For the rest of the year, global growth is expected to pick up gradually, although the pace of growth is likely to be uneven across economies.\" \nIt added that \"growth in some labour-intensive sectors such as food services may be weighed down by labour constraints.\" \nThe construction industry grew 2.9 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, compared with 4.2 percent growth in January-March. \nThe accommodation and food services sector meanwhile shrank 1.4 percent from the previous quarter, following a 6.5 percent dip in the first three months of the year. \nSectors such as construction and hospitality are under pressure owing to tighter government rules for foreign labour aimed at placating public anger over a surge in immigration, analysts have said. \nThe large presence of overseas workers has become a hot-button political issue in the island nation, with widespread expectations a general election will be called in September. \nSome citizens complain that foreigners are competing with locals for jobs, causing overcrowding and straining public transport and other services (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T09:36:03.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
