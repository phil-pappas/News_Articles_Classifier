The scrutiny follows international probes into the rigging of financial benchmarks for rates and currencies, which have yielded billions of dollars in fines.\nThe trio was among financial companies that agreed in an EU settlement to pay a total of 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in December 2013 for colluding over derivatives linked to the London and euro interbank offered rates. HSBC remains under investigation in the Euribor case after refusing to join the accord.\nIn the U.S., UBS Group AG said in May that it won immunity from criminal fraud charges in a Justice Department investigation into misconduct in the trading of precious metals.\nBarclays said in a July filing it has been “providing information to the DOJ and other authorities in connection with investigations into precious metals and precious metals-based financial instruments.”\nBarclays spokeswoman Joanne Walia declined to comment on whether the authorities included the EU. Representatives for the other banks didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T14:18:36.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
