James Davies JGD by Matthew Smith The equity markets have changed. It used to be that investors wishing to put a toe into the sharemarket would buy shares directly or place their money with a funds manager, who would select stocks on their behalf.\nHowever, within the past five years the rise of passive investing using exchange-traded funds has changed the ebb and flow of money in the sharemarket.\nIt has been a good time to invest this way. The extra liquidity that has been sloshing around the global equity markets, thanks to policies of central banks around the world to hold interest rates at record lows, has done wonders for asset prices.\nInvesting in market indices has been the smartest trade in town. In Australian dollars, an investment in the S&P500 index in the United States has returned more than 50 per cent over the past two years, not including dividends.\nBecause we find ourselves in a low-growth world, costs have become more important to total investment returns than ever. Paying a funds manager up to 1 per cent can make a material difference when compared with about 30 basis points paid to an ETF provider, or less than 10 basis points in some cases.\nSince the global financial crisis active funds have been losing money, initially as investors leaped into the safety of cash but more recently as investors have bought index-tracking ETFs.\nDespite 14 consecutive quarters in Australia of growth in total assets flowing into the funds management industry, actively managed funds continue to record outflows.\nMeanwhile, ETFs have steadily attracted more capital (see chart).\n More pronounced The rise in passive investing in the United States is far more pronounced than in Australia.\nEquity ETF assets have reached $US1.2 trillion ($1.63 trillion), equivalent to one-quarter the size of all US equity mutual funds. In the US there is one ETF for every 3.5 stocks, a Goldman Sachs report from April called The Rise of the Machines shows.\nInvestment firms that have specialised in index funds have become the largest in the world, with Vanguard swallowing most of the inflow, closely followed by BlackRock and State Street.\nIn Australia the picture is much the same: in the March quarter index funds attracted more than $2.3 billion, compared with outflows of almost $3.9 billion for actively managed funds, Morningstar says.\nWhether stock picking and active management is the best way to invest or whether passive strategies will continue to work is a heavily debated point. Most financial advisers these days will suggest there's a case for a combination of both.\nThe \"core and satellite\" approach, in which ETFs are used to \"buy the market\" and active management is used sparingly where outperformance is deemed possible, has put advisers back in the driver's seat with clients.\nActive managers will argue we are on the verge of market ructions after years of historically low volatility, thanks to the stimulatory effects of low interest rates.\nRise of passive Investors continuing to follow the trend towards index-oriented investing should consider how the rise of passive has changed the nature of the equity markets and consider what they are buying into.\n\"By investing in passive, you're assuming risk is adequately priced by the market and you are also taking a larger weighting to the largest companies,\" AustralianSuper co-head macro and portfolio construction Alistair Barker says.\n\"The assumption is that companies that have been the most successful in the past will continue to be the most successful in the future, but that's not necessarily the case.\"\nMost superannuation funds have not grown their allocation away from active management to passive – that's been more of a retail investor phenomenon.\nThe reason super funds have not dumped active management is because, at the institutional level, investing in active is relatively cheap.\nAustralianSuper pays about 31 basis points for active management for Australian and international equities. The average cost of its balanced option in 2014 was 57 basis points, which includes the cost of some more expensive private equity and infrastructure funds.\nBarker suggests the market's preference for passive over active will probably ebb and flow. \"We're in an environment where returns are lower – cash and interest rates are lower – the impact of costs is higher and the focus on costs from a lot of people will be greater,\" he says.\nHistorically high point Now that the proportion of the market owned by passive funds is at a historically high point, Perpetual Investments co-head of Australian equities Nathan Parkin suggests some active management might gain favour. He says active managers are increasingly trading against institutional buyers of ETF providers populating funds to replicate the index.\n\"A large part of the market is now traded without regard for value … we trade against it when we see an index buyer on the other side. The fact active [management] is out of favour is a good thing for us,\" he says.\nParkin suggests there could be an untested liquidity risk for holders of ETFs because units tend to be traded back and forth with other ETF investors, creating what he describes as \"perceived liquidity\".\nHe wonders what might happen when the markets for the underlying assets are deserted.\nWithin the broader-based ETFs that invest in the largest companies in the index, the liquidity of the fund is the same as for the underlying asset, Vanguard Australia market strategy principal Robin Bowerman says.\nBut he concedes that liquidity in some of the more \"esoteric\" ETFs that invest in small segments of the market could be an issue.\n\"We are strong believers in broad-based ETFs, but it's up to investors in specialist ETFs to understand what the ETF owns … If it's something else [outside the broad-based market index ETFs] I'd say people take some time do their homework and understand because that will ultimately determine whether liquidity will be there in times of stress,\" he says.\nAs for active managers taking advantage of the rise of passive and trading against index buyers, Bowerman says: \"Show me the evidence of those returns.\"\nAfter fees, active managers offering funds at the retail level have on average struggled to outperform the benchmark returns.\nBut it's clear where the investment industry is focusing its efforts now: almost 70 per cent of the amount invested in ETFs is owned through SMSFs, Bowerman says.\nExchange-traded products In May, ANZ collaborated with ETF Securities to announce the launch of six new exchange-traded products (ETPs), becoming the first Australian bank to offer ETFs. UBS launched five ethical ETFs, which by early March had gathered more than $92 million, Morningstar says.\nThere were 117 ETPs at the end of March, up from 102 at the end of 2014.\nThe rise of ETFs has brought about a democratisation of investing that has enabled individuals to invest in a way that would have been available only to institutions less than a decade ago.\nFor many investors it is uncharted territory.\n\"If you're buying the index, you're buying a collection of companies for no fundamental reason other than their size and the amount of shares traded,\" Perpetual's Parkin says.\n\"I don't know of anything else in life that's purchased in this way. Most things in life you spend time trying to understand.\"\nBut advocates of passive investing will suggest that ETF strategies enable investors to pull their punches so they can pay for active strategies where outperformance is possible.\n\"In the short term it's all noise. In the long term a diversified passive strategy will capture economic growth,\" Bowerman says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:12:30.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
