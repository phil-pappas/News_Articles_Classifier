The possible move by Transfield illustrates how seriously the company is taking a push by activists to pressure industry super funds to embarrass the company by publicly announcing that they are selling its shares.\nIndustry super fund HESTA this month said it sold a 3.5 per cent stake, worth some $23 million, citing evidence of human rights violations inside the detention centres.\nThe $32 billion super fund said the risks associated with Transfield were too high, claiming the social governance issues associated with its detention centre contracts could hurt the company's business and share price and lead to legal action. Other super funds, including NGS Super , have been selling their shares too.\nTransfield's largest shareholder, funds management firm Allan Gray, welcomed the prospect of seeing the detention centres.\n\"We would definitely take the opportunity to visit the centres on Manus Island and Nauru,\" Allan Gray managing director Simon Mawhinney said.\nMr Mawhinney said the visits alone would not ensure confidence in transparency. \"Site visits seldom give a true perspective,\" he said. \"You can rest assured that everyone will be on their best behaviour when a known-in-advance site visit takes place.\nAllan Gray controls an almost 19 per cent stake in Transfield, worth about $99.7 million.\nThe Australian Council of Superannuation Investors has been pressing Transfield's board and management for more information on the treatment of asylum seekers for more than a year.\nACSI chief executive Louise Davidson said site visits do help improve transparency.\n\"Disclosure and transparency are crucial in helping investors to determine the level of risk within a company. The more investors know about what is happening within a company, the less assumptions they need to make and the greater their ability to assess the risks and opportunities facing a company,\" she said.\nTransfield was confident it had the right governance processes in place and was \"doing things the right way\" at the detention centres, but wanted to better communicate with investors and the public, Mr Hunt said.\n\"We don't want people reaching the wrong conclusions on the basis of either not engaging with us or not understanding what are the facts as opposed to what speculation and allegations might be,\" he said.\nTransfield acknowledged in its submission to a Senate inquiry into alleged human rights violations that there have been \"a number of allegations and complaints of sexual and physical assault\" made by detainees at the Nauru centre, including against staff members, but says it has acted \"swiftly and appropriately\" on complaints and allegations of assault.\n\"Where adverse findings have been made against staff we have taken appropriate disciplinary action, including termination where appropriate,\" it said in a submission. The inquiry is due to report its findings on Monday.\nMr Hunt said that while there were questions over whether the Australian government's detention centres complied with international laws, he did not believe the company had broken any Australian laws.\n\"Our very clear advice and position is that we are acting within the framework of the Australian law and therefore there is no exposure,\" Mr Hunt said.\nRachel Ball, director of advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the company had obligations under the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to respect international human rights standards.\n\"The company cannot evade responsibility simply because the violations are sanctioned by the Australian Government,\" Ms Ball said.\nPhil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said Transfield had become hostage to \"rights abusing\" policies by the Australian government policies and should have done more due diligence before accepting the detention centre contracts.\nMr Hunt acknowledged the potential for class actions to be lodged by \"aggrieved\" investors against the company but said he did not believe the company had any \"material\" exposure to lawsuits.\nClass action lawfirm Maurice Blackburn said it had received inquiries from detainees who had been injured while in offshore detention on Manus Island and was assessing personal injury claims.\nTransfield's annual net profits fell 8 per cent to $48.6 million after the company took $36 million in provisions to settle legacy contracts and commercial disputes.\nTransfield did not pay a final dividend and did not specify when it would start repaying dividends.\nTransfield's shares rose 3.5¢, or 3.5 per cent, to $1.04.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/ngs-super-dumps-transfield-services-on-moral-grounds-20150825-gj72tm", "http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Regional_processing_Nauru/Regional_processing_Nauru/Submissions"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:30:26.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
