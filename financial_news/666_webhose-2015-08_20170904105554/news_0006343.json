Born in Hawaii on Aug. 4, 1961, Obama’s life story contains a journey of remarkable financial success. Raised by a single mother and grandfather in the absence of his Kenyan father, Obama had to work his way through college. But, he will celebrate his upcoming 54 th birthday as a multimillionaire. Barack Obama Net Worth: $2 Million — $7 Million \nIt is difficult to assert the exact personal wealth of this — or any — U.S. president. It can be said with certainty that Barack Obama’s salary for his day job as president is $400,000 a year. But from there, hard numbers are more difficult to come by. Under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, the president — along with other high-ranking federal officials — must disclose their finances every year. Those disclosures, however, might be broad and vague. \nThe president’s recent annual disclosure shows that Barack Obama’s net worth is somewhere between $2 million and $7 million, reports USA Today. CelebrityNetWorth , however, reports that Obama’s net worth is as high as $12.2 million. \nObama reportedly disclosed between $1.9 million and $6.9 million in assets, mostly mutual funds, savings bonds and other conservative investments. Much of the president’s net worth is tucked away in tax-sheltered retirement accounts. He also has between $200,000 and $400,000 deposited in college savings accounts for his two daughters, Malia and Sasha. \nThe president receives royalties of $15,001 to $50,000 on his two books, “Dreams From My Father, The Audacity of Hope” and “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughter,” reports NPR. \nRelated: Why Obama Has Less Than $1,001 in Savings Barack Obama’s Timeline of Wealth \nIn 2007, the president was worth approximately $1.3 million, reports the Independent Journal Review. So with a net worth potentially topping $7 million, that means Obama’s net worth grew 438 percent since when he first ran for president. \nBut how exactly did Obama grow his fortune? The Barack Obama timeline of wealth accumulation looks something like this, according to Business Insider : 2004: Obama pulls in two salaries: $80,287 from the Illinois State Senate and $32,144 from the University of Chicago Law School where he taught as a lecturer. The president also has assets in three different financial funds worth something between $50,000 and $400,000 each. And, Obama gives the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, which propels him into political stardom — and lucrative book deals. 2005: Obama gets a $1.9 million advance — plus favorable royalty percentages on future sales — to write “The Audacity of Hope.” Random House also republishes “Dreams of my Father,” a book he penned in 1995. As for his investments, Obama puts his money in several financial assets worth at least $100,000 and has as much as $500,000 in a checking account. And finally, he receives another advance from Random House, this time for $847,167 and royalties for “Dreams” in the amount of $378,237. 2006-2007: Obama invests his book profits in a massive purchase between $500,000 and $1 million of Treasury Notes. Preparing for a presidency run, Barack Obama is now a household name. 2007: Obama buys into two age-based education funds for his daughters, each worth up to $100,000. 2008: When Obama is sworn in as president, he owns somewhere between $1.1 million and $5.1 million in U.S. Treasury Bills. 2009: Obama wins the Nobel Peace Prize, which comes with a $1.4 million award. He donates it to an assortment of charities instead. 2009-2015: Obama earns $400,000 a year as president and continues to earn book royalties, as well as interest on his investments. \nDuring his post-presidency, Obama is expected to write a third book and can expect more royalties to come in from that. Recently, Obama was able to raise more than $500 million for the Presidential Library in Chicago as part of the Barack Obama Foundation. \nRelated: From JFK to Abraham Lincoln: The 10 Richest and Poorest U.S. Presidents Barack Obama Net Worth Vs. George W. Bush Net Worth \nBarack Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush , has an estimated net worth of $35 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth. After graduating from Yale University and Harvard Business School, Bush created and sold an oil company. He also became an investor of the Texas Rangers baseball team but sold his ownership stake for $15 million in 1998. Two years later, Bush was elected president. \nBush earned a lot of money after his presidency, though. Since leaving office in 2009, he has given more than 200 speeches and was paid between $100,000 and $175,000 each, states a recent Politico article.
