If you're still searching for a strategy or the markets meltdown makes you a wary of your current plan, here are three ways to bulletproof your retirement savings: 1. Dollar Cost Averaging Dollar cost averaging is a classic technique . It simply involves contributing a fixed amount of money into a retirement account. When stocks rise, so does your wealth. But when stocks drop, your money is able to scoop up more shares for less. \"You get different bites at the market at different prices,\" said Tom Mingone of New York-based Capital Management Group. You may not have a lump sum of money to throw into the markets, but you may have a few hundred dollars each month to invest. \"Plus, most people suffer from inertia, and with dollar cost averaging, your investments are on autopilot and before you know it, the money you're investing becomes another bill that you're used to paying,\" Mingone added. If you have a 401(k) account, chances are you're already employing dollar cost averaging. \"Most have a 401(k) plan through an employer that invests on a consistent basis,\" said Grant Engelbart, portfolio manager at CLS Investments based in Omaha, Neb. But Engelbart said fixed monthly amounts of money can also be contributed each month to a Roth or Traditional IRA , which you may also have in addition to a 401(k). \"Sticking with that investment plan will ensure that you are both taking advantage of market selloffs and participating in strong, trending markets,\" he added. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T02:46:38.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
