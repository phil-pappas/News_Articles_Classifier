It did not disclose when the buyback would happen. \nResponding to questions from Reuters, a spokesman for the bank said in an emailed statement: \"We received the regulatory approval. However, no decisions have been made as yet and we are considering many options. We will go with the optimal approach that satisfies both the bank's capital needs, the shareholders and investors alike.\" \nThe bank did not state in either statement how it would pay for its action on the bonds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:09:21.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
