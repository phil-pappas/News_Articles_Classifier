Taking money from one project to another has to be done properly,”the President warned. \nHe was reacting to the specific instance of the diversion of a substantial part of the loan of more than US$1 billion from the Chinese Exim Bank, obtained for the construction of a standard gauge rail line linking Lagos to Kano. \nBashar had informed the President that only $400 million of that loan remained with the Ministry of Finance. \nThe President regretted that government had over the years failed to meet its counter-part funding obligation on some projects, leading to such projects being left uncompleted or abandoned. \nHe added that there was a clear need to streamline, harmonize and prioritize on-going projects in the transportation sector. \nMeanwhile, the Transport Permanent Secretary also briefed the President on other challenges facing the transport and maritime sectors. \nThese include encroachment on railway land, lack of security on inland waterways and the confused nature of agreements between the Nigeria Ports Authority and ports concessionaires. \n-  //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7376   11 2015.
