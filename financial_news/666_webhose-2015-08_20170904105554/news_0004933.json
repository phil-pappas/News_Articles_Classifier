Former federal Labor leader Mark Latham has resigned as a regular columnist for The Australian Financial Review amid controversy over his views on feminism and other social issues.\nMr Latham, who has been a columnist on the Financial Review for the past eight years, and more recently AFR Weekend , told the Financial Review 's editor in chief Michael Stutchbury on Sunday that he had written his last column for the masthead.\nMr Stutchbury said reports and social media speculation that he had been dismissed by the Financial Review were incorrect.\n\"Mark has been a provocative and highly readable columnist for the Financial Review ,\" Mr Stutchbury said. \"He has been both loved and hated by readers â€“ sometimes by the same ones at different times. While I didn't agree with everything Mark wrote, he has played a significant role in Australian public life and brought rare personal insight into his writing.\"\nMr Latham resigned as leader of the federal Labor opposition in early 2005 after losing heavily to Coalition prime minister John Howard in the October 2004 election.\nIn his early columns for the Financial Review , Mr Latham drew on his intimate knowledge of current Australian politics and the Labor Party in particular.\nIn recent years, he strongly defended former prime minister Julia Gillard over allegations concerning her relationship with the Australian Workers Union in the 1980s that ended up being probed by the Abbott government's Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. He dismissed the allegations as right-wing fantasy.\nHe also has controversially covered social issues, often from a self-styled western Sydney perspective, including a sharp critique of feminism, the medicalisation of mental illness and domestic violence. He even criticised the past two Australians of the Year Rosie Batty and Adam Goodes.\n Former columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald 's Good Weekend magazine Lisa Pryor has taken legal action against an article Mr Latham wrote on her in the Financial Review last year.\nSome feminist websites and activists have campaigned against Mr Latham's columns, including by complaining to Westpac, which presents the successful Women of Influence awards with the Financial Review .\nMr Stutchbury said he appreciated the nature of the complaints about Mr Latham's columns and accepted there was always a line that responsible publications must not cross.\nBut he defended the Financial Review 's right and even duty to publish provocative opinions that some readers and non-readers might find offensive, as this was a hallmark of a vibrant democracy. The various controversies surrounding Mr Latham raised important issues about the robustness of public speech in a social media world, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:05:05.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
