Even drawing a Senate filibuster wouldn’t stop a truly determined majority without the threat of a veto, so a successful Presidential bid is key to achieving the party’s long standing goal of repeal-and-replace . Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are the first to float concrete Obamacare alternatives in their campaigns. \nOn Tuesday, Walker brought his own candidacy one step closer, releasing a seven-page health care proposal that would strip away most of Obamacare’s regulations and replace them with a system based on tax credits and incentive plans. \nPolitically this is a huge step for the conservative movement. Despite the Republicans' fractious primary season , it’s no stretch to imagine a candidate like former Florida Governor Jeb Bush or Walker winning next year’s election and putting his name on a brand new piece of health care legislation. \nSince starting to wage war on Obamacare, Republicans have presented relatively few ideas for what would come after, holding 50 votes to repeal the law while proposing little aside from the occasional detail-light white paper. Walker’s plan is a serious one that for the first time has a legitimate shot of someday becoming law. The party may have to stand by these words in a way it never would have during an Obama presidency, and it shows.
