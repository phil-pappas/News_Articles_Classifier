Photo: Reuters\n A sizeable gap is emerging between Andrew Forrest's price expectations for stakes in Fortescue Metals Group mining assets, and what its Chinese suitors are willing to pay.\nSources said China's Hebei Iron & Steel and the State-owned Tewoo Group have been in talks with Fortescue but a formal bid is yet to be tabled.\nFortescue management, including chief executive Nev Power, and advisers have been in China in recent weeks, ahead of the iron ore miner's full-year results next Monday.\nFortescue's profit is expected to plunge to about $US390 million ($527 million) for the year, from $US2.65 billion in 2014.\nAdvertisement Reports emerged this week that substantial Fortescue shareholder, OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel, is planning to sell its 5 per cent stake in the miner but will wait on a recovery in the iron ore market.\nFortescue's market capitalisation has retreated to $US5.75 billion, with its share price near six-year lows.\nGiven that a deal at the involving Fortescue's ordinary shares is unpalatable at current prices, Fortescue is trying to unlock value by focusing on its assets, and arguing that their true value is not being reflected by the current share price.\nBut the gap in price expectations on an selldown of some, or all, of its Pilbara mines, is likely based on differing opinions of where the iron ore price is headed.\nFortescue declined to comment.\nEleventh hour refinancing deal By striking an eleventh hour, expensive refinancing deal of its $US7.3 billion debt pile three months ago, Fortescue has bought itself time. It means the miner is not desperate to do a deal, but neither are its two Chinese suitors, so talks could be drawn out. Fortescue doesn't have a major debt repayment due until 2019.\nBut if Fortescue doesn't take a partner on soon, it runs the risk of being forced to do a deal for less, later.\nSome industry players have been questioning the imperative for China to buy into Fortescue now, why not wait a year or so, betting that Fortescue will come under greater pressure.\nBut there is a view held by some in China that Fortescue's business contains decent assets that don't come up for sale often, so better to pay a bit more this time around to get your foot on them.\nHebei and Tewoo are understood to be pushing for a stake in Fortescue's port and rail assets, held in a vehicle called TPI, to sweeten a mines equity selldown.\nBut advisers say TPI is only as good as the people who use it, and that is Fortescue at this stage. So if a buyer takes a mine stake, without a holding in TPI, they could be exposed to risk.\nUBS has a $US12 billion valuation on FMG's operations, excluding net debt and administration overheads. Selling a stake of at least 20 per cent in Fortescue's mines would help shore up Fortescue's the balance sheet. The trade-off for Fortescue shareholders selling part of the business and losing part of its cashflow, would be confidence in the balance sheet.\nRio and BHP have many equity joint ventures at the asset level – BHP and Rio partnered with the Japanese long ago, and later the Chinese. There is doubt Japan is seriously interested in buying into FMG at an asset level – it appears to be left to China.\nFortescue released a statement to the ASX earlier this month saying that, \"while there is no imperative, Fortescue is open to commercial discussions with a range of groups on a regular basis at the mining asset level\", in response to reports that Hebei and Tewoo had approached the miner about buying equity in mining operations. That was read by many as meaning a sales process was underway.\nUBS analyst Glyn Lawcock has suggested Fortescue could look at selling a stake of up to 30 per cent in its Kings mine, a standalone operation that produces 40 million tonnes a year. Fortescue could then buy the product back from their JV partner at the mine gate, and give them the right to buy the ore as it comes out the back end of the port. A stake in its other Pilbara mines, Cloudbreak, Christmas Creek and Firetail – whose product is blended to form the Fortescue mix – could be bundled into a separate deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T09:43:23.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
