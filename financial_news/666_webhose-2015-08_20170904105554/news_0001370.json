Europe made a substantial contribution to this development, posting currency-adjusted sales growth of 7%. \nSales in the UK rose at a double-digit rate, with the pace of growth also increasing in most \nother European countries. The US market showed, however, showed only moderate growth, edging up 1%. Bolstered by double-digit rises in Australia and Japan, sales in Asia exceeded the prior year's level by 5% after adjustment for currency effects. \nThe company said it grew much faster in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year, with all regions reporting more favourable dynamics. As a result, management reconfirmed its sales and profit targets for the full year of currency-adjusted sales growth in the mid-single-digit rate, and EBITDA to increase by between 5% and 7% in reported terms. \n\"Thanks to the very healthy development of the group's own retail business, growth accelerated in the second quarter,\" said CEO Claus-Dietrich Lahrs. \"The excellent trend in our online business contributed to this. Because of our strength in the European market, we expect the favourable trend to continue in the second half, even though conditions in the USA and China remain difficult. Our investments in the brands, distribution and organisational efficiency will pay off this year and beyond.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T16:39:12.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
