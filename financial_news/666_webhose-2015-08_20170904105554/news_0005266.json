Photo: Supplied\nYawning through meetings? Getting out of bed dog-tired? Finding it harder to make decisions? If caffeine is the only thing getting you through the working day, you could be setting yourself up for a fall.\nJacqui Jones is the founder of Way We Do. With a business that straddles the United States, Britain and Australia, she's had to take steps to protect her sleep time.\nFor starters, no online meetings between midnight and 6am. \"If I do have a late-night call I organise my time so I don't have early morning meetings the next day, and sleep in a little longer,\" she says.\n\"I find that if I do an 11pm meeting with the east coast of the US and then go to bed directly after the call, my mind is active and it takes a while falling asleep.\"\nAdvertisement Jones says in the past a lack of sleep has had her nod off at parties and concerts. When she burns the candle at both ends it can also affect her business and her productivity. \"I am really unproductive with clouded thoughts and incoherent speech,\" she says, adding that it can take a day or two to get back to normal\nIn a working culture where we have to be switched on 24/7, presenteeism is becoming a serious issue.\nStuart Taylor, founder of The Resilience Institute Australia, says many studies reveal the significant cost of presenteeism â€“ reduced productivity resulting from employees being at work when they are physically or mentally unwell.\n\"A recent study based on Australian workers shows the association between poor sleep quality and quantity with higher presenteeism,\" he says.\nThe Resilience Institute recently released the findings of a three-year study measuring the resilience of 16,000 people in 250 organisations. It found that 43.3 per cent of respondents ranked high on questions relating to tiredness and fatigue.\nTaylor attributes his own experience with ill-health to years of working long hours on reduced sleep in demanding corporate roles. Fourteen years ago he was diagnosed with brain cancer and given less than three years to live.\n\"Sleep and rest are vital to our health and wellbeing,\" he says. A lack of sleep can show up in a variety of ways. Co-ordination, attention, decision-making and impulse control all suffer, while cardiovascular risk, blood pressure, metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes, and immune system dysfunction increase.\nTaylor says artificial light, heating, electronics and sleep debt are among the factors disrupting our body clocks. As he explains, our circadian rhythm is a 24.5-hour cycle built into our suprachiasmatic nucleus. Sitting just behind the eyes, this clock is regulated by light, particularly requiring the blue light in the early hours of the day to effectively reset.\nWhen we wake our body temperature rises, cortisol is released, blood pressure rises, testosterone peaks and we are alert, co-ordinated and effective. During the day we build up adenosine, which in high levels increases our propensity for sleep. The longer we are alert, the deeper our delta-wave sleep. After 7pm our body temperature drops, at 9pm melatonin secretion begins and we drop into a deep sleep somewhere between 10pm and 2am. Growth hormone is active during this stage, facilitating repair, growth and immunity.\nA good night's sleep rejuvenates our cells, builds muscle and repairs the brain, while REM sleep is essential to memory and emotional intelligence, according to Taylor.\nWhen Bench PR managing director Jocelyn Hunter found herself working long hours on a communication project, she noticed lower-quality sleep taking its toll. \"I certainly found that decisions I would usually make quickly took longer in those two weeks, and I relied more heavily on my team to ensure the project didn't impact on our work for other clients.\"\nAlthough tempted to jettison her exercise routine, she didn't. \"I found going out for a run cleared my head and helped me focus more clearly when I got back,\" she says, adding it also helped her sleep.\nDiet, exercise and routine are among Taylor's tips for getting a great night's sleep:\nCommit to a regular wake-up time. Rise at dawn if possible. Get vigorous exercise early in the day Power-nap for 15 minutes after lunch Avoid caffeine after 2pm Have an early and light evening meal Limit alcohol and protein intake Ditch TV, laptops and gadgets after 7pm (or two hours before bedtime) Cool, darken, quieten your bedroom Make your bedroom an electronic-free zone Develop a relaxation routine before sleep Discharge sleep debt by going to bed early, rather than sleeping in Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep each night", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T03:01:35.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
