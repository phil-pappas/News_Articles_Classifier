Then it’s clear the pub was everything.\nIn Buchan, a tiny Victorian hamlet around an hour northeast of Bairnsdale in Snowy River country, that’s certainly the case.\nWhen the Buchan Caves Hotel was destroyed by fire last year, the 100-odd residents off the windy Gelantipy Rd lost more than just a place to tell tall tales and drink tall beers.\nThey lost the centre of town, they lost a meeting place, they lost the difference between tourists stopping in or passing straight through.\nLocals started brewing their own beers and stopped talking to one another.\nBuchan resident Jim Norling brews his own beer after the Buchan Caves Hotel burnt down.

It was the social hub. It was everything. It’s been missing.”\nOn Thursday night, the town and its supporters raised $600,000 to rebuild the iconic hotel. To celebrate, Mr Brick drank beers with mates in a tiny shed. The irony was not lost on him. Soon he’ll have a proper place to celebrate.\nThe remarkable fundraising campaign to bring the pub and the town back to life started two months ago. The website hosting donations crashed on Thursday night under the weight of generosity before reaching and eclipsing the goal.\nMr Brick and his wife Marg will manage the new pub. They said it will again cater to locals from Suggan Buggan in the north and Nowa Nowa in the south. The farming couple are expected to have plans drawn up within the week.\nMr Brick said he never realised that people in town “lived off the back of one another” until they stopped meeting for meals and pints and a game of pool.\n“There’s not much else here,” he said. “There’s a general store, a roadhouse and a cafe. We’ve got the Buchan Caves here and they’re world renowned but the problem is there’s nothing else in town. The pub was the centre of the Victorian town for many years.

It’s just been dead.”\nBuchan is known for its cattleman’s culture and it’s rodeo. But it’s also known for its hospitality and sense of community.\nOn a website titled Let’s Build a Pub, fundraisers including former resident Lyndel Moore promised annual profits from the business will be given back to the community. They’ll support the Buchan Primary School, the CFA and the footy club.\nFormer pub owner Pip Kay wrote on Facebook “I was devastated when it burnt down, now I can’t wait to see the new one”.\nMore than 120 years since the pub was first erected, it will rise from the ashes again.\nIn May, Mr Brick said he was confident the pub would be up and running by Christmas.\n“As a community, we need it,” he said.\nRohan.Smith1@news.com.au\n How a town saved their pub", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/08/14/1227483/847465-dade9bbc-4201-11e5-895e-ea44465fec65.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/08/14/1227483/849480-b83bc760-4201-11e5-895e-ea44465fec65.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/tiny-snowy-river-town-of-buchan-to-rebuild-its-iconic-pub/story-fn9evb64-1227483849568", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/08/14/1227483/849167-5686310c-4203-11e5-895e-ea44465fec65.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-15T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T23:02:21.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
