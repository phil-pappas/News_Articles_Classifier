Julian Andrews by James Chessell Ask Rio Tinto's chief financial officer, Chris Lynch, about the quality of debate in Australia over the taxation of multinational corporations and he does not mince his words.\n\"Rational argument is often an early casualty in the political process,\" he says. \"That is a challenge. If you look at the start of the debate, it was about if someone had an effective tax rate lower than the Australian corporate tax rate then they were rorting the system.\n\"Australia has a 30 per cent corporate tax rate. The UK is currently 20 per cent, heading towards 18 per cent. There are various tax rates around the world. To have a newsbite-style debate on this subject is obviously going to favour whatever will get headlines. It's a very complex area, in reality.\"\nLynch spoke to the AFR Weekend on the fourth floor of Rio's revamped head office in London's St James's Square. The West End property was the Anglo-Australian miner's global headquarters until 2007, when it moved to nearby Paddington. So it would be tempting to suggest the move back to St James's, in May, should represent a return to the mining giant's roots.\nBut plenty has changed in the past two-and-a-half years since Lynch moved with his wife and their two sons to the United Kingdom to take up the position of CFO. Back then, Rio had roughly 600 head office employees; these days it has closer to 200.\nThis is considerably less than the 350-odd staff at the company's Singapore commercial hub, which handles marketing, procurement, information systems and technology. The shift in staff numbers is interesting, given the debate about tax. Rio and rival BHP Billiton appeared before a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance in April and denied arranging their businesses to shift profits through hubs in low-tax Singapore. The resources giants argue the hubs are, in fact, genuine business operations used to sell commodities to Asian customers.\n\"What's lost a bit in the public debate is that every dollar of Australian-sourced revenue is reported through Australia,\" Lynch says.\n\"That marketing activity that we do in Singapore actually, by way of example, adds value to revenue in Australia. It's there primarily on the commercial grounds that it makes sense to be within reach of your customers.\n \"At the end of the day, if tax policy is going to be decided by a sensationalised, public opinion-type process, it's probably not going to get you a very efficient outcome.\"\nLynch can be forgiven for being a bit punchy. When the 61-year-old accepted the CFO role in February 2013, the company's credibility was in tatters. A month earlier, Tom Albanese, who ran Rio for six years, had revealed another multibillion-dollar write-down of aluminium unit Alcan. But the final straw for the Rio board was an additional $US3 billion writedown of the Riversdale coal business in Mozambique, bought for around $US3.7 billion just two years earlier . Rio's failures perfectly encapsulated the excesses of the mining boom where too much capital and precious little discipline were devoted to chasing growth.\nThe board replaced Albanese with Sam Walsh, who was running the iron ore division. One of the first things the new chief executive officer did was convince Lynch – who was a Rio non-executive director at the time – to return to full-time executive duties. It has proved to be a successful combination so far.\nOn Thursday, Rio unveiled an 82 per cent drop in net profit for the first six months of 2015 to $US806 million ($1.09 billion) and a 43 per cent slump in underlying earnings to $US2.9 billion as the average price of iron ore, Rio's main earner, almost halved to $US56 a tonne.\nYet despite significant declines in the prices of nearly all its major commodities in the fist half, Rio managed to generate $US4.4 billion of operating cash flow, which is only 19 per cent less than the previous first half and enough to pay for its progressive dividend. At the same time, the company continued to trim excess fat from its operations and strengthen its balance sheet. Costs fell $US600 million in the first half (helped by a weaker Australian dollar and lower oil price) and the target for 2015 is now $US1 billion, while capital expenditure has been reduced yet again. As a result, net debt rose less than expected and net gearing remains at the low end of the 20-30 per cent target set by Rio management.\n\"There is daylight between Rio Tinto and its peers now,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Young said on Thursday, before suggesting Rio was in strong-enough shape to launch another share buyback next year. Indeed, the only person who is likely to be unhappy about Rio's performance will be Ivan Glasenberg, the boss of Swiss mining and trading house Glencore, who still harbours desires for Rio despite a merger approach in July last year being rebuffed by the Rio board.\nFor his part, Lynch, who was the CFO of BHP for seven years during the 2000s, is now confident enough to say Rio's balance sheet is strong enough that the company could consider acquisitions, should opportunities arise.\n\"We are not averse to going outside the gearing range if we saw a great opportunity where we were not only able to convince ourselves but very confident we could convince the market it was a good idea,\" he says. \"There's no plans here to make a major acquisition. But if a good asset popped out of a bad balance sheet, we would be one of the companies that had capacity to actually have an interest in it.\"\nLynch says the Glencore approach did not change the way Rio ran its businesses – which include coal, copper and aluminium operations – but does concede \"any external comment about your company\" is \"a good chance to test yourself and say, 'what do they see that maybe we don't'.\"\nLynch nominates the performance on cost reductions as a highlight of the interim results. One advantage of lower commodity prices is that some of the heat comes out mining services and labour markets. Rio has worked hard to create competition among suppliers of everything from equipment to fly-in/fly-out routes while at the same time remaining focused on using existing resources more efficiently.\n\"The industry generally took the eye off the ball through the boom,\" says Lynch. \"The capital construction costs get heavily bid up during the boom. Input costs such as labour rise during that period. That's probably the biggest challenge we have for the industry in recovery is making sure you don't lock in cyclical costs and make it structural.\"\nBut Lynch is quick to add that cost reduction remains a work in progress. \"If there is any low-hanging fruit, it should be long gone,\" he says. \"It's getting much, much harder.\"\nThe issue of costs was one key goal outlined in a five-point plan Lynch set out when started as CFO. The other four goals were restoring market credibility, getting the balance sheet back in shape, improving the allocation of capital within the business, and developing more executive bench strength for succession purposes.\nThis week's interim result show Rio has come some way in achieving Lynch's financial aims, while the replacement of half his direct reports suggest he hasn't wasted time on succession planning in the CFO's office.\nWinning back the trust of investors, however, may take more time. \"Rebuilding credibility is a long-term game,\" says Lynch. \"And it's fragile. You are only as good as your last set of results. You can destroy credibility much quicker than you can build it.\"\nLynch says his family is enjoying London. A talented footballer from Broken Hill in NSW who ended up playing five VFL games for Geelong, Lynch has been making the most of the British capital's many sporting events including the Lord's test match and Wimbledon. His sons – aged 7 and 10 – have settled into school.\nThe rescue job Walsh and Lynch have largely pulled off at Rio poses an interesting dilemma for the board. Do they reward Lynch with the top job when Walsh – who signed an open-ended contract last October - retires? Or do they go with someone younger, such as Rio's well-regarded iron ore boss, Andrew Harding?\nMost Rio insiders believe Lynch would get the job if something happened to Walsh tomorrow but acknowledge succession planning could change over time. Of course, Lynch, who was CEO of toll road company Transurban from 2008-2012, won't say if he wants to run Rio. But he is certainly showing every sign of an executive who wants to be around for a while yet.\n\"I've already been a CEO, if that's what you call running a company. I tend to look at it more as a team process. There's a big group of people that have to do a hell of a lot of work for an organisation like Rio to be successful. I'm happily part of a team. I enjoy what I'm doing. I think Rio has a great capacity to respond to challenge.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T16:07:51.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
