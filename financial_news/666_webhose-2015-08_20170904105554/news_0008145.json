Magazine , LeaseTeam , Software \nLeaseTeam announced that it has been named to Inc. magazine’s 2015 Inc. 5000 list recognizing the fastest-growing privately held companies in America. This distinguished editorial award is based on the percentage growth of a company’s annual revenue over a three-year period (from 2011 to 2014). The 2015 Inc. 5000 represents the most competitive collection in the list’s history, with the average company achieving an astounding three-year growth of 490%. Additionally, the list’s aggregate revenue is $205 billion, generating 647,000 jobs over the past three years. “The story of this year’s Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership. In an incredibly competitive business landscape, it takes something extraordinary to take your company to the top,” said Eric Schurenberg, president and editor-in-chief at Inc. “You have to remember that the average company on the Inc. 5000 grew nearly six-fold since 2012. Business owners don’t achieve that kind of success by accident.”“To be recognized in the Inc. 5000 is a tremendous achievement, particularly when you consider that we have been in business for over 25 years,” said Randy Haug, co-founder and executive vice president at LeaseTeam. “Our continued growth, in terms of both employee-base and revenue, is a reflection of not only the health of the equipment finance industry, which we continue to work alongside in supporting, but also our commitment to investing in the top employees and technologies.”To learn more about the 2015 Inc. 5000 or view the complete list, visit www.inc.com .
