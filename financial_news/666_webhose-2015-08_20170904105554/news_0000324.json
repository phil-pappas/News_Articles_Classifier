The practical advice usually revolves around how to provide low-cost loans or gifts for part of the deposit, or the wisdom or otherwise of going guarantor on the child's mortgage.\nHowever, seemingly never far from the surface of the discussion is an intergenerational tension: whether young people \"deserve\" this help or how baby boomers' stranglehold on property assets give young people little choice but to go cap in hand to the bank of mum and dad.\nThis combative context is unfortunate. Not only does it threaten to sour what is generally a wonderful expression of love within a family, but it also obscures a more important role for parents to their child: that of mentor and a source of wise counsel.\nMany children look to their parents for property advice. It's all new to them, while the parents often owns a home and perhaps other assets. And it's no surprise that parents are often all too pleased to share their wisdom.\nTread carefully is my advice for parents in these circumstances. Will you end being a help or a hindrance? Are you confident you'll provide advice that will help and not hinder?\nYou see, many parents draw on their own experience when shaping and delivering advice. Many are baby boomers who bought their first home when land was relatively cheap and building costs much lower than they are today.\nThey could afford – although it was a struggle – to buy houses on reasonable-sized blocks. The classic Australian Dream. Enough room for a brood of kids and a dog.\nThe suburbs weren't always the trendiest ones. They might have been outer suburbs (at least at the time – often they are middle suburbs now). This experience may condition parents to think that their children must buy a house. And a roomy one at that.\n Unhelpful advice But that advice may be unhelpful. To achieve such an end today, first home buyers have to buy in distant suburbs, sometimes 30 or even 50 kilometres from the CBD. They may also be buying properties with more bedrooms than they'll ever need. Families tend to be smaller now.\nFollow mum and dad's 1980s-fashioned advice and the kids may end up with a property that isn't home sweet home but a financial burden.\nThe reality is that today they may well be better off starting with a good two-bedroom apartment in an inner suburban location as a first home. It is likely to be closer to work and the amenities they seek. And, importantly, the inner suburban two-bedroom apartment will grow faster in value than that of far-flung houses.\nThe aim is for the apartment to be a stepping stone to buying a house in five or six years, say after kids come along and they outgrow the apartment. There will be equity in the apartment, and it will give them the buying power to secure something not too far out.\nThe key thing is to pay down debt quickly, as this – with capital growth – will build equity quickly.\nAnother issue parents may have a disproportionate dislike of is debt. When they were young it was hard to borrow money and the conditions attached were challenging. Moreover many remember interest rates at 10, 15 and even 17 per cent.\nBeing careful with debt is always wise, but this experience may make them unduly conservative about borrowing money and encourage their children to minimise borrowings and buy \"cheap\" property. This could exacerbate the problem above.\nFinally, owning a home need not be the must-achieve life goal of yesteryear. Today's young adults are just as wise to consider buying an investment property, because then they can rent wherever they want – and often get great value and amenity for their lifestyle needs – while also investing in a quality property without compromises.\nRichard Wakelin is a director of Wakelin Property Advisory , an independent firm specialising in acquiring residential property for investors.
