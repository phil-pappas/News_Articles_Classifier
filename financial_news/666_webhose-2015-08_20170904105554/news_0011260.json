Merchants that already accept PayPal will see One Touch automatically enabled, PayPal said.\nA smoother shopping experience is crucial to online retailers as they often blame the high rates of unfinished or abandoned online sales on the tiring process of re-entering payment information.\nPayPal said more than half of e-commerce shopping sessions are taking place on mobile but said that only around 10 to 15 percent of purchases occur on mobile devices.\n\"If consumers can't check out in one touch or tap and instead have to do data entry on their mobile device they're far less likely to complete the transaction,\" Bill Ready, PayPal's senior vice president, said in an emailed response to Reuters.\n\"With One Touch, we're bridging that gap and creating better buying experiences for consumers, which in turn means higher conversions for merchants.\"\nPayPal said the One Touch program had led to 50 percent or greater improvement in conversion rates and said it planned to eventually launch One Touch to all markets in which PayPal exists.\nThe company, which has more than 169 million customer accounts worldwide, processed 4 billion payments last year totalling $235 billion. PayPal also said $40 billion was spent globally on mobile devices with the company.
