Jessica Hromas \"Where are we today on the 'great disagreement' between the new normal and the minority who believe the Fed will normalise interest rates over the next three years?\" he said.\nSigns of a rise plentiful: Douglass\nHe rattled out plenty of evidence for a rate rise – such as the fact that investors in Europe and the US are accepting negative or zero returns while nations like Mexico can raise funds for 100 years.\nIn equities the safer \"bond-like\" consumer staples stocks are trading at price to earnings multiples of 21 times, well above the 16 times long-term average, implying long term rates will stay around 3 per cent.\n \"The equity markets are backing the new normal and lower for longer. This is absurd that we are thinking like this.\"\nMr Douglass believes the US economy – with household leverage reset to 2002 levels, a healed banking sector, 12 million jobs created and record vacancies – points to higher interest rates.\n\"It's an economic question of what the US economy will look like in three years time,\" he said.\n\"We believe is it's likely that these transitory effects are moved past and the American economy can grow at over 4 per cent in nominal terms and the Fed will move rates to normal levels, a level that is fundamentally different to what markets are pricing at present.\"\nMacquarie Investment Management's head of fixed income Brett Lewthwaite remains firmly in the \"lower for longer\" camp.\nHe said that the world has continued to underestimate the extent to which unconventional and conventional monetary policy has been required just to keep growth at a moderate pace.\nNo normal interest rates any time soon: Lewthwaite\nThe build-up in debt since the financial crisis has made it even harder to return to \"normal\" levels of interest rates.\n\"The credit build-up was so bad we had to go all the way to zero. This reliance on monetary policy is still there. We are still using this method to drive growth,\" he said.\nWith commodity prices falling and more central banks embarking on quantitative easing or devaluing their currencies, deflationary forces are building, not dissipating.\n\"It's still going on. The ECB [European Central Bank] has just started and they'll keep going. The thing that will surprise you is that in 2015 there has been 52 banks that have eased versus seven that tightened.\"\nHe's predicting a \"sore tooth\" scenario in which the Fed raises rates, but is forced to stop, and then tries again before pulling back.\nAnother aspect of the debate is what impact higher interest rates will have on the global economy.\nMr Douglass said that higher interest rates in the US will mark the end of a prolonged seven-year period of financial repression in which US savers have earned no interest. That could boost household budgets that are already benefiting from falling oil prices.\nBut the US is part of a global economy and the impact of US Fed rate hikes on other parts of the global economy are uncertain, creating a feedback loop.\nBeing wrong would benefit both\nPerhaps what is most interesting is that Mr Lewthwaite and Mr Douglass acknowledge they have an interest in being wrong.\nAs a bond manager Mr Lewthwaite would welcome higher yields in bond markets which would increase running returns even if there was short-term pain in capital prices.\nMr Douglass on the other hand as an equity manager appreciates that he'll make more money for himself and his clients if he's wrong. He suggested many in the lower for longer camp are \"taking their books\" and are trying to spook the Fed into holding rates low by warning of an economy that will be derailed by higher rates.\nYet he is weary of the risks and is positioning to protect client funds and take advantage of depressed prices that might result from the fallout.\nOne thing both agree on as they're predicting events they don't want, is that the world is a bit bonkers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:12:01.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
