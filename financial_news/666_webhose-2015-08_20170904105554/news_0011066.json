That was the biggest one-day jump for U.S. oil since March 2009. The gains ease some concerns about the economic impact of falling oil prices on oil-producing regions and the economy at large. \nBrent crude, a benchmark for international oils imported by U.S. refineries, rose 5.2 percent to $50.05 a barrel. Brent also rose 10.3 percent Thursday. \nThe price of U.S. crude has been trading at six-year lows because of a global supply glut and worries about the health of China's economy. Oil prices started tumbling about a year ago because of rising supplies and sluggish growth in the world economy. \nThe price of U.S. oil averaged more than $90 a barrel from 2011 through 2014. On Monday, U.S. crude closed below $40 a barrel for the first time since February 2009. \nStephen Schork, an independent analyst and trader, said the gains of the past two days don't mark the beginning of a recovery in oil prices because demand will decrease once the summer is over. However he said prices will eventually recover. \n\"We are sowing the seeds for a 2016 rebound in oil prices,\" he said. \nSchork said he thinks there will be a wave of acquisitions in the energy sector over the winter. Some of acquisitions are already happening, and he feels that after more deals are struck, production will go down further and companies will also be able to make money with lower oil prices. \nHe said he thinks U.S. oil will average about $55 a barrel in 2016. That's about where it was at the end of 2014. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T01:31:55.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
