By standing back and blocking out some of the noise, they will accept what they already know: losses are expected, and are what you need to incur if you are going to take a higher risk to achieve higher returns.\nSounds easy enough. But on days like Monday, when The Australian Financial Review 's website was showing a treadmill of bad news, it's almost impossible.\n\"Once you've been exposed to it, it's very hard to overcome,\" says Russell, director of Behavioural Finance Australia, a consultancy to advisers and investors. \"It flows through subconscious pathways. It's very hard to avoid all the emotive terms that are screaming out on the page.\"\nAn obvious suggestion is to look the other way, he says.\n\"Like the person on a diet who says, 'I am not going to walk past the doughnut shop'.\"\nWhat an investor chooses to pay attention to and how it's presented will distort the way decisions are made, he says.\n His tips for investors as they face the certainty of extreme volatility are:\nUnderstand what biases and psychological effects are, so you can recognise which situations will invoke fear or panic and try to adjust your thinking before making decisions. Understand yourself. Some people are more predisposed to emotional responses and others are more process-driven. \"They'll step through a process which will perhaps put some barriers between the stimulus and the response,\" he says. Establish a framework. \"Part of the problem is that we look at a situation, investment or strategy in isolation,\" he says. \"If you took a step back and said, 'I'm going to have a policy that says, whenever I encounter a situation where the market falls by 2 or 3 per cent I will do X'. You make that policy in a situation where you're not exposed to that, or feeling the emotion.\" One strategy is delayed execution. You've made the decision but then give yourself 24 hours before acting on it. \"Emotional responses can be short-lived,\" he says. When you come back and look at it again, you can stop yourself doing something silly. Don't repeat your errors. When something good happens we attribute it to ourselves, but when something bad happens we lay blame elsewhere. \"Because we're biased in the way we interpret feedback, it puts a barrier in the way of us learning from things.\" Overcome your biases. Look at the actions of the broader market. \"They are exposed to the same sorts of biases I am, so how can I profit from their biases?\" Russell's personal strategy to avoid mistakes is to hide the password to his online broking account.
