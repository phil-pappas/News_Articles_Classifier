Lenovo, Xiaomi, Huawei and Gionee alone accounted for 12 per cent of the total smartphone market in the second quarter, a double from year ago.\n“As China started to slow down, most vendors from the country have targeted India as the next big growth market for smartphones,” IDC Research Manager Asia/Pacific Mobile Phone team Kiranjeet Kaur said.\nKey to success of the Chinese vendors has been popular flash sales through online players such as Flipkart , Snapdeal and Amazon .\n“At the same time, they have also focused on bringing more 4G phones at an affordable USD 100-150 price points, which is left unattended by Indian and global vendors, Kaur said.\n 11, 2015 3:38 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:12:59.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
