I really have nothing further that I can add,\" he said.\nDavis, 66, had been on the company's board as an independent director since 2001, and became non-executive chairman in May 2013 after Gregg Engles moved to become chairman and CEO of WhiteWave Foods Co.\nDean Foods spun off its remaining interest in WhiteWave, the organic foods division, in 2013.\n\"The stock is likely weak due to the sudden departure of the chairman,\" Stephens Inc analyst Farha Aslam said, adding that commentary on higher competition and declining sales volume could also be hurting shares.\nThe maker of Meadow Gold and Dean's Milk reported a 15.8 percent fall in quarterly sales as volumes declined after the company kept its prices high despite a drop in raw milk costs.\nDean Foods said it was not planning to cut milk prices even though it expects volume sales to decline in the low single digits in the current quarter.\n\"You look at a 77 cents difference between private label and our branded products... we would like to keep it up at those levels as long as we possibly can,\" Tanner said.\nU.S. raw milk prices fell 33 percent in the second quarter ended June due to a decline in demand from China and Russia's ban on U.S. milk and dairy imports.\nSales fell to $2.01 billion, the second drop in five quarters, missing the $2.06 billion analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal volume declined 3.1 percent.\nNet profit was $26.5 million, or 28 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a net loss a year earlier.\nExcluding items, it earned 33 cents per share, topping analysts' estimates by 7 cents.\nDean Foods' shares recouped some losses to be down 6 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAt the day's low of $14.56, $300 million of the company's $1.67 billion market value was wiped out.\n(Additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Sriraj Kalluvila)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T20:17:12.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
