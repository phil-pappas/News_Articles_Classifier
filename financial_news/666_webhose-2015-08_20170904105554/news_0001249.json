(Submitted image) Top Projects: Lime By: Julie Swiler August 12, 2015 7:06 am 0 \nAddress: 2904 Lyndale Ave. S., Minneapolis \nProject cost: $36.5 million \nProject size: 171 apartments; 8,500 square feet of retail space \nOwner: Lyndale Development Partners LLC (Partnership between developer Greco LLC and ASB Real Estate Investments) \nContractor: Frana Companies \nArchitect: BKV Group (exterior); BDH + Young (interior) \nEngineer: BKV Group; Westwood Professional Services (civil) \nEditor’s note: This is the 11th installment in Finance & Commerce’s Top Projects of 2014 series. Previous installments are available here . \nWhen Greco Development executives sought to build market-rate apartments in the LynLake neighborhood of Minneapolis, they wanted to capture its hip, urban feel while offering amenities that would attract busy professionals. \nWorking with BKV Group, they developed Lime, a 171-unit building that offers residents a community with a lifestyle all its own. “We took cues from the boutique hotel industry,” said project architect Michael Krych. “Lime captures the character of the neighborhood, but pulls it into a new age.” \nLime is modern, angular and L-shaped. The exterior, finished with metal panels in a color palette that echoes the LynLake Business Association logo, is a bright beacon in the neighborhood. \nAngular accents and bold colors continue inside to create inviting spaces for residents to gather and socialize. Amenities include a rooftop deck and clubhouse, pool and spa, fitness center, concierge and resident events. The open lobby, filled with natural light, features Marché , a bistro and bar. \nDeveloping the site came with challenges, some of which were solved by working with the neighborhood. To begin, they needed to determine how to make a limited space financially feasible, said Josh Brandsted, Greco project manager. \nLooking south to the James Ballentine VFW, Greco made an unusual deal. “We purchased the air and below-ground rights to their parking lot, and in return, provide the VFW with surface parking,” he said. \nThe project team worked with the Midtown Greenway Coalition to address a concern that the building would shadow the biking and walking trails just to the north, causing icing in the winter. The problem was solved by shifting the building back 15 feet and stepping the top floor back as well. \nWith a 96 percent occupancy rate, Lime has been well-received, said Brandsted. “It brings more people to LynLake to live. There is more activity and businesses benefit.” Pause Play Play Prev | Next Bright colors are used as accents in apartments in the Lime apartment building, which is 96 percent leased. BDH + Young handled the interior design. (Submitted image) \nLike this article? Gain access to all of our great content with a month-to-month subscription.
