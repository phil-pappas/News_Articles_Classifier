Gov. Peter Kinder , a board member who is running for governor. Republican Rep. Jay Barnes of Jefferson City also spoke against it. He and other lawmakers are suing to block the state from taking steps to finance a stadium without legislative approval. \nThe tax credits represent a small chunk of the $998 million cost of the project. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:43:26.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
