He also stated that they will soon add another subsidiary to offer world class real estate services in the country. \nOn the problems faced by the company, Mr. Mukesh lamented bitterly about the load shedding exercise which has resulted in 30% decrease in production. He is pleading with government to plan effectively and increase the power production to meet the rising demand to curb the energy crisis. \nMr. Mukesh is challenging government to also reduce taxation and import duties on raw materials and other products to boost local production. With a current capacity of 10,000 tonnes, he believes the company could double their production if government tackles the challenges faced by the industry. \n“In neighbouring countries, there are no taxes on raw materials. If we get good support from government we can produce 20, 000 tonnes of assorted steel products for local and international use,” he added. \nHe raised concerns with the instability of the cedi which he said is having adverse effect on trading. \n“Our economy is based on imports and exports so depreciation and instability of the cedi is a major factor affecting us. If government works more positively we can increase production of made in Ghana goods and our dependency on the dollar will decrease”. \nB5 Plus places a huge value on corporate social responsibilities. The company has established the Delhi Public School International; an ultra-modern school which provides holistic training for students. \nThe company organizes health camps for the public on a regular basis and also donated GhC10, 000 for the construction of a Police Station to curb crime at Kpong in 2014. \nB5 Plus Limited has been honored with several awards including the International Europe Award for Quality and Excellent Service by Globe Trade Leaders' Club, Best Enterprise Award in the field of Steel Industry by the Socrates Committee, Oxford UK and TNG Steel Fabrication Company Award by the New Ghanaian (TNG) Pillars of Modern Ghana. \nOther recognitions are European Award for Quality and Excellent Services in 2013 and Best Company in Metal Building & Construction Centre by the Association of Ghanaian Industries (AGI).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:09:17.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
