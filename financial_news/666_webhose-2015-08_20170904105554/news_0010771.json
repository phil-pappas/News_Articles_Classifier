We will take it to Cabinet after comments are received from concerned departments,\" an official source told PTI.\n\nIt is proposed to provide income tax benefits to the persons paying a portion of their expenditure either through debit or credit cards and do away with transaction charges for purchase petrol, gas and rail tickets.\n\nAs per the proposal, all high value transactions exceeding Rs one lakh will have to be made through electronic mode and the utility service providers would be encouraged to give incentives for card payments.\n\nIncentives would also be given to shopkeepers accepting major portion of their payments through plastic money.\n\nThe proposal follows an announcement made by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech, wherein he had said that one way to curb the flow of black money was to discourage transactions in cash.\n\n\"Now that a majority of Indians have or can have a RUPAY debit card. I propose to introduce soon several measures that will incentivise credit or debit card transactions, and dis-incentivise cash transactions,\" Jaitley had said.\n\nFinance Ministry had in June put up for public comments the draft proposals for facilitating electronic transactions.\n\n\"Almost all the proposals mentioned in the draft have been incorporated in the Cabinet note. Besides, certain comments from public too have been included,\" the source said.\n\nAs per the draft proposal, merchants could get a tax benefit for accepting 50 per cent of payment in electronic mode.\n\nAt present, there are about 57 crore debit cards and over 11 lakh point of sale (PoS) terminals in India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:11:47.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
