As with the shareholding we have been selling in Lloyds over the course of the last few years this is the beginning of a process that will take some time.\" \nThe overall size of HM Treasury's economic interest in RBS has been reduced from approximately 78.3% to approximately 72.9%. \nSpeaking to Sky News on Monday, Chris Leslie, the shadow chancellor, urged the Government not to sell at a loss , arguing it was not \"an impossible objective\" to recoup the £45bn investment. \n\"Why this rush to sell when the share price is so far below that paid at the time of the rescue? RBS had to be bailed out urgently, but it doesn’t have to be sold off at the same speed,\" he said. \nGlobal banks Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) orchestrated the share sale but have each been instructed by UK Financial Investments Limited (UKFI) and HM Treasury not to sell further RBS shares for at least 90 days without prior written consent from a majority of the other selling banks. \nIn a report Osborne commissioned from Rothschild, the investment bank, his advisers concluded that disposing of the taxpayer's entire stake in the bank would crystallise a £7bn loss if fees paid to the Treasury since 2008 were taken into account. \nSpeaking at the Treasury Select Committee last month Osborne said: \"there is an argument that by starting to sell now you might create more of a market for RBS shares and lift the price, but I am not banking on it\". \nThe Government also announced a further disposal of Lloyds shares on Monday which lowers its stake to 13.99%. \nUnlike RBS, the taxpayer would make a £1.9bn profit from its Lloyds intervention assuming it would be able to offload its remaining stake at current market prices. \nIn early morning trading RBS shares were 0.5% lower at 336p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:17:22.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
