Bloomberg Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi CSL could soon be joined by Cochlear and Macquarie Bank as stocks with a $100 price tag, with Blackmores, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Ramsay also possible contenders.\nCSL reached $102.39 on Wednesday before settling back into double figures. Other stocks within striking distance of the $100 mark include Cochlear at $91, Blackmores at $88, Commonwealth Bank at $83, Macquarie at $80, and Ramsay, an outside chance, at $64.\nThe next stock after that is Rio Tinto, at $54. At the peak of the mining boom Rio reached $124 but analysts give it almost no chance in the foreseeable future of reaching triple figures.\n\"I would rate it as a race between Cochlear and Macquarie,\" said CMC Markets chief market analyst Ric Spooner on which will hit $100 first. \"Cochlear will get an ongoing benefit from a weaker Australian dollar, plus decent earnings growth. Macquarie is also likely to get decent ongoing earnings growth.\nCSL hit $102.39 before settling back into double figures. Bloomberg \"I see Commonwealth Bank as being an outsider now. They're a long way from it and they need to raise a lot more capital which will dilute their share price downwards anyway in all likelihood.\"\nHealthcare stocks were in vogue at the moment, said Mr Spooner, and should remain so given Australia's increasingly health-conscious and ageing population.\nVitamin and supplements maker Blackmores is the only contender from outside of the S&P/ASX200, which Options Express markets analyst Ben Le Brun said was a \"quiet achiever\" although its price-earnings multiple was looking \"stretched\".\n\"It's a maybe ... its earnings results would need to be good. I would put it in the outsiders basket but I would certainly give it more of a chance than Ramsay and Rio.\"\n Mr Le Brun said Commonwealth Bank would \"struggle\" to get to $100.\n\"I think it will probably lag,\" he said. \"Earnings next week and maybe a capital raising and we could see the shares under further pressure.\"\nAs with Mr Spooner, Mr Le Brun placed Cochlear and Macquarie as the two top candidates to break $100, in that order.\nCochlear would continue to show \"serious topline revenue growth which is just so rare in the market\".\nMacquarie is in the \"maybe\" category and would need another upgrade its guidance.\n\"The market is used to Macquarie upgrading guidance at the eleventh hour just before they release earnings numbers,\" he said. \"I would back Macquarie as a better chance than Commonwealth Bank of breaking $100 in the short-term.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@cauchis"], "published": "2015-08-07T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:04:06.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
