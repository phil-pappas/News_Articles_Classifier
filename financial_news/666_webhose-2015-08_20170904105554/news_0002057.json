Pichai, 43, has joined the league of Indra Nooyi, Lakshmi Mittal, Ajay Banga, among many other Indian-origin persons at the helm at large conglomerates headquartered abroad. \nMeanwhile, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, was the first to congratulate Pichai. Nadella tweeted on Pichai's elevation at the company, writing in the micro-blogging site \"Congrats @sundarpichai well deserved.\" \n[ India-born Sundar Pichai appointed as Google's new helmsman ] \nThere are many other Indians heading the businesses at relatively smaller companies abroad, specially in IT sector, but at least 12 large companies have got India-born chief executives. \nThese include Microsoft (Satya Nadella), PepsiCo (Indra Nooyi), ArcelorMittal (Lakshmi Mittal), Diageo (Ivan Menezes), Reckitt Benckiser (Rakesh Kapoor), MasterCard (Ajay Banga), DBS Group Holdings (Piyush Gupta), SanDisk (Sanjay Mehrotra), Global Foundries (Sanjay Jha), Cognizant (Francisco Dsouza) and Adobe (Shantanu Narayen). \nInternational magazine Time once termed CEOs as Indias leading \"export\" and said that the subcontinent could be \"the ideal training ground for global bosses\". \nWhile Google reported a USD 66 billion revenue in 2014, Microsoft had recorded turnover of over USD 86 billion last year, PepsiCo's annual revenue stood at nearly USD 67 billion in 2014, ArcelorMittal's annual revenue stood at USD 79.26 billion, Diageo had USD 21 billion, Reckitt Benckiser USD 13.75 billion and SanDisk at USD 6.62 billion. \nIn the past, giants like Citigroup, Vodafone, Motorola and Deutsche Bank have also had Indian-origin CEOs. Moreover, former Google Executive Nikesh Arora, who is currently President of Japanese telecom major SoftBank, is likely to be its next CEO as SoftBank's founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son has chosen Arora to be his successor. \nAccording to human resource experts, the significant rise of India-born executives at global companies can largely be attributed to the technical skills and the behavioural patterns which make them very much adaptable to any kind of situation they come across. \nExperts believe that Indians focus on good education and ability to work in difficult situations are aiding to this rising trend and more and more Indians could rise to top positions at global companies in near future. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:12:14.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
