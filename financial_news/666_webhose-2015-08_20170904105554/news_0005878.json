Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires As the dust settles from China's shock move to devalue its currency, Credit Suisse sees clear winners and losers on the ASX as the effect on the global economy flows into shareholder portfolios.\nChina's renminbi fell, from its stable peg to the US dollar, by 3 to 4 per cent this week. Further devaluation is expected as China's central bank loosens its grip and moves towards a freely traded market amid concerns of its slowing economy.\nCredit Suisse's equity analysts led by Hasan Tevfik believe additional yuan devaluation – by up to 4 or 5 per cent – will spark further weakness in the Australian dollar, which fell to a fresh six-year low of US72.15¢ this week before recovering .\n\"We expect the [Aussie] to depreciate further [against the US dollar] as the lead indicators of growth in China remain subdued and commodity prices remain under pressure,\" Mr Tevfik wrote in a research note.\nA global deflationary effect, spurred by the weaker yuan as other countries ramp up their production to compete with cheaper Chinese exports, could also increase the chance of the Reserve Bank of Australia moving towards further rate cuts, Mr Tevfik said.\nAt the same time, the risk is of a slowdown in the trajectory of the United States' tightening cycle.\n\"Further potential weakness in commodity prices and a weaker than forecast terms of trade should mean further pressure for monetary easing,\" he said.\nBut the consequences for Australian companies are mixed, and while the yuan devaluation led the sharemarket to a seven-month low week, Credit Suisse is doggedly sticking to its positive outlook for the ASX, with a target of 6000 by the year's end.\n Winners High dividend yielding companies, international earners benefiting from a lower Australian dollar and companies with a large China cost base are expected to win from this move, according to Mr Tevfik and his team.\nGaming company Aristocrat, blood maker CSL, Macquarie Group and ResMed are the offshore earning companies best placed to gain from a stronger US dollar, the currency which stands to appreciate the most, Mr Tevfik said.\nGlobal disinflationary forces stemming from concerns around the Chinese would send bond yields plummeting, making Australia's high-dividend yielding stock more attractive.\n\"We find the spread between Aussie trailing dividend yield and the Australian 10-year bond yield is currently 2 per cent and hardly ever been larger,\" he said.\n\"We have a number of solid dividend yielders in our portfolio and most provide solid dividend growth, including National Australia Bank, M2 Group and Macquarie Group.\"\nAustralian companies with a Chinese cost-base also stand to benefit, as China ramps up its manufacturing competitiveness. Breville, Harvey Norman and JB Hi-Fi all have high Chinese cost bases, with Breville up to 75 per cent.\nLosers Commodity producers, companies competing with China and businesses with a Chinese consumer base are tipped to struggle. China's exports could become more competitive with the weaker yuan and its economy in deflation mode, Mr Tevfik said.\n\"Chinese exporters would gain at the expense of competitors in the region,\" he said.\nGoods imported from China are now effectively 3 to 4 per cent cheaper in US dollar terms and could become cheaper still, he said.\nThe weaker yuan is also expected to have a negative effect on companies with a large Chinese customer base, such as Crown and Treasury Wines.\nEmbattled resources companies are facing more pressure as strengthened US dollar weighing on commodity prices and concerns around China's real-estate projects.\nSantos, Origin and Iluka are on Credit Suisse's list of companies it believes will suffer falling share prices.\nFirms up against Chinese competitors, principally steelmakers Arrium and Bluescope and metals recycling company Sims Metal, are under threat as their competition's costs become cheaper.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-08-14T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:05:06.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
