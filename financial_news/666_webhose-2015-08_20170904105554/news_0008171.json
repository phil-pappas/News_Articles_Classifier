' \nMr Otoo, whose company was established in Accra in 1999, reigns as the Best Furniture Work in the country. \nHe explained that his entity had over the years, been offering free training in carpentry and wood works to several young people, as a way of creating jobs opportunities to reduce unemployment. \nHe said, however that, since the venture was capital intensive, there was the need for government to come to his aid with some financial support, in order for him to rope in more people, especially the youth, to benefit from the gesture to transform their lives. \nThe MD stressed the need for the setting up of an Entrepreneurial Development Fund through which government could make available funds that businesses could source from in the form of loans through selected banks. \n'This has to be done carefully by assessing companies' track records if they are tried and tested entrepreneurs, like my company then they can be assisted financially to expand their operations,' he said. \nMr Otoo said, this could also support the companies to provide the trainees with the needed equipment to start their own businesses after their training. \nThis would contribute immensely to societal transformation, instead of seeing the youth idling around and indulging in vices like armed- robbery, stealing, and drug abuse, among others. \nMr Otoo appealed to the appropriate authorities to grant licenses and concessions to carpentry industries, to enable them have direct access to wood from the forest. \n'Carpenters needed to be respected and assisted in all their endeavours, because, we produce all that people sleep and sit on, at home, school, church, workplace and even the presidency,' he said \nMr Otoo advised the youth not to waste their talents, time, energies and resources on fruitless ventures and unproductive activities, but seek proper ways of developing their God-given talents, in order for them to become responsible citizens in future. \nHe also urged Ghanaians to bear with the leadership of the nation and pray for them, so that they could steer affairs effectively and successfully. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:09:20.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
