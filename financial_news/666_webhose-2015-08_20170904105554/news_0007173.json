It's a real pity to see schools in such deplorable state in the Greater Accra region, home of the capital city of Ghana. I was moved to tears to see these pupils defy all odds to study under such conditions,' said the headmaster, Osman Kweku Eshun. \nSimilarly, the Municipal Education Director expressed her profound gratitude to the Tigo Ghana Shelter 4Education Programme and pleaded for additional assistance to improve the quality of education in the area. \nHead of Corporate Communications and CSR of Tigo Ghana, Gifty Bingley, in her speech stated, 'We believe that the future belongs to these beautiful children. That is why we are creating a conducive environment for them. We remain committed to empowering communities by promoting educational opportunities that make a positive difference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:08:30.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
