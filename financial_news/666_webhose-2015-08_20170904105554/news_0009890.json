Photo: Getty Images\nBeijing: Next week, President Xi Jinping will take the salute at a massive military parade in central Beijing that will shut factories, force cars off the roads, and put much of the city under security lockdown.\nThe parade is another milestone in Xi's continued centralisation of authority and desire to project power. But beyond the procession of tanks, fighter jets and goose-stepping soldiers, Xi and the Communist Party's central leadership are facing one of their sternest tests.\nThe Chinese stockmarket is much more of a sort of casino down the side street, rather than a bank on High Street.\nArthur Kroeber, analyst, Gavekal Dragonomics Since the onset of the global financial crisis, China has provided the bulk of the heavy lifting that has supported global economic growth, through a credit-fuelled infrastructure binge of extraordinary scale.\nThe concerns are now that the once high-flying Chinese economy – widely credited for helping economies like Australia through the depths of the crisis – is slowing more dramatically than expected, and posing a threat to global growth. And, the confused messages China's government is exporting are creating uncertainty and damaging its credibility as an economic manager.\nAdvertisement The world has watched agape as $US5 trillion ($7 trillion) has been melted off its crumpling sharemarket since mid-June, the equivalent of more than three times Australia's annual economic output.\nThe natural instinct, especially outside China, is to infer the free-fall as a signal of the state of the broader economy.\nThe optics are terrible, but China's sharemarket has never been a reliable indicator of the country's economic health. Trading is dominated by individuals and state-linked investors who pay more heed to political sentiment than corporate earnings and economic fundamentals.\nWhen China was reporting double-digit economic growth numbers, its sharemarkets remained in the doldrums. Conversely, the remarkable year-long bull run which preceded this crash came at a time when China's growth had slowed to the lowest levels of economic growth in 25 years.\nChina's sharemarkets, like its internet, are substantially walled off to the outside world; only around 1 per cent of shares are foreign-owned.\nAs a result, what happens on China's bourses rarely has much impact on international stock indices.\n\"Most economic analysts like us have struggled very hard to find a strong connection between the stock market and the real economy,\" says Arthur Kroeber, of Beijing-based Gavekal Dragonomics. \"The Chinese stockmarket is much more of a sort of casino down the side street, rather than a bank on High Street.\"\nIt's not to say that China's economy isn't without serious problems.\nThe colossal stimulus program back in 2008 that kept it and other economies afloat during the financial crisis enriched iron ore and copper miners but also resulted in rampant overbuilding – office towers, apartment blocks and steel mills that, at least for now, it simply does not need.\nChina has continually emphasised the need to transition its economy to a more sustainable footing; and the elevation of Xi and Premier Li Keqiang to top office has seen the Communist Party embark on an ambitious economic reform program with more vigour than in the past.\nThe idea is to become less reliant on building roads, skyscrapers and airports for GDP growth, and more dependent on domestic consumption; on the country's rising middle class buying more cars, laptops and smartphones, and spending more on food, travel and entertainment.\nThe shift has been clearly visible in Australia, where tourists and international student numbers from China are surging, and clamour for Australian dairy and fresh produce is growing.\nBut the overcapacity in China's steel industry, coupled with a global iron ore glut, has seen the share prices of the big miners like BHP Billiton and Fortescue hammered. Last week, BHP posted its worst profit result in 12 years.\nResearch firm Capital Economics says Australia's growth could slow to 2.0 per cent from 2.7 per cent last year if China's economy continues to weaken.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey said he felt concerns surrounding China's economy were overblown.\n\"There's a lot of people sitting in London or New York, or any other town or city a long way from China, who is a self-proclaimed expert,\" he told the Wall Street Journal . \"We're confident about our understanding of the Chinese economy and we see over time huge opportunities for growth.\"\nHe added that Australia was \"part and parcel\" of China's growth story, just as many emerging-market economies have become reliant on the country for their own growth.\nThe weakness in China has compelled the US Federal Reserve to say that an interest rate increase next month now looked less likely.\nBrazil, another economy heavily reliant on its resources trade with China, has also been less sanguine.\n\"The entire world is focusing now on China, watching this crisis unfold,\" Armando Monteiro Neto, Brazil's minister of development and foreign trade, told reporters on Tuesday in Brasília. \"Brazil is already feeling the effects of China's deceleration. If the situation gets worse, the impact will get bigger.\"\nArguably the most damaging fallout for China's leaders from the steep drop in its sharemarkets has been the dent it has put in its economic management credentials.\nIt has not acknowledged what has been a source of public anger – that the government had been implicit in encouraging the remarkable bull run which stoked the sharemarket bubble before the crash.\nAgainst a backdrop of slowing economic growth, it encouraged ordinary Chinese to buy into a short-lived sharemarket bubble, through prominent state media editorials.\nWhen the bubble burst, it funnelled $400 billion into a state-backed share purchase agency, China Securities Finance, to support stock prices, running counter to its pledge to let free markets play a decisive role.\nThe intervention failed. With investors expecting more intervention when shares fell more than 22 per cent in four days, it stayed away.\n\"To start, the regulator should not have tried to get the stock index to go up,\" Caixin , an influential business magazine said in a sharp editorial on Wednesday. Direct criticism of government policy and wisdom in the mainland's state-controlled media is rare.\n\"Also, the CSF seemed to have picked stocks randomly, pouring capital into valuable and worthless companies indiscriminately. Critics have questioned the wisdom of these actions, and some voiced concerns about insider trading.\"\nMany analysts have taken China's policy confusion as a sign that the economy is in worse shape than its headline 7 per cent growth figure suggests, and that officials are desperately clutching at any means to prop it up.\nScepticism over China's official growth figures is stronger than ever.\nCitigroup's chief economist, Willem Buiter, said China was not acting promptly enough with its reforms to prevent \"China sliding into recession\". The true rate of China's economic expansion, was probably \"closer to 4.5 per cent or less\".\nMeanwhile, Xi's efforts to consolidate authority and build up China's prestige as an international power, have continued unabated.\nBeijing has been bathed in unseasonably blue skies, with Chinese ordering steel mills, construction sites and factories to close in Beijing and surrounding cities ahead of the military parade.\nHalf of the city's cars have been ordered off the roads and 850,000 \"volunteers\" have been mobilised to keep order during this time of heightened security.\n\"Xi's bargain is more state control now, in return for a vague hope that it will eventually be used for beneficial ends,\" Kroeber says. \"This is exactly the opposite of the recipe his predecessors used to conjure up 35 years of extraordinary growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:36:34.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
