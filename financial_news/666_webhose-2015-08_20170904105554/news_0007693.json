Chances are you used an online platform run by a largely unknown British company, writes Andrew Cave \nGordon Wilson has made it to the stock market at the third time of asking. Just don’t suggest to the chief executive of Travelport Worldwide that it’s via the wrong exchange. \nTravelport, one of the top three global companies behind the complex world of online travel bookings, finally floated last September four years after its second attempt to list in London was thwarted by the jittery market reaction to the first Greek sovereign debt crisis. \nLast year’s float was on the New York Stock Exchange, however. Travelport’s debt hangover from its eight years of ownership by private equity group Blackstone (NYSE: BX - news ) meant that its leverage was too high for sensitive London investors. \nIt elected instead to pitch its shares at more debt-tolerant American investors, though it remains headquartered in Langley, near Slough, with 630 of its 3,400-strong global workforce based in the UK. \nOperating in 170 countries, Travelport provides the systems behind online travel brands including Trailfinders, Expedia (NasdaqGS: EXPE - news ) and Ebookers, making reservations with more than 400 airlines, 650,000 hotels and all the major car rental, cruise and packaged tours companies. \nLast year, $90bn (£58bn) of travel bookings were processed through the company’s systems, which deal with 1bn transactions a day. * From budget to business: how the low cost airlines are winning us over This saw Travelport, which reports its second-quarter numbers on Tuesday, achieve turnover of $2bn last year, when earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation amounted to $540m. \nAll this gives it a stock market of capitalisation of $1.56bn (£1bn) down from $1.9bn in February although it remains smaller than Spanish rival Amadeus and Dallas-based Sabre. \nIsn’t Travelport a much smaller fish in a bigger pond in the US, however? After all, the company would be in the FTSE 250 index, if it was listed in London. Does it suffer from the downside of its US listing? \n“Yes and no,” says Wilson (Oslo: WILS.OL - news ) . “In all honesty, as a newly quoted company and as a business-to-business company as well, which means by definition that you’re not so well-known, I’m spending a lot of my time educating investors in terms of what we are and how we operate and also how the world works outside of America. That’s something that just takes time. \nBudget airlines have helped to fuel growth in the travel industry \n“We’re very proud of the fact that we’re a British-headquartered company and of what we have done here. \n“This is a success story of a British company that has taken itself public in New York and is a global enterprise. We don’t have many of those, especially not in the technology field.” \nTravelport’s history dates back to 1987 when it was set up in Amsterdam by a consortium of airlines including British Airways. The project became Galileo International, a travel booking information systems business, which was sold in 2001 to a US marketing services group, Cendant. \nCendant later split into four and Galileo was bought in 2006 by Blackstone, which separated the travel distribution business from hotel wholesale and website arms, merged it with a company called Worldspan and rebranded the group as Travelport. \nThe memories of the pulled float which followed earlier separate unannounced discussions about going public that were quietly shelved in 2010 are still strong. “We were literally on the road,” Wilson recalls, “but unfortunately the market just closed and nobody was doing anything new. We got caught up in that, so had to go away and bide our time until the markets got better.” \nLast September’s float was not straightforward either, because of that debt issue. “We reduced our debt by $1bn last year, inclusive of our initial public offering, but we’re still just over four times levered today in terms of our debt-to-equity ratio,” says Wilson. * Travelport float pulled at eleventh hour over discount “We were six-and-a-half times levered in our heady days with Blackstone, but we were still too highly leveraged for the UK market, where the tolerance level is about three-and-a-half times. \n“But we’re a very cash-generative business, so the level of debt isn’t an issue for us, particularly not now when we have reduced it so much, and we will continue to reduce it as we go forward,” he says. \nWilson has been at Travelport for 24 years, joining as vendor sales manager in its Galileo days in 1991. \n“It was my job to sell participation in the system to airlines, car rental companies and hotels,” he says. “But when I first started, we were effectively selling vapourware because we hadn’t quite built the system yet. We were selling a concept.” \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) growth is being fuelled by budget airlines such as EasyJet (Other OTC: EJTTF - news ) , Ryanair and Air Asia coming on to major booking platforms and by the expansion of Gulf airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways that primarily sell their seats outside their home markets. \nTravelport’s systems control 25pc of global air travel bookings, making it third largest in the sector behind Sabre’s 40pc and Amadeus’s 35pc. \nIt is the second largest behind Amadeus in terms of revenues, however, and has the largest number of hotels that can be booked through its systems. “Nobody has more,” says Wilson. “We’re in a good position there.” \nGrowth is also coming through the rapidly developing online travel payments sector, where Travelport last year raised its stake in payments company eNett. \nThe company also has a bespoke software applications business, running the key reservations systems for Delta Airlines and fares and shopping systems for Emirates. \nLast month, Travelport acquired mobile technology firm MTT, which provides mobile technology and apps to the travel industry and develops and hosts travel apps for airlines including easyJet. \nWith the IT world fast consolidating, one question is whether Travelport, Amadeus and Sabre will become targets for business software giants such as SAP (Amsterdam: AP6.AS - news ) , Oracle (Hanover: ORC.HA - news ) and Salesforce. Wilson is sanguine. \n“You can never say never,” he says. “We are all quite expensive to buy. But, if the big players wanted to get more into the platform space, that’s what we are. \n“We’re a platform and the world is going more and more platform-driven. Amazon is a platform for example. But we’re specialised in the travel sector. They’d have to want to get into that.” \nSuch a move has begun, however, with SAP spending $8bn buying Concur Technologies, an American company specialising in expense management and travel booking systems. \n“Who knows?” says Wilson. “They all seem to be moving up the food chain. Rather than being just IT providers, they’re getting more into the applications and platforms. If they did that, they may look. I don’t know. Obviously, my goal is to run Travelport as it is.” \nStill, it always helps to have potential buyers out there, doesn’t it? “Sometimes,” he laughs. “But I’d like to have a little period of time. We only went public in September.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:07:05.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
