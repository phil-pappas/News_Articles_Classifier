The cash rate is now at a record-low of 2.0 percent, with the latest cuts coming in February and May. \nANZ senior economist Felicity Emmett said the latest statement suggested interest rates would stay on hold for an extended period, with an easing bias. \n\"A prolonged period of elevated unemployment, together with potential upward pressure on lending rates from higher capital requirements and other regulatory measures suggest that further monetary policy easing over the next 6-12 months cannot be ruled out,\" she said in a note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:35:28.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
