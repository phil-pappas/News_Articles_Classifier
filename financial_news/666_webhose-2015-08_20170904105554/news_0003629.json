Adjusted EBITDA of 2.22 billion euros was down 1 percent from a year earlier but was still the biggest contributor to group profit.\n($1 = 0.9164 euros) (Reporting by Harro ten Wolde; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Georgina Prodhan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T08:59:01.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
