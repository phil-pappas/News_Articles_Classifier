Ramsay reaffirms guidance \nPrivate hospitals operator Ramsay Health Care has reaffirmed its guidance for core net profit following the publication of the financial results for French hospitals group Generale de Sante. \nGenerale de Sante (GDS) is the leading private hospitals operator in France. \nRamsay currently holds a controlling stake of 50.9 per cent of GDS, following the merger of GDS and Ramsay Sante in early July. \nBefore the merger, Ramsay held a stake of 48.8 per cent in GDS. \n\"Ramsay confirms that the results released by GDS are consistent with Ramsay's expectations,\" Ramsay said on Friday. \n\"Accordingly Ramsay reaffirms its upgraded guidance (given in February 2015) for core net profit after tax and core earnings per share growth of 18 per cent to 20 per cent for full financial year 2015, including nine months of GDS.\" \nGenerale de Sante said that in the six months to June 30, 2015, revenue lifted 1.2 per cent to 893.3 million euros but EBITDA (earnings before interst, tax, depreciation and amortisation) fell 8.2 per cent. \nEarnings were affected by a decrease in pricing and an increase in expenses. \nGDS has changed the closing date for its financial year from December 31 to June 30, so the 2015 financial year covers only six months. \nRamsay reports its own full year financial results for the 2015 financial year on August 27. \nShares in Ramsay were $1.98 lower at $64.39 at 1120 AEST. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Virgin cuts Bali routes on path to profit AAP \nVirgin Australia will axe flights to Bali and Phuket in an effort to turn around its loss-making international â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T09:47:07.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
