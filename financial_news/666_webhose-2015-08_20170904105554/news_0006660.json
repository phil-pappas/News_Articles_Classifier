All three of the websites were offline on Saturday afternoon as details of the attack were made public. \nThe Carphone Warehouse division also provides services to its recently launched iD mobile network , as well as to TalkTalk Mobile and Talk Mobile, around 480,000 customers of which may also be affected. \nCarphone Warehouse confessed that the personal data of as many as 2.4 million people may have been accessed by the hackers, including names, addresses, date of birth information and bank details. \nThe company has sent a letter to anyone who may be at risk via email, alerting them to the situation and providing information on what they can do next. They have been told to notify their bank, and check for any suspicious or unexpected account activity. \nAnyone who fears that they might be affected by the data breach should be wary when answering calls purporting to be from the affected websites and services, Carphone Warehouse said. \nThe company told customers that in the event that they became a victim of fraud, they should contact Action Fraud , the UK’s national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. \n• Three early warning signs that you've fallen victim to identity theft • Identity theft jump 27pc as thieves target innocent account-holders \nVictims of fraud are also able to check to if their credit card rating has been impacted by checking on the Experian (Amsterdam: EP8.AS - news ) and Equifax websites. \nCredit card data of 90,000 customers \"may also have been accessed\", the company said, although this was stored in an encrypted form. Customers whose credit card details have been exposed have been informed by email and told to notify their credit card company. \nThierry Karsenti, technical director at data security firm Check Point, said: \"Armed with the data they already have, attackers are likely to try and trick those affected by the breach into revealing further details, such as account numbers and passwords.\" \n\"For the attackers, it’s just a numbers game, but it could have serious consequences for customers,\" he said, adding that \"customers should be suspicious of any emails, or even phone calls, that relate to the breach, and should not give away more information\". \n• The biggest ever cyber attacks and security breaches • Unmasked: the six hacker 'tribes' you need to avoid \nCustomers alerted to the hack on Saturday took to social media website Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) to air their outrage that Carphone Warehouse had not been able to protect their personal information. \nOne customer said that Carphone Warehouse had displayed \"staggering incompetence\", while another said that \"you would think companies would get their act together in this day and age\". \nThe data breach is the latest in a series of high-profile hacks that have made the personal information of internet users vulnerable. \nMore than 15m Britons were put at risk when eBay was hacked in May 2014 , and last month, the hack of extramarital dating website Ashley Madison left the details of 37m would-be adulterers in the hands of cyber criminals . \nCarphone Warehouse, which is owned by Dixons Carphone (Stuttgart: CWB.SG - news ) following last year's £3.7bn merger , also incorporates Currys and PC World. \nSebastian James, chief executive of Dixons Carphone, said: \"We take the security of customer data extremely seriously, and we are very sorry that people have been affected by this attack on our systems.\" \n\"We are, of course, informing anyone that may have been affected, and have put in place additional security measures,\" he added. \nThe company said that the customer information of Currys and PC World, and \"the vast majority\" of Carphone Warehouse customer data is held on separate systems and has not been affected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:19:16.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
