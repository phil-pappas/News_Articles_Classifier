Inflation is coming under control. So overall we are moving towards a softening interest rate environment,” she said.\nChanda Kochhar added “clearly a lot of transmission has happened because if you see when the monetary policy rates gets cut then the deposit rates fall and the deposit form a only part of cost of funds for the banks.”\nShe said 30 basis points (0.30 per cent) rate cut has already happened “which is quite in line with the reduction in the cost of funds.”\nThe Reserve Bank of India has cut its benchmark rate by 75 basis points to 7.5 per cent in three tranches so far this year. At the bi-monthly monetary policy earlier this month, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan wanted banks to transmit more interest rate cuts to borrowers before he further eases monetary stance.\n“Not only we were the first ones to cut rates we had actually cut them by a much larger amount than any other bank,” Kochhar said.\nShe said “gradually as cost of funds keep going down you would see interest rates coming down. Directionally, definitely we are in a softening environment but when and how much that is not something we can say.”\n 18, 2015 5:13 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:21:27.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
