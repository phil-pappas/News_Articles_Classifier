With delinquencies on the rise for the 40 million Americans saddled with an aggregate $1.3 trillion of student loan debt, solving the crisis has become an imperative issue for the candidates to address.This article is the first of a political series on student loans, and outlines the major plans for student loan reform that have been put forth by the Democratic presidential candidates: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders, and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley. Hillary Clinton: reconfiguring loan structures and providing free community college Hillary Clinton’s proposed student loan reform plan focuses on several major goals:\nLowering student loan interest rates and reforming student loan repayments by providing refinancing opportunities for those who have graduated; t Making it possible for students to attend public colleges or universities without taking on student loans; t Increasing graduation rates; and t Providing free community college . She is seeking to achieve these goals through the following measures: Requiring states to increase their investment in higher education, subsidized by grants from the federal government; t Providing federal grants to colleges and universities that improve graduation rates, and those that help support low-income and first-generation students to graduate. Colleges and universities would be required to show how they would increase their graduation rates; t Requiring public colleges and universities to set tuition rates at a level that students can afford without taking on student loan debt to cover the costs of tuition. The Federal government would spend approximately $175 billion over 10 years on grants to support this; t Providing tuition assistance in exchange for national service through AmeriCorps; t Instituting income-based plans as the default repayment plan, and limiting the profit that the federal government makes from student loans. Student debt will be forgiven after 20 years; and t Allowing recent graduates to refinance their student loans at current interest rates. Clinton’s plan would be estimated to cost $350 billion over 10 years, and would be paid for by limiting itemized tax deductions for the wealthy.

Bernie Sanders: making Wall Street pay for America’s education The goal that Senator Bernie Sanders has put forth for student loan reform is clear: free tuition at every public college and university in America.In order to reach this goal and help alleviate much of the economic burden associated with student loans, Sanders has proposed the following: Providing $47 billion per year to eliminate undergraduate tuition and fees. The total public college and university tuition bill in America amounts to $70 billion per year, leaving states responsible for the remaining $23 billion per year; t Restoring the student loan interest rate formula to the formula used until 2006, cutting student loan interest rates nearly in half, and allowing graduates to refinance their federal loans at current interest rates; t Expanding work study, with a focus largely on schools with high percentages of low-income students; and t Simplifying the application process for student aid. To pay for the plan, Sanders has proposed a Robin Hood Tax that would impose speculation fees on Wall Street for financial market transactions, including of 0.5% on stock trades (50 cents for every $100 worth of stock), 0.1% fee on bonds, and 0.005% on derivatives.

Martin O’Malley: providing debt-free education for all Martin O’Malley has two major goals for reform that are the foundation of his student loan plan: Within five years, all students have access to quality, debt-free education at all public colleges and universities; and t Within 10 years, college completion rates to be increased by 25%. O’Malley has outlined numerous methods through which he’d seek to achieve these goals, but the following are the main proposals: Providing immediate relief to federal student loan borrowers by allowing them to refinance and tie their student loans repayments to their income; t Freezing and reducing tuition fees at public colleges and universities while also increasing help for low and middle-income students; t Allowing all low and middle-income students enrolled in income-based repayment to have their monthly student loan repayments capped at 10% of their take-home pay; and t Providing other measures to increase success in college, such as childcare for students with children and expanded college counseling.

Understanding the impact of student loan reform on Millennials A common theme that runs throughout these student loan reform plans put forth by the Democratic candidates is that intervention, oversight, and support from the federal government to public colleges and universities is necessary.Sanders’ plan is the most progressive, calling for all tuition costs and associated fees to be paid for by imposing new costs on Wall Street. Both Clinton’s and O’Malley’s plans aim at significantly reshaping college tuition and the structure of student loans, but are more gradual in their approach. Interestingly, Clinton has outlined the assumed costs of her plan whereas O’Malley hasn’t yet released specific details on the cost of his proposal .It can be clearly seen that these plans are aimed at Millennials, who make up a large percentage of the population most affected by student loan debt. This group is also comprised of those who have the most at stake from new reforms begin enacted, which will influence their personal futures as well as that of the nation.As Millennials have historically been an important demographic for the Democrats in both the primary and general elections, discussions surrounding student loan reform and other new initiatives to manage the student loan crisis can be expected to grow in the coming months.", "external_links": ["http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9125349/hillary-clinton-college", "http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/07/08/martin-omalley-racked-up-339200-in-loans-putting-two-kids-through-college-he-wants-to-lighten-the-load-for-others/", "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/clinton-propose-350-billion-college-041429011.html", "https://martinomalley.com/policy/make-college-debt-free/", "https://medium.com/@HillaryClinton/the-new-college-compact-73652df9543c", "http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-calls-for-student-loan-reforms-affordable-tuition"], "published": "2015-08-21T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T02:53:58.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
