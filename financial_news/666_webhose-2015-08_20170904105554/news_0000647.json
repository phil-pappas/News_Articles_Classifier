Holiday parks owner eyes expansion By Ben Martin | Telegraph – 14 minutes ago +0.02 \nPark Leisure owns 11 holiday home parks and is monitoring further acquisitions \nPark Leisure is eyeing further acquisitions after first-half revenues at the holiday homes business were boosted by the company’s recent rapid expansion. \nMiles Dewhurst, managing director at the privately-owned firm, said that Park Leisure was monitoring two possible purchases. The number of sites the company owns has already swelled to 11 across the country, after the business bought the Plas Coch park in Anglesey for £15m earlier this year and two others in Herefordshire and North Yorkshire in the second-half of 2014. \n“We’ve got our eye on a couple of ideas,” said Mr Dewhurst, adding that Park Leisure was looking at sites in Yorkshire and Devon and Cornwall. Further deals are unlikely to complete until next year, he said: “Realistically it takes six months to buy anything.” \nThe company was founded in 1998 and bought its first park the following year. It sells static caravans and luxury lodges on parks which it maintains, and Plas Coch is set to become its flagship location, offering a spa and a host of adventurous activities. \nIts parks are only open to holidaymakers who own properties on-site, and the firm charges annual site fees to its customers. \nThanks to its recent acquisition spree, turnover at Park Leisure surged by 56pc to £28.4m during the first-half, compared with the same period a year earlier. Pre (Shanghai: 600048.SS - news ) -tax profits swelled by 70pc to £3.4m. \nThe business is targeting full-year sales of more than £50m, up from £39.4m last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T09:16:19.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
