Jessica Shapiro by Matthew Stevens The risk of Commonwealth regulatory intervention in the proposed $6 billion privatisation of the Port of Melbourne sits alive and kicking despite the settlement confirmed this week between the Victorian government and the father of its waterside complication, DP World.\nDP World has emerged from a cleverly managed but often publicly bitter six-month negotiations with port authorities and then government with a deal that betters anything boss Paul Scurrah could have expected when the demand for a 750 per cent rent rise first hit his desk last Christmas Eve .\nBut DP is only half the competitive framework at the Port of Melbourne. The other incumbent operator is Asciano's Patrick Terminals. And, as much as it might quietly irk Asciano boss John Mullen, he has no choice but to follow the DP World playbook in settling new terms for access at Australia's biggest container port.\nAsciano was due to open discussions on a new Port of Melbourne rental agreement sometime after March next year. But everything says that Asciano needs to bring that schedule forward and it needs to arrive at those negotiations bearing the same regulatory blunderbuss that served Scurrah so well.\nAsciano needs to get itself a great deal like DP World did. Jessica Shapiro Scurrah's weapon of choice was a threat to force Melbourne's port through the trial by ordeal that is declaration under Part III (a) of the Competition and Consumer Act. Success in a process overseen by the National Competition Council would most likely have introduced the ACCC as the port's pricing regulator. But, given the appalling complication of the declaration process, even failure would have generated wild cost and complication for both port authority and privatising government.\nThe perversity here is that Part III (a) is so clumsy and unworkable that the mere threat of its use can force even a state government to collapse in contrition. When governments talk about a win-win deal, you know they have lost the argument. And that means that they will lose it again when Asciano comes shopping for a new deal and again when the sale of the 50-year port lease fails to generate the level of interest or income that had once been anticipated.\nFrom what we hear, Asciano might arrive at its discussions even more heavily armed than DP. Because there are options open to Asciano outside of the Byzantine NCC process and both involve the pointed exercise of Commonwealth powers with the aim of forcing the introduction of the ACCC as the port's pricing regulator.\nThat the Victorian government does not like that idea one little bit has been made explicit given that the port's privatisation legislation is shaped to specifically preclude ACCC oversight.\n The importance of this negotiation to Asciano cannot be overestimated.\nThe successful introduction of new technology and the subsequent hard IR yards have left it the low-cost operator in Brisbane and Sydney. Surrendering that advantage to a higher Melbourne cost base would risk making that success partially pyrrhic.\nThat matters more now than at any time in Asciano's slightly chequered history because it is currently the target of maybe $9 billion of takeover interest from Canada's infrastructure Pac-Men at Brookfield Infrastructure Group.\nScurrah's hot little deal provides rare certainty and security over a 50-year term and the price deck it locks in starts at a point far lower than anyone in the industry imagined was possible. Why am I so certain of that? Well, only because one of the prerequisites for the tenders in the 2013 auction of the Port of Melbourne's third container franchise was that rent had to start at a level at least double the legacy levels.\nTo give you some idea of that that meant, the one of the underbidders for the third terminal was offering an opening rent of something like $34 a square metre and ITSCI of the Philippines carried the day in the auction by offering to pay $120 a square metre.\nScurrah's deal starts at $16 a square metre with annual incremental increases to be set by CPI. According to DP's formula, it will be paying something more than $40 a square metre by 2023. It is suggested that when DP's deal terms out in 2065, it will still not be paying what ITSCI is slated to be paying when it begins working its share of Melbourne's Webb Dock.\nAs far as we can divine, the Scurrah deal and the near certainty that Asciano will extract matching terms at a point before privatisation leaves ITSCI in a very tough place indeed. If the terms of its successful tender hold, then the Melbourne venture simply has to go broke. Why? Because operators generally pass the cost of terminal rent straight through to the customer. So if ITSCI follows the industry model, the cost of rent will render its service charges utterly uncompetitive.\nThere is very informed speculation that, even before Scurrah got his deal, ITSCI had approached the government begging for a new discussion on the terms of its deal. But we hear they were back with a vengeance on Tuesday demanding the same terms of DP's win-win.\nBut, barring any pre-existing agreements or assurances from government on the potential that whatever ITSCI bid would flow through as the new base for the legacy operators, any current or future ITSCI entreaties should be firmly resisted.\nGiven my confidence that DP's deal will set the terms of Asciano's, then we are left now with only a couple of questions unanswered.\nFirst, does ITSCI move ahead with its new terminal or does it tear up the contract and free the government to run a new tender for Webb Dock. More immediately, we wonder how is it that Port of Melbourne boss Nick Easy, still has a job. He was warned by everyone in the industry that an attempt to inflict the ITSCI rents on existing operators would end in tears. But still the port authority overplayed its hand massively and lost.\nFortescue endgame? In deflecting speculation that it was near delivery on the sale of rail and port infrastructure, Fortescue Metals Group has confirmed it is in discussions to introduce an investment partner in one or both of its mining hubs.\nHaving watched its share price climb more than 9 per cent at one point in energetic trading on Wednesday, Fortescue released a statement that noted speculation of Chinese interest in its rail and port infrastructure and then went on to say it was open to \"commercial discussions\" with a \"range of groups\" over investments at a \"mining asset\" level.\nSelling chunks of mines to customers makes a whole lot more sense to me than introducing financial partners to infrastructure at a time when you are trying to sustain competitiveness by driving down costs. Sharing ownership of trains and ports would, surely, only add to the cost of the service. I mean, that service would have to be paid for in real money rather than an accounting transaction and the cost of the service would include a profit for the new investor.\nAt one level then, the implications of an investor at the mine level are less onerous and risky. The partner would simply share in whatever profit can be extracted from the sale of the ore. There would be no risk of adding to the cost base.\nThere might though be other complications. It was reported by Bloomberg that Fortescue has been approached by Hebei Iron & Steel and Tewoo. Hebei is China's biggest steel maker and Tewoo, among other things, is a big trader of steel. But both are big boys in China Inc and it is seriously hard to believe that either or both would sit comfortable with investment at an asset level without ownership enough of the head stock to justify a seat on the board.\nThis might create two dilemmas. First, where does that stock come from given that it is unlikely that 33 per cent owner and chairman, Andrew Forrest, might invite the level of dilution implied in issuing that level of new equity. And second, how might FIRB receive such a plan given that China Inc, in the form of Hunan Valin Iron & Steel, already owns 15 per cent of Fortescue and holds a board seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:05:11.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
