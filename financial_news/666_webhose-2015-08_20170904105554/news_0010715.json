Supplies to Europe and other countries fell 6.5 percent to 80.4 billion cubic metres in the first six months of the year. \nThe company is facing stiff competition at home from other gas producers such as Rosneft and Novatek, while its production is set to hit a new all-time low this year. \nGazprom also said its second-quarter earnings rose 29 percent to 293.79 billion roubles, beating an average forecast of 260.6 billion from analysts polled by Reuters. \nThe company, restricted from borrowing by Western sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis, said it raised a $1.5 billion five-year loan from a bank consortium at Libor plus 3.5 percent. \n($1 = 64.4710 roubles)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:21:05.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
