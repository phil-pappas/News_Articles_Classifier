QIC acquired the approximately 970,000 square foot shopping center for a purchase price of US$174.4 million on behalf of a major Australian client. \nThe acquisition, which represents QIC's first 100 percent owned U.S. property, further cements the firm's U.S. platform, and is a natural next step from QIC's two-year U.S. real estate joint venture with Forest City Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE:FCE.A and FCE.B) of eight, high-quality retail assets. QIC is a global diversified alternatives investment firm offering real estate, infrastructure, private equity, liquid strategies and multi-asset investments, and one of Australia's largest institutional investment managers. \nThe Shops at Tanforan is the tenth U.S. retail property QIC has invested into on behalf of its Australian clients over the last 18 months. Earlier this year, QIC assisted AustralianSuper – one of Australia's largest pension funds – to acquire a 25 percent stake in Honolulu's Ala Moana Centre for approximately US$1.1 billion. \nThe Shops at Tanforan is located in San Bruno, 13 miles south of San Francisco, in an area where Google, Apple, Facebook and other tech companies are located. The Shops have excellent accessibility and exposure by the El Camino Real and nearby Interstates 101 (Bayshore Freeway) and 280 (Junipero Serra Freeway). Its anchor tenants include Sears, Target, JC Penney and Century Theatres. \nMatthew Strotton, Head of U.S. Funds and Investments for QIC, said: \"We're delighted to have been able to secure an asset of Tanforan's quality for our client and build on our real estate presence in the United States and in this Northern California market. \n\"The U.S. market is opportunity rich, and the combination of QIC's on-the-ground office in Los Angeles and teams around the world will continue to enable us to source high-quality assets for our clients.\" \nThe Shops at Tanforan were acquired from Breevast B.V., which invests worldwide in commercial and residential real estate and also develops and manages commercial and residential properties, including large-scale portfolios of office buildings, business premises, shopping malls and homes. \nBreevast U.S. CEO Terry Crowley said, \"We're delighted to have achieved this transaction with QIC and look forward to developing our relationship with them in other potential areas.\" \nSteven Leigh, Managing Director – Global Real Estate for QIC, said: \"QIC's U.S. real estate strategy is based on three complementary components: Working with AustralianSuper to secure exposures to very high quality dominant malls such as Ala Moana; Our joint venture with Forest City, which gives clients access to a portfolio of regional retail assets; and 100 percent QIC-owned assets like The Shops at Tanforan, which we intend to add more of in the future. \n\"The scope of our global activities allows us to deploy the full range of our sourcing, execution and management capabilities in bespoke ways for clients,\" Leigh concluded.
