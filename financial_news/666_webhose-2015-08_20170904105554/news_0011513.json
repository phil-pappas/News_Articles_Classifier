Buffett eventually walked away with nearly a half-billion from that deal.* Bought $3 billion in GE (GE) stock, which more than tripled in price since 2009. I guess he saw a future in jet engines, power turbines and medical equipment.All told, Buffett cleared at least $10 billion from investing during the last financial crisis.I'm not suggesting you go out and buy the stocks he bought -- he got great deals with preferred shares and fat dividends -- just go out and find consistently profitable companies.The big theme for Buffett's epic soundtrack: Buy quality companies at a discount and ignore the noise. What You Can Do Now There's no reason to think that the most-profitable, dividen-paying companies in the U.S. will go away after the recent sell-off.The U.S. economy is still pretty stable. And with lower energy prices and rock-bottom interest rates, that's still a formula for modest growth.When the cost of doing business goes down, that's also a good catalyst for job creation, home sales and improved salaries.But you needn't trouble yourself with identifying individual bargain companies.I would start with the old-line corporations that are consistently making money and paying healthy dividends.To find them bundled up in one place, you should turn to exchange-traded funds.The ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), holds some of the highest dividend payers in the U.S.Featuring a nearly 2% yield, it holds lesser-known companies like Pentair PLC and Leggett and Platt Inc., which have been quietly and consistently profitable.The companies in the ProShares fund are also picked for their record of growing dividends, so their payouts increase over time.If you want to cast a wider, global net for the best dividend payers, consider the PowerShares International Dividend Achievers ETF (PID).This fund yields more than 3% and holds major international players such as GlaxoSmithKline PLC.Of course, no bargain-hunting strategy would be complete without an overall plan.To take advantage of a market swoon, you need to be buying on a regular basis, preferably through stock index funds in your 401(k) or other retirement plans.Don't wait for the market to \"return to normal\" or \"until it's safe.\" No one ever knows when those moments occur in real time.And certainly don't pull out all of your money from stocks and invest in cash, which is earning close to nothing now. That way you'd lock in losses and miss buying opportunities.Just like after-holiday sales, stocks are much the same thing.You don't want to be buying when others are flooding the stores. You'll get much better deals when the aisles are empty.[brightcove videoID=4445636905001]", "external_links": ["http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/ARCX/NOBL/quote.html", "http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/ARCX/PID/quote.html", "http://theweek.com/articles/459166/how-warren-buffett-made-10-billion-during-financial-crisis"], "published": "2015-08-27T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T02:12:51.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
