Frankfurt and Paris were down by 2.0 percent. \n- 'Problems in the coming years' - \nGreece won the final green light on Wednesday to start repaying its debts and reviving its crippled economy after eurozone finance ministers formally approved the loans-for-reforms package. \nThe bailout includes more pain in the form of tax hikes, as well as a pensions overhaul and privatisations the government had previously opposed. Many Greeks viewed it as a humiliating climbdown. \nThe all-clear to unblock a first payment of 23 billion euros came once the bailout was approved by European parliaments, including Germany's Bundestag. \n\"This agreement provides perspective for the Greek economy and a basis for sustainable growth,\" said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the so-called Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers. \n\"We are certain to encounter problems in the coming years but I trust we will be able to tackle them,\" he added. \nThe decision unlocked 13 billion euros for Athens and set aside another 10 billion euros to recapitalise the country's cash-starved banks. \n- Merkel's 'cowardly performance' - \nLast week, the eurozone's finance ministers approved in principle the bailout to keep Greece in the single currency bloc and pay its bills. \nThe German parliament voted by an overwhelming majority on Wednesday to back the bailout, with Chancellor Angela Merkel spared her own rebellion of deputies opposing the aid. \nBut Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper ran an unforgiving headline denouncing \"Merkel's cowardly performance\" after she remained silent during the parliamentary debate. \nBut it celebrated the 67 lawmakers in her coalition who voted against the bailout, dubbing them the \"righteous ones\". \nTsipras, 41, rode to power in January on a wave of popular anger against the tax hikes, spending cuts and reforms demanded by creditors in exchange for the two previous bailouts costing 240 billion euros. \nHe has said that Greece's creditors -- the European Union, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and the European Stability Mechanism -- have agreed to discuss public debt relief measures when a first assessment of reform compliance is completed in November. \nGreece's debt currently stands at a towering 312.8 billion euros, the finance ministry said Wednesday, a level the IMF said is unsustainable and requires immediate relief.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T21:50:33.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
