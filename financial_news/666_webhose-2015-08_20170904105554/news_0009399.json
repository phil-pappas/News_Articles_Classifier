More Graduates overpay student loans by £45m \nThe Law Society, a professional body for solicitors, has warned that the government’s plans to rebalance the costs of the judicial system threaten not only to undermine the principle of universal access to independent rulings, but also to tip the balance of power in disputes towards the tax authority. \n“The government is effectively selling justice by saying that you need to pay for the courts,” said Jonathan Smithers, the Law Society’s president. \n“To fight charges levied by one branch of government, you would have to pay another division of government . . . It leads to a feeling there’s a fairly heavy-handed state.” \nTaxpayers can appeal to the first-tier tribunal , which is independent of government, when they dispute internal rulings made by HMRC. \nIt is currently free to apply for a tribunal hearing, but Paul Aplin, chairman of the ICAEW tax faculty technical committee, said it is usually “a last resort” for taxpayers. \n“Tribunals serve a vital function in preventing HMRC from acting as both judge and jury,” said Mr Aplin. “They are particularly important when the question is whether the taxpayer has taken reasonable care or has a reasonable excuse, and they often find in their favour.” \nThe Ministry of Justice, which is consulting on its proposals, has suggested fees of between £50 and £200 for referring cases to the first-tier tax tribunal, with hearing fees to range from £200 to £1,000 depending on their complexity. Appeals to the upper tribunal would incur an initial fee of £100, plus up to £2,000 for a hearing. \nMichael Avient, personal tax partner at accountants UHY Hacker Young, said that although the proposed fees are relatively low, they should be opposed. \n“You’re now going to be charged to take an appeal [against the Revenue] to court where you think you’re right,” said Mr Avient. “The costs may not initially be that great but, as we know, once introduced they are likely to rise.” \nChas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said it is wrong to think that only wealthy taxpayers taking on the Revenue will be affected. \nWhere the amount of disputed money is very low, the introduction of fees may dissuade individuals from challenging the authority, he said. “It is putting up a cost barrier for those who could have only made an arbitrary mistake.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:22:45.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
