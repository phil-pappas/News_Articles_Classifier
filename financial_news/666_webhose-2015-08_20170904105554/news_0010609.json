After two consecutive quarters of negative growth, officials said the economy was formally in recession. \nContinue reading \nBrazil’s economy has been beset by a series of interlinking problems that show few signs of abating. \nCorruption scandals at state-owned companies, most notably oil company Petrobras, have hit investment. Rising inflation has prompted high interest rates that are affecting consumer demand. And the government’s low popularity has limited its ability to bring the budget deficit under control, which officials believe is necessary to begin a new cycle of growth. \nThe uncertainty about the fate of the economy in China — a vital customer for Brazilian commodity exports — has only added to the poor outlook for Brazil in the coming months. More Rousseff battles sense of crisis in Brazil \n“This is a shocking report,” said Neil Shearing, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. “The driver was a complete collapse in domestic demand.” \nWith unemployment also rising sharply in recent months, household spending dropped 2.1 per cent from the previous quarter, while fixed investment fell 8.1 per cent — an indication of the fallout from the scandal at Petrobras, the country’s biggest industrial company, which has also involved many of Brazil’s biggest construction companies. \nThe second-quarter growth figure was the second worst since 1998, capped only by the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. \nThe GDP figures ended a week of bleak economic news from Brazil . A separate government survey revealed on Wednesday that unemployment reached 8.3 per cent in the second quarter, up from 6.8 per cent a year before, while in July alone the fiscal accounts showed a deficit of R$7.2bn (US$2bn). \nWhen interest payments are excluded, Brazil has so far this year recorded a budget deficit of 0.27 per cent of GDP — the first time the figure has been in deficit since the government began publishing the statistic in 1997. \nAmid such a wave of pessimistic news, the government’s efforts to rein in public spending are facing strong resistance. The latest proposal, a leaked plan to reinstate a tax on financial transactions, was sharply criticised this week by leading politicians. Renan Calheiros, the president of the Senate, called it a “shot in the foot”. \nPaulo Skaf, head of the influential São Paulo industrial federation, said on Thursday that finance minister Joaquim Levy should resign because of his efforts at new austerity measures. “A minister who only talks about raising taxes . . . Brazil does not need such a minister,” he told reporters.
