We're seeing lots of numbers showing signs of positive reaction.\" \nThe strong US economic figures also added momentum to a global stock market rally that lifted bourses that have lost trillions of dollars in value in a rout over the last week or so. \nAnalysts said the oil contract also benefited from technical factors after recent trades left the commodity in an \"oversold\" state and lingering below the psychologically important $40 a barrel level. \n\"Buyers who had backed off from trying to catch the prior dynamic decline are now stepping back in,\" said Tim Evans, analyst at Citi Futures, who described the dynamic as a long-awaited technical correction to the upside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T22:26:34.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
