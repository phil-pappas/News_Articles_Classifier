After co-founding Misfit wearables back in 2011, Sculley is back with a new venture, this time around a brand new smartphone company which goes by the name Obi Worldphone. Given the immense competition in the smartphone industry, with leaders like Samsung struggling, Obi WorldPhone aims to distinguish itself from other manufacturers. \nThe market is already flooded with established manufacturers as well as new comers, but Obi Worldphone will particularly concentrate on the affordable segment. Although the global market may not have heard of the name Obi before, the company has already completed a test phase last year. Obi operated in United Arab Emirates and according to the company, it has climbed to 5 percent market share right now in the region. \nObi Worldphone has paid special attention to the design and components used in its two smartphones, Obi SF1 and Obi SJ1.5. Sculley says that the company wants to distinguish itself from mainstream players with its attention to detail and no compromise attitude. The company wants customer to experience better components than what customers are used to. The design has to be its most distinguishing feature. \nSpecs wise too, both the handsets offer much more in value than mainstream players like Samsung. The Obi Worldphone SF1, which costs just $200 features a 5-inch FHD 1080p display with Snapdragon 615 octa-core chip underneath. There are 2GB / 3GB RAM and 16GB / 32GB storage variants with a MicroSD card slot too. The higher-end version will cost $259. At the back, there will be a 13MP camera with LED flash and up front, there’s a 5MP shooter. The phone supports 4G LTE and dual SIM dual standby. As for battery there’s a generous 3000mAh under the hood. Finally, the phone runs on its LifeSpeed UI based on Android 5.1 OS. \nNext up is the Obi Worldphone SJ1.5. This particular device will cost just $129 but offers a 5-inch 720p display, Mediatek MT6580 quad-core chip clocked at 1.3GHz, 1GB RAM and 16GB of expandable storage. At the back, there will be an 8MP camera while up front there’s a 5MP shooter. Even the SJ1.5 will feature a large 3000mAh battery. This is a 3G only device with dual SIM support and runs on Android 5.1. \nIn spite of being a Silicon Valley startup, the company has not announced any plans for a US release. Instead, Obi Worldphone will focus on developing markets such as UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa, Pakistan, Turkey and India.
