The index from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) climbed 0.5% month-on-month in July, reversing the previous month's decline and climbing 7.3% year-on-year. \nBoth figures, however, were below the 1.0% month-on-month gain and the 8.4% increase on a yearly basis analysts had expected. \nLawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR, said existing sales were expected to maintain their recent rate of growth, adding NAR forecast a 7.1% gain for 2015 existing home sales to 5.29m homes and the median price to increase by 6.3%. \n\"We are inclined to interpret the softness at the start of the quarter as payback after a strong performance at the beginning of 2015 and expect the housing market to remain in recovery mode,\" analysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said in a note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:50:31.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
