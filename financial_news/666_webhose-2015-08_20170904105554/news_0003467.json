On Friday the United States added Gazprom's Yuzhno-Kirinskoye oil and gas field to its sanctions list against the Russian energy sector. \nYuzhno-Kirinskoye was seen as key to expansion of the Gazprom-led Sakhalin-2 LNG plant, co-developed with Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , Japan Mitsui and Mitsubishi Corp . \nGazprom also said on Monday that it borrowed $760 million and 240 million euros ($263.1 million) from Sberbank last month, plus a further $310 million from Gazprombank, without elaborating on the purpose of the loans.
