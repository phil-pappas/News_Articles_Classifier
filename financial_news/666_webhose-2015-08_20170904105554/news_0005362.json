It filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to find out what had caused the CFTC to delay its decision.\nThe latest letter again accused the CFTC of overstepping its authority in attempting to regulate a foreign exchange as it privately pushed for the LME to introduce reforms, including a cap on rents at warehouses.\n\"If the Commission would like to examine the performance of the LME aluminum contract, Alcoa requests that the Commission establish a fair, inclusive and open process for doing so,\" Laun wrote in the letter.\nLaun also asked to schedule a meeting between Massad and Alcoa Chief Financial Bill Oplinger later this month.\nThe letter added that Alcoa had \"not yet received a response\" to its FOIA request.\nA CFTC spokesman confirmed the agency had received Alcoa's letter, but declined to comment.\nThe move illustrates the deepening concerns among aluminum producers about the impact of the LME rule changes on prices, which have plunged close to or below breakeven for a large portion of global smelters.\nThe disagreement comes after the LME implemented reforms that increased the rate at which metal must be delivered out of warehouses, a response to years-long queues and financing deals that drew intense regulatory and legislative scrutiny.\nAluminum has flooded the market partly as a result of the new rules, and LME aluminum futures prices and the premiums customers pay on top of them for physical delivery AL-PREM have tumbled this year, hobbling producers like Alcoa and Rusal.
