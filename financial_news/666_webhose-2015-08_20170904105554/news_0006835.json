AMP lifted its interim dividend 1.5 cents to 14 cents per share. \"The continuing delivery of our strategy to be a more customer driven organisation and our business efficiency programs are on track,\" chief executive officer Craig Meller said. Profit at AMP's Australian wealth management division increased 13.1 per cent but the company said it is still implementing a package of measures to improve the quality of its financial advice. It has piloted \"a new approach to advice ... with encouraging results\" in five locations. \"AMP continues to invest in service, platforms and digital capability to improve adviser quality and productivity,\" AMP said. The financial planning industry has been under huge pressure after victims of dodgy financial advice from major institutions lost millions of dollars in savings. The big banks have paid millions of dollars to those who suffered as a result of poor advice, while Commonwealth Bank, NAB, ANZ and Macquarie all faced a Senate committee to explain their efforts to look after those who lost out. AMP AMPS UP PROFIT * Net profit up 33pct to $507m * Cashflows up 11pct to $1.9b * Interim dividend up 1.5 cents to 14 cents per share.
