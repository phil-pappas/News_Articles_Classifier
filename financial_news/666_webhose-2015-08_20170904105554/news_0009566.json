TPMS warns the driver about the number of underinflated tires. TPMS is classified into two categories: direct TPMS and indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS provides real-time information of the tire pressure using pressure monitoring sensors in the tires. As a result automotive manufacturers are shifting their focus on the usage of direct TPMS sensors to improve the safety of the consumers.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global TPMS market to grow at a CAGR of 15.71% during 2014-2019.\nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nCommenting on the report an analyst from Technavio’s team said: “The automotive sector in emerging markets such as India China and Mexico is growing at a steady rate which in turn is increasing the demand for safety systems as well. The constant improvement of the economic conditions in emerging markets has improved the financial status of consumers. This is why they are able now to spend more on safety features such as TPMS ABS and ESC. For instance China is increasing its focus on the safety applications for automobiles and emission-related issues. China's usage of automotive MEMS sensors is expected to increase more in the coming years as the country is increasing the deployment of TPMS in vehicles.”\nAccording to the report governments across the globe are promoting the usage of TPMS in automobiles. The growing concerns about passenger safety have compelled automobile manufacturers to implement various driver assistance systems. Advanced safety systems such as TPMS combined with ABS help to minimize accidents reduce fatalities and improve overall vehicle safety. Consequently governments of countries in Europe the Americas and APAC have started implementing stringent safety regulations regarding the development and sales of these systems.\nFurther the report states that functional errors because of the failure of electronic sensors the usage of defective sensors and battery failure result in the failure of TPMS resulting in accidents.\nThe key players in the Global Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) Market are Continental Pacific Industrial and Schrader Electronics while other prominent vendors include Advantage PressurePro Enterprises ALLIGATOR Ventilfabrik Alps Electric Bartec USA Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems Bosch (Bosch Automotive Technology) Delphi Automotive Dill Air Control Products Doran Manufacturing Freescale Semiconductor Hella Ireland Huf Electronics Bretten Infineon Technologies Johnson Controls Murata Electronics Oy NIRA Dynamics Orange Electronic North America Silicon Microstructures Standard Motor Products Transense Technologies Valor TPMS and ZF TRW\nThe study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
