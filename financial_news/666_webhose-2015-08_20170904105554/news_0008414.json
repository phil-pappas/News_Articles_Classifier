This announcement followed years of delays. When Sir Richard Branson founded the company in 2004, he claimed that the first launch would take place by 2009. \n“It’ll be ready when it’s ready,” Mr Whitesides said . “We’re communicating with our customers about progress in terms of milestones as they happen.” \nA number of academics and research institutions plan to conduct experiments on board, including Dr Rob Ferl from the University of Florida, an expert in the field of space biology. \nHe admitted the ongoing doubt over the launch date was a “problem”. “In the academic science setting we have to move quickly through our projects to educate our students and meet the goals of our research grants,” he said. \nHe added he remained “supportive” of Virgin Galactic. \nWhitesides, a former NASA chief of staff became a customer of Virgin Galactic in 2005, five years before he joined the company, buying tickets for himself and his wife. “I identify with our customer base,” he said. “Many of them view themselves not as customers but as people enabling the thing that will change the world.” \nThe new SpaceShipTwo will be ready to test by the end of the year, Virgin Galactic said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T19:53:20.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
