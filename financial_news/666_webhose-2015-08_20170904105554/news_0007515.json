The new introduction of Xtractor is a complement of functionality to the existing ActivePDF product suite. The Xtractor tool delivers the functionality to easily automate within existing workflow environments. This provides the ability to import hundreds or thousands of PDF documents to extract key information that can be used in categorizing or indexing documents for archiving, classification and more. The process categorizes information such as metadata, barcodes, or keywords that is then used to control printing, sorting, or packaging.\n“The vision of our customers use cases and a clear understanding of their business needs drives ActivePDF to respond with a solid quality product such as Xtractor.” said Jay Schlarb, Chief Operation Officer, ActivePDF. “The Xtractor functionality enhances business processes where our flagship product, ActivePDF Toolkit has been helping clients in driving the digital business for over 15+ years.”\nXtractor is a versatile server-based tool for locating and extracting text and images from PDF files.
