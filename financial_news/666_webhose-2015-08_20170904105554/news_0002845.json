Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith Behind all the noise around the latest monster bank capital raising, are growing signs that the era of spectacular bank earnings growth is coming to a close.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia has reported another record full-year profit , with cash earnings climbing 5 per cent to $9.14 billion. But earnings at all of the bank's major divisions slowed in the second half.\nAnalysts are also questioning the bank's ability to fund future capital requirements at the current dividend payout ratio given the slowdown in organic growth. \"Something, it seems to me, has to give,\" Credit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin told CBA chief Ian Narev on the bank's results conference call.\nCBA's coveted dividend payout ratio is unaffected by the $5 billion capital raising announced on Wednesday and investors want it to stay that way. But all the banks are being coy on how much they might have to raise and how this will affect dividends.\nCBA's latest results and the capital raising is no reason to avoid the banks, which still offer value at current trading prices. But it is now clear the dream run is over and it will be harder to maintain the earnings momentum of the last four years.\nNotably, CBA is no longer reporting higher income growth than cost growth. This is known as \"negative jaws\" in the industry and something that CBA, the country's biggest mortgage lender, usually avoids.\nThe bank's \"jaws\" were flat for the year ended June 30 with operating income up 5 per cent, matching a 5 per cent lift in expenses. But the measure was negative in the second half when revenue edged up only 1 per cent compared with a 3 per cent lift in expenses.\nUnprecedented competition This is worrying as the bank faces unprecedented competition for home loans in a low-interest rate environment.\nCBA's cash earnings fell 2 per cent to $4.5 billion in the second half compared with $4.6 billion in the six months to December 31. Earnings in the retail banking division fell 6 per cent in this period, 4 per cent for business banking, 6 per cent for institutional banking and 13 per cent for wealth management.\nCBA executives spent a lot of time explaining why the weaker performance for all its major divisions in the second half of the year should not be taken as a sign that momentum is slowing. There were three fewer trading days in that period compared with the first half and it also had to absorb some one-off costs around currency and regulatory changes.\nBut margins in the second half was also impacted by mortgage repricing, given the stiff competition for home loans in a low-interest rate environment. CBA raised mortgage rates in May and for investor loans in July.\nWhile discounts and promotions for investor loans are drying up, the conditions for owner-occupier loans are being sweetened. \"It is reasonable to anticipate high levels of competition in owner-occupied,\" Matt Comyn, CBA's head of retail banking, says.\nHome loans balances rose 6 per cent on the year to $423 billion, from $400 billion for the year. But growth in retail banking and Bankwest was slightly below system growth because of the competitive market.\nThe result itself was overshadowed by CBA's $5 billion capital raising, a move that had been widely expected since ANZ rattled the markets with a $3 billion raising last week.\nThe four major banks will have raised a combined $15.5 billion to shore up their balance sheets in the wake of unprecedented regulatory pressure. It is funding few bank executives believe they really need but they have little choice.\nCBA is now back in pole position with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 10.4 per cent, compared with 9.2 per cent in June. The additional cover will cover changes to the risk weights for mortgages to fall into line with regulatory changes both in Australia and globally.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-08-12T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:08:52.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
