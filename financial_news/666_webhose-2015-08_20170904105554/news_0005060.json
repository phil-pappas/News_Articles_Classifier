Then Wells Fargo. Then another. Denied. Denied. Denied.\nNo, I don't feel entitled to a loan and the banks have every right not to lend me money. But my tale of woe tells a broader tale of what is going on in the lending industry these days.\nAll the bankers told me the same thing: \"Steve, if you'd walked in our bank eight years ago with this mortgage application, we would have rubber stamped it in five minutes and you would have walked out with a bag of money.\"\nBut those were the go-go days of the real estate frenzy when people who worked at McDonald's could walk into a Countrywide and get a $600,000 mortgage. Back then underwriting standards were tossed out the window.\nNow, thanks in part to new federal regulations like Dodd Frank with its anti-predatory lending rules, the pendulum has swung to the other extreme and underwriting standards (for those without federal insurance) are absurdly tight.\nHere we are with the lowest interest rates in 50 years but many businesses and aspiring homeowners can't qualify. It's like the old adage: \"water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink.\"\nM‎y situation was doubly frustrating because I'm making a 25 percent downpayment on the house.\nResearchers have examined huge samples of the portfolio of defaulted loans during the 2007-2009 housing crisis. Virtually all of the defaulted loans had low downpayment. Many were less than 5 percent down, thanks to government \"affordable housing\" mandates.\nAlmost no loans with 25 percent downpayment went into default because it's simple economics: if you've paid for 25 percent of the house and you suddenly can't make your mortgage payment, you sell the house or refinance the loan. You don't walk away from your equity stake.\nThe main reason I was denied a loan was because of a below average credit score. This was infuriating on several levels. First, I have had two previous mortgages and in 25 years I've never missed a payment. How can I be a high risk borrower?\nThe answer is twice in 30 years I was 30 days late paying my credit card bill - and paid the hefty late fee. And even more ridiculous: I, Steve Moore, have $300 of unpaid parking tickets.\nThe horror. How does that data point provide any useful information to a bank of whether I'm going to pay my mortgage?\nWhy in the world does any financial institution ‎put any credence in credit rating agencies today?\nThey were the most derelict institutions of all during the housing meltdown. These were the buffoons who were giving triple \"A\" credit ratings to mortgage-backed securities only weeks before the whole house of cards collapsed. They were the ones who ignored every warning of the subprime overload. They were the ones who gave Enron, Countrywide, Bear Stearns, and others a clean bill of health right before these institutions famously crashed. But banks still listen to their advice on which homeowners are likely to pay off their loans?\nBut here is why I really want to pull my hair out.\nWhile I'm making a 25 percent downpayment, the government insurance underwriters - the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac - are backing with taxpayer dollars hundreds of thousands of low downpayment loans of as little as 3 percent. These are the loans that will likely default. And taxpayers are on the hook for hundreds of billions of more loans.\nUncle Sam is repeating every mistake it made just eight years ago. The figure shows that a record number of new mortgages are backed by the feds. Almost two-thirds have direct federal backing and about 90 percent have some form of federal insurance. This is the definition of insanity.\nEdward Pinto, a housing expert at the American Enterprise Institute, notes in a new study that through Fannie, Freddie, and FHA, government is relying on \"looser and looser mortgage lending standards in a misguided effort to promote broader home ownership and accomplish wealth accumulation, particularly for low-income households.\"\nHe shows that in 2013 ‎\"low-income households (those in the 20th to 40th percentile of the income distribution) had a median net worth of only $22,400 in 2013.\"\nThese are the people the government is forcing banks to make loans to.\nSo while my tax dollars are backing thousands and thousands of loans likely to default, my loan with close to zero probability of default can't get financed - because I'm upper middle class. This is considered fairness.\nOnly in America.\nStephen Moore is a CBN economics contributor and an economist at the Heritage Foundation .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T19:08:50.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
