After taking a moment to view their advertising campaign, the appeal is both obvious and irresistible. I MUST HIRE THEM.\nThe most institutionally corrupt organization south of the New England Patriots, the Memphis-based string of tax preparation shops continues to find itself in the news for all the wrong reasons, with franchise owners having a nasty habit of winding up in court or prison.\nThe troubles began in 2012, when the IRS raided franchise headquarters shortly before owner Jimi Clark was arrested in St. Louis along with four employees and charged with falsely claiming education credits on 47 returns filed in 2009. The total loss to the US tax coffers on those 47 returns exceeded $350,000, which apparently went directly into the pockets of Clark and other Mo’ Money employees, because they certainly didn’t wind up in the hands of the paying customers, who complained of either receiving less-than-promised refund checks or of being told their refund checks “could not be cashed.” Clark would plead guilty to conspiracy to commit tax fraud and aiding and abetting the preparation of false tax returns in 2013, and was sentenced to 20 months in prison.\nAlso in 2013, the Justice Department brought a civil injunction against store owners Markey Granberry, Derek Robinson, and Eumora Reese, alleging that the false refund claims exceeded $9 million . The suit alleged that Granberry, Robinson and Reese encouraged Mo’ Money Taxes preparers to “falsely claim the earned-income credit; claim improper filing status; claim bogus education credits, improperly prepare returns using paystubs rather than employer-issued W-2 forms; fabricate bogus W-2 forms; file tax returns without customers’ consent; sell false and deceptive loan products; and charge deceptive and unconscionable fees.”\nIn 2014, Shandon Allen, Tabitha Tunstall, and Shewanda Williams, former Mo’ Money franchise owners who changed the business name to Southern King Taxes in 2012, were barred from continuing to file tax returns by a federal court in Memphis.\nAnd just yesterday, Mo’ Money found itself in the news once again, and surprisingly not to laud the company’s reformed business practices. Instead, three location owners — Erik Pittman, Jeremy Blanchard, and Corey Taylor — were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and aiding in the preparation of 19 false and fraudulent individual tax returns. If convicted, Pittman could face a maximum penalty of 23 years in prison; Blanchard 29 years; and Taylor 20 years.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/tuF1MkrCMSI"], "published": "2015-08-06T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:19:27.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
