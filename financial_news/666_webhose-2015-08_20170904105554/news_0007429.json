The trade-weighted index increased to 71.06 from 70.95.\nThe US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, dropped after the release of the minutes, which cited concerns about weak wage inflation and oil prices. Futures show traders pared back their expectations the Fed will raise rates at its September meeting to about a 38 per cent chance, down from about 50 per cent earlier in the day, according to Bloomberg. \"There was no smoking gun for a September lift off in those minutes,\" said BNZ currency strategist Raiko Shareef. \"Those factors are now biasing the Fed to delay rather than raise at our forecast of September. We will stick with September for now, but certainly the risks have shifted towards a later start.\" In New Zealand, the ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence survey is scheduled for release. The New Zealand dollar advanced to 89.82 Australian cents from 89.75 cents, increased to 42.11 British pence from 41.98 pence, slipped to 59.37 euro cents from 59.54 cents, edged lower to 81.76 yen from 81.80 yen, and gained to 4.2262 yuan from 4.2096 yuan.
