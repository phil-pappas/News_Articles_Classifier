She is recognized with this prestigious distinction for leadership in business. NAPW is the nation’s leading networking organization exclusively for professional women, boasting more than 700,000 members and over 200 operating Local Chapters. “I’m pleased to recognize Victoria with this important honor,” said NAPW President Star Jones. “Her perseverance, work ethic and leadership qualities are an inspiration to all women.”\nWith a passion for helping people and animals, Victoria Vojdani is determined to assist those who are in fear, pain and suffering. For years, she would counsel and console people around her, without realizing that later on she would build a career from her passion to help others. She is now the Owner and a Reconnective Healing Practitioner in Maui, HI, at Universal Healing, LLC.\nMs. Vojdani was previously a Real Estate Agent in Las Vegas, NV, and was devastated when the real estate market declined. Many people around her were losing their jobs and homes and on many occasions she would try to support and heal their grief. At this turning point, Ms. Vojdani began reading books about spirituality, psychic abilities, healing modalities, etc.\nSome years later, she came across a book Reconnective Healing and was immediately inspired. She wanted to heal as many people and animals as possible. Ms. Vojdani began the healing process in Arizona, performing on horses, bulls, goats, birds and even tortoises. Seeing their immediate reaction, she then began to perform healings on people. After a year of practicing, in 2011 she opened an office in Las Vegas, NV, where she had a space for her sessions with her clients. In 2013, Ms. Vojdani decided to relocate her office and move back to Maui, HI.\n“The more sessions I provide, the more I am amazed at how I can help the people and animals around me. I wish I had come to this realization in my youth but it is never too late to find yourself. The most rewarding part of my work is seeing people feel better,” she said. Ms. Vojdani enjoys that each healing is unique in itself. The most challenging part is that most people do not understand or are not aware of alternative forms of healing. Therefore, her goals are to continue building her clients and expand her office to provide healing for people and animals in one place.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYXB3LmNvbS91c2Vycy92aWN0b3JpYS12b2pkYW5p", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbG9oYWhlYWxlci5jb20=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYXB3LmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T08:20:50.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
