We'll still see a focus on individual earnings results,\" Yutaka Miura, a technical analyst at Mizuho Securities, told Bloomberg News. \nThe Bank of Japan began a two-day meeting Thursday, with all eyes on signs of when policymakers may launch further easing measures. \nElsewhere, Seoul lost 0.81 percent, or 16.47 points, dragged down by technology firms and mobile carriers, to 2,013.29. \nShanghai fell 0.89 percent, or 33.03 points, to close at to 3,661.54, while Hong Kong shed 0.57 percent, or 138.88 points, to 24,375.28. \nSydney slid 1.13 percent to close down 63.9 points at 5,610.10 after taking a hit from a jump in unemployment to 6.3 percent in July and news ANZ Bank will sell Aus$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) of shares. \nAnalysts floated the possibility of an interest rate cut following the spike in joblessness, which came despite a hiring surge. \n\"The market is downplaying stronger jobs growth given the rise in unemployment,\" Kieran Davies, chief economist at Barclays Plc (LSE: BARC.L - news ) in Sydney, told Bloomberg News. \n\"I see a risk of a further rate cut given the Australian dollar still looks overvalued.\" \nAustralia's unemployment rate has edged up over the past year to its highest in almost a decade, while wages growth has been weak and business investment outside the mining sector remains soft. \nAdding to concerns over the economy, mining giant Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) after the bell announced its first-half net profit had fallen 82 percent, hit by a supply glut and waning Chinese demand. \n- Shanghai jitters - \nIn Shanghai, a second day of losses after a recent market rout compounded fears for the Chinese economy. \nThe Shanghai Composite Index has tumbled nearly 30 percent from its highest point in June over fears for the health of the world's second-biggest economy. \nInvestors are still jittery despite a raft of measures from Beijing to prop up the share market, including restrictions on short selling, the suspension of initial public offerings (IPOs) and a trading halt for some companies. \n\"The market needs its own strength to recover,\" Zhang Haidong, chief strategist at Jinkuang Investment Management in Shanghai, told Bloomberg. \n\"The coming economic data don't seem to be good and will add additional pressure,\" he said, referring to export and trade data due out this weekend. \nUS stocks finished mostly higher Wednesday, but a disappointing earnings report from Disney weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Traders are now focusing on Friday's official US employment figures. \nOil prices were mixed as dealers digested an US energy (NasdaqCM: USEG - news ) report showing a big drawdown in crude stockpiles -- but also an increase in domestic production. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 17 cents to $44.98 while Brent crude for September gained nine cents to $49.68. \n\"Crude prices continued to remain weak with focus on oversupply,\" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY. \nIn forex trade, the dollar was near a two-month high against the yen on bets the Fed would hike rates in September. \nThe greenback bought 124.75 yen, against 124.88 yen in New York Wednesday when it briefly crossed the 125 yen level, its highest since early June. \nThe euro stood at $1.0910 and 136.10 yen compared with $1.0904 and 136.18 yen in US trade. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) fetched $1,085.30 an ounce compared with $1,085.72 late Wednesday. \nIn other markets: \n-- Taipei fell 1.09 percent, or 92.71 points, to 8,449.56. \nLeading smartphone camera lens maker Largan Precision plunged by 10.0 percent to Tw$2,720. \n-- Wellington closed down 0.17 percent, or 9.82 points, at 5,928.69. \nContact Energy (NZSE: CEN.NZ - news ) went against the trend, rising 3.16 percent to NZ$5.22, while Fletcher Building (NZSE: FBU.NZ - news ) dropped 0.13 percent to NZ$7.97 \n-- Philippine shares closed 0.95 percent, or 72.60 points lower, to 7,589.95. \nTop-traded Universal Robina (Other OTC: UVRBF - news ) fell 2.50 percent to 195 pesos, SM Prime Holdings lost 0.91 percent to 21.80 pesos while Philippine Long Distance Telephone was down 2.10 percent to 2,800 pesos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T13:33:10.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
