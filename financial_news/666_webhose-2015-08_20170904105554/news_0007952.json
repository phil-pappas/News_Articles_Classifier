Getty Images by Dominic White and John Stensholt Nine Entertainment Co has locked up wholesale free-to-air broadcast rights to the NRL as part of its record $925 million deal with the code.\nIt is a move that could give Nine the option to horse-trade games with incumbent AFL rights holder Seven West Media.\nFairfax Media has learned that Nine's five-year free-to-air and digital contract to screen key NRL games, which stunned rivals when it was unveiled last Monday , is structured to allow the free-to-air broadcaster to on-sell games to rivals if it chooses.\nThe move could ultimately mean that Nine ends up with one or some AFL games in return for selling some NRL games to Seven, or even the struggling Ten Network Holdings.\nNine, which bought the Nine stations in Perth and Adelaide two years ago as part of a deal under which it paid $450 million over five years for cricket rights, could be in the market for rights to live AFL matches featuring the teams from those two cities.\nLive matches, whether home or away, of Port Adelaide and Adelaide, and Fremantle and West Coast, rate extremely well in their home cities and achieve solid figures in Melbourne.\nUnder one possible scenario, Nine could effectively \"exchange\" rights for an NRL game with Seven, which could then take on one of the four Nine has paid for. It is probable Nine would consider the Saturday night game, which is the least-highest-rating of the NRL games it has bought rights for, behind Thursday and Friday evenings and Sunday afternoon leading into the news.\nIn the balance The final make-up of future sports rights for the two big codes still lies in the balance with Seven and News Corp's Fox Sports and Ten expected to move fast in an effort to wrap up negotiations with the AFL in the wake of Nine's pre-emptive strike on the NRL rights.\nWhile Seven is considered favourite to retain its AFL rights – it currently shows four matches live each round, with Foxtel's Fox Footy channel showing all nine live – it might face competition from a combined Ten/Foxtel/News Corp and Fox Sports bid for AFL.\nThough the AFL could also move, as the NRL did, to strike a free-to-air deal before dealing with the remaining broadcast rights, it is considered likely the league will have to negotiate the complete package at the same time, given News Corp will want some involvement after being shut out of the NRL rights bid.\nFox Sports also has to negotiate pay television rights separately with the NRL, while Nine is understood to be receptive to negotiating an early start to its new deal, which does not begin until the 2018 season.\nNine's bumper NRL bid – worth $185 million annually, almost double the amount it is paying now – underlined the growing importance of premium sport to free-to-air broadcasters as they compete for viewers with new digital competitors such as Netflix.\nThe surprise announcement angered executives at Fox Sports and its owner News Corp, which, along with other free-to-air networks, had been unaware of the Nine deal until Monday morning last week.\nThe NRL will push Fox Sports hard to buy rights to all eight games live, four of which would be simulcast with Nine. One executive said the pay-television rights could be worth about $700 million, which along with the $150 million the NRL hopes to garner from international and New Zealand rights, would put the total rights at a record $1.7 billion for rugby league.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/nine-holds-onto-nrl-television-rights-20150809-giva5s.html"], "published": "2015-08-16T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:05:44.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
