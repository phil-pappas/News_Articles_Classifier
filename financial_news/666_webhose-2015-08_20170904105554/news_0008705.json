Dore's share was about 11 percent of that. \nIn a further boost to dore imports, the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, and the finance ministry are considering scrapping bulk import licences of the commodity, officials with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters last month. \n(Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T13:28:17.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
