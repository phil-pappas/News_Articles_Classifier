The Marikana violence three years ago was partly rooted in that struggle. \nA number of mining companies including Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) , Kumba Iron Ore (Other OTC: KIROY - news ) , Sibanye Gold, Lonmin and Anglo American Platinum have said they plan to cut staff in the face of depressed prices and rising costs, but face pressure from unions and the government to maintain jobs. \nThe NUM, South Africa's largest mining union despite its losses in the platinum sector, has said 11,000 of its members could lose their jobs under planned cost cutting. \nMathunjwa, in typically combative language, said on Sunday that AMCU would \"seek to protect our members against exploitative capitalists who seek to make a profit at all costs\". \nHe said that after AMCU members were laid off, the prices of precious metals would rebound. \nThis is a common theme of the union, which sees South Africa's economy in stark class and racial terms, with foreign capital manipulating markets to exploit black miners. \nSouth African President Jacob Zuma said on Sunday that 1 billion rand ($78 million) had been allocated in the budget this financial year for housing in mining communities. \n\"This is anticipated to deliver approximately 19,000 housing opportunities in mining towns,\" Zuma said in a statement. \nPoor social conditions and squalid housing are seen as reasons behind the labour tensions in the mining sector. \n($1 = 12.8216 rand) (Reporting by Ed Stoddard; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T02:25:10.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
