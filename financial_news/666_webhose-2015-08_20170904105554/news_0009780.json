He was later released without charge.\nFanya Metals is an exchange which buys and sells minor metals such as indium and bismuth, while also offering high-interest investment products.\nPhotos of Mr Shan’s capture and protests in Shanghai were posted to social media site Weibo. Mr Shan has not commented publicly, but his company denounced the raid.\n“Violent acts against president Shan and our employees or the disturbance of our work are destructive of our work around solving the crisis,” Fanya Metals said in a statement on its website.\n“This will only allow forces behind the scenes to profit and will greatly harm interests of all members.”\nAccording to the Financial Times , many investors said they bought into Fanya’s financial products because they were advertised on CCTV, China’s national broadcaster.\nIt said despite the company’s widely reported problems, its products were still being advertised on train networks.\nFanya Metals head Shan Jiuliang was dragged from his hotel.
