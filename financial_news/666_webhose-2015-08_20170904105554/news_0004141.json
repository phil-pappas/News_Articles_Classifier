In 2013, the company was ranked as the worst governed listed counter by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries Administrators of Zimbabwe due to its failure to release financial results on time and hold annual general meeting of shareholders. \nIts financial results for the year 2014 painted a sorry state of affairs. The results were published in June after the three months stipulated time-frame which listed companies are supposed to comply with. \nIn a statement accompanying the company's financial results, Chiyangwa, who chairs the board, apologised to stakeholders for the delay in publishing the audited results for 2014. \n\"This was due to extra work and time required to ensure full disclosure relating to the discontinued operations,\" he said. \nThe group, a holding company for Delward Engineering and Critall Hope, saw its revenue falling to $500 518 from $604 526 in the comparable period in 2013. \nZeco said it had discontinued Zimplastics after it became unviable with no prospects of recovery. \nCost of sales -- which is the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company -- were up to $382 407 from $291 764 in the prior year despite falling revenue. \nZeco had cash and cash equivalents of $129 down from $8 393 in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalent refers to the value of a company's assets that are cash or can immediately be converted into cash. \nContrast Zeco's performance with its largest shareholder, Chiyangwa. \nWhen he bought his fancy $500 000 car, the businessman said the acquisition was in line with his standards. \n\"When people hear about these figures, they scream and squeak, but to me that's the standard. The talk about being extravagant doesn't apply because I am living well within my means,\" he was quoted as saying. \nIn March, Chiyangwa told The Standard that Zimbabweans tended to employ the waiting attitude whereby they blamed the economy, politicians and environment but themselves for failure to succeed despite being an educated nation. \nHe said one needed a correct mindset and a positive attitude that tells one that they will succeed at all costs. \n\"I believe that if we were all innovative, progressive and determined to make it, our country would be far much better than it is now. Otherwise, how am I thriving in the very same economy that you keep whining about?\" Zimbabwe \nPRESIDENT Mugabe will hand over the chairmanship of the 15-member Sadc community to his deputy, host President Seretse … see more » Copyright © 2015 Zimbabwe Standard.
