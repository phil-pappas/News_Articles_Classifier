That was despite an 11.6 percent fall in publishing print sales, its main source of income, as supermarkets and telecom groups spent less on advertising. \nWhile print publishing came in at 235.7 million pounds in the first half, digital publishing revenue grew by 27 percent to 18.9 million pounds. \n\"It was a tough half year for print advertising,\" Chief Executive Simon Fox told Reuters. \"Good cash generation meant we have 24 million pounds of cash on our balance sheet, the first time in our history that we've had cash on our balance sheet.\" \nAnalysts also welcomed the comment that July revenue trends were better than those experienced in May and June, and Fox said he hoped the rate of decline would abate in the second half. \nShares in the group rose 8.3 percent to 144.4 pence by 0828 GMT after a 36 percent drop in the last five months, valuing the owner of national, regional and digital titles at around 370 million pounds.
