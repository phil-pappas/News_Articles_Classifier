It suggests: detailed proposals for the application of the SIMR to large NDFs; keeping the requirement for certain NDFs to appoint an actuarial function holder, and a with‐profits actuary; the transitional arrangements for all NDFs; the proposed new forms and updates to existing forms; retention of records of allocation of responsibilities to senior managers at NDFs; and new parts of the PRA Rulebook to apply to NDFs. \nThe consultation includes a table mapping across current requirements to the proposed new rules. PRA seeks views by 12 October.
