Chris Hopkins Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger Melbourne estate agents Hodges are using the lure of rising foreign buyer appetite to encourage residents in the south-eastern suburbs to think about putting their homes on the market.\nA letter sent to a resident in Caulfield South and forwarded to the Australian Financial Review says that property prices in Caulfield are \"booming\" and that one of the reasons the market is so strong is \"because there are many foreign buyers looking to purchase property in the Caulfield area\".\nIt goes on to say that Hodges Caulfield has hired a new agent (who speaks fluent Mandarin) to \"work closely with buyers\" and urges the resident, if they are considering selling to \"contact us at your earliest convenience\".\nLast week Treasurer Joe Hockey ordered the sale of six homes bought or owned illegally by foreigners with a further 462 being investigated. From November 1 illegal buyers of existing home face heavy fines and even jail time.\nHodges Caulfield director Alex Flamm said it was not up to estate agents to verify whether foreign buyers were legally entitled to purchase existing property. \"It's up to solicitors and conveyancers to verify that.\" .\nHe said the letters were being sent out widely to homeowners in the south-eastern suburbs given the prevalence of Asian buyers competing for property in these suburbs in sought-after school zones.\nBut, he said, it was a \"little bit of a misconception that the market place was being eaten up by Chinese buyers\".\n\"Just because they are competing for property does not mean they are the final buyers,\" he said.\n Mr Flamm said Hodges had started sending out the letters two months ago. He said houses in these suburbs were priced between $1.2 million and $5 million.\n\"$1.5m for a cashed-up foreign buyer is a cheap home for them,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-08-12T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:04:10.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
