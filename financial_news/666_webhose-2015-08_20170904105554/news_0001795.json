About 1,495 businesses took part in the survey. Last month's increase partially recouped June's plunge, which had pushed the index to its lowest level since March 2014.\nData on automobile sales, employment and the services sector have suggested a steady build-up of economic momentum at the start of the third quarter after gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter.\nSeven of the index's 10 components increased last month, while three continued to decline.\nOwners were upbeat about business conditions over the next six months, and their expectations about sales improved after weakening for several months. They were optimistic about investing in capital and inventories.\nThere was an increase in the number of small business owners who said that now was a good time to expand.\nThe survey's labor market gauges improved after weakening a bit in June. Fifty-seven percent reported hiring or trying to recruit workers in July, up five percentage points from June.\nTwenty-five percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill, up one point from June, but four points below the highest reading for 2015. About 23 percent of owners reported raising worker compensation, up two points from June.\nThe survey pointed to tame inflation pressures in the near term. Thirteen percent of small business owners reported reducing their average selling prices in the past three months, down one point from June.\nAbout 17 percent reported price increases, also down a point from the prior month. Seventeen percent said they planned to raise average prices in the next few months, down two points from June.
