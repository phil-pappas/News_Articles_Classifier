Deputy Minister of Finance, Mrs Mona Quartey has assured the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority of government unflinching support to begin the processing of the Customs Classification and Valuation Report (CCRV). \nThe CCRV, which would replace the destination inspection report also known as the Final Classification and Valuation Report, would start in September 1. \nBriefing the media after a familarisation visit to the offices of the new classification and valuation unit, Mrs Quartey said government is convinced that allowing Customs to play their role is the best thing to do. \n'I am convinced from what I have seen that the system and the personnel are more than ready to start the operations of the single window in September,' she said. \nThe new system would adopt a collaborative approach, where customs, freight forwarders, brokers, and other stakeholders, work together to provide services to Ghana's Trading Community, supported by service providers such as GCNet, West Blue Consulting and Scanning Companies. \nThe arrangement is to create a synergy that utilises the core competencies of each of the stakeholders to implement a seamless, efficient and user-friendly e-clearance regime in a National Single Window environment. \nMrs Quartey said although there might be some initial teething issues, the contingency plans in place would ensure a seamless and hitch-free transition as possible. \nThe Pre-Arrival Assessment Report (PAAR) system is an integrated and shared risk platform that would help overcome the inefficiencies in the current regime, including duplications, as a result of non-integrated systems, lack of real time notifications to declarants and manual document processing of import transactions. \nThe system, utilising a robust risk engine, would assist authorised officials to perform a comprehensive assessment of imported goods, by classifying, valuing and risk assessing them, based on international standards and conventions. \nTo aid trader compliance and provide timely trade information to the public an interactive trade information portal www.ghanastradinghub.gov.gh would be launched as part of the programme on September 1, 2015 to aid compliance at source. \nThe PAARS services would be delivered from the Customs Technical Services Bureau. \nValentina Mintah, Chief Executive Officer West Blue Consulting Limited, Valentina Mintah pledged a smooth delivery of the single window project. \nShe said adequate preparations had been made to ensure successful execution of the project, adding that customs and partner government agencies as well as clients are ready. \nMintah, however, called for vigilance to stem both internal and external risks that might emanate during the operations such as the behaviour of customs officials and sabotage of systems. \nShe gave the assurance that there are backup plans for every area to deal with the risks and to reduce it to avoid panic in the environment. \nA dedicated Toll free help line would be set up for the public during the period. \nMr Kuudamnuru John Vianney, Acting Commissioner Customs Division, said users must register on line to be able to process their import declaration forms, adding that, the issuance of all FCVR would cease at the close of work on August 31, 2015. \nHe said active and unutilised FCVRs would be valid for 30 days ending October 2, after which all outstanding ones would become void. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T12:34:01.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
