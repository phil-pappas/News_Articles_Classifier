The bonds were issued through a New Jersey program that diverts state aid to debt payments, which lessens the risk to bondholders.\n“For a downgrade at this point, it just doesn’t make sense,” he said.\nAtlantic City “continues to make progress” in addressing its budget shortfall and longer-term structural deficit, Lavin, the emergency manager, said in an e-mailed statement.\nGovernor Chris Christie had appointed Lavin to come up with a plan to revive the finances of the city, where four of 12 casinos closed last year. The governor’s move led Moody’s Investors Service and S&P to downgrade Atlantic City because of the risk that a turnaround plan could foist losses on bondholders. Moody’s ranks the city Caa1 with a negative outlook.\nBills that the state legislature passed in June, including a measure that would create payments in lieu of taxes from the the city’s casinos, are part of the financial plan, Stinson said. The legislation still has to be signed by Christie.\nKevin Roberts and Brian Murray, spokesmen for Christie, didn’t immediately return a call and e-mail requesting comment.\nTax-free general obligations due in December 2027 traded Monday with an average yield of 7.26 percent, or about 4.7 percentage points over benchmark munis, data compiled by Bloomberg show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T23:40:06.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
