Its losses for August have already matched those for June, which was its weakest month in two years, as worries over lagging inflation and slowing growth in China weigh on global financial markets. \nThere were some decent European corporate figures out, with shares of Dutch retailer Ahold rising 2.1 percent after a solid rise in profits. \nHowever, Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) managing director Nick Lawson wrote to clients that earnings expectations for Europe were 'probably too high', while others pointed to negative pressure from worries over China. \nU.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . bank Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2016 to 3.1 percent, from 3.3 percent, citing significant downgrades for the euro area and China among others. \n\"China is having the biggest impact on the markets. I'd look to sell any rallies at the moment,\" said Berkeley Futures associate director Richard Griffiths. \nDROP IN DAX \nGermany's DAX index, which contains major carmakers that export to China, weakened by 2.3 percent, while the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 fell 2.2 percent. \nThe DAX is some 16 percent below a record high of 12,390.75 set in April and at its lowest level since January. \nMark Evans, fund manager at Taube Hodson Stonex Partners, said a domestic recovery within Europe - helped by economic stimulus measures from the European Central Bank (ECB) - could offset problems caused by the slowdown in China. \nNevertheless, concerns over China - which is a leading global consumer of commodities - pushed the shares of major oil companies down on Thursday, with the STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas Index dropping 1.3 percent. \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Lionel Laurent; Editing by Toby Chopra/Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T21:05:49.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
