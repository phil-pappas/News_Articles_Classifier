Will that match be stable? A computer scientist uses numbers to answer these questions.\nReetika is married to John and Maitri is married to Kartik. But Reetika secretly prefers Kartik, and it so happens that Kartik prefers her to Maitri. Right there, you have what mathematics would term an unstable match -the two people who prefer each other over their current spouses are liable to break their existing matches in favour of a prospectively bet ter one. So, if there are 10 men and 10 women, is it possible to match them in such a way as to create stable matches, taking into account their preferences? This is the crux of the Stable Marriage problem, encountered in mathematics and other related fields.\nDavid Gale and Lloyd Shapley, who formulated the theory in 1962, used marriage as a metaphor to explicate if and how stable matches can be generated given two groups. The problem was first put forward in dealing with matching students and colleges in the admission process.\nAt a talk organised by theatre group Junoon at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum on Sunday, TIFR computer scientist Jaikumar Radhakrishnan unravelled for a lay audience the mathematics behind considering preferences and generating stable matches. Is there always the possibility of creating sta ble matches between two sets of data? And if they exist, are these easy to find? In a mathematical understanding of a 'stable match', Radhakrishnan clarified it meant \"stability and not satisfaction\". The hour-and-a-half-long talk pivoted on a simple problem. Consider the following situation: there are 10 men and 10 women.Each of the 10 men has a list of preferences from among all the women. Similarly, each woman has a preference list of men. How can they all be paired in such a manner that everyone gets someone as high on their preference list as is possible within the limits of the situation? The problem essentially deals with two concepts: pref erences and stability. It is necessary to pair every one off in such a way that none of the couples is tempted to break off the given match in favour of a different match.So we need to avoid the Reetika-John-MaitriKartik imbroglio.\nLet us start by saying each of the men can propose to any of the 10 women. A woman can accept or reject a proposal, but not make one. If a man is rejected by his first preference, he moves to the next, and so on.\nWhen a woman gets a proposal, she can either reject it outright or hold on to it until she gets a proposal from a man higher on her preference list. So Anita may receive a proposal from Rohan, who is third on her preference list, and she will tentatively accept.Second, however, on her list is Nevil. Nevil might have first approached Zara, his first preference, but been turned down by her. He then approaches Anita, his second preference. Since Nevil is higher (2) on Anita's list than Rohan (3), she turns down Rohan, having moved higher up her preference list.If she gets a proposal from Narendra, who is right on top of her list, she will ditch Nevil. If, however, Narendra doesn't approach her, she will set tle for Nevil.\nThis can keep going on until all 10 pairs are matched. Since everyone has to list all their preferences from one to 10, there is no situation in which any one remains unmatched, even if they are stuck with their least preferred partner.\nRadhakrishnan then raised two questions before the audience: can the men propose strategically to improve their chances of getting a higher preference match? And can the women time their rejection to improve their chances of getting a higher preference partner? As it turns out, the answer to both is no.\nOnce all 10 pairs are matched, and based on the results generated through the matching algorithm, men bat at an average of 1.9; men are usually managing to get women within their first or second choice. For the women on the other hand, the average is 4.8; meaning they have to go as far down as their fifth proposal.\nThis situation arises because the men have the power to propose whereas women only have the power to either accept or reject -such a situation is favourable for the men. If the women were proposing and men were receiving or rejecting, the results would be favourable to women.\nNow, consider this situation. If there are 11 men and 10 women, that means one man will remain unmatched at the end of the process. In a scenario of an 11th man, the average evens out for both parties -men at 3.4 and women at 3.5. Both men and women are managing on average to be matched by the person who was their fourth preference.\n\"If there is a surplus in the market, it doesn't matter that [men] are proposing,\" said Radhakrishnan.\nThe talk ended in a lighter vein with Radhakrishnan playing a song clip: Matchmaker from the film classic Fiddler on the Roof. \"Groom me no groom,\" the tune went, \"find me no find, catch me no catch, unless he's a matchless match.\"\nby Bhavya Dore\nFor more stories, follow us on Twitter and Facebook\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=situation,Scientist,relationship,match,Abacus ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOIRelationship", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIRelationships"], "published": "2015-08-11T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:32:47.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
