But if the freeze is a “trustee process attachment” (tying up a bank or other institutional account), a whole different set of emotions can be evoked. As I discussed in Gain Leverage by Freezing Bank Accounts – Part I and Part II , knowing the law surrounding trustee process attachments can create or defuse significant and sometimes dispositive leverage. Further, and as the Federal District Court reminded us recently in DeBenedictis v. Dougherty , the speed with which a party acts or reacts when a trustee process is sought can be critical. \n& Cabot brokerage account in Dougherty’s name that contained more than $145,000. A hearing on that motion was scheduled for January 7 (two business days later), and Dougherty was served with notice of the hearing on the evening of January 3. \n’s account. While that writ was served on Moors & Cabot on Jan. 8, hours earlier Dougherty had withdrawn all but $170 from the account. While DeBenedictis complained to the court that this was a blatant effort to circumvent its ruling, Judge O’Toole responded that: \nThe issuing of a writ does not create [the attachment]. Something more is necessary; and that . . . is the arresting of the debt in the hands of the trustee, which is effected by a service of the writ on him.” …’s property interest in his account was not limited and he was free to withdraw the funds. \n, i.e. , without giving the defendant notice of the motion or an opportunity to oppose it. While many judges will not entertain such a request, there is little if any downside in asking and, if granted, there is a much better chance of finding funds in the subject account. \nAs for defense, it is important that as soon as in-house counsel are aware of a litigation they check the docket to see what may be pending. Likewise, there a before service of process is made. Plainly, knowing this information as soon as possible may enable you to employ a defensive strategy like the one Dougherty employed by moving assets before a writ is issued and your account frozen.
