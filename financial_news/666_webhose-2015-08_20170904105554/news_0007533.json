At the closing price of 7,477 yen on Wednesday in Tokyo his cash would buy just over 8 million shares, for a 0.69 percent stake in SoftBank, making him the second biggest individual investor after Son, who welcomed the investment from his anointed successor.\n\"I expect him to succeed me at the appropriate time,\" Son said in the press release.\nArora became the president and chief operating officer at SoftBank in May as the Japanese company looked to step up its overseas expansion and battled to make its $20 billion 2013 acquisition of U.S. carrier Sprint Corp profitable amid intense competition with larger U.S. rivals AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.\nThe one-time highest paid Google Inc executive joined SoftBank in July last year and has overseen a string of investments into Indian technology start-ups Snapdeal, Ola Cabs and Housing.com in a bid to tap India's potentially huge but under-developed online retail market.\nIn an interview with Reuters in May he said he has three criteria for making investments; the market size, quality of the team, and the right business model.
