The Greek parliament is expected to approve the reforms attached to the conditional programme on Thursday.\nGreece's economy posted an unexpected return to growth in the second quarter, but Greek yields held steady.\nLosses for the Chinese currency were slight after the People's Bank of China set a midpoint that was again lower than the previous day's, but not as weak as some had expected.\nGerman 10-year Bund yields rose 2 basis points to 0.62 percent. Spanish and Italian yields were flat at 1.96 percent and 1.79 percent.\nGerman two-year yields were slightly off but near record lows of around minus 0.28 percent hit on Wednesday.\n\"There are some signs of stabilisation in China's currency, stock markets, commodity prices - all these factors which offered strong support to core markets in the past couple of days - so we're seeing a correction in Bunds as well,\" BNP Paribas rate strategist Patrick Jacq said.\nBut he did not expect a strong rebound in yields.\nSources told Reuters some powerful voices in the government were pushing for an even deeper yuan devaluation to help China's struggling exporters.\nThe currency moves have increased concerns about the state of the world's second largest economy and raised concerns that China is exporting disinflation to other regions.\n\"We expect risk aversion to continue and ... Bunds should therefore remain well supported despite the early morning reaction,\" said Alexander Plenk, head of investment research at Bayerische Landesbank.\nThe European Central Bank's (ECB) favourite measure of the market's long-term inflation expectations - the five-year, five-year breakeven forward - traded just above 1.65 percent, having hit its lowest since the end of March on Wednesday at around 1.63.\nThe measure shows where markets expect 2025 inflation forecasts to be in 2020. A fall below 1.6240 percent would take it to levels seen before the ECB launched its trillion euro bond-buying stimulus programme to bring inflation back to its target of nearly 2 percent.\nOne-year inflation swaps have already hit pre-stimulus levels, trading at around 0.15 percent, compared with almost 1 percent in June.\nThe drop in inflation expectations has prompted bets that the ECB will expand its quantitative easing (QE) programme beyond September 2016, when it is due.\n\"Global disinflationary forces call for a larger and longer QE response from the ECB,\" Societe Generale rate strategists said in a note.\n\"Remember that a six-month review of ... (QE) is due next month. We could see some surprises.\"\nSimilarly in the United States, the weaker yuan trimmed expectations for a rate hike in September.
