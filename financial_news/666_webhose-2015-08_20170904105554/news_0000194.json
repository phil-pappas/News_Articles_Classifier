Photo: Bloomberg\nThe Australian sharemarket bounced back on Monday, boosted by renewed faith in the banks amid a mixed day for company results.\nAt close of trade, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.6 per cent higher to 5509.2 , while the broader All Ordinaries also rose 0.6 per cent to 5504.9.\nWeak economic data from China released on the weekend and residual selling in the bank stocks led the market lower at the open, hot off the heels of Friday's ANZ-led $37 billion sell-off.\nBut the big four found support early in the session as investors digested ANZ's $3 billion capital raising announcement and the prospect that Commonwealth Bank would follow suit when it reports on Wednesday.\nAfter losing 7.5 per cent on Friday, ANZ shares recovered 1.5 per cent to $30.60. An upgrade of the bank's stock by Citi to a 'buy' provided additional tailwind.\nCommonwealth Bank and Westpac both added 1 per cent to $82.14 and $32.68 respectively, National Australia Bank shares added 1.5 per cent to $33.32 after it reported a 9 per cent lift in third quarter profits to $1.75 billion.\nIG market analyst Angus Nicholson said there may have been a bit of overselling of the banks on Friday.\n\"I think the market should have expected the banks to raise more capital,\" he said.\nInvestor reaction to Commonwealth Bank's likely capital raising announcement on Wednesday could go either way, he said.\n\"They could opt to raise anything from $2 billion to $7 billion; the higher the number better for the longer term, but on short term share price a bigger number's going to mean a bigger hit.\"\nAdding to renewed optimism on Monday may be a rally in China's sharemarket, St George senior economist Janu Chan said.\nIn late trade the Shanghai Composite Index was up 5 per cent, fuelled by merger talk.\n\"News that the Chinese government may be accelerating mergers of its state-owned enterprises may have helped our sharemarket higher,\" she said.\nA slew of company results released on Monday triggered some decisive buying and selling, the most dramatic of which came from rubber and condom maker Ansell.\nIts share price fell 15.8 per cent to $20.84 despite the company delivering a 20 per cent surge in profits, beating analyst expectations. The sell-off was driven by a warning from the company that in the year ahead foreign exchange rates will hit its bottom line.\n\"Their numbers weren't terrible, they're pretty much right on target on net profit after but their guidance for the 2016 financial year was lower than what the market was expecting,\" Mr Nicholson said.\n\"They're also suffering a bit from their foreign exchange plays, a lot of their hedging bets are going to run off into next year, that's one of the big reasons it dropped so much today,\" he said.\nRetailer JB Hi-Fi was the star performer of the day's company results. Its share price soared 10.6 per cent to $21.69 after it announced a 6.3 per cent lift in net profit to $136.5 million , and lifted its dividend payout by 6¢ to 90¢ a share. It also flagged a $15.2 million share buyback.\nThat sent a wave of buying in the retail stocks, with consumer discretionary the second strongest sector for the day, after utilities.\nThe worst performing sectors were health and consumer staples, with Wesfarmers down 1.2 per cent to $41.43, but Woolworths gained 0.4 per cent to $27.85.\nIn the miners, Rio Tinto rose 0.9 per cent , while BHP Billiton lifted 0.3 per cent, and Fortescue Metals Group added 2.1 per cent.\nIn the absence of major local economic data, a week of plentiful company results would drive market movements, Ms Chan said.\n\"China retail sales and industrial production on Wednesday will be a focus, with the US retail sales and industrial production numbers to come out on Thursday,\" she said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/mining/iron-ore/afr10asrio---20150809-givaq8", "http://www.afr.com/business/results-wrap--reporting-season-blog-august-10-20150807-gitr5w"], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:39:39.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
