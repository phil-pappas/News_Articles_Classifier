The organization, which collects license fees and pays out royalties when musical works are broadcast, performed or reproduced, built the portal on Appway 6. The portal enables Swiss songwriters, composers, and music publishers to access account information and register new works. \nDevelopers from SUISA built the portal themselves, with training from Appway Academy and support from Appway consultants. Previously, the organization communicated through paper letters and mail. Today, members can access statements and information from SUISA through their online portal, where they can update their details and view information about their musical works. Over 500 members registered within the first two weeks and the portal now serves over 1,000. The goal is to serve all 34,000 members. As the number of registered members steadily grows, SUISA will increase efficiency and reduce paper across their organization. \nSUISA’s plans for innovation have only just begun: As a next step towards digitalizing its business, the company plans to exchange its mainframe architecture with service-oriented architecture with Appway orchestrating all user interactions. \nAbout Appway \nAppway empowers the service industries to move beyond automation toward ongoing digital transformation.
