These wireless phones, pads, and tablets are being utilized worldwide by businesses and consumers as mobile payment stations, representing new and significant revenue opportunities for retailers that are seeking to cash-in on anytime, anywhere transactions. \n\"While it is still early days for mobile payments in many respects, the disruption of mobile devices as the conduit connecting online and offline worlds is clearly not to be underestimated,\" says Javelin's Nick Holland. \"Retailers that want to remain relevant in this new world need to embrace mobile strategies now to prepare for more seismic disruptions to the landscape that are inevitably coming.\" \nRichard Love of AP Technology agrees that game-changing advances in payments are imminent for retailers and consumers alike, and that now is the time to pave the future for payments perfection. \"It is the dawning of a new and better way to pay through mobile devices, with merchants having an opportunity to dictate and shape the transaction experience,\" said Love. \"Security is top-of-mind for all, as is the transaction experience. During this conference, we'll look forward to discussing best practices, multi-layered security, and even a change in transactional process between payor and payee that we believe will result in a drastic reduction in fraud and theft.\" \nCountry Music star Rick Monroe joins the MPC panel as an entertainer that is using mobile strategies to better connect him with his fans around the world. Like Nick Holland and Richard Love, Monroe sees global changes at-hand for retailers and consumers, as mobile payments become the way to do commerce and to connect with audiences. \"The ability for me to distribute music and to sell merchandise globally, combined with the opportunity to create and manage personal connections with fans is something that was not previously possible,\" Monroe stated. \"This new use of mobile technology, coupled with the ability to transact in non-traditional ways means that the music industry -- along with every other industry on the planet, is forever changing.\" \nAs someone that helped shape mobile commerce and technology at iconic companies such as Sears, K-Mart and Motorola, retail guru Mario Di Prizio says he is looking forward to the 2015 Mobile Payments Conference as a way to educate retailers on mobile strategies that retain and monetize. \"Creation of a mobile strategy is something that needs to happen immediately, if it is not already in place,\" said Di Prizio. \"For retailers that are looking for a 'silver bullet,' they need look no further than mobile payments and mobile strategies as the means to take revenues to new heights.\" \nThe 2015 Mobile Payments Conference will be a unique opportunity for attendees to learn from experts in various mobile disciplines that are already utilizing next-generation technologies and strategies in real-world situations. \"We hope that the end result of our panel is that retailers are able to embrace mobile payments as a way to give their story a happy ending,\" remarked session moderator, Greg Wilfahrt. \nAbout AP Technology \nAP Technology is a Carlsbad, California-based company that processes $30 billion in payments annually for a growing base of 6,000 customers that include financial institutions, government organizations, universities, and an array of businesses.
