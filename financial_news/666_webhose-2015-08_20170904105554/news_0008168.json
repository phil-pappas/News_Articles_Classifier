RateSetter, launched in the UK in 2010, is now approaching $2 million a month in loans in Australia.\nMatt Symons of peer to peer lender SocietyOne.

Source: News Corp Australia\nIn the UK, it’s doing around $100 million a month.\n“What we’re really doing is introducing competition into the personal loan market,” said RateSetter Australia CEO Daniel Foggo. “Typically our rates are 4 to 6 per cent lower than what the banks are offering.”\nLenders on the platform see returns ranging from 4 per cent for a one-month loan to 10 per cent for a five-year loan. “Basically we’re providing them access to a new asset class which in the past the banks monopolised and which provided very good returns,” he said.\nDifferent peer-to-peer lenders use different risk mitigation models. MoneyPlace, for example, fractionalises all of its loans to spread the risk. RateSetter instead keeps a provision fund to insure lenders against defaults.\nRateSetter charges lenders a flat 10 per cent off the interest earned, and borrowers are charged a fee of $200 or $300 depending on the term of the loan. The average value of funds invested on RateSetter is $6,283 per lender and the most common reason for borrowers taking out a loan is to finance a car.\n“At the moment it seems that traditional large incumbent banks and lenders think they hold a lot of trust, but I think what we’re already seeing is that trust is moving to newer players,” Mr Foggo said.\nWHERE WE’LL INVEST OUR MONEY\nChris Brycki, founder of online investment platform Stockspot , agrees that trust in the banks is no longer the selling point it once was. “If you look at the advertising for the banks, it’s always around trust and safety in numbers,” he said.\n“They never sell it on good performance or low fees, because they can’t.”\nHe points to a recent report from the Australian Securities Exchange which showed share ownership through managed funds and advisers had declined dramatically over the past decade.\n“That’s because consumers have been wising up to the amount of fees that get bolted on,” he said. “They charge an advice fee, and on top of that they put you on a platform that in 80 per cent of cases is aligned with their financial planning business, recommending their own products.”\nChris Brycki of online investment platform Stockspot says his company offers much lower fees than the big banks. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nMr Brycki argues the financial planning scandals have been valuable in shifting public perception. “The reason the wealth industry is wealthier than it should be is information asymmetry,” he said.\n“Most consumers can understand when a pot of peanut butter is more expensive than other, but financial services are complex.”\nStockspot falls into the new category of ‘robo-advisers’ — low-touch, automated, online portfolio managers which use the same investment algorithms employed by the industry.\nMr Brycki, who has more than 4000 people investing through his platform, said the cost of development had fallen dramatically over the past few years.\n“To build the platform we’ve built 10 or even five years ago would have cost $100 million,” he said. “I know a lot of the banks have spent that amount of money in their investment platforms.”\nThe banks, however, struggle with overheads of legacy infrastructure and traditional branch networks, adding to the customer’s bottom line.\nMOVING CASH AWAY FROM THE BANKS\n“The mood has been shifting for a while now, people now realise banks aren’t the only alternative to provide financial services, and they do feel like they’re paying more than they should,” said Sean Barrett, CEO and co-founder of peer-to-peer currency exchange marketplace CurrencyFair .\nMr Barrett and fellow Aussie expat Brett Myers founded the company while living in Ireland, having seen first-hand the exorbitant rates banks were charging on foreign currency transfers.\n“We both worked in financial markets, I was doing forex trading in a bank in Dublin, and we had to move money around a fair bit,” he said. “When we were doing those exchanges with the banks it was quite obvious how much you were getting taken for a ride.”\nCurrencyFair essentially acts like a “dating website” for people who want to exchange currencies, facilitating the transfers through local accounts on either side to avoid paying hefty bank fees.\nThe company has exchanged close to $3 billion since starting five years ago, saving customers an estimated $200 million in bank fees. “We made it possible to send $50 or $100 to Ireland. It would cost you $50 to send $100 normally just in fixed charges,” he said.\nCurrencyFair has around 100,000 registered users and 30,000 in Australia. “We’ve done about 450 million euros ($A665 million) in Australia, so we’re still only a small part of it,” Mr Barrett said.\n“The banks have basically got people captured, there’s this lethargy which is probably one of our largest roadblocks — my money’s in the bank so I just go and do everything with my bank.”\nHe predicts the banks will gradually see their hold on these ancillary services such as foreign currency transfers worn away.\n“Their core business of lending will remain strong, but I think society is moving towards niche companies — if I want this, I go here. This is all we do, move money from here to there every day. It’s our only product so we know it inside out.”\nDO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU MOVE ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS\nHowever, Justine Davies, editor of financial comparison site canstar.com.au , said it was important for consumers to understand that these start-ups weren’t replacing professional financial advice so much as providing an alternative for those who would otherwise “DIY their finances”.\n“You need a certain amount of confidence in your ability to manage your own borrowing and investment needs in order to use an online start-up — and sometimes you simply don’t know what you don’t know,” she said. “We love to knock the banks — but if you deal with them properly and take advantage of the wealth of knowledge and education they can give to you, you’ll get your money’s worth.”\nMs Davies said she was a big supporter of P2Ps but, realistically, the small loan that you can obtain from a start-up, no matter how competitive the rate, is still a small loan.\n“That’s their business model and it’s terrific for them and can be terrific for the customer and by all means check it out,” she said. “But — even though you might borrow $20,000 or $30,000 to buy a car, or a few thousand for a personal loan from a P2P, you’ll still head to the bank for your home loan, your credit card and your bank accounts.\n“Once you have a home loan with a bank, big or small, you may find it a lot more cost-effective to transfer everything else to that bank and take advantage of the very competitive package deals that they offer.”\nSUPERMARKET SERVICES\nMeanwhile, non-traditional financial institutions such as Coles and Woolworths are also sizing up for a fight by offering credit cards and insurance.\nLast year, Coles launched a ‘ mobile wallet ’, allowing customers to pay without a credit card and collect FlyBuys points by simply tapping their phone at the check-out.\nRichard Wormald, general manager of financial services at Coles, said more than 80,000 customers have downloaded the app since launch and activated more than 400,000 FlyBuys offers through the wallet.\nSupermarkets are staking a claim on the credit card market. Picture: Paul Miller/AAP Source: AAP\nHe estimates Coles currently holds between 4 and 5 per cent market share in credit cards. Mr Wormald says looking at historical examples, between 10 and 15 per cent market share is the “tipping point” when the new solution becomes the dominant solution.\n“We’re very far from that now,” he said.\n“But the insurance market is already being disrupted by new entrants quite significantly. The top three challengers — ourselves, Budget Direct and Youi — now account for one third of new insurance applications.”\nAgain, as with the smaller companies, Mr Wormald highlights trust as the key barrier.\n“Trust is something that has to be earned over time. That’s one of the reasons we haven’t broadened our range immediately to 20 products.\n“There has been a lot of poor behaviour in financial services in many markets over time, and much of that has been driven by short-termism. We’re in this for the long term.”\n* News Corp, the publisher of this website, has an investment stake in peer-to-peer lender, SocietyOne.\nfrank.chung@news.com.au The Party's Over 52:11 Play video\nDiscover how momentous decisions made three decades ago sparked the GFC and transformed our economic future.\nOovvuu 24 Mar 2015 TV/Business TV/Money TV/Society and Culture TV/Documentary\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.canstar.com.au/", "https://www.ratesetter.com.au/", "http://www.societyone.com.au/", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/the-companies-set-to-take-billions-off-the-banks/story-fnkjidjt-1227478552703?sv=c6fae7ee8a796e0cceaf8e925a83e275", "https://moneyplace.com.au/", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/the-companies-set-to-take-billions-off-the-banks/story-fnkjidjt-1227478552703?sv=c6fae7ee8a796e0cceaf8e925a83e275&title=Big+banks+face+bold+new+threat", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Big+banks+face+bold+new+threat&c=ALL+over+the+world%2C+big+banks+are+under+attack.+The+public%26%238217%3Bs+plummeting+trust+has+opened+the+way+for+a+new+type+of+rival+to+emerge.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/the-companies-set-to-take-billions-off-the-banks/story-fnkjidjt-1227478552703?sv=c6fae7ee8a796e0cceaf8e925a83e275", "https://www.currencyfair.com/", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/the-companies-set-to-take-billions-off-the-banks/story-fnkjidjt-1227478552703?sv=c6fae7ee8a796e0cceaf8e925a83e275&h=Big+banks+face+bold+new+threat", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://videomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com/generated/prod/05/06/2015/35712/image1024x768.jpg?count=1&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/the-companies-set-to-take-billions-off-the-banks/story-fnkjidjt-1227478552703?sv=c6fae7ee8a796e0cceaf8e925a83e275&title=Big+banks+face+bold+new+threat", "https://www.stockspot.com.au/", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/the-companies-set-to-take-billions-off-the-banks/story-fnkjidjt-1227478552703?sv=c6fae7ee8a796e0cceaf8e925a83e275"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T07:49:29.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
