Teh \nAn expert in the rubber industry has disclosed that productivity in the rubber sector of Liberia is below international standards. Dr. LMK Tillekeratne says planting low yielding clones of unknown identity, poor quality of plants in the field as a result of low stands of trees and wrong exploitation of tapping techniques adopted by the country are responsible for low productivity in the rubber industry here, especially among small rubber farmers. \nDr. Tillekeratne, who is former Executive Director of the Sri Lanka Rubber Institute, and an advisor to Adam Smith international, pointed out that farmers in Liberia should take their farming activities seriously in order to generate money.
