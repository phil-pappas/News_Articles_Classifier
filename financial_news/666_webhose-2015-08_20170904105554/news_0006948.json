In June 2014, a barrel was worth $115. \nOil has lost 32.9% of its value since May and more than half of its worth (54.7%) since this time last year. \nThe slide is mostly due to a global surplus, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) warning production had to slow from its current \"breakneck speed\". \nIt said supply is already outstripping consumption by three million barrels a day. \nIt predicted the glut would persist into next year, despite growing demand for the commodity due to the collapse in prices. \nThe Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, is showing division over how to address the slump. \nReports suggest many smaller members are putting pressure on Saudi Arabia – whose main export is oil – to agree to crisis meetings. \nAlgeria is understood to have asked for urgent action, particularly on the oil production ceiling which governs the amount countries are allowed to produce. \nIt currently sits at 30 million barrels of oil a day, a level not scheduled to be reviewed until December. \nSome nations have suggested lowering this threshold would reduce supply and drive up value. \nBut Saudi Arabia, which has enough of a financial cushion to sustain itself through the slump, seems content to allow the market to dictate prices. \nThe decline in the Chinese financial system is also having an effect as investors fret over its industrial contraction and the chances of it reducing the demand for oil even further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T16:25:04.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
