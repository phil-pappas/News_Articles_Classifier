By redirecting these transactions to a clearinghouse, the derivatives market should become safer. If a counterparty goes bust, the clearinghouse will spread the losses incurred between all its member firms. Companies have to post collateral with clearinghouses to use them.\nFinancial institutions held OTC swaps with a notional value of $505 trillion at the end of 2014, according to a survey from the Bank for International Settlements . The real value of the contracts is far smaller because firms often hold contracts which cancel each other out.\nPlain Vanilla The commission has made clearing compulsory for plain vanilla interest-rate derivatives, basis swaps, forward-rate agreements and overnight index swaps traded within the EU. It said that the mandate would be phased in over three years.\nThe estimated daily turnover in the EU of OTC interest-rate derivative contracts denominated in so-called G4 currencies -- dollar, euro, yen and pound -- was more than 1.5 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) as of April 2013, according to the commission.\nLCH.Clearnet Ltd. is the largest clearinghouse for swaps. The subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group Plc has 90 percent of the overall market for swap clearing and a 70 to 80 percent share of clearing for end clients, according to Nathan Ondyak, the firm’s head of products and markets.\nThe clearing rules were issued as a delegated regulation. The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union , which represents the interests of member states, have three months to object to the standards starting from Aug. 21. In the absence of objections, the rules can enter into force.", "external_links": ["http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en\\", "http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/home/\\", "http://ec.europa.eu/archives/commission_2010-2014/president/pdf/statement_20090826_en_2.pdf\\", "http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1504.pdf\\", "http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5459_en.htm\\"], "published": "2015-08-06T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:36:45.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
