Photo: Reuters\nHe tells Fairfax Media the number one priority for the board would be finding a new chief executive for the \"iconic\" business.\nAdvertisement He will not comment on what needs to be done to get Woolworths back on track but he promises it will \"be great again\".\n\"We have four retail businesses to die for, anyone in their right mind would say these are wonderful assets, we've just stalled,\" Cairns says.\n\"This is a job to die for, it's one of the best retailers in the world and what great executive doesn't get attracted to the opportunity to help a business that's stalled.\"\nJust how Woolworths is going to get back on track and how long it will take will depend on how quickly the board appoints a new chief.\nCairns' appointment is the latest in a string of senior personnel changes at Woolworths, including the resignation of chief executive Grant O'Brien​ after a second profit downgrade this year in June as well as Big W boss Alistair McGeorge's shock departure last week after just over a year in the role.\nCredit Downgrade Things are undoubtedly tough. Woolworths unveiled a 12.5 per cent slump in full-year net profit to $2.1 billion on Friday.\nAs if to further underline the challenge, Cairns' appointment coincided with a downgrade to Woolworths' credit rating.\nAnalysts claim a new chief executive needs to be installed quickly to address fundamental issues like the rise of the discount retailers in the supermarkets sector.\nCBA analyst Andrew McLennan warns this is a five-year restructure operation and it required a new CEO at the helm to execute.\n\"I think it's pretty clear the execution of Woolworths' strategy has been sub par for many years and both management and the board need to take responsibility for that,\" McLennan says.\n\"Woolworths is still the dominant player from a market share perspective but they should have continued to enforce cost leadership and price leadership. From my point of view that's inexcusable.\n\"It's very difficult to win those customers back when you've shown a lack of loyalty by not enforcing cost and price leadership.\"\nThe gap between Coles and Woolworths widened to the biggest it's ever been in the last quarter of 2015, as Woolworths food and liquor sales went backwards by 0.9 per cent compared to 4 per cent like-for-like growth at Coles.\nO'Brien says its research suggests it had bettered Coles prices by the end of June but there is still the challenge of convincing shoppers.\nThe retailer has abandoned the green Cheap Cheap birds and plans to roll out a new marketing and advertising campaign in the next few months.\nO'Brien says shoppers need to be \"100 per cent clear\" they were getting the best price when they bought their groceries at Woolworths.\n\"We have a lot more to do to ensure that people put Woolworths first.\"\nWoolworths invested $200 million in lowering prices in the second half of 2015 and it claims its online prices were as much as 5 per cent lower than Coles.\nAldi still represents a threat, even if it's just a price perception issue.\n\"Our home brands, on average are lower than Aldi,\" says managing director Australian food and liquor Brad Banducci.\n\"But the challenge we have is that customers don't necessarily see home brands as equal to Aldi brands.\"\nHardware Hard Times Woolworths has also asked for more time to make its new and improved Masters format work amid concerns it is throwing good money after bad in an effort to establish a foothold in the market.\nWoolworths claims sales from the new look Masters stores are up about 30 per cent.\n\"The format needs to be given a chance to perform, we have an offer here that clearly resonates with customers and the uplift in sales is clear evidence of that,\" says O'Brien.\nFacing down criticism over Master's $245.6 million loss for the 2015 financial year, O'Brien says breaking even was not the benchmark for success, it was growth.\n\"What is not unclear is the attractiveness of these new stores [to customers].\"\nWoolworths said it had rolled out the new format to about 20 per cent of the Masters chain and it planned to refit three stores in NSW in the first half of this financial year.\nDespite the new layout and improved brand selection, the $930 million total sales result from Masters in 2015 did not even match Bunnings sales growth of $1 billion for the same period.\nThe temptation for Woolworths new chief will be to cut the Masters business loose and relegate it to the annals of past management mistakes, according to one shareholder.\nHe says the easy option would be to reach the conclusion that Masters was \"too hard and liquidate it and take a hit of a couple of billion dollars\".\n\"But I don't know that it's the right thing to do,\" he says.\n\"Bunnings is making a truckload of money from hardware ... I would think there is a massive opportunity there, even if they are second to Bunnings.\"\nWoolworths and its partner US retail heavyweight Lowes have sunk about $3 billion into the Masters chain in the past six years and its losses have surpassed $500 million in the last three years.\nO'Brien reaffirmed his commitment to the hardware business just weeks before announcing his own resignation.\nThe future of Masters is just one of the tough decisions that will weigh on the shoulders of Woolworths' incoming chief but profitability is the main game, according to CLSA analyst David Thomas.\nHe says whoever took the helm needed to understand that maintaining profitability was \"impossible if they really do want to compete\".\nThomas says a turnaround of Woolworths was a \"multi-year\" proposition and he warned there would be mistakes made along the way.\n\"Some shareholders will want to see some re-prioritising of focus and, to use some political parlance, to see a few barnacles knocked off, be that Masters or Big W,\" he says.\n\"Perhaps that will give them some sense that the food and liquor business is getting the right level of freedom and attention.\n\"The reason they find themselves in this position is they are losing share to Coles and Aldi, by my estimation Woolworths has been losing market share for more than three years.\n\"To my way of thinking the biggest problem was an overemphasis on the bottom line and as long as earnings showed some level of momentum ... management was seen to be doing a reasonable job.\n\"But gross margins got pushed up a lot, which meant higher prices and eventually lost customers.\"\nThomas says despite Woolworths' challenges many shareholders still had a view that it was a high quality operation and that with the right focus and management \"fortunes could be turned around\".\n\"The first thing all shareholders need is a well-articulated strategy outlining significant changes.\"\nAnd this won't happen until a new chief executive is at the helm\nAnalysts estimate Woolworths' gross margin started to drift up from as far back as 2009 and there have long been concerns that profits from the supermarket business were being pushed into the loss-making Masters business.\nThere's no consensus on the likely timing of any turnaround, but it will be years not months and analysts agree there is more pain to come as the hard discounters build their market share in Australia, just like they did in Europe and the UK more than a decade ago.\nWhen the cut-price operators like Aldi and Lidl moved into the supermarket sector in the UK, the full-service operators like Tesco and Asda experienced EBIT margin decline of between 300 and 500 basis points.\nAnd Aldi's outstanding performance, as revealed in the Senate tax inquiry earlier this year, would not have gone unnoticed by potential new entrants Lidl. There's even talk of a home-grown discount grocer.\nAgainst this backdrop Woolworths has to arrest its loss of market share and reaffirm its commitment to price and convince customers to put it back on the shopping list all while Coles pushes ahead with its aggressive cost-cutting strategy.\nThe only winners will be budget-conscious shoppers, who can expect a likely ramping up of the price war as Woolworths new boss gets it back in the game. But it's going to take time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:57:48.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
