The baht (THB=) hit its weakest levels since 2009 this week and most of the baht's 8 percent losses this year against the dollar have been in the past couple of months. \n\"It's clearly a bit uncomfortable. I would expect them to start to think this is unwelcome volatility rather than welcome depreciation,\" said Richard Yetsenga, global head of financial markets research at ANZ in Sydney. \nSouth Korea's central bank turned swiftly defensive of the won (KRW=) this week as it hit its lowest in nearly four years, selling dollars to slow the won's decline. \nThat's a turnabout from its tactics earlier this year to weaken a currency that had become less competitive against Japan's sharply weaker yen. It also kept rates unchanged this month, two days after China's devaluation. \nMUFJ's Tan reckons Asian central banks could coordinate policies better and be more proactive in using their trillions of dollars in currency reserves to defend their currencies. \n\"Asian central banks are already on the defensive, but the question is a strong versus a weak defence. \n\"They have a chance to prove that, by driving rates up and making it very expensive to hold these short-term positions.\" \n(Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Will Waterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T05:51:34.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
