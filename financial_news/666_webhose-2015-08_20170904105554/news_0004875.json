Photo: Louie Douvis\nElizabeth Broderick was working recently with NATO in Brussels when she was interrupted by the ding of a new text message.\n\"I look at it and it's my son, 'Mum what's for dinner?,' he says ... 'Hello, I'm in Brussels, ask Dad, he's standing beside you,'\" said Ms Broderick, who has served for eight years as the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner.\n\"And I thought I'm such a failure.\"\nToo many men pretend they don't have family responsibilities while at work.\nMs Broderick shared this anecdote to illustrate the everyday battles on the road to gender equality.\nAdvertisement The story also goes to the heart of one of her key messages for working fathers as she nears the end of her time as commissioner: that everyone battles with family pressure and setting examples that break the mould.\nToo many men pretended they didn't have family responsibilities while they were at work and this created a distorted \"ideal worker model, someone who was available 24/7 without any visible caring responsibilities\", she said.\nThe benefits of men making their family or \"caring responsibilities\" visible to their employees at work reverberated throughout a workplace, she said.\n\"When men step up and work differently ... it says you can be a serious player at work and an engaged dad.\n\"That role modelling, that sharing of yourself, your personal experience, your personal challenges is so important and it's what I call courageous leadership.\"\nA few more chores Men also might need to pick up a few more chores around the house to improve the nation's workplaces, Ms Broderick told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) lunch.\nShe said if she could do only one thing as commissioner to create greater gender equality, it would be the \"better sharing of paid and unpaid work between men and women\".\n\"Which is why flexible work is so important and interestingly a number of companies are now making flexibility the starting place ... so every role in the organisation is available as a flexible work arrangement.\"\nSince introducing this almost a year ago, Telstra had reported a 300 per cent increase in the number of male managers taking primary parental leave, she said.\nOnly two of management consulting firm McKinsey & Company's 20 global partners in Australia and New Zealand are women.\nAustralian and New Zealand managing partner John Lydon took a course of action that staked his own performance on redressing this imbalance.\n​\"I went out publicly with my partners, with my clients, with the global firm and I said, 'I will have failed as managing partner if we do not have 10 female partners' [in the next four years],\" Mr Lydon said.\nChange the system \"That starts the dialogue of what do we have to do to change the system. Not change the women, change the system.\n\"It's disruptive. It won't be enough but it's a start.\"\nMr Lydon was one of three panelists discussing gender equality in the workplace with Ms Broderick at the CEDA event. The others were Jo Fisher Executive Group managing director Jo Fisher and AusNet Services managing director Nino Ficca.\n​In recent weeks analysts have raised concerns over corporate governance at AusNet after overseas power giants and controlling shareholders Singapore Power and State Grid Corporation of China voted to remove independent director Tony Iannello.\nMr Ficca said actions spoke louder than words when it came to gender equality in the workplace and he admitted there was still a some way to go to stamp out discrimination.\n\"The answer is culture in organisations – not only what happens when people are watching but what happens when no one is watching,\" Mr Ficca said.\n\"I would say everyone should take some action. We are good at words ... but do something in terms of total diversity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:55:28.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
