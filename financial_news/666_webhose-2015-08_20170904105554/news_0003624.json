You Can Still See Your Favorite TV Shows Written by: Naomi Mannino 08/06/15 - 10:52 AM EDT Tickers in this article: AAPL AMZN CBS NFLX YHOO \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Ever click through all 700 HD channels on your cable or satellite service channel lineup only to announce, \"Nothing's on...\" with a long sigh? Maybe you added a streaming service such as Netflix , Hulu Plus or Amazon Prime to get more shows when you want them. Or maybe you want to cut the cable cord entirely and just use video streaming but are worried about missing live sports and live news. To your cord-cutting arsenal, you can add SlingTV, a new streaming package by Dish Network (but without the dish) released in March that just might make cutting the cable cord a viable option. Now there's another choice: CBS will sell Showtime as a standalone over-the-top content (OTT) through Hulu for for $8.99 a month, cheaper than the $14.99-per-month HBO Now. \n“Sling TV includes ESPN and CNN among others and is a great option for people who want to cut the cable cord but can't live without those additional live sports and live news channels,” says Andrea Woroch, a consumer savings expert. \nOfficially termed SVOD (subscription video-on-demand) and OTT TV-watching, online streaming services like these add more options to the traditional TV channel lineup from a paid cable or satellite provider. More Headlines What Rental Car Insurance Do You Really Need? \nDigital TV Research projected the number of worldwide households using SVOD would grow from 21 million in 2010 to 83 million in 2014 and 199 million in 2020. Almost half (46%) of households in the U.S. have streaming service as of July, according to Nielsen. That percentage jumps to 62% among Millennials. This is all part of the changing tide -- less bland and general cable, more targeted on-damand. In fact, as TheStreet previously reported , when Disney announced that ESPN had \"modest subscriber losses\" in its second quarter, shares tumbled 9.2% on Wednesday . This is indicative of the future. \nWith SVOD apps using a streaming device connecting your TV to the Internet, there is now the option of cutting out the paid cable subscription service (and bill) entirely, but there is a learning curve and you'll need a major attitude adjustment. Once you've learned to watch TV this new way, you'll be getting so much more from your TV while paying much less. Cancel the cable/satellite service...and bill \nCord-cutting is all the rage. The cable industry shrank at a rate of 0.5% in the 12 months ending in May, according to media industry research firm MoffettNathanson . That's at least in part due to cost. If you've been paying for cable or satellite TV, you paid an average of $86 per month in 2011, according to The NPD Group. Rising to a 2015 prediction of $123 per month, you could be spending $1,476 per year, just for pay-TV programming. As a result, the U.S. in 2014 lost 176,000 subscribers to cable TV, satellite or fiber services, according to research firm SNL Kagan -- the second straight year of decline. Could you use that extra $100 elsewhere in your budget? If so, simply call up your provider and cancel your service. Be prepared for the provider to offer to reduce your rate or try to get you to bundle up and pay even more. Once the cable or satellite box is gone, you'll need to reconfigure your TV for SVOD viewing. Connect your TV to a video streaming device \nIf you hate watching TV on your iPad or computer, you'll need to connect your TV (via the HDMI port) to a video streaming device which connects it to the Internet wirelessly, as 47% of households already did in 2014, according to NPD Group. Then, you suddenly have access to a whole new world of viewing content in the form of \"apps\" that represent each channel you already know and love plus many more you've yet to discover. John Buffone, Connected Intelligence industry analyst for The NPD Group, says one of the big changes this year is increased affordability of these devices with an average one-time price as low as $35. \"Since cost is removed from the equation, you can try the one that appeals to you most,\" he says. Roku: ($49 at Walmart online) is a tiny device loaded with hundreds of free and paid SVOD apps accessed with its own remote. Chromecast: ($34.99 at Walmart online) uses your Smartphone, laptop or tablet as the remote. When accessed via a laptop it can pull up any webpage onto your TV. Apple TV: If you're a big Apple user, the Apple TV ( which now has a reduced price of $68 ) device can access all content from your iPhone and iPad as well as a huge library of TV and movie viewing apps. HBO Now will be available exclusively on Apple TV. \nOther choices include streaming devices from NetGear and the new Amazon Fire TV ($99 on Amazon.com). Blu-ray Disc players and gaming consoles such as PlayStation 3 or Xbox One also double as streaming video devices. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:29:34.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
