Photo: Andrew Quilty\nA suspected Russian hacker has targeted retail shareholder accounts held by Commsec, E*TRADE and Australian Investment Exchange last year, authorities said.\nThe corporate regulator and federal police said that the Supreme Court of NSW has seized more than $77,000, after a Russian hacker, a holder of an overseas account that traded through a Morgan Stanley account, made suspicious trades in the second half of last year as part of alleged money laundering.\nAs a financial institution we remain vigilant at all times to fraud and continues to deploy the most advanced security systems and processes available in an effort to stay ahead of criminal behaviour.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia spokesman The suspected Russian hacker targeted 13 ASX-listed penny stocks using retail shareholder accounts on major trading platforms and artificially inflated their share prices. The alleged hacker then traded out of the positions and collected the profits.\nMarket manipulation can result in up to 10 years in jail, and internet hacking an additional 10 years in jail.\n\"There's no one at Morgan Stanley who's done anything wrong and no Morgan Stanley accounts have been hacked,\" a Morgan Stanley spokesman said.\nCourt action A spokesman for Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which owns CommSec and Australian Investment Exchange, said: \"The matter is currently subject to court action and investigations and it is not appropriate for us to disclose details. However, as a financial institution we remain vigilant at all times to fraud and continues to deploy the most advanced security systems and processes available in an effort to stay ahead of criminal behaviour.\"\nAn ANZ E*TRADE spokeswoman said: \"The incidents were the result of clients' computers being compromised and therefore hackers being able to access their online trading accounts, and not a breach of E*TRADE's security.\"\nThe affected customers had their passwords reset and were sent communications about the importance of keeping passwords safe, keeping anti-virus software up-to-date and not clicking on suspicious emails, ANZ said.\nThe matter will return to court in February 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:53:17.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
