Why rail fares are going up and why the system is flawed By Peter Spence | Telegraph â€“ 26 minutes ago CPICQ 0.011 \nRail fares still rise or fall in line with the \"outdated\" and discredited retail price index - which economists want to scrap anyway \nEvery August, new data will determine how much commuters have to cough up for train fares in the year to come. \nThat's when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes retail price index (RPI) inflation data for the year to July. \nUsing inflation - the average change in prices - to benchmark rail fares should mean that prices don't rise too fast compared to other living costs that commuters face. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's an important date for rail passengers - but how does the process work? \n= How are rail fare increases calculated? = \nRail companies are only allowed to increase their prices by whatever the RPI inflation figure turns out to be in the year to July, plus a set amount. \nAt the moment, that set amount is zero, as George Osborne, the Chancellor, has capped increases in line with RPI. \nWhile some fares may rise by more than RPI, and some by less, operators can not increase their average fare by more than RPI. \nSo the July data is a critical release for commuters across the country. \nWith the measure at 1pc in the year to July 2015 , rail passengers can now expect their fares to increase up to an average of 1pc in January 2016. \n= RPI? People still use this? = \nYou might be forgiven for forgetting RPI even existed. It's been phased out in a lot of places. \nThe Bank of England has targeted the consumer price index (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) measure of inflation since 2003 , as it became the preferred official measure. RPI doesn't even have \"national statistic\" status any more, after it was debadged in early 2013 . \nBut there are politically convenient reasons to hang on to RPI. It tends to run hotter than CPI, so if you're a politician wanting to cut costs, linking spending increases CPI can save you money. \nThat was one way the Chancellor was able to save money in the last Parliament, by linking several benefits to CPI rather than RPI. \nBut if you're a regular train user, the fact that rail fares are linked to RPI may irritate you because it means operators have been able to charge far more over the years than if fare increases had been measured using CPI. \nThat explains why the Treasury has been criticised when stating that rail fares wil increase by no more than \"inflation\" - it depends which measure of inflation you use. \nSir Andrew Dilnot, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, last year said references to RPI \"could have been worded more precisely\" as the public \"might incorrectly have inferred\" that inflation referred to CPI. \n= Why do economists hate RPI? = \nThe RPI measure itself is very contentious. \nSome would love to see it stay - they have investments linked to it and could stand to lose if they were linked to CPI instead - but economists argue that RPI is fundamentally broken. \nLord King, the former governor of the Bank of England, has said that RPI is \"outdated\", while Britain's former national statistician, Jill Matheson, described it as \"flawed\". \nThe most common criticism of RPI as an inflation measure is that it fails to do what it says on the tin - it doesn't really tell you what's happened to prices. \nIt is calculated using the so-called Carli formula, which statisticians across the world have tried to move away from. \nUsing this method, the figures will suggest that inflation is running above zero, even if prices have not changed. \nIf prices rise from a given starting point, and then fall back to that same point, the Carli formula RPI will tell you prices have risen. \nThis means RPI has overstated inflation for years. \nIt's not, therefore, a measure to be taken seriously when trying to assess the health of the economy or to judge whether living costs are rising. \nAnd it will come as no surprise that many would like to see the ONS scrap the measure entirely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T16:31:06.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
