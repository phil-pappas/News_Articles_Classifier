The company surveyed up to ten lenders in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. in June 2015. Bankrate’s researchers obtained online good faith estimates for a $200,000 mortgage to buy a single-family home with a 20% down payment. The costs include fees charged by lenders, as well as third-party fees for services such as appraisals. The survey excludes discount points, taxes, title fees, property insurance, association fees, interest and other prepaid items. \nThe highest average closing costs vary from state to state with the highest costs occurring in Hawaii at $2,163, followed by New Jersey at $2,094, Connecticut at $2,033, West Virginia at $1,971 and Arizona at $1,969. The lowest closing costs are in Ohio at $1,613, Idaho at $1,682, Wyoming at $1,689, Utah at $1,697 and Maine at $1,727. \n“Homebuyers have more say over closing costs than they think,” said Holden Lewis, Bankrate.com’s senior mortgage analyst. “The costs vary between lenders, so everyone should compare at least three different options. You don’t have to go with the lender your agent suggests.” \nThe average origination fee declined 22% to $1,041 and the average third-party fees rose 22% to $807 in the U.S. The origination fee is charged by a lender for every loan. \nSome of the expenses can be covered by various housing programs funded by federal grants. Workshops to educate home buyers are sponsored by HUD- approved nonprofit agencies are a “great way to gain a better understanding of closing costs,” said McClary. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T00:09:06.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
