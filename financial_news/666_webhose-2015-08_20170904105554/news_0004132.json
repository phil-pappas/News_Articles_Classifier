Franklin\nThe promise by Domino's Pizza to have food at the door in 15 minutes is another indication that we want things and we want them now.\nWhether that's food, clothing, books or whatever else is bought online.\nIn the US it's called The Last Mile and comes as the rapidly evolving consumer demands have made it a priority for e-commerce retailers to provide same-day delivery options.\nOne of the driving forces is the impatience of consumers, who want the same convenience and swiftness of delivery as though they are using a traditional bricks and mortar store.\nAdvertisement In New York, where the population far exceeds Australia, if an item isn't delivered by the promised time, its game over for the retailer.\nThis Last Mile service has been implemented in select US cities, mainly the nation's largest metropolitan areas by population, but over the next several years it is likely to be offered in most markets across the country.\nAccording to CBRE agents in the US, distribution and fulfillment supply chains, which have traditionally been designed for two to three day coverage of the country and multi-day delivery times, are being transformed to accommodate these short delivery promises.\nGaining access to densely populated areas in particular, to the e-commerce shoppers who likely live in those areas is a priority.\nLight industrial properties typically smaller than 2000 square metres and often located in or adjacent to infill urban markets, have been identified as the solution to the \"last mile\" problem.\nAmazon, which is looking to break into the Australian market, is leading the charge in the US, with mandates out to agents to find smaller sites that will allow same-day delivery.\nOne group in Australia, that has grown from a small warehouse in Artarmon to a large centre at Lidcombe, is Booktopia. The founder, Tony Nash, said the drive to make delivery efficient, means they need to be near infrastructure.\nTo ensure the group reaches it clients from remote cattle stations to inner city suburbs, it has teamed up with Australia Post.\n\"To do a good job, we need to offer the last mile service,\" Mr Nash said.\nCBRE's national director of industrial & logistics services Australia, Jason Edge, who worked closely with Booktopia's leases, said the last mile was the most important for the e-commerce sector.\n\"Demand for the inner city infill sites has boomed, particularly around Artarmon in Sydney's north and South Sydney, where the sites are smaller and have access to infrastructure,\" Mr Edge said.\n\"On time and swift delivery is a point of difference in the competitive e-commerce sector and we field many inquiries for these sites that are close to customers.\"\nMr Edge said the last mile infill sector will soon spread to the fast growing western suburbs of Sydney, where demand is growing for online sales.\nGreg Goodman, the chief executive of Goodman, said while industrial is being squeezed out by residential developments, particularly around South Sydney, any smaller sites his group has are being snapped up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:40:36.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
