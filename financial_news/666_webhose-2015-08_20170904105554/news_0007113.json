Keeping these changing landscapes and newly demanded requirement by professionals in mind, Prof Moorad Choudhry has introduced the Certificate of Bank Treasury Risk Management (BTRM). The BTRM is a six month part time course designed to empower individuals working in, or intending to work in, every aspect of bank risk management and asset liability management. The BTRM is unique in being the only professional qualification for bank Treasury, Finance and Risk professionals that covers every aspect of bank ALM and liquidity risk management. ALM is the core discipline in banking and every bank should have mastered it irrespective of its business model or product suite. Liquidity risk, interest-rate risk, credit risk, currency risk, capital planning and cash management are all encapsulated in ALM for all bankers.\nQuantInsti, which is a renowned leader in the field of education on algorithmic trading, has partnered with BTRM (UK) and UNICOM (UK + India) to easily facilitate access to a unique globally accredited certification in bank treasury risk management in the Asia-Pacific region.
