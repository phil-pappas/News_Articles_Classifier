They have a lot of store openings, while the major multiple grocers are either axing or slowing down openings Chris Longbottom Kantar Worldpanel director of client services Chris Longbottom said that the two could grow to take up to 13 per cent of the market, depending on how quickly they can find and open new stores. He said: “The thing about the discounters is that they never let up. They have a lot of store openings, while the major multiple grocers are either axing or slowing down openings. \"Aldi and Lidl have over 9 per cent of the market, but they could get to 12-13 per cent depending on the amount of store openings.” Meanwhile, Tuesday will mark Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis’ first anniversary in charge. Although many analysts and investors say that they acknowledge the vast challenges Lewis faces in his battle to turn around the fortunes of Britain’s biggest retailer, they say that his “honeymoon period” is over. Although he has made progress in his efforts to arrest Tesco’s falling sales and improve its finances, including the intended sale of its South Korean division Homeplus, Lewis has so far been unable to stop the firm’s share price sliding. When he took over, Tesco shares were trading at 225.6p a share. On Friday, they closed at 191.4p. However Lewis’s efforts to revive Tesco has the support of its staff. According to company ratings website Glassdoor, the chief executive’s approval rating has risen from 69 per cent to 81 per cent over the past year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:41:19.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
