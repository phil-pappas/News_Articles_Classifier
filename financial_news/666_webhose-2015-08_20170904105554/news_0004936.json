The arbitrator called their lawyer who so happened to be within the nearby complex and he indicated that he has since renounced agency. \"The arbitrator said he was keen to give them another chance and on Monday we will serve letters to their secretary-general (Webster Chikengezha) and if they do not come on Friday next week the arbitrator will proceed with a matter as a default case. \n\"They are already in breach of the deed of settlement so we just want judgment on the full settlement,\" Magaya said. \nMutasa declined to discuss the matter referring all questions to the Dynamos management. \n\"I cannot comment on the issue anymore, I can't even comment on our relationship, there are issues to be sorted out with my clients so you would have to speak to them,\" Mutasa said. \nDynamos president Kenny Mubaiwa said he did not have finer details of the matter as it was being handled by Marechera, who however could not be reached for comment. \n\"The matter was being handled by our treasurer, but I am aware that we have been making some payments but I don't have the finer details,\" Mubaiwa said. \nOnce the parties struck an agreement on a payment plan in which Dynamos will also cede the motor vehicle they had given the coach as a company car a Honda CRV Nhandara indicated that the Labour office would now issue a settlement certificate. \nThe move by the coaches and the club to strike an arrangement also helped avert the matter spilling into arbitration at the Labour Court. \nCrucially for Pasuwa, Dynamos made a major climb down from the $15 000 they had demanded for the motor vehicle and the $1 000 they had also claimed the coach was owing, \"in respect of the TV set, DVD, washing machine and TV stand\" which the coach was alleged to have held onto. \nInstead the value of the Honda CRV was put at $3 750 with the consent of the parties.
