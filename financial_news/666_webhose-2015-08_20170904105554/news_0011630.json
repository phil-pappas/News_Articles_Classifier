At one point during the session Wall Street was more than 2.5 per cent in the black.\n“It’s now some time since the US stock market has had a major correction. This makes it vulnerable to volatility once some large moves have started and markets are concerned that it could take some time for things to settle down,” Mr Spooner said.\nLocally, in economic news today, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens is slated to speak at the National Reform Summit.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics releases quarterly construction work figures.\nIn equities news, Seven Group, Westfield Corporation, BC Iron and WorleyParsons all release financial results.\nThe local market yesterday posted its strongest gains in almost four years in a remarkable turnaround from Monday's $64 billion plunge.\nThe benchmark ASX 200 index was up 136 points, or 2.7 per cent, at 5137.3 points.\nThe broader All Ordinaries index was up 129.6 points, or 2.58 per cent, at 5143.8 points.\nOriginally published as Aussie stocks slide after wild Wall St ride ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/australian-share-market-slides-following-wild-swings-on-wall-street/story-e6frfm1i-1227499332676?sv=fe25ada5a2bd09f467bcb6fe88e7224f", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/australian-share-market-slides-following-wild-swings-on-wall-street/story-e6frfm1i-1227499332676?sv=fe25ada5a2bd09f467bcb6fe88e7224f&title=Aussie+stocks+slide+after+wild+Wall+St+ride", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/australian-share-market-slides-following-wild-swings-on-wall-street/story-e6frfm1i-1227499332676?sv=fe25ada5a2bd09f467bcb6fe88e7224f&title=Aussie+stocks+slide+after+wild+Wall+St+ride", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/australian-share-market-slides-following-wild-swings-on-wall-street/story-e6frfm1i-1227499332676?sv=fe25ada5a2bd09f467bcb6fe88e7224f", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/australian-share-market-slides-following-wild-swings-on-wall-street/story-fni0dcne-1227499332676", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Aussie+stocks+slide+after+wild+Wall+St+ride&c=THE+Australian+stockmarket+has+lost+ground+today+after+a+wild+swing+in+late+trading+saw+Wall+Street+close+weaker+for+the%26nbsp%3Bsixth+straight+session.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/australian-share-market-slides-following-wild-swings-on-wall-street/story-e6frfm1i-1227499332676?sv=fe25ada5a2bd09f467bcb6fe88e7224f", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/australian-share-market-slides-following-wild-swings-on-wall-street/story-e6frfm1i-1227499332676?sv=fe25ada5a2bd09f467bcb6fe88e7224f&h=Aussie+stocks+slide+after+wild+Wall+St+ride"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:36:58.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
