As a result, the ZCTU organised a two-day strike in December 1997 against undesirable taxes, dubbed a \"stayaway\", which at the time was the largest mass action seen in Zimbabwe. Government was so shaken that the police invaded the ZCTU offices in Harare and bashed then ZCTU secretary-general, Morgan Tsvangirai, now MDC-T leader. \nGovernment however backtracked by shelving the offending piece of tax legislation as a result of the strike. \nBut more was to come. In January 1998 government was further shaken by bread riots accompanied by widespread looting as thousands of people displayed their anger at the increase in prices of basic commodities, and a general fall in living standards. \nGovernment's reaction was heavy-handed as armed police officers and the army were deployed in townships to ruthlessly crush the protest, assaulting and injuring many people in the process. There were reports at least 10 people died during the process as government resorted to a \"shoot-to-kill\" backlash. \nA leading activist at that time, former Finance minister Tendai Biti, who is now MDC Renewal secretary-general, was quoted in the International Socialism Journal of 2002 saying: \"This was a momentous occasion in the history of this country because it brought confidence -- you could smell working class power in the air\". \nAccording to a dissertation by Joe Sutcliffe titled Labour Movement in Zimbabwe 1980-2012, between 1996 and 1998 ZCTU organised strikes that attracted approximately 1 073 000 workers, demonstrating the power the organisation wielded. \nSo strong was the trade union movement then that in 1999 it culminated in the formation of a strong opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), as social and economic discontent surged amid political agitation for change. \nThe labour-backed MDC subsequently gave Zanu PF a good run for its money in elections that followed between 2000 and 2008. \nFast-forward to 2015 and you have a ZCTU that is now a pale shadow of the massive movement that gave the government sleepless nights almost two decades ago. One of the major factors is the country's economic meltdown which has resulted in the majority of formal sector workers losing employment, severely weakening the labour movement in the process. The country has an unemployment rate of more than 85%, and counting. This has decimated the labour movement's support base and structures. \nAs a result, the ZCTU has in recent years dismally failed to mobilise workers to demonstrate against the collapse of the country's industry which has seen the manufacturing sector operating at 36,3% capacity, down from 57,2% in 2011. \nAt least 7 000 employees were retrenched last year, with more than 50 companies letting go of workers amid operational challenges epitomised by a swingeing liquidity crunch. \nIn the past three weeks, about 20 000 workers lost their jobs in an unprecedented wave of retrenchments and dismissals following a Supreme Court ruling confirming employers' right to remove workers on three months' notice without paying severance packages. \nSo pre-occupied are hard-pressed Zimbabweans with eking out a living, mostly in the burgeoning informal sector, that they seem to no longer have the time or appetite to heed the ZCTU's strike calls -- dancing in the streets and waving placards. \nThe ZCTU has lost its mass support, capacity to mobilise and gravitas largely due to the protracted economic problems which have been gripping the country since the late 1990s, that resulted in massive company closures and intensified job losses. So the labour movement is now largely a shell and thus powerless. \nThis was the case in April this year when only a handful of workers responded to a call by the ZCTU to demonstrate against government's failure to take the Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF) -- comprising government, labour and business -- seriously. \nAn indication that government knew the demonstration would lack bite was the fact that it was monitored by a few uninterested police officers, whereas in the past the cops would have been out in full force, ready to mete out \"instant justice\". \nAccording to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) 2014 Labour Survey report, 94% of the currently employed aged 15 years and above are informally employed while 98% of the currently employed youths aged between 15-24years and 96% of the currently employed youths aged between 15 -34 years were in informal employment. \nThis week the ZCTU called for countrywide mass demonstrations tomorrow in response to massive job cuts in both the private and public sectors, triggered by the Supreme Court ruling. \nThe response to the ZCTU's call to arms will test if the union can still boast of relevance apart from sitting on the negotiating table in TNF meetings. \nJudging from recent such botched attempts, the strike is likely to be another damp squib, serving only to reflect how the labour movement's fortunes have nosedived. \nSocial commentator Blessing Vava says there is no doubt that the ZCTU is losing its clout due to economic and labour shifts. \n\"It's an open secret that the ZCTU is a now beleaguered union, led by career unionists who are now serving interests of political parties, especially the MDC-T, at the expense of its membership, the workers,\" Vava said. \n\"The ZCTU has lost ground; they have become spineless and clueless. They do not represent workers, hence they only shout from their air-conditioned offices when workers are wallowing in poverty. It is now an empty shell of its former self in that it is now like the proverbial empty vessel making a lot of unco-ordinated noise aimed at massaging the egos of factional politics.\" \nHowever, ZCTU secretary-general Japhet Moyo is adamant that the labour movement can still pack a punch, arguing that the union's membership is still very much alive. \n\"We represent workers at national, regional, continental and ILO (International Labour Organisation) level,\" Moyo said. \"We run one of the biggest research institutes in Zimbabwe which assists unions and workers' committees with data for collective purposes. We are currently dealing with labour law reform at national level. \n\"Workers need unions now more than yesterday; therefore labour unions are more relevant when the state abdicates its role to protect them through favourable legislation.We were ambushed by capitalists using the state, but the struggle is not lost.\" \nAs for the April demonstration flop, Moyo said: \"These are casualties in a battle, but the war is not lost. It was successful because a demonstration is a form of airing views, the numbers might no longer be important in our economy which is informalised. The publicity we got is what matters and it's enough to send a message. \n\"Mind you the decline of trade union membership has been as a result of company closures and restructuring, and capital migration because of political risk factors, not that trade unions were weak in defending their turf.\" \nWhile the proposed mass action tomorrow could be a barometer to gauge ZCTU's clout and relevance, the job losses over the years have surely taken their toll on the former vibrant organisation. Suffice it to say, that \"smell of working class power in the air\" is now hardly discernable. \nFollow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T09:10:47.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
