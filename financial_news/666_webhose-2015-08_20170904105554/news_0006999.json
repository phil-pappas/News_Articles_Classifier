At 0900 BST, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.8%, Germany's DAX was 1% weaker and France's CAC 40 was down 0.9%. \n\"While there is continuing concern that the current slowdown seen in Chinese economic growth might be spreading across the region it also seems that a lack of confidence that the Chinese government and PBoC will take sufficient measures to turn things around is hurting stocks,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \n\"The main focus today will be on the release of the FOMC minutes and US inflation data later today. The FOMC minutes will be of special interest as in recent weeks several FOMC members have voiced different opinions on just how urgent a rate hike is on the agenda.\" On the corporate front, Vestas Wind Systems (Other OTC: VWDRY - news ) fell 2%. Although the Danish wind turbine maker's second-quarter profit beat expectations, the company's services margins fell short of consensus estimates. \nCarlsberg (Other OTC: CABGY - news ) slumped 7% after the brewer cut its profit forecasts and posted weaker-than-expected operating profit for the second quarter. \nLondon-listed miner Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) dropped 2%. Although the company's first-half earnings beat analysts' expectations, investors were disappointed that it cut its capex target for the full year. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Imperial Tobacco (LSE: IMT.L - news ) were flat after it delivered a slightly light set of nine-month results Swiss pharmaceutical group Roche slipped 0.3% after saying it has bought US gene-technology company Kapa Biosystems for an undisclosed sum. \nAdmiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) bucked the trend, rallying 3% after the insurer reported a forecast-beating 1% rise in first-half pre-tax profit as it benefited from growing customer numbers. \nAside from company news, Greece remained in focus, with the German and other European parliaments due to vote on the country's third bailout. \nThere are no major Eurozone data releases due but in the US, the consumer price index for July is scheduled for release at 1330 BST. \nThe FOMC minutes from the July meeting are due after the European close at 1900 BST.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T12:24:18.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
