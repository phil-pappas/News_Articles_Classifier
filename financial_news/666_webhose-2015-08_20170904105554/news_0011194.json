Investors need to refrain from selling their equities and should instead use their extra cash from CDs or savings accounts to purchase them at discounted prices, Byzyka said. Instead of viewing the market correction as an opportunity to buy cheaper stocks, many investors are motivated by fear and tend to sell their equity holdings.

They wouldn’t hesitate to purchase their car if it drops in price by 10% tomorrow, yet they won’t purchase equities.” \nA correction is actually good for the market but often produces a negative outcome for investors, because instead of sticking to a “well thought out strategy,” they use their emotions to make impulsive decisions, said Matthew Tuttle, portfolio manager of the Tuttle Tactical Management U.S. Core ETF in Stamford, Conn. \n“It is awful for investors because when people are scared, they tend to do stupid things with their money,” he said. \nVolatility is beneficial for the market, because it does not “go up in a straight line,” Tuttle said. \n“The larger the correction, the bigger the rally can be,” he said. “We have been locked in a trading range all year, so this could knock us out of that.” \nThe market will continue to produce additional volatility due to China’s slowdown, Greece’s continued economic issues and other geopolitical concerns, Byzyka said. \n“We’re in a stage of the U.S. equity market that has severely lacked downside volatility and is on a record three year stretch of calm, he said. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:36:59.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
