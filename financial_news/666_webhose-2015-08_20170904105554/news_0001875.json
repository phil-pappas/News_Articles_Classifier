Simple. It’s a very simple, easy and obvious way of improving our likely long-term investment returns.\nWhat is beyond dispute is that many stocks in Greece are at this point incredibly cheap by almost any measure. Math, logic and a great deal of financial research argue that most of us should be allocating a few percentage points of our total stock portfolio to the Greek stock market right now. Even if we don’t manage an “active” portfolio. Especially if we don’t, actually.\nContrary to conventional “wisdom” and popular delusions, such a move is neither “risky” nor complex. Indeed it’s relatively easy.\nBut I’ll bet almost nobody takes advantage — more’s the pity.\nFew things are as little understood as investing, and rarely are they are misunderstood as when they are most interesting and useful. Like now.\nThe modern cult of “target-date” funds and “index funds” and “passive portfolios” has a lot to recommend it. But it also has its flaws, or limitations. Index funds, after all, are not an end in themselves. They are merely a means to an end. They are simply a way of owning a very widely diversified portfolio of stocks at a very low cost. Each individual stock is “risky.” But the more of them you own the more the risks offset each other.\nOver the years, an enormous body of research has found any investor could have done even better than the standard U.S. indexes, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500, very simply.\nIn a nutshell, investors have earned higher long-term returns, and made more money, when they have invested globally (rather than just in the U.S.), favored unfashionable stocks that were inexpensive compared to underlying fundamentals such as earnings, dividends and net asset over fashionable stocks those were expensive, and favored unfashionable national stock markets around the world that were also inexpensive in relation to underlying fundamentals.\nNone of these findings is seriously disputed by anyone. At best, some “Indexers” have questioned how important these factors are — and whether they are really worth the added effort and cost of pursuing them.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T16:12:26.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
