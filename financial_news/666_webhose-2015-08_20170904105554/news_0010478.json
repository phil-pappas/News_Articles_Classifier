The I-195 Commission bought most of the land and is reselling it, although some was given for free for use as a public park. \nThe state Department of Transportation wrote to the Federal Highway Administration at the request of the I-195 Commission, which asked about the requirements for the land. \nThe federal agency responded Aug. 13, telling the transportation department that the land given to the commission for free has a stipulation on the deed that it remains open space. \nAny change in use would require the land to be first returned to the department of transportation and sold at fair market value, the letter states. \nThe team’s original proposal called for building a Providence stadium on a 5-acre parcel designated as open space and surrounding land. \nThe commission in January agreed to sell a smaller parcel that is not on the waterfront for $750,000. The 5-acre riverfront parcel eyed by the PawSox is 15 times that size.
