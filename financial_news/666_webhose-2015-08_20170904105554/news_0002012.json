Players take on the role of a gun turret operator on a mining vessel, and as part of the ship’s defence team is tasked with protecting the rig from pirates and other would-be attackers. \nNaturally, Gunjack is played from first-person perspective, with the announcement trailer showcasing some of the rather splendid Unreal Engine 4 visuals. CCP describes the game as a “first-person arcade shooter,” which suggests that players will largely be moving around on rails, especially when coupled with the control limitations of the Samsung Gear VR platform.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T13:51:39.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
