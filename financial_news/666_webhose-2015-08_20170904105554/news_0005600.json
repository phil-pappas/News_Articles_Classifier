We need to sharpen up the productivity of the company, and we need to sharpen the nature of the decision-making processes in the company, they are actually quite cumbersome,” the executive chairman said. \nIf those changes are successful, then the bank could report much healthier returns for investors, which would be positive for its credit rating, according to Moody's. \n“The firm announced an additional medium-term target cost-to-income ratio in the mid-50s. The additional revenues and cost reductions needed to reach this target, if done prudently, would increase the firm’s buffer against unexpected losses, a credit positive,” said Mr Roccati.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:43:40.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
