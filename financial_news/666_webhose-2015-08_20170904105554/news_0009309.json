Mr Arnold also predicts more lenders will reduce or stop the rate discounts they had given investors while tweaking discounts offered to owner occupiers through package deals which combine home loans, credit cards and savings accounts. \"I think between the fixed rates and the package discounts, even more of that differential pricing for the whole variable book, investors are going to be paying a lot more,\" he said. \"Risk-based pricing is something I think in general we're going to see more of, whether that's residential versus investment or within residential we're already seeing a lot more pricing by LVR (loan-to-valuation ratio) - you have a big deposit, you pay less.\" The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has set a \"speed limit\" restricting growth in investor lending to 10 per cent a year and will require banks to hold more capital against their mortgage books. Mr Arnold said the changes are designed to stabilise the market and slow housing price growth. \"As an owner occupier that is what you want: it's your home, it's your biggest investment. You don't want property prices increasing too quickly if that means that they're going to come down in price at some point. \"It also means that if you're an upgrader, if investors aren't running so hot then it eases the competition for who you're fighting against in the property ladder.\" Westpac, Australia's largest lender to landlords, on Friday said its standard variable rate for investors will rise by 27 basis points.
