While you're away, your self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) annual return needs to be lodged with the tax office. Will the accounts be ready and the fund audited in time? Will you have minutes in place for the trustee meeting you're yet to have (and it's an important one because, among other things, you've got to review the fund's investment strategy, even if you don't think things will change)? Do you really need this?\nOr perhaps you're moving overseas permanently and because of issues with the central management and control of your fund and inability to contribute further, you decide it's no longer appropriate.\nEither way – or perhaps due to other circumstances entirely – you may be considering whether to wind up your DIY fund.\nIf you're retired, it may be about wanting to sit back with your super pension, to enjoy life without the burden of managing your own fund. While fund administration is usually outsourced to specialist providers, as a trustee the buck stops with you as your responsibilities cannot be delegated.\nYou could be considering moving your retirement savings to a mainstream fund for strategic, rather than lifestyle, reasons. Estate planning is a good case in point.\nEstate planning is important at any age, but obviously becomes more imperative the older you get. You want your wealth to go to the right people in the most efficient and tax-effective manner. It means they get more.\nSo, when it comes to your super and getting more, wouldn't it be nice for your loved ones to get not only your death benefit when you die, but an additional benefit known as an anti-detriment payment? Not all funds, however, offer this payment and it's particularly difficult for SMSFs to pay it.\nSmart strategy needed It's not impossible for SMSFs to pay anti-detriment payments, but you must employ smart strategies to fund the payment. This is because the payment must first be made before it can be recouped via a tax deduction, and funding the payment can't come from members' accounts.\nOne strategy uses investment reserves, but this is merely robbing Peter to pay Paul. This is because the current member accumulates a reduced benefit or runs a lower pension balance because the money that would have otherwise been allocated to them is accumulating in a reserve to pay their spouse or son or daughter when they die. But if this same member was in another type of fund that paid an anti-detriment payment on death, then it would come as a true bonus or additional benefit to the spouse or kids, without any downside to the current member.\nSMSFs have their share of estate-planning problems. Without careful planning and execution, there is the risk that control of your fund when you die could end up in the wrong hands with the result that your entitlements go to the wrong person(s).\nRecent court cases highlight situations where intended beneficiaries have ended up being bitterly disappointed. Even when you think your affairs are in order, things may not be as they seem.\nIn one case, a binding death-benefit nomination failed as it did not follow the strict requirements of the fund's trust deed.\nUnintended consequences can and do happen. Other types of fund do, of course, have problems but some issues are peculiar to SMSFs.\nLosing touch Losing mental capacity is tragic. In SMSF space, it can be a real problem. Almost one in 10 people over 65 have dementia, and it's not confined to this age group.\nAccording to Alzheimer's Australia, there are more than 1800 new cases of dementia each week. This is expected to increase and there is no cure. Running an SMSF can get complicated if you lose capacity. Certainly you can (and should) take action to plan for this unfortunate event – for example, having an enduring power of attorney in place. This goes hand in hand with good estate planning, but you need to act before it's a problem.\nThere are excellent reasons for running your own fund. Generally, it should be all about what other funds can't offer – for example, a doctor wanting to use their super money to buy the premises from which they run their medical practice. As mainstream funds cannot deal with direct property, this asset class is the domain of SMSFs.\nBut there would be many investors who didn't have a \"unique\" reason for setting up their SMSF other than for \"control'. Or others who set it up because mainstream funds didn't offer certain features – for example, child-income streams on death or trading direct shares – or for strategic reasons that are no longer needed (such as managing reasonable benefit limits). For them, the time may come when they've had enough. It may be that the benefits are no longer there, the attraction has worn off or it's got too hard.\nDo your savings even need to be in super after retirement? Too many SMSFs have low balances. Why incur fees running a super fund for the privilege of a tax-free retirement when this could possibly be achieved investing outside super, given the amount that can be earned tax-free ($32,279 for singles and $28,974 for couples) with the seniors and pensioners tax offset?\nColin Lewis is head of strategic advice at Perpetual Private.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:03:30.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
