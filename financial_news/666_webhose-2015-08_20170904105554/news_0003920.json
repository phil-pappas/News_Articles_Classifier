Getty Images Share on twitter by John Stensholt The Professional Golfers Association of Australia is hoping Jason Day's record-breaking PGA Championship win will convince the federal government to help pay for a permanent $32 million home for the sport.\nPGA chief executive Brian Thorburn will travel to Canberra on Wednesday to lobby federal MPs for funds for the plan. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews – a golf tragic – has promised $10 million towards it.\nDay posted the highest score in majors history when he won the United States PGA Championship, the last of the four majors for the year, on Monday morning Australian time. He rose through the golf teaching ranks in Queensland before moving to the United States and turned professional aged 19 in mid-2006.\n\"No-one has ever shot 20-under in the history of the majors, which stretches back to 1860,\" said Mr Thorburn. \"So in that regard he's beaten the big names like Palmer, Nicklaus, Player and Woods.\"\nRanked fourth in the world before the PGA Championship, and having finished close to the top in several majors over the past three years, Day led for from start to finish in the fourth round, beating Jordan Spieth​ by three shots to take the $US1.8 million ($2.44 million) winners cheque.\nBattling adversity Day endured a bout of vertigo earlier this year and has overcome a difficult childhood, having lost his father to cancer at 12. \"I wouldn't be here if my father hadn't passed away,\" Day said after winning. \"One door closed, but another opened. My mum sacrificed for me.\"\nHe is one of seven Australians now ranked in the top 100 on the men's global tour, a fact Thorburn will be pointing out to politicians when lobbying for funds, and is the second to win a major in two years after Adam Scott's win at the 2013 US Masters.\n On the women's side, Karrie Webb was voted into the Ladies Professional Golf Association Hall of Fame before the end of her career and 19-year-old Minjee Lee is ranked 15th in the world.\nDay paid tribute to his long-time caddy Colin Swatton​, who taught Day as a teenage pupil at Kooralbyn International School in Queensland. Day was sent to the school after developing an alcohol problem, and Swatton helped him back onto his path to success.\nStringent coaching Thorburn said the Australian PGA's stringent coaching requirements have helped produce talents such as Day.\n\"We've got 1800 full-time PGA members teaching golf around the country ... and other countries look at our programs with some envy. Our pros spend three years as apprentices and have tough academic requirements as well as having to score on average 4.5 over par over 60 rounds in those three years –which is higher than any other PGA in the world,\" he said.\nThe Home of Golf plan includes a golf Hall of Fame and Museum, and practice and administrative facilities that will include all levels of professional and amateur golf.\nDay is the fifth Australian to have won the PGA Championship, following in the footsteps of Jim Ferrier (1947), David Graham (1979), Wayne Grady (1990) and Steve Elkington (1995).", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt", "http://www.lpga.com/"], "published": "2015-08-17T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:11:32.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
