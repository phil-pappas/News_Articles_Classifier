Dominic Lorrimer by Agnes King EY has a 14 per cent rise in reported income to $1.29 billion for the 12 months to June 30, on the back of asset privatisation programs in NSW, Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria, in further evidence that growth has returned to the global accounting profession despite tough trading conditions.\nPwC Australia revealed its full-year revenue had risen 10 per cent to $1.7 billion last month, while sales at Deloitte rose 15 per cent to $1.3 billion for the year to May 31, its highest growth rate in three years and a glowing inaugural result for its new chief executive Cindy Hook.\nKPMG Australia is due to release its numbers on Tuesday.\nEY's new chief executive Tony Johnson said net profit also improved by reining in travel and other non-essential expenses.\n\"There is constant pressure on margin but we focused on efficiency and it delivered,\" Mr Johnson said, adding that all EY's service lines grew.\nAdvisory was the outperformer, with sales up slightly over 30 per cent. This division accounts for roughly a third of EY's total income.\nMr Johnson expects this contribution to creep up to about 40 per cent over the next few years.\nSales in EY's transactions business rose 15 per cent through a collaboration with the advisory team on some big infrastructure asset sale programs.\n This also boosted EY's tax practice, which saw a 10 per cent increase in sales, while audit and assurance income rose by 5 per cent.\nIn the advisory division, sales in EY's performance improvement practice (code for cost-cutting and supply chain rationalisation) grew by over 40 per cent – a telltale sign of how corporate Australia is investing its time and energy.\nHowever, Mr Johnson said the year ahead will see big businesses undertake expensive, multi-year transformation work.\n\"Incremental cost-cutting [work] has been exhausted. There's an understanding they need to do something completely different,\" he said.\nClient focus The majority of this work has a strong customer bent.\n\"Many years ago it might have been possible to do a finance transformation without consideration of the customer – that's changed,\" Mr Johnson said.\nAdvisory also houses most of EY's seven acquisitions made in the last 12 months. These bolt-ons lifted revenue by about 1.5 per cent, quelling any concerns that the firm is buying growth at the expense of developing it organically.\nMr Johnson flagged further acquisitions in cyber security, data analytics and digital technology in the coming year.\n\"Demand in all three of those areas is significant,\" he said. \"There is quite a bit of competition for assets but we see it as a must-do. Clients are demanding it and we have to match it.\"\nEY is targeting \"close to double-digit growth\" for 2015-16.\n\"We're very conscious of global uncertainties but we've got a really strong pipeline,\" Mr Johnson said.\nThe professional services giant takes possession of its new futuristic Sydney premises mid-2016. Management is hopeful this will further boost employee engagement and collaboration. EY has invested heavily in this over the last 18 months to arrest a decline in employee satisfaction a few years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:15:01.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
