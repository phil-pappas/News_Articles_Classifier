The AAP govenment will sell onions at Rs 40 a kg at 280 locations across the city.\nFood and Civil Supplies Minister Asim Ahmed Khan said that onions will be sold at Fair Price Shops (FPS) in every ward of municipal corporations from Monday.\nKhan said that government will also sell onions through mobile shops where FPS is not close to residential locations, so that the public does not face any inconvenience.\n“The department of Food and Civil Supplies had begun its preparations to counter a possible rise in prices of onions in the rainy season since April.\n“Teams of Small Farmers Agro-Based Consortium (SFAC) were stationed at Nasik and were directed to procure and store adequate stocks of onions at hygienic cold stores,” Khan told reporters here.\nThe minister also said that the department was monitoring the prices and has now decided to intervene given the reasonable apprehension of rise in prices of onions and the hike in wholesale and retail prices in recent days.\n“The department has factored in the time it will take for receiving the stock from Nasik and for making it ready to be sold to consumers.\n“Delhi government will keep a close check on the prices of other essential commodities and has warned hoarders of strict action in case they indulge in this illegal activity,” he added.\n 04, 2015 8:35 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T04:57:46.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
