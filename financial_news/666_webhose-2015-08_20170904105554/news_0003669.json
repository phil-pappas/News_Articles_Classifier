One day someone played one of my (CDs).\n“The first song did nothing, but the next song was ‘Toxic’by Britney Spears-I smiled, tried moving my hips and lifting my arm waving it back and forth in the air trying to dance. That song was incorporated in ALL Therapy Sessions.u201d\nSix years later, the 13-year-old has posted an inspiring video of herself smiling and dancing to “Toxic”, in a Facebook post that has garnered nearly 270,000 views in less than two months.
