We really need to get the fixing down.” \nThe FCA’s regulatory decision committee reviews the findings of the watchdog on some contested matters. The panel is designed to be independent from the team at the centre of the issue, and hears cases where the person under investigation disputes the watchdog’s version of events. \nThe 11-person committee, staffed with former auditors, police and financiers, last month prompted the closure of the investigation into Bruno Iksil , the JP Morgan trader known as the London Whale. \nMeanwhile, the Serious Fraud Office aims to bring more charges against traders linked to the manipulation of Libor later this year. \"I have said further charges are likely ... in the autumn. Our Libor investigation is far-reaching and quite wide ... We haven’t finished yet,\" SFO director David Green told Reuters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T23:07:40.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
