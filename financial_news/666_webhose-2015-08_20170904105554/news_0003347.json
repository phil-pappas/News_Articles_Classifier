The prices soon collapsed amid the 2008 financial crisis, the investors said.\nAndrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Goldman Sachs said this month that it’s put aside $1.45 billion in the second quarter for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters.\nThe suit is among the last of a string of investor class actions against banks stemming from the credit crisis of those years, precipitated by the failure of investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. They have unfolded alongside multibillion-dollar penalties extracted from the banks by U.S. authorities as well. Goldman Sachs agreed to buy back almost $3.2 billion in mortgage bonds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last year to settle a suit by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. this month agreed to pay $388 million to settle a similar MBS class action. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP represented investors in both that matter and the Goldman Sachs case.\nThe pension fund case is NECA-IBEW Health & Welfare Fund v. Goldman Sachs & Co., 08-cv-10783, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:15:03.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
