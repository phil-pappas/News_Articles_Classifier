By Kyle Caldwell | Telegraph – 2 hours 1 minute ago 0.0000 \nSpecialised 'maximiser’ funds pay up to 8pc income - but can they be trusted? \nThose who depend on income from savings have been forced, in recent years, to contemplate risks most would prefer to avoid. \nA return of 5pc, which many people can remember earning on cash left on deposit, is now far higher than the average dividend yield from shares in Britain’s biggest companies where, of course, investors’ capital is at risk. \nA number of “solutions” have emerged during this long period of income drought, and savers’ money has poured into higher-paying but riskier investments including peer-to-peer loans, corporate bonds, “mini-bonds”, commercial property and a number of investment funds designed specially to maximise income payouts. \nOne such group of funds are known as “income maximisers” or “income boosters”. Offered by highly reputable, established fund companies, including Schroders and Fidelity, they offer yields of between 6pc and 8pc exceptionally tempting in this low-return environment. \nBut eye-catching returns prompt a number of questions. \nHow do these funds work, and how safe are they? At what expense is this income being generated? And, crucially, would it be better for investors to opt instead for a lower-risk form of investment and simply draw down on their capital when they need to further supplement their income? \n• Newsletter: Get our latest investment tips emailed directly to you \n= = \n= How 'income maximiser’ investment funds work = \nThe portfolios’ primary aim is to deliver the maximum income payout for investors. \nWith average FTSE 100 shares yielding just 3.5pc, a special technique is brought to bear to boost income. The fund manager sells investors’ rights to some future capital growth in return for cash, which is used to boost the “natural” income produced by the fund’s assets. \nThis is done by selling complex “derivative” products to other investors, who will benefit from any rise in the funds’ assets. \n= How risky are these portfolios? = \nFinancial advisers have warned that the funds should not be seen as a “silver bullet” solution to the quest for income. \nAlan Steel, who runs wealth management firm Alan Steel Asset Management and has been an adviser for more than 40 years, does not recommend the funds to his clients. \nHis concern is that they are both risky and “far too complicated”. \n“These funds are not for inexperienced savers who might underestimate how much capital they require to fund a retirement. Would I invest? No. Not a chance. When something relies on complex investment instruments for an edge, you can be assured that risk has increased.” \nJustin Modray, of independent financial adviser Candid Money, cautioned that, thanks to increased life expectancy, a typical retiree today needed to build a pension pot to last. \nTo achieve this, savers would be better served by having a mixture of growth and income investments, “rather than putting all their eggs in the income basket”, he said. “There is an obvious appeal for income seekers, but these funds only work for those who can live with the reduced capital growth prospects. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is therefore important not to be seduced by the very high headline income rates.” \n• Calculator: How your investments might grow with monthly saving \n= Are you paying too much for the income? = \nOnly five “income maximiser” funds have records going back five years or more. An analysis of their returns reveals exactly how much growth has been forgone to generate superior income. \nThe table, below, prepared by fund analysts FE Trustnet, shows what income each fund has paid in the past five years, along with its capital growth. \nThe figures are based on a £10,000 investment made five years ago. \nThe first column shows the total income paid over the period. The ranking, shown alongside, refers to the position of the fund within the whole equity income sector, comprising 70 funds. \nThe vast majority of those 70 funds are straightforward income portfolios, with savers’ cash typically invested in blue-chip, dividend-paying shares. They do not use the complex derivative-based strategies deployed by “income maximisers”. \nClearly, the “maximiser” funds come out very highly in terms of income. The top fund, Premier Optimum, paid £4,500 income over five years, putting it top out of all 70 funds. \nIn general, the “maximiser” funds have paid £2,000 more in income than the average UK income fund. \nBut the data also shows that, from a capital return perspective, “income maximisers” slip to the bottom of the performance tables. They occupy the bottom five places out of 70 when measured on capital return. Some have so entirely prioritised income that they have barely grown their capital at all since 2010, with Insight Equity Income Booster, for instance, posting capital growth of just £20. \nBut the ultimate measure is in the total return. Here again, “maximiser” funds disappoint. \nNone of the five makes it into the top 25pc of funds in the sector. The best ranked, at 32 out of 70, is Premier Optimum Income. \n== \n= Alternative income solutions = \nTo obtain yields of 6pc or more, investors would need to look at buying very high-yielding shares or lending to companies in the form of buying retail bonds or mini-bonds. The risks are high. \nIf yield itself is the aim, “maximiser” funds, thanks to the diversification they offer through investing in around 50 to 80 dividend-paying shares, are a safer bet. And as the table shows, they have delivered on their income promise. \nBut if yield is not the sole objective, it could be better to pick a straightforward income fund where total returns are higher and to draw down on capital, when necessary, by selling units. \nPatrick Connolly, a financial adviser at Chase de Vere, uses the funds as an “income kicker” alongside mainstream income funds such as Threadneedle UK Equity Income, Rathbone Income, Woodford Equity Income and Fidelity Moneybuilder Dividend. Mr Steel’s favourite income funds include Artemis Global Income and Invesco Perpetual Global Equity Income. \n• 10 undervalued dividend shares for income AND growth \n• Mark Slater's share tips: three income stocks that pay 5pc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T13:03:31.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
