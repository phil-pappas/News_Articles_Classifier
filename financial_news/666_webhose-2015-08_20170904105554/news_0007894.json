() ET SPECIAL: Love visual aspect of news? Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: The finance ministry said eligible candidates from the existing pool of public sector bank employees will be considered for the selection of chief executives in state-run lenders other than the five big ones, effectively ruling out the further induction of outside talent. The \"Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) has approved the guidelines for selection of MD and CEOs in public sector banks (PSBs) other than five large public sector banks,\" the finance ministry said in a statement. The selection process is to be initiated next month. Last week, the government announced chief executives of five large banks, appointing people from the private sector for the first time to run two--Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank . It also appointed non-executive chairmen at five state-run lenders, two of them from the private sector. As of now, Indian Bank and Andhra Bank are without a managing director-CEO. The term of the chairman and managing director of UCO Bank gets over at the end of the month. \"Executive directors of nationalised banks, DMDs of IDBI Bank and MDs of associate banks of SBI who have risen from the associate bank services, with one year of service as ED/DMD/MD and who have two years remaining service are eligible to consideration as MD and CEO,\" the ministry noted in its statement. (DMD stands for deputy managing director, ED for executive director.) Candidates will be interviewed by three panels of the appointments board sub-committee. \"The candidates will be rated out of 100 marks with 50 marks to be awarded for APARs (annual performance appraisal reports) of five years and 50 marks assigned on the basis of performance during interaction with the sub-committee,\" the finance ministry said. It also announced criteria for executive directors. \"General managers of nationalized banks and chief general managers of associate banks of SBI (State Bank of India) who have risen from the associate banks service and who have completed two years of service are eligible for consideration for the post of executive director,\" the ministry said. In 2014, the government decided to separate the post of chairman and MD and CEO in state-run banks except for SBI, the country's largest. It appointed MD-CEOs at four state-run lenders including United Bank of India , Oriental Commerce Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and Vijaya Bank . The government has announced a Bank Board Bureau (BBB), which will start functioning in April 2016 and is slated to replace the Appointments Board for the selection of whole-time directors as well as non-executive chairmen of state-run lenders.
