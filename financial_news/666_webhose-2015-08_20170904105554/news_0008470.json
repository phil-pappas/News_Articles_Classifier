Photo: Jesse Marlow\nPeak bodies representing retail and industry super funds, actuaries and the Grattan Institute have backed a call to limit retirement balances to no more than $2.5 million.\nBT Financial Group chief executive Brad Cooper last week said the government should cap at $2.5 million the amount people can accumulate in superannuation.\n\"We welcome the support for the the call for a $2.5 million super cap, which reflects our policy,\" Association of Superannuation Funds Australia chief executive Pauline Vamos said.\nThe Actuaries Institute also used its submission to the government's tax inquiry, which closed on Friday, to call for a super cap of $2.5 million.\nAdvertisement \"One of the potentially unsustainable parts of the superannuation system is tax-free earnings on investment income for people in the retirement phase, so it would be prudent to put some limit on it,\" said the convener of the institute's superannuation committee, Towers Watson managing director Andrew Boal.\n\"It seems fair to argue that people with $2.5 million have achieved the comfortable retirement the super system was designed to provide, and so any extra wealth they have above that should be held outside the concessional tax settings of super.\"\nThe Actuaries Institute has also called for a change that would force people to crystallise the capital gains on their super balance when they transfer from the accumulation to retirement phase.\nA $2.5 million cap is based on the amount ASFA calculates is needed to provide $150,000 a year in income, the amount it estimates is needed to provide a couple with twice average weekly earnings.\n\"Super is meant to be used to generate replacement income in retirement. Beyond this, I do not think it's appropriate for people to use its tax-free status to build incredibly high levels of wealth or serve as a proxy estate planning tool,\" Mr Cooper said.\nIndustry Super Australia chief executive David Whitely backed Mr Cooper's call for a limit but said $2.5 million was too high.\n\"So few people have a super balance of $2.5 million, and broader changes are needed to address inequity in the system\".\nAustralian Institute of Superannuation Trustees chief executive Tom Garcia described a $2.5 million cap as \"window dressing\".\n\"We need to put more focus on policies that a make significant difference rather than those that simply tinker at the margins,\" Mr Garcia said.\nGrattan Institute director Jim Minifie said he favours implementing some type of limit on access to the tax advantages of the super system, but suggested a limit on tax-free earnings in retirement might be a more efficient way to achieve this rather than a cap on balances.\n\"If you accept that the purpose of the superannuation system is to provide a tax-efficient vehicle to help self-fund for a comfortable retirement, then a cap of $2.5 million is about three times the balance people need\".\nMr Minifie also criticised the proposed $2.5 million cap as too high to create any meaningful budget savings.\nThe Financial Services Council would not be be drawn on whether it would back a cap on super balances.\n\"The debate should be focused on the mechanisms required to help Australians achieve a retirement income of 65 per cent of their pre-retirement earnings until life expectancy, rather than on whether savings should be capped,\" FSC chief executive Sally Loane said.\nA major challenge in discussing the pros and cons of instituting such a cap is that there is no clear data available on exactly how many people have more than $2.5 million saved in superannuation.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said on Monday it is unable to provide any figures on individual balances in pooled funds. It is widely believed that most people with super balances over $2.5 million have most of that stored in a self-managed fund. According to the latest available data from the Australian Taxation Office, as of July 1, 2013, 12.2 per cent of SMSFs had a balance over $2 million.\nMr Cooper Quote: d ASFA research that estimated a $2.5 million cap on super would affect about 0.5 per cent of Australians, or about 24,000 people, in the super system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:56:18.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
