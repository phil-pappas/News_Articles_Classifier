Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan \"Are you running a Ponzi scheme?\" was the reaction CrowdfundUP's founder Jack Quiqley got when he started his crowdfunding platform to raise money for property investments.\nAustralia was the \"nanny state\" holding back investors from owning properties, Mr Quigley and his peers from crowdfunders DomaCom, VentureCrowd and Prodigy Network's 17 John Street told a Property Council of Australia breakfast in Sydney on Wednesday.\nProperty crowdfunding has taken off in the US, with $1.42 billion in investments, and in Europe, with more than $1 billion, but only $80 million from the rest of the world, a report by CrowdfundUP said. China was on track for a possible $45 billion market.\nWith median house prices in Sydney scaling $1 million and in Melbourne $700,000, property equity crowdfunding gives retail investors a chance to own properties for smaller outlays – as low as $100.\n\"Think of it as a real estate investment trust with no ongoing fees. The crowd picks the properties, which is also diversified across types,\" Mr Quigley said.\n\"On top of that, there are no large fees or middlemen such as brokers.\"\nNominate projects Property crowdfunding raises funds from a \"crowd\" of investors for a project or investment. The crowd meets online and investors \"pledge\" their capital to projects. Investors can nominate projects or platforms can make suggestions.\n \"The most popular property investment types are residential, commercial and industrial, although storage unit complexes had been crowdfunded in the US,\" CrowdfundUP said.\nMr Quigley's CrowdfundUP, based in Perth, is a one-stop online platform that accesses properties from developers or fund managers for investment.\nThe platform has two opportunities running – one that is raising $500,000 to part-invest in a $10 million industrial property in Sydney with asset manager Lester Group and the other, also $500,000, for a Perth residential property by developer Megara. They require a minimum outlay of $10,000.\nWith Arthur Naoumidis' DomaCom, things are a bit different. DomaCom is not only an online platform but it is also an Australian Securities and Investments Commission-registered managed investment scheme, with an ability to manage crowd money like a fund.\n\"It is like a marriage between E-Trade and realestate.com.au,\" he said.\nBookbuilding exercise \"The pledges that people put on to the platform is like a bookbuilding exercise. Think of it as a modern syndication, which takes properties and cuts them up into small chunks.\"\nDomaCom performs due diligence on potential properties in stages to ensure they are profitable deals. It has launched nine property opportunities and has another 52 to go.\nInvestors in DomaCom deals can buy their units, or \"chunks of properties\", for as little as $2500 and sell them to other investors.\nDomaCom charges a small 0.8 per cent fee, while CrowfundUP earns money from developers and asset managers.\nHowever, the platforms have their own troubles.\n\"My biggest concerns are failed landbanking schemes, which give us a bad name,\" Mr Quigley said.\nThe legal framework surrounding crowdfunding is also still in its infancy in Australia. The latest development is a framework discussion paper released by the Abbott government late in 2014.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-08-26T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:05:17.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
