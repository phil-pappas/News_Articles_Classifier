Patrick Scala by Sue Mitchell Coles, Woolworths and Metcash's IGA chain are facing increased competition at both ends of the socio-economic spectrum as discounter Aldi ramps up its Australian presence and department store chain David Jones upgrades its gourmet food offer.\nRatings agency Moody's says Woolworths, Coles and IGA supermarkets will continue to lose market share over the next 24 months as Aldi expands into new markets and as David Jones skims off wealthier customers by refurbishing its gourmet food halls.\n\"These factors will shake up the strong duopoly structure of Australia's grocery market,\" Moody's said in a report on Thursday.\n\"As such, we expect the market share and profit margins of the two incumbents, but Woolworths in particular, to remain under pressure over the next 24 months.\"\nMoody's expects same-store sales growth at both Coles and Woolworths to come under pressure as Aldi opens 60 new stores over the next 12 months, increasing its store footprint by 16 per cent.\nMargins squeezed Woolworths' same-store food and liquor sales, which fell in the June quarter for the first time in 12 years, are expected to remain in negative territory over the next two quarters - falling more than 1 percentage point by mid-2016.\nAt the same time, Woolworths' food and liquor margins are expected to fall from 8 per cent in 2014 to around 6.5 per cent by the end of fiscal 2016 as it cut prices on national brands and private label groceries to better compete with Coles and Aldi, Moody's said.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...
