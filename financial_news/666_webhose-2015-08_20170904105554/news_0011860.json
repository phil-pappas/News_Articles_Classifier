Peter Braig by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell There will be no love lost between the Big Four banks as they battle for one of the country's biggest banking customers; Telstra.\nIt's understood Telstra has put its transactional banking up for tender after a reasonably long stint with Westpac Banking Corp.\nNational Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank of Australia are said to have large teams of people working on their pitches, while Westpac is keen to get another stint with the telecommunications giant.\nThe pitch teams are said to involve some pretty senior executives, who are keen to get their hands on Telstra's everyday banking. Banking analysts said it was a lucrative account but the real value may be in what it brings into the bank's corporate and funding departments.\nOf course these things are also about relationships. No doubt each of the banks' retail bosses and chief executives would not see any harm in cosying up to Telstra in its new era under Andy Penn.\nElsewhere, Pacific Equity Partners is in pole position to buy New Zealand's Academic Colleges Group after securing exclusive talks with a $NZ530 million offer.\nAs revealed by Street Talk, PEP and ACG are working on a deal which would see the Australian private equity firm continue its streak of investments across the Tasman.\nDeutsche Bank is advising PEP and said to be finalising funding. Financial sponsors bankers said recent gyrations in equity markets meant little for debt markets, with banks lining up to write cheques and fund acquisitions.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:06:01.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
