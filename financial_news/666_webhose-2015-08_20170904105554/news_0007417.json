Roughly 40% of the 134 million square feet under construction today represents speculative development, a ratio that's consistent with past cycles, says Walter Page, director of U.S. research for Washington-based commercial property research firm CoStar Group ( CSGP ). \nYet the amount of general development in most markets is still about half of what it was in 2007, even though the average national office vacancy rate of 10.8% today is on par with where it was eight years ago, Page adds. Nationwide, the average quoted rental rate of $24.78 per square foot is nearly 25 cents less than it was in 2007, according to CoStar. \n\"Normally at this point in time, we would have a lot more construction,\" Page said, \"but we don't because in most cases rents aren't high enough. \nPinpointing Construction \nThe lack of broad-based rental growth has limited new construction to the tightest submarkets, where a lack of new supply over the last several years has translated into a dearth of large blocks of modern office space. \nDevelopers in particular are focused on building in central business districts or close-in suburban enclaves that feature a mix of uses within walking distance, observers say. \n\"Even though speculative development is at scant volumes, relative to what we've seen historically, the majority of it is occurring where it makes sense,\" said Ryan Severino, senior economist for New York-based commercial property research firm Reis. \"There hasn't been a lot of space developed over the last seven or eight years, so developers are trying to out-compete older buildings by providing new space with bigger floor plates and better layouts. \nRaleigh, N.C.-based real estate investment trust Highwoods Properties ( HIW ), for example, plans to build a 131,000-square-foot speculative building in its Seven Springs mixed-use project in Nashville's Brentwood submarket, which boasts an office occupancy rate of 97.7%, according to the REIT. \nHouston-based Hines Interests earlier this year broke ground on a 40-story, 662,000-square-foot speculative office tower in downtown Denver, where the vacancy rate is 12.5%, according to Reis. \nOther active submarkets include downtown Cincinnati, where developers are adding more than 2 million square feet, about half of which is speculative, says Julia Georgules, director of U.S. office research for Chicago-based commercial real estate services provider Jones Lang LaSalle ( JLL ). \nMeanwhile, most of the 3.4 million square feet of offices under construction in Phoenix is going up in the Tempe submarket, which has a vacancy rate of 8.5%. Tenants already have preleased about 75% of the new space. \nTypically the new buildings aim for greater efficiency and foster collaborative workspaces, features that technology and creative companies in large markets initially demanded, Georgules says. Financial and professional services firms that frequently anchor smaller markets in the country increasingly prefer such space, too, she adds. \nTo a large degree, those companies downsized dramatically during the recession, and often they upgraded when rents for higher quality office space were cheap, she says. But in a review of leases over the last four quarters, JLL found that about half of the tenants were expanding. \nFirms today typically want new space to enhance recruitment efforts and efficiency, Georgules says, but the options are limited in most markets, thanks to the flight to quality and the lack of new construction since the recession. \n\"There is definitely a segment of the office market, with this idea of creative and collaborative space, that is in much more demand,\" she said. \"In markets where you find pockets of high vacancy, you'll probably find older office product that isn't as efficient. \nWild Cards \nThe fact that developers are choosing select markets for new construction should keep a governor on supply and reduce the risk of a glut, observers say. \nPage expects strong office demand to offset new construction, for example, and predicts that the national average vacancy rate will bottom at around 10.5% in 2017 and increase to 11% or so in 2019. \nNevertheless, wild cards such as China's slowing economy and the devaluation of its currency could short-circuit demand's uptrend, Page adds, and energy markets are already feeling the disruption of falling oil prices. \nDevelopers in Houston are constructing nearly 13 million square feet of office space, about 40% of which is speculative, CoStar says. The firm projects that the current average rental rate of $27.90 per square foot will drop 7% over the few years as vacancies rise. Houston's average vacancy rate in the first half of 2015 increased 190 basis points to 12.7%. \nWhat's more, CoStar made those projections assuming that West Texas Intermediate crude oil would be trading for $60 a barrel. But the price fell below that benchmark in late June and has been under $45 for much of August. \n\"Houston will become the weakest big market in the country,\" Page said. \"It could be worse than what we're forecasting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:04:31.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
