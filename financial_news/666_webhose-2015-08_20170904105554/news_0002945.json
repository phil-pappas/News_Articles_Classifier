Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates ANZ Bank chief executive Mike Smith says the bank is treating hotspots in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets \"very cautiously,\" after recent moves to curb lending to property investors.\nMr Smith also sought to allay market fears about credit quality , saying ANZ had not experienced a significant deterioration in its loan book even though the global environment was more \"challenging\" for the bank.\nAfter a trading update on Tuesday, Mr Smith said there was a \"severe\" mismatch between housing supply and demand in parts of the country's two biggest cities.\n\"You have seen us address the regulatory brakes being applied to investor lending,\" he said on a call with analysts.\n\"Australia is, however, made up of multiple housing markets. Not all of these are facing the same pressure. However, price rises in some areas of Sydney and of Melbourne are being driven by a severe mismatch in supply and demand, and we are managing these hotspots very cautiously.\"\nTypical dwelling priced jumped 18.4 per cent in the year to July in Sydney and Melbourne prices were up 11.5 per cent, latest figures from CoreLogic​ RP Data show.\nAll the major banks including ANZ have stepped up their attempts to slow housing investor loan growth to comply with the banking regulator's 10 per cent-a-year speed limit on credit growth in this segment.\nANZ was the first bank to last month raise interest rates for all of its housing investor customers by 0.27 percentage points. It has also cut interest rate discounts for new investor borrowers and required new investor borrowers to have a minimum 10 per cent deposit.\n It comes after National Australia Bank on Monday said it had red-flagged 40 postcodes where business and personal loans are in higher risk of default because areas over-rely on single industries for growth, have high unemployment, or property prices have run too hard.\nMr Smith made the comment after ANZ confirmed its cash profit in the nine months to June was $5.4 billion , as it had flagged two weeks ago when ANZ announced it would raise $3 billion in capital from shareholders .\nANZ shares fell 1.9 per cent, or 55c, to $28.97, in a bad day for the sector, as the Commonwealth Bank traded ex-dividend and Fitch Ratings predicted banks would need to hold even more capital.\nFitch predicted higher capital requirements would be imposed in response to the financial system inquiry chaired by former CBA chief David Murray, and global negotiations among regulators.\nWhen ANZ launched its capital raising earlier this month, a key concern was its charge for provisions for bad and doubtful debts, which rose to $366 million in June quarter, up from $278 million three months earlier.\nOn Tuesday the bank's management sought to calm investor fears of a jump in bad debts, which eat into bank profits.\nChief financial officer Shayne Elliott said the main reason for the rise was because of collective provisions – which are held against unidentified loan losses but can indicate declining loan quality trends – rather than individual provisions for specific loans that have been identified as having soured.\nThis rise was mainly because of trends in mining and agriculture.\n\"Essentially last year we were witnessing risk upgrades across many sectors, while this year we have seen a moderate number of risk downgrades. These generally relate to resource and agri​ sector,\" Mr Elliott said.\nHe said there had been a \"small increase\" in mortgage customers falling behind on repayments in the resource-exposed states of Western Australia and Queensland.\nMr Smith said credit quality had reached the bottom of a cycle that has lowered banks' costs from bad loans to the lowest in years.\nANZ is forecasting that impaired loans will lift to 0.21 per cent of its portfolio in the full year, up from 0.19 per cent last year.\nMr Smith conceded that bad debts had bottomed but said he did not think they would get significantly worse.\n\"The question to ask is, are we at the bottom of the cycle, and I guess the answer to that is yes. Is it going to get significantly worse? I don't think so, but it's not going to get better,\" Mr Smith said.\nAlongside higher bad debts, banks are also facing a crunch on their profit margins due to fierce competition for borrowers.\nANZ has felt this squeeze in its international and institutional arm, where it said foreign banks were competing fiercely.\nIn response to the \"challenging\" environment, Mr Smith said ANZ was sharpening its focus on keeping costs under control and capital management.\nSome analysts have questioned future growth in banks' highly-prized dividends against this weaker backdrop, and pressure to hold more capital, which lowers returns.\nCLSA analyst Brian Johnson said that after ANZ had issued more shares in its capital raising, he expected a period of flat dividends.\n\"It stalls the dividend over the next 18 months,\" Mr Johnson said.\nMr Elliott said ANZ's policy of paying out 65 to 70 per cent of profits as dividends was sustainable for the \"medium term.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/anz-to-raise-3-billion-from-shareholders-to-increase-capital-levels-20150805-gismo0.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/nab-puts-40-postcodes-on-credit-watchlist-20150817-gj12o3.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-profits-pour-in-20150817-gj1czd.html#post_live_999459501", "https://twitter.com/clancyyeates"], "published": "2015-08-18T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:15:33.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
