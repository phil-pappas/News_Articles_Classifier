Amgen also agreed to change its marketing practices.\nEnbrel was Amgen's top-selling drug in 2014, with $4.69 billion of sales. Aranesp sales totaled $1.93 billion. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company reported overall revenue of $20.06 billion.\nTuesday's settlement came after Amgen agreed in December 2012 to pay $762 million to settle criminal and civil litigation over its marketing of Aranesp, Enbrel and other drugs. It also pleaded guilty to illegally introducing a misbranded drug, Aranesp, into interstate commerce.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Amgen said it was pleased to resolve the states' claims. It also said company management was \"dedicated to fostering a culture of doing the right thing at Amgen in full compliance with the law.\"\nAmgen shares were down $1.85, or 1.1 percent, at $167.94 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.
