Photo: Louie Douvis\nThe captains of industry were out in force for a chat and mingle with media's mightiest mogul, News Corp's Rupert Murdoch, on Tuesday.\nAmid tight security at one of Sydney's most lavish restaurants, Catalina in Rose Bay, Mr Murdoch was flanked by his son Lachlan and daughter-in-law Sarah as well as outgoing News Corp Australia boss Julian Clarke as he rushed inside.\nThe media conglomerate hired out the entire restaurant for the afternoon shindig, which brought out a who's who of top executives from financial services, aviation, retail, media, sporting chiefs and even the odd politician.\nAmong the big names were Ian Narev, chief teller at CBA, former Telstra boss and incoming CSIRO chairman David Thodey, former Ten boss Hamish McLennan, Seven Group chiefs Tim Worner and Ryan Stokes, Qantas boss Alan Joyce, outgoing Woolies' CEO Grant O'Brien, Harvey Norman's Gerry Harvey and Katie Page, Foxtel's Richard Freudenstein, Fox Sports' Patrick Delany, incoming News Corp Australia executive chairman Michael Miller, NSW Premier Mike Baird, and Crown Resorts co-chair Rob Rankin and James Packer's media man Mark Arbib.\nAdvertisement Mr Murdoch also hosted the heads of Australia's biggest sporting codes: round baller David Gallop, NRL boss Dave Smith, ruggers man Bill Pulver and head of the AFL Gill McLachlan.\nNews Corp chief executive Robert Thomson gave Mr Murdoch a brief introduction before than man himself introduced his board, which he brought with him from the United States, to business, political and sporting leaders.\nAfter introductions, the high-powered room sat down for lunch. The event was described as a low-key, informal and social get together for advertisers and clients.\nCBD can confirm that no Fairfax Media journalists were offered canap√©s, let alone entrance into the event, and remained quite hungry throughout the ordeal.\nLachlan and Sarah Murdoch Ian Narev Grant O'Brien and Richard Freudenstein Alan Joyce (right) Gerry Harvey and Matthew Johns Katie Page Ryan Stokes Hamish McLennan Mark Arbib and Rob Rankin Mike Baird David Gallop Gill McLachlan Bill Pulver", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:46:53.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
