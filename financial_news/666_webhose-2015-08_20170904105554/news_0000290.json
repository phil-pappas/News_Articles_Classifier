But Friday's payrolls report is expected to play a more crucial part in shaping the \"data dependent\" Fed's approach towards raising rates. \nEconomists expect the payrolls report to show that 223,000 jobs were created in July. \n\"Whether the dollar can advance further against the yen will likely depend on how equities react to payrolls that could support a September hike. Lower equities would weigh on the dollar, but we still see the currency on an uptrend in the medium term,\" said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. \nThe Bank of Japan holds a monetary policy meeting on Friday but with most eyes fixed on U.S. jobs the gathering could be relegated to a side show. The central bank is expected to maintain its massive stimulus programme. \nElsewhere, sterling continued to flounder after the Bank of Message sent a more dovish message overnight than some had expected. \nAt a policy meeting on Thursday, only one member voted for an immediate rate hike against expectations for at least two members to join the hawkish camp. The BOE still pointed to a possible hike early next year. [ID::nL5N10H2ZT] \nThe pound dipped further to $1.5509 after shedding 0.6 percent overnight. \nThe Australian dollar was steady at $0.7347, on track to gain about 0.6 percent on the week. The Aussie has benefited this week after the Reserve Bank of Australia omitted calls for its further decline.
