Universal's new biopic cost only $29 million to produce and marked its sixth film so far this year that debuted with more than $50 million in sales. Second on the list this weekend was Paramount's 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,' totaling $17 million. Starring Tom Cruise, the spy movie boasts $140 million in sales since its July 31 debut. Coming in at number three was 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' from Warner Bros., which brought in $13.5 million. That’s a far cry from its reported $75 million production budget. The fourth biggest film this weekend was 20th Century Fox’s, which is owned by 21st Century Fox (FOX), ‘Fantastic Four,’ which garnered $8 million, but debuted on August 7. Meanwhile, STX Entertainment’s ‘The Gift’ saw $6.5 million in sales at the box office, while The Walt Disney Company’s (DIS) ‘Ant-Man’ totaled $5.5 million. Shares of movie studios Comcast, Viacom and Time Warner, posted slight gains on Monday. Disney shares rose 1.2 percent in midday trading.
