Chris Ratcliffe by Amanda Saunders Rio Tinto will reduce capital investment by at least $US2.5 billion ($3.4 billion) over two years and aim to cut costs by $US1 billion this year under a plan to protect dividends from the iron ore price collapse.\nAfter reporting a 43 per cent fall in first-half underlying earnings, chief executive Sam Walsh said the strategy was \"not about mortgaging the future for the present\" or compromising growth.\nHe launched a strident defence of Rio Tinto's policy of ensuring its dividend does not fall. \"If you look at the world we are in, yield is key,\" he said.\nRio lifted its interim dividend to $US1.075, an increase of 12 per cent, or 40 per cent in Australian dollars, on the year-earlier period, in keeping with its progressive dividend policy. Rio's cash flow will cover its dividend payout this half.\nUnderlying earnings shrank 43 per cent to $US2.9 billion in the first half from $US5.1 billion in the same period a year earlier, largely because of the halving of the iron ore price. It was much better than the $US2.4 billion analysts expected.\nGlencore's Ivan Glasenberg is still stalking Rio Tinto, but the strength of the first-half result could stay any advances for a while. Any hint of weakness would be a target for Mr Glasenberg in a possible second attempt at pitching a merger to shareholders.\nRio plans to cut at least $US2.5 billion from capital spending this year and next year from an already-reduced estimated $US7 billion a year. The company will spend $US5.5 billion this year, and \"less than\" $US6 billion in 2016, generating savings that can be used to pay dividends.\nMr Walsh said he was confident the cuts in investment would not compromise profit growth.\n \"The business does have an imperative to continue to grow, and to continue to take advantage of our tier one assets,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.\n\"I am not about mortgaging the future for the present. I am very much about running the business strategically for the long term.\"\nCuts won't impact growth: Deutsche Deutsche Bank mining analyst Paul Young said Rio's latest cuts to capital spending forecasts \"will have no impact on growth\", and the company could propose another share buyback at its full-year results in February.\n\"There is daylight between Rio Tinto and its peers now,\" he said. \"They are growing, and their peers aren't, and they've got a buyback ongoing. And this result increases the probability, given net debt was lower than thought, of a buyback in February 2016.\n\"So you are investing in a company with an increased probability of ongoing capital management, over and above the dividend, which is sustainable, together with sector leading growth, which equals sector-leading shareholder returns.\"\nUBS mining analyst Glyn Lawcock also said the capital spending cuts would not compromise growth, noting that some of the reductions were drawn from the weakening Australian dollar, and reduced costs in the mining industry.\nWhen asked if delivering on costs and productivity was Rio's best defence against unwanted advances from the likes of Glencore, Mr Walsh said: \"I don't jump at shadows, I am steely-determined on making this the best mining company in the world.\n\"We are raising the hurdle for everybody,\" he said.\nRio smashes targets Rio is smashing its $US750 million cost savings target for 2015, carving out $US600 million in the June half, buoyed by big falls in the Australian dollar.\nRio on Thursday increased its target to $US1 billion. The new target comes in addition to the $US4.8 billion the miner has carved out in in cash costs since the start of 2013.\nThere has been some market concern that the dividend yield is not real and could be cut. Many Australian investors have been critical of the policy, saying it is a poor fit for a resources company and restricts the miner from making counter-cyclical acquisitions or investments. But Mr Walsh said the dividend was \"important\" to shareholders.\n\"I have taken a deliberate approach of ensuring we deliver on shareholder returns,\" he told The Australian Financial Review. \"We are the best mining house in the street.\"\nTo stay true to its progressive dividend policy, Rio's interim payment had to be half of its 2014 total dividend payout of $US2.15. Its progressive policy ensures the dividend is maintained or increased in US dollars at each half-year payment.\nThe miner has signalled it is willing to flex its balance sheet to fund growth, and is comfortable with gearing sitting in a range 20 to 30 per cent.\nRio's gearing crept up slightly to 21 per cent, from 19 per cent as at December 2014, mainly because of the $US2 billion share buyback unveiled in February this year, which is still ongoing.\nNet debt rose to $US13.6 billion, from $US12.5 billion at December 2014, easily beating analyst consensus of an increase to $US14.5 billion.\nRio's Hunter Valley coal business is unofficially on the block and Glencore and Mick Davis's X2 have been sniffing around.The miner wants at least book value, which is about $US3 billion, for the NSW business.\n\"If anybody wants to offer us a price that is more than we value an asset, then of course we'll look at it,\" Mr Walsh said, when asked about interest in Rio's coal business.\n\"We've got investment bankers coming up with a range of bright and brilliant ideas, which we appreciate. But we will focus on what we're doing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:09:59.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
