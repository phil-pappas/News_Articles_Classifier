In this article we turn to issues of collateral transfer and eligibility. \n– Requirement and Timing \n’s pricing. \n– Eligible Collateral \n– Threshold and Minimum Transfer Amount \nal margin to the extent that the initial margin that would be posted to the CSE and its affiliates by the financial end user and its affiliates is under $65 million. A minimum transfer amount of $650,000 would also apply, although it is somewhat unclear from the proposed language whether this amount applies across both initial and variation margin. ISDA has asked for clarification from the CFTC on this point and requested that the minimum transfer amount apply to each of IM and VM separately. \n– Requirement and Timing \n– Eligible Collateral \n“the currency in which payment obligations under the swap are required to be settled”, the determination of which would require a CSE to “consider the entirety of the contractual obligation”. The Margin Rules are less than clear on what the “entirety of the contractual obligation” means and unfortunately standard ISDA terms such as contractual currency, base currency, or termination currency do not have clear corollaries under the Margin Rules. Further muddying the waters, under Basel III leverage ratio rules the BIS defined currency of settlement” as “ any currency of settlement specified in the derivative contract, governing qualifying master netting agreement or the credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement.” \nThe limit of variation margin to cash also deviates significantly from the for uncleared swaps margin, which does not restrict variation margin to cash. The cash restriction goes against the grain of common market practice of permitting highly liquid securities such as US Treasuries, subject to appropriate haircuts. The requirement could also require the liquidation of investments for certain businesses that must stay fully invested in securities or that do not carry large cash positions, such as asset managers or insurance companies. This could introduce tracking errors and other risks. Further, the restriction of variation margin to cash could potentially cause financial end users to turn to the US Treasury repo markets (which some market observers have said are increasingly illiquid) in order to “transform” their US Treasuries into cash, which implicates potential term mismatches and hence the possibility of forced sales in stressed market conditions. \nAs noted above, the Margin Rules provide for a minimum transfer amount of $650,000, although the application of this amount across initial margin or variation margin is not entirely clear. \n\nThe various types of eligible collateral for initial margin would be subject to standardized haircuts, ranging from ranging from zero, in the case of cash in the same currency as the swap obligations, to 25 percent for certain equities. An additional 8 percent is imposed where the currency of the swap obligation differs from that of the collateral asset”. The use of a model to calculate haircuts not permitted. \n\nAs noted above, the EU regulators proposal permits non-cash assets to be posted as variation margin. There are several other notable differences between the EU and US proposed rules. For instance, the EU proposal imposes concentration limits on certain types of collateral, which is a significant change from market practice. In addition to highlighting these cross-border differences, future updates will also address issues such as the segregation of initial margin with a third party and the calculation of margin using a model versus a standardized table. \nTo close out with another Disney quote, times and conditions change so rapidly that we must keep our aim constantly focused on the future.” The Margin Rules are indeed in a state of flux but we expect that the various proposals set out by regulators will converge to some extent over the next several months as they hammer out final rules, although it remains to be seen to what degree. Developments are worth monitoring given the operational and economic impact they will have on financial end users, as well as the lead time many entities will need in order to implement appropriate changes to existing practices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:26:51.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
