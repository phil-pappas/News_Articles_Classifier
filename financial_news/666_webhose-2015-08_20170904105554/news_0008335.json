Severe housing downturns usually coincide with recessions.\"\nThe other two reasons cited are strong immigration and the gradual pace at which interest rates will rise.\nRBC says it doesn't expect national home prices to fall outright, at least in the short term, although certain segments of certain markets — for example, condos in Montreal — could see a decrease.\nThe risks of a nationwide collapse in prices — such as a drop of 25 per cent or more — are \"quite remote,\" according to the report.\nFollow @alexposadzki on Twitter.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:13:10.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
