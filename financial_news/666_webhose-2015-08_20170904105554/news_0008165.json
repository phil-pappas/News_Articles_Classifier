Christies Real Estate International Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger Helped by the forced $39 million sale of Villa del Mare, Sydney's exclusive harbourside enclave of Point Piper, with its Wolseley Road mega mansions, has maintained its crown as Australia's most expensive suburb with a median value of $5.6 million.\nThe latest list of million-dollar suburbs compiled by CoreLogic RP Data and based on sales over the 12 months to June is dominated by Sydney suburbs, in particular those in the Eastern Suburbs. Centennial Park ($5.2 million), Vaucluse ($4.1 million), Bellevue Hill ($3.8 million) and Tamarama ($3.5 million) round out the top five.\nNationwide, the number of million-dollar median suburbs surged 23 per cent from 355 to 437 as a result of surging house prices, up 11.1 per cent across the capital cities.\nNSW, where Sydney house prices are up almost 20 per cent over the year, accounted for more than two-thirds of the 437 million-dollar suburbs with numbers rising from 232 to 302 over the 12 months.\nThe top 20 suburbs by median value. Les Hewitt Victoria was the next highest, up by 10, to 61 suburbs, followed by WA (39), Queensland (14), South Australia (12), ACT (7) and NT (1).\nJust one Melbourne suburb – Toorak in the inner south-east with its St Georges Rd mansions – made it into the top 20, rising from 15th last year to ninth on the latest list with a median value of $3.2 million.\nPerth had two. Peppermint Grove on the north bank of the Swan River and home to some of its wealthiest residents ranked sixth, up from eighth last year ($3.3 million). Another Swan River suburb, Dalkeith, rounded out the top 20 with a median of $2.47 million.\n\"This data reflects the effect of strong capital growth rates, which show that Sydney values are growing substantially faster than all other areas and the cost of housing in Sydney is much higher than elsewhere,\" said CoreLogic RP Data head of research Tim Lawless.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

This surpassed the previous highest sale in 2013 of \"Altona\" to a Chinese developer for $52 million by publisher Deke Miskin.\nAccording to CoreLogic RP Data, there have only been five sales in Point Piper since January and 14 in total last year. But the suburb accounted for three out of the top five biggest sales so far this year.\nOf the 437 suburbs with a median value of at least $1 million over the year, 427 or 97.7% of suburbs were in a capital city.\nOnly 13 suburbs made it on to the list for apartments, led by Dawes Point on the edge of the Sydney CBD.\n\"In fact, all of the suburbs listed for units were situated in Sydney and were located adjacent to or on the water,\" said Mr Lawless.\nThere were 48 suburbs with a median above $2 million, up from 32 a year ago.\nOf these 48 suburbs, 40 are in Sydney, five are in Melbourne, two are in Perth and one is in Canberra.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-08-13T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:08:09.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
