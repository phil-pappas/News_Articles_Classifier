Carla Miles \nChristian bakers recently sent cakes, letters, and gift card packages to ten Gay Rights Groups hoping to begin a dialog with recipients on what one of the small business owners called the right to \"live our lives the way we want to.\" \nThe small business owners, Aaron and Melissa Klein, were sued in 2013 after Melissa declined an opportunity to bake a cake for a lesbian couple and based the decision on religious views, according to reports on the story recently mentioned here at westernjournalism and here at theBlaze . \nShe denies the cake is a publicity stunt, but Melissa Klein seems quite clear on why she decided to send the cakes. “We wanted to have the cake represent freedom — that we all should have freedom and to live our lives the way we want to,” Melissa Klein is quoted in yesterday's story by Melody Dareing. Klein also stated that she believes gays and lesbians should be free to live as they choose. \n“But I also feel like I should have the right to live the way I want to,\" Klein added, \"and that should be my choice.” \nIn all the messages sent, the Kleins are hoping to express their sincerity and goodwill, and they hope that this is clearly made in their creative design of a heart in the middle of the cake with the words \"We really do love you.\" \nCurrently, the Kleins have also appealed to dismiss a $135,000 lawsuit brought against them. “We’re still fighting this,” Melissa Klein says about the lawsuit against them. But as she told Blaze writer Billy Hallowell, there are also plans for Aaron and her to continue sending cakes to other gay and lesbian rights groups in the near future. \nA previous article, regarding using exclusivity agreements to prevent lawsuits targeting small business owners with deeply held religious beliefs, can be found here at the Examiner .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T02:32:54.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
