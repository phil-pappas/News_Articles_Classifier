They want us to help them pursue claims,” said Mr Scott . Those include pension funds, hedge funds and non-financial companies, who trade foreign exchange to support their overseas units or to bring back profits from abroad. \nHalf a dozen banks in the UK have been fined by regulators for attempting to manipulate forex benchmarks, the price of currencies at a fixed point in the day against which many trades are carried out. \nBut Mr Scott said his cases in the US have uncovered evidence of spread manipulation through the whole trading day, and accuses banks of ripping off the buyer and seller of currencies to increase the bank’s own profit margin. \nHe plans to lodge cases in the Autumn to seek compensation for clients who will say they were harmed by banks forming a cartel in the currency markets and breaking competition laws. \nSo far in the US, 12 cases into this area have been settled with banks paying more than $2bn to date. Another seven banks have not settled the claims, and the claimants, who include pension funds and hedge funds, hope to win at least another $2bn. \nAs currency markets are twice as large in the UK, the lawyers believe the claims for damages could come in twice as high at $8bn, or £5bn. That compares with regulatory fines for Libor and forex abuse of £2.2bn in the UK. \nScott and Scott is setting up an office in London and is hiring in a new partner to run the British operation. \nThe lawyers are also looking at using the new Consumer Rights Act to lodge claims on behalf of large numbers of clients. \n“The act is new and is not yet in effect, so there are many open questions on its implementation and how it is going to actually work, but the idea is that it would provide people or entities who do not have a large enough claim, to seek redress through collective proceedings,” Mr Scott said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T22:31:44.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
