This morning’s comment from the bank’s CEO that subject to regulatory approval, the bank is strong enough to do this now, means that the State’s finances should receive a significant benefit in the coming year independent of any decision to sell some of our shares in the bank. \nThe strong growth in new lending activity which was significantly higher across a broad range of sectors reflects increased demand for credit as the economic environment continues to improve. \nAIB also continues to make significant progress in reducing distressed loan balances with the total number of accounts in arrears declining by 13% including a 13% decrease in owner occupier mortgage arrears. \nFinally, I welcome the bank’s decision to implement a further 0.25% cut in their standard variable rate (SVR) for new and existing customers, this is the third such rate cut that the bank has implemented and will be of significant benefit to large numbers of the bank’s customers”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T14:30:55.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
