More Headlines \nThe sector is also dependent on wages, consumer spending , fuel prices as well as surging food prices, but at least they are better positioned to downturns in the economy than consumer discretionary companies, like restaurants. \nHere are 9 large-cap consumer staples that are rated Buy, A+ by TheStreet Ratings. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet' s proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNote: Year-to-date returns are based on Aug. 13, 2015 closing prices. \nMarket Cap: $11.7 billion Year-to-date return: 13.3% \nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products in the United States. The company operates through three segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and Specialty Products Division (SPD). \n\"We rate CHURCH & DWIGHT INC (CHD) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 12.2%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 4.8%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share. Compared to its closing price of one year ago, CHD's share price has jumped by 34.42%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Turning to the future, naturally, any stock can fall in a major bear market. However, in almost any other environment, the stock should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed nice gains in the past year. CHURCH & DWIGHT INC's earnings per share declined by 15.4% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, CHURCH & DWIGHT INC increased its bottom line by earning $3.01 versus $2.78 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.26 versus $3.01). The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.54, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. Despite the fact that CHD's debt-to-equity ratio is low, the quick ratio, which is currently 0.61, displays a potential problem in covering short-term cash needs. The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Household Products industry and the overall market on the basis of return on equity, CHURCH & DWIGHT INC has underperformed in comparison with the industry average, but has exceeded that of the S&P 500.
