Advertising Print This Post Greek ATM's with a handwritten note saying \"The End\", Photo: Bloomberg \nSince re-opening on Monday after a five-week hiatus, the Greek stock exchange has sustained heavy losses. While the Athens Stock Exchange General Index (ASE) lost a modest 2.7% of its value on Tuesday vis-à-vis Monday’s hefty 16% drop, shares of the struggling Greek banks continue to plummet. \nIndeed, Monday saw the troubled return to trading on the Athens Exchange , which had been shut down as Greece and its international creditors have been wrangling over bailout packages and loan repayments. Soon after opening, the market nosedived, losing almost 23% from the start of trading to finally close 16% down. Athens Stock Exchange General Index , Souce: Yahoo! Finance \nThe banking sector has sustained the heaviest losses. For the second consecutive day, Greek banking shares fell by about 30%, the bottom of their daily limit. \nPiraeus Bank (TPEIR.AT) has been the worst hit, hitting the 30% line two days running, taking its shares to €0.196. Its compatriots, the National Bank of Greece, Alpha Bank and Eurobank Ergasias, also fell significantly, down 26.1%, 29.7% and 29.7% respectively. Piraeus Bank Share Price, Source: Yahoo!

Namely, energy and utility stocks were up, with Terna Energy rising 4.2% and Public Power by 3.8%. Transportation also remained resilient, with Piraeus Port share prices rising 4.4% and Aegean Airlines up 2.6%.   How do you feel about the article?
