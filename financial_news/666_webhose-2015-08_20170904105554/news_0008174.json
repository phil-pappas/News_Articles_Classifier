Many people, he believes, consider it \"beneath them\" to work as a tradie. So they instead opt for the sterile surrounds of an office rather than the raw environs of a worksite to which they're probably more suited. But is being a tradie really that bad?\nThe answer for some is yes. That's why there's an inordinate push for high-school students to pursue university studies, which results in the employment market flooded with overqualified graduates who can't get a job in what are already over-crowded fields.\nWhat they're chasing, perhaps, is a job where they're protected from the harsh weather and where there's a greater chance for career progression. But what they're sacrificing is the kind of job where their labour produces a tangible product every day, where they could potentially live the dream of self-employment, and where the education process is usually shorter and cheaper.\nAll of that, though, is speculative. From an empirical perspective, let's see what causes satisfaction (and dissatisfaction) among blue-collar workers and, in comparison, their white-collar equivalents. To do so, three dimensions need to be explored:\nAdvertisement What the two groups experience as they carry out the work. What they each think of their colleagues. How they feel about their pay. Back in 2010, a study of 870 people by psychology professors at George Mason University shed light on those determinants. Here's what they found.\nWhen it comes to the nature of the work, white-collar workers are more likely to have jobs that contain variety, creativity and complexity. Their jobs also attract opportunities for challenging tasks and interesting projects. Blue-collar workers, on the other hand, have jobs that can be overly routine and monotonous.\nIn regards to colleagues, an intriguing distinction appears. White-collar workers tend to judge the performance of those they work with objectively. In contrast, blue-collar workers are more subjective because they often develop closer relationships with their workmates. The collaborative nature of their work means they genuinely get to bond with their colleagues, and so they determine each other's competence based more so on how much they like each other.\nAs for pay, this, too, is interesting. White-collar workers can feel hard done by because they're more likely to compare themselves to their peers. This is made worse by the large gaps in salary that characterise white-collar professions. So even though they might be highly paid, they're still at significant risk of distress simply because someone else is getting paid even more than they are for doing the same job. These types of income disparities are rarer in blue-collar industries, thereby minimising that anxiety.\nSo where does this leave us? Well, nowhere really. And that's because there are many more factors beyond the three simplistic ones analysed in the study.\nFor example, most blue-collar professions are physically taxing, which means they can't be performed with a lot of vigour past a certain age. Blue-collar workers are also at higher risk of mental health issues, hence why beyondblue's latest million-dollar campaign implores tradies and their counterparts to seek help. In the meantime, white-collar workers have their own stressors in the form of office politics, bureaucracy, incompetent bosses, outsourcing and much more.\nA big part of me wishes I had what it takes to be a blue-collar worker, especially a tradie. There's something quite appealing about being out on the road, doing work that produces an immediate, visible and lasting impact.\nBut then I think back to my most traumatic adolescent memories, which involved my dad repeatedly trying to teach me (unsuccessfully) how to change a car tyre. And I'm quickly reminded it's probably best I just stick with a laptop for now.\nHow about you? Do you prefer blue-collar work or white-collar work?\nFollow me on Twitter: @jamesadonis", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/meet-davo-the-face-of-beyondblues-focus-on-blue-collar-mens-mental-health-20150619-ghsfv8.html", "https://twitter.com/jamesadonis"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:25:59.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
