I will now look in more detail at how each share has fared and at its current prospects, starting with the four I recommended last year. \nRestore \nRestore , a document storage, shredding and relocation services firm, made a £23m acquisition of Cintas in October. The purchase is expected to enhance earnings. \nThe half-year update on July 22 was positive but there was a problem with a cost overrun on a major Cintas shredding contract. Remedial action has been taken and Cenkos, the company’s stockbroker, estimates that earnings per share for 2015 will still be up by 29pc. At the present price of 238p the prospective price to earnings (p/e ratio) for the next 12 months is about 14. \nI agree with Cenkos that at this level the shares are a buy. \nTelford Homes (LSE: TEF.L - news ) \nThis company, a residential property developer, reported excellent results in May. Then, at the annual meeting in July, it reported that there was still very strong demand for its homes. \nFrom a launch of 148 apartments, villas and penthouses at one of its sites in Bermondsey, south London, 92 were sold in June, adding £43m to forward sales, which now stand at more than £620m. Bear in mind that Telford is valued by the stock market at only £250m. \nA planning delay has caused a decrease in the company’s earnings per share estimate for 2017, with an equivalent increase coming in 2018. Its broker, Peel Hunt, has a target price of 550p and forecast that Telford’s pre-tax profits would rise from £25m in 2015 to £43m by 2018. \nAt 417p, on a prospective p/e ratio of about 10 and a rising dividend yield of 3.5pc, Telford’s shares are a strong hold. \nClinigen \nFollowing its game-changing acquisition of a rival firm, Idis, for £225m, Clinigen is now a market leader in the supply of ethical unlicensed medicines which have the potential to become a very large international market. The deal, which was financed by a £135m share sale and debt, will be earnings-enhancing in the first full year, with cost savings to come in later years. \nA trading update on July 22 for this financial year was very positive. \nAt 761p Clinigen shares are on a forward p/e ratio of 24 with a forecast growth rate in earnings per share of 26pc and a further 20pc increase to follow in 2017. \nNumis Securities, the company’s broker, has a target price of 840p and Peel Hunt is more optimistic with £10. \nThe shares are expensive but they are a strong hold. \n• More investing ideas at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting \nRedcentric \nRedcentric (LSE: RCN.L - news ) provides computer services from four data centres and networks around the UK the current focus is to form long-term services contracts, working in partnership with the IT teams of its customers. \nThe results for the year ended March 31 were well up to expectations with growth in earnings per share of 33pc. More than 80pc of the company’s revenue is recurring and cash flow is strong. \nIn April, Redcentric made a £12m earnings-enhancing acquisition of Calyx, funded by a new £40m credit facility. Finncap, the company’s broker, forecasts 30pc growth in earnings per share next year and has a target price of 205p. At 182p the prospective p/e ratio is 16 and the shares are a strong hold. \nAlthough I have reduced some of my holdings in these firms after a strong run in their shares and added to others, I still have substantial shareholdings in each of them. \nIn January, I suggested two further shares, Breedon Aggregates and CVS Group (LSE: CVSG.L - news ) , for readers who might feel more comfortable with a wider spread of holdings. \nWhen I recommended Breedon I did not own any shares in the company, although it had been in my sights for a long while. \nBreedon \nBreedon is engaged in the quarrying of aggregates together with the production of asphalt and ready-mixed concrete. \nThe interim results on July 23 were very strong, with profits before tax up by 92pc and earnings per share up by 77pc. \nThe company said it believed that “market expectations for the year will be exceeded” and added that “several further acquisition opportunities are under review”. \nThe company’s broker, Peel Hunt, has raised its target price to 60p. \nThe forward p/e ratio is high at 19 for 2016. However, growth prospects are strong and any further acquisitions are very likely to be earnings-enhancing, so at 52p the shares are a hold. \nCVS Group \nCVS operates veterinary practices and diagnostic businesses throughout the country. Britain’s pet population continues to grow rapidly, as do the profits of CVS. The interim results for the six months ended December 31 were excellent and for the full year ended June 30 the consensus forecast for earnings per share is 23.6p, against 8.7p last year. \nI took profits on CVS when to my mind the forward p/e ratio became too demanding in relation to the then forecast 2016 earnings per share growth rate of 12pc. This was a mistake as since then the shares have risen and so has the consensus forecast growth rate. \nAt 650p the prospective p/e ratio is still lofty at 23 so I am tempted to rate the shares as a sell. However, a trading update on July 27 indicated that like-for-like sales were up by 6.8pc and the company’s broker, Singer, says “expansion is accelerating”. \nI believe that CVS is a great growth stock and although the price has run ahead of itself the shares should be held for the longer term. \nI should point out here that for IHT purposes it is not necessary to hold the same share for the entire two-year qualifying period. \nRelief from death duties is not lost if investors dispose of qualifying shares and replace them with other qualifying shares (certain types of firm, such as investment companies, do not qualify for the IHT relief). \nHowever, to qualify for continuing relief the whole of the sale proceeds must be used to purchase the replacement shares. HMRC is generous with the time allowed for reinvestment sale and purchase only have to take place within three years of each other. \nSo, for example, if you decided to sell some of your shares in CVS, you could replace them with more Restore shares or any other qualifying Aim stock. \nAn attractive bonus in addition to the capital gains from my suggested IHT portfolio (hopefully tax free in an Isa) there is exemption from 40pc death duties on the value of the shares. \nMore from Jim Slater: \n• My latest 'IHT-free' share tip \n• Escape death taxes with my perfect portfolio of shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T15:51:29.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
