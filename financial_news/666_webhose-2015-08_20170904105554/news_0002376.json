Sources said it was later felt that some more names should be added to the list so there can be greater choice for making the selection.\nAccording to the Prasar Bharati Act, its Board should have six part-time members and curently there are four vacancies.\nA committee headed by Vice President Hamid Ansari and comprising Information and Broadcasting Secretary and Chairman of Press Council of India (PCI) would choose the members.\nThe decision to choose more names, however, would also mean that the appointment of part-time members would take longer since security clearance of the new members would also have to be done.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs has already given security clearance to the seven people whose names have been forwarded to it by the I&B ministry. The same process would have to be undertaken with regard to the new names, sources said.\nThe vacancies of part-time members have existed for over a year as some of them had resigned after a change of government at the Centre.\nAs per the Prasar Bharati Act, part-time members have to be persons of eminence in public life. While their term of office shall be six years, one-third of them shall retire on expiration of two years.\nFirst Published on August 02, 2015 11:14 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T10:22:07.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
