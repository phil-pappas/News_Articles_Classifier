Reuters by Karen Maley The global economy is likely to witness a fresh onslaught of monetary stimulus as central banks respond to feeble European and Japanese growth by ramping up their bond-buying programs.\nBeijing's surprise move last week to push the yuan lower is likely to increase pressure on the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan – which already have massive bond-buying programs in place – to adopt even more aggressive stimulus in the hope of bolstering growth and pushing their currencies even lower.\nThe two major central banks will be deeply disappointed that their efforts so far to boost economic activity and to fan inflationary pressures have met with poor results.\nFigures released on Friday show that gross domestic product in the euro zone increased by a scanty 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, as the French economy stagnated while growth was weaker than expected in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. On an annualised basis, GDP grew by 1.3 per cent.\nAnd even though the European Central Bank launched a €1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) plus bond-buying program in March in an effort to bolster inflation, its efforts have been overwhelmed by the plunging oil price.\nInflation grew by just 0.2 per cent in July on an annualised basis, well below the central bank's target of just under 2 per cent.\nEven lower euro, rates on cards\nThe region's failure to respond to the triple stimulus of a lower euro, falling oil prices and the ECB's massive bond buying program will put pressure on the Bank to apply yet more monetary stimulus. ECB boss Mario Draghi is likely to try to push interest rates, and the euro, even lower in the hope of producing more satisfactory results in terms of growth and inflation.\n But the situation in Japan is even more dire. Figures released on Monday showed that the Japanese economy shrank at an annualised rate of 1.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, weighed down by shrinking household spending and the biggest drop in exports since 2011.\nThe contraction in the Japanese economy, which came after 4.5 per cent growth in the first quarter, raises doubts about the vitality of the world's third biggest economy, despite the vigorous efforts of the Japanese central bank.\nFor the past two years, the Bank of Japan has been buying assets such as government bonds, in an effort to rid the country of deflation. Last October, Bank of Japan head Haruhiko Kuroda shocked financial markets by ramping up the pace of purchases to Y80 trillion ($870 billion) a year.\nInflation effort suppressing consumer confidence\nBut although this policy has driven the Japanese share market higher, and bolstered the profits of the big Japanese companies such as Toyota, it has dented the confidence of Japanese consumers. Japanese households are feeling the strain as wage growth has been sluggish, while Japan's weak yen has pushed up prices for many imported food items. As a result households – whose spending accounts for around 60 per cent of Japan's GDP – have kept a tight control on their purse strings.\nA steep drop in exports, especially to emerging markets, also weighed on Japan's economic performance in the second quarter. Exports to China were particularly week, underscoring the problems caused by China's slowing economy. Japan's exports could feel a further shock as last week's move by the Chinese central bank to devalue the yuan saw it drop by 3.4 per cent against the yen.\nAlthough the Bank of Japan is forecasting growth of 1.7 per cent and 0.7 per cent inflation for the year to March, many analysts believe these forecasts will have to be revised lower.\nThis is likely to put further pressure on the Japanese central bank to adopt even more aggressive monetary stimulus as soon as October, particularly if China's currency depreciation drags down import prices and pushes Japan's inflation – which has been close to zero for most of the year – even lower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:05:23.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
