Despite posting a 3.2pc increase in pre-tax profits to £158.6m and raising its dividend by more than 20pc, the share price nose dived. Augustin Eden, of Accendo Markets, was quick to point the share price is trading at levels, similar to those seen just before the 2008 financial crash. \nInvestors were further spooked on Wednesdy as Citigroup (Swiss: C.SW - news ) “modestly tweaked its estimates”, lowering its rating from “buy” to “neutral”, while raising its target price to 2300p from 2190p. The bank said the company looks well positioned for market share gains and higher returns, but warned this is largely reflected in the share price. \nSeparately, the group’s outlook for the year may also be weighing on investor sentiment, as it maintained its full-year financial performance guidance on Tuesday, despite boosting of good progress in the first six months of the year. \nGary Hobbs, of Investec Wealth & Investment, described the outlook as “reasonably cautious”, but with no upgrades on guidance, he said “the company have a lot to do in the second-half of the year”. Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) and Numis also raised the stock’s target price but their optimistic stances did little to alleviate investors’ concerns. The stock closed at £21.60, bringing the two-day loss to 100p, or 4.5pc. \nMeanwhile, M&A gossip circulating the City suggested some further takeover activity in the pharma industry. Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) found itself in the midst of takeover talk on Wednesday sending shares 18p, or 1.3pc, higher to £14.19. \nTraders say the most likely suitors are US rival Pfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) , with Novartis (Xetra: 904278 - news ) and Roche also linked to the British company. \nIn May, analysts at Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) released a note entitled “Introducing PfizerKline”, in which they proposed tie-up between the two companies. At the time, Gregg Gilbert, of Deutsche Bank, said “a combination with GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) would diversify Pfizer’s vaccine and consumer portfolios while doubling and quadrupling the revenue base for these businesses respectively,” the analysts said. \nOn Tuesday, Anglo-Irish drug giant Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) announced it had approached US-listed Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) . David Evans, of UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , said “this tie-up would make Shire much less attractive to potential buyers”. The stock was changing hands at £54.70 up 75p. GlaxoSmithKline 3-day share price (Source: Bloomberg) \nIn the wider market, Britain’s benchmark index climbed higher boosted by corporate earnings and a rebound in the mining sector. The FTSE 100 closed 65.84 points up at 6,752.41. Jameel Ahmad, of ForexTime, said a combination of slightly better data from China and stabilisation in the commodity markets helped European bourses gather momentum. The German DAX and CAC in Paris rose 1.6pc and 1.7pc, respectively. * UK growth slows in July as dominant services sector cools After enjoying gains of almost 10pc since ValueAct revealed a stake in Rolls-Royce , the FTSE 100 company tumbled 6.5p, or 0.8pc to 817.5p, despite a broker upgrade. Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) raised its price target to 845p from 784.3p and lifted its rating to “neutral” from “underperform”. \nAfter a string of profit warnings, the bank believes “most negatives are now in the price”. While Olivier Brochet, of Credit Suisse, reckons it is probably too early to turn more positive on the stock, “an underperform rating now seems unwarranted”. \nHowever, Mr Brochet noted the involvement of US activist investor ValueAct has changed the market focus from “the poor current 2018 outlook to the possibility of improved profitability and maybe even a break-up of the group”. * Rolls-Royce's biggest shareholder ValueAct is in for the long haul Elsewhere, the London Stock Exchange Group began to reap the benefits of acquiring the Russell Group , as robust growth in the index business helped Europe’s oldest independent bourse post a 27pc rise in half-year adjusted operating profit to £366.1m. Revenue jumped 90pc in the first six months to June to £1.1bn. The stock leapt 42p, or 1.6pc to £26.20. \nMining stocks rebounded, as Liberum upgraded the sector’s rating to “hold”. While analysts expect mining fundamentals to continue to deteriorate into the second half of the year, they reckon the downside from further falls in the iron ore price is limited at Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) . \nAhead of Rio Tinto unveiling its half-year results, Liberum upgraded it to “hold”, sending the stock to the top of the FTSE 100, up 97p, or 3.9pc to £25.68. \nBHP Billiton and Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) jumped 3.6pc and 1.6pc, respectively, and while Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) received a “sell” rating, it advanced 1.7pc to 798.1p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:07:44.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
