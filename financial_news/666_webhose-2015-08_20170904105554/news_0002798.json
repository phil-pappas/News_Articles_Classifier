Management has now admitted that trading and profits are nowhere near the levels expected and have written off about $25m of the target’s value. \nThe charge has been taken in the first-half numbers, causing pre-tax profits to slump to £7.1m, from £16m in the same period last year. \nThe price paid for Paterson was a painful mistake, but investors yesterday focused on the strong underlying trading in the business. The shares gained 1pc to 693.4p. \nThe company is a specialist steel manufacturer. Drive along any UK motorways and you are likely to see Hill & Smith’s crash barriers. The group saw revenue from its roads business rise 35pc in the first half. This is likely to increase after the Conservative government pledged to spend more on infrastructure. \nAbout three-quarters of revenue and 85pc of underlying operating profit are generated from its UK and US businesses, which mainly operate in industrial markets, where the outlook is good. After a slow start, infrastructure spending in North America is rapidly accelerating. \nRevenue in the six months to the end of June increased 4pc to £233m, at higher operating profit margins than last year. Taking out the one-off costs, underlying pre-tax profits were up 19pc to £24.8m. \nMarket consensus is for full-year, underlying pre-tax profits of about £50.3m, from revenue of £475m, giving 48.5p in earnings per share. \nThe shares offer a prospective yield of 2.8pc and have gained 14pc, or almost £1 per share, since we said they looked too cheap (Buy, 603p, March 10). \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , trading on 14.4 times forecast earnings, they remain a steady income share. \nWith trading expected to improve into the second half, we are happy to remain holders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T14:24:35.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
