Figures for 2015 were not disclosed. \nThe documents also show Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 to deliver a speech at the World Travel and Tourism Council in Abu Dhabi on April 9, 2013. The tax returns revealed the Clinton couple collectively earned a total of more than $139 million between 2007 and 2014, mainly from speeches and book deals. \nAnnouncing Clinton’s appointment in December 2010, the chairman of GEMS Education, Sunny Varkey said: “We are honoured and privileged to have President Clinton as our honorary chairman. The foundation’s aim is to impact the lives of 10 million underprivileged children globally and I know that with his support we have a good chance of reaching that objective. Up to 70 million school age children worldwide do not have access to education, that is a travesty and we intend to do something about that by using all the resources available to us.” \n“By working with international organisations that promote better educational standards, we seek to use our best talent, insight, and intellectual property to make a vital difference to the knowledge, skills and abilities of school leaders and teachers, who make the essential difference in a child’s educational journey.” \nCommenting on his appointment, Clinton added: “Access to education provides the means to lift children out of poverty and that an educated child affects not only the child itself, but his or her family and the wider community. The Varkey GEMS Foundation's commitment will bring this opportunity to millions more children around the world by improving the quality and access to education for those less fortunate. One of the things I have learned travelling the world is that intelligence is evenly distributed but opportunity is not. \n“Our ability to solve some of the world’s most pressing issues, like poverty, is only possible when the private sector works alongside, and in partnership with, intergovernmental agencies and NGO’s and the Varkey GEMS Foundation is an excellent example of that. Recently, the Foundation announced a partnership with UNESCO to train 10,000 school Principals in Ghana, Kenya and India.” \nThe Varkey GEMS Foundation works with a number of former politicians to promote its educational message, including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, through his Tony Blair Faith Foundation, and former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who is a member of the foundation’s Global Advisory Board. \nGEMS Education declined to comment when contacted by Arabian Business. \nIn June, GEMS Education reported its revenue grow by 20 percent in the year through to March, helped by rising fees and pupil numbers. \nThe National newspaper reported that GEMS, which operates more than 50 schools across 19 countries in the Middle East, North America, Europe, Asia and Africa, earned $674.8 million in revenue in the year through March, up 20 percent on the previous year’s figure of $559.6 million. \nGEMS said its revenue increase was down to improvement enrolment numbers, which rose by nearly 9 percent to 98,000, and improved annual revenue per pupil. \nDubai's Fajr Capital led a group, including Blackstone and Bahrain sovereign fund Mumtalakat, in acquiring a \"significant minority stake\" GEMS Education in October 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T15:20:12.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
