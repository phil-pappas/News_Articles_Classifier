Kathee Tesija, the company's former chief merchandising and supply chain officer, was moved to an advisory role in June.\n\"Given the breadth and complexity of the business, it will always be a challenge to be in stock on every item in every store... but our guests need us to be consistent in delivering everyday essentials,\" Mulligan said.\nTarget's supply-chain problems have grown more acute as it has expanded its offering of consumable goods such as meat, fresh produce and dairy products, which in turn have brought customers back to their stores more frequently than in the past.\nTarget's larger rival, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, has struggled to tackle the problem of running out of stock at its own stores for several years, despite having one of the largest and most sophisticated supply chain networks in the business.\nAnalysts and industry consultants said that while Wal-Mart's problems revolve around insufficient employees to fill shelves, an issue the company is addressing, Target's issues stem from its reliance on external distributors.\n\"Target tends to use outside wholesalers and outsources a large amount of distribution, typically on fast-moving consumables,\" said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.\nProducts such as groceries, fresh produce, meat, dairy are replenished up to a 100 times or more every year, and when an outside wholesaler short-ships, Target's stores suffer. The clear solution would be to take control of its supply chain, he added.\n\"They have had problems in the past with it and they probably rely on third-party wholesalers and distributors more than they need to,\" said Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst at Edward Jones.\nIn an earnings conference call Target said its supply chain was built to serve an outdated model in which product flowed from vendors through distribution centers to stores.\nThe company did not respond to subsequent requests for comment.\nTarget also has tried to order less inventory than rivals, striving to turn over inventory quickly and reduce capital needs. Typically, retailers like to keep enough stock in their stores to meet around 90 percent of anticipated demand, and over 96 percent for advertised or promotional items, Yarbrough said.\n\"Target historically has leaned on the side of under-ordering or under-allocating to keep inventory turns high,\" said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan-Doolittle.
