By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 56 minutes ago 1,171.00 -5.0000 \nMoney makeover: Elaine Livesey, 52, is keen to invest her lump sum from Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) wisely. Our experts suggest exactly what she should do \nElaine Livesey was made redundant in May by supermarket giant Tesco, after 25 years of loyal service. At just 52, she is not able to take her pension yet, so needs her £60,000 redundancy payout to provide an income for the next few years at least. \nThe lump sum is currently sitting in her bank account and so is earning very little interest. \n\"I know I need to invest it so that I can generate an income without eating into the capital, but I have no idea where to start,\" she said. \nMs Livesey does have a part-time job which brings in £800 a month, but it doesn’t cover all of her costs. \nAs well as supplementing her income, she would like to pay off her mortgage as soon as possible and ensure she has a decent income when she retires, which she hopes to do at age 55. \nMs Livesey is lucky she has a final salary pension scheme with Tesco that she has been a member of since she joined the company in 1990. While Tesco said it can’t put a value on the pension until closer to her retirement age, it’s a valuable benefit that will provide a guaranteed income for life. \nIn the meantime, Ms Livesey and her partner have a £104,000 mortgage on their £200,000 home near Stirling in Scotland. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) contributes £600 a month towards the repayments and there is just under eight years remaining on the loan. \nIn addition, Ms Livesey has a £4,500 car loan that costs her £219 a month, with two years remaining. These two expenses alone use up her £800 monthly salary. She has a small slush fund that will keep her going until next month, when she will need income from her redundancy money. \nMs Livesey does have other assets. She bought her parent’s house outright, worth £65,000, and plans to sell it after they pass away. She also owns £2,500 worth of Tesco shares. \nShe also bought her daughter a £77,000 house with a £12,000 deposit and a £65,000 mortgage. Although the mortgage is in Ms Livesey’s name, her daughter pays the monthly repayments and plans to take over the mortgage and repay the deposit in the future. \n“I'm now in a position where I have £60,000 sitting in the bank and I just don’t know what to do with it,” she said. “I don’t want to take too much risk but I know I need to generate an income. I’ve considered investing in more property but I’m open to other ideas.” \n'We want to emigrate to Australia, but can we afford to?' \n'We earn £47,000. Can we get into buy-to-let and retire at 50?' \n= Danny Cox of Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) said: = \nMs Livesey’s core aim is to increase her income to meet her outgoings, but in many cases it is more effective to reduce outgoings, increasing disposable income. \nShe could do this by clearing her car loan and paying off a large chunk of her mortgage. \nUsing £4,500 of her redundancy pay to clear her car loan would immediately boost her disposable income by £219 a month. Before doing so however, Ms Livesey should check whether there are any charges or penalties for paying the loan off early. \nLooking at the mortgage, Ms Livesey and her partner have just taken a very attractive two-year fixed rate of 2.09pc on the remaining £104,000 of the mortgage. However the rate of interest she is paying on the mortgage is higher than the return she might achieve on her £60,000 lump sum from a cash account. \nFor example the best monthly income account is paying 3.01pc gross interest, which is 2.41pc after basic rate tax. However, this is over a five-year term which in my view is far too long to fix a savings rate given the likelihood of interest rate rises next year. \nA one-year rate is paying 2.04pc gross, or 1.63pc after basic rate tax, roughly half a percentage point lower than the interest being charged on the mortgage. \nIf Ms Livesey opted to use £45,000 of her redundancy to reduce the mortgage, the repayments would be around half the £600 she is paying now. This would improve her disposable income by around £255 a month, or £3,060 a year, compared to receiving £733 a year in interest after tax. \nEarly repayment charges may apply to her mortgage, particularly during the two-year fixed period, so she should make the repayment as soon as there is no penalty attached. \nIn the meantime she should keep the remaining £10,000 back as a cash reserve emergency fund and split it, plus the £45,000 she is waiting to pay off her mortgage, across a cash Isa (to maximise her tax-free savings) and one-year fixed term accounts. \nOn her final salary pension from Tesco, it will be at its most valuable at the normal retirement age, probably 65. If Ms Livesey takes her pension at age 55, there would be what is known as an “actuarial deduction”, which would lower her income. \nThis could be as much as 5pc for every year she retires early, which could mean her pension benefits halve. Although Tesco cannot put a value on this pension they will be able to say what the actuarial adjustment is likely to be for early retirement. Ms Livesey should check this, as well as when and how much she will receive in state pension. \nRather than invest further in property, she should consider diversifying her investments, looking toward the stock market. Stocks and shares Isas provide tax efficient growth and income, with more flexibility and lower transaction costs than a property. She could start by moving her Tesco shares into a stocks and shares Isa and then look to add money on a regular basis once her mortgage has been cleared. \n• Need a money makeover?

This amount should be held in cash and used to draw on until her final salary pension kicks in at age 55. \nWith the remaining amount she could look to invest this for capital growth. As her risk profile is low to medium she could feasibly have some of this invested in equities. As she has not utilised her Isa allowance this year she is able to put £15,240 into a stocks and shares Isa. \nThe remaining funds could be invested in the same way, with the same provider, in a collective investment account and could gradually be transferred into an Isa. That way it would all eventually be housed in a tax-free growth environment. Any income that is paid out from the Isa at a later date would not be subject to income tax. \nI would suggest that once Ms Livesey reaches 55 a review is done to establish what level of income she is likely to receive from her final salary scheme and whether she still requires additional income. \nIn the meantime Tesco should be able to give her projections as to what they estimate her income to be at retirement. \nMs Livesey should investigate whether her part time employer has a pension scheme in place as this may be another way of supplementing her retirement income. It’s not wise to pass up the opportunity of free money from your employer. \nIn order to pay off her mortgage as soon as possible, Ms Livesey should consider overpaying or reducing the term when her current two-year deal comes to an end. Her car loan will be paid off by then so she may be able to afford slightly higher repayments. \nAny additional funds that she may receive, such as the deposit money from her daughter, could go towards repaying the mortgage. Most lenders will allow you to overpay by up to 10pc a year without any penalties. \n• More makeovers are included in our weekly money newsletter \n= Would you like a Telegraph Money Makeover? = \nIf you'd like to be considered, please send your responses to all the following questions with the header ‘Give me a Money Makeover’ to money@telegraph.co.uk. \nYou must be willing to be photographed for the article, which will appear online and in the paper.
