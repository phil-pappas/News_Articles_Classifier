( bit.ly/1MKsFSo )\nU.S. homebuilders, including Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton Inc and Lennar Corp, have been able to raise prices as low mortgage rates and strong employment trends boost demand, putting the housing market on a path of steady recovery.\nThe average price at which Toll Brothers booked orders rose 16 percent to $834,000, the highest quarterly average in the company's history.\n\"This housing recovery appears to be built on a very solid foundation,\" Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said in a statement on Tuesday.\nToll Brothers targets customers who typically make at least $100,000 a year.\nThe company's net income fell to $66.7 million, or 36 cents per share, from $97.7 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue fell 2.7 percent to $1.03 billion.\nTo Monday's close of $38.06, Toll's shares had risen about 11 percent this year, slightly outpacing a rise of about 10 percent in the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index.
