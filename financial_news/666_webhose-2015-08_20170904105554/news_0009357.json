He said while many Asian investors had never travelled to Perth, they were comfortable “buying blind” after viewing presentations.\n“They might never visit Perth, but as free-trade agreements continue and Chinese people start to see more WA products in their supermarkets, they feel a familiarity,” Mr Tong said.\nHe said recent Foreign Investment Review Board changes, which introduced a minimum $5000 fee on investors, had little effect on “smart, wealthy businessman” who considered Perth property “cheap”.\nFIRB figures show overseas buyers applied to purchase $1.32 billion worth of WA residential property last year.\nBlackburne Property director Paul Blackburne reported foreign investment of up to 25 per cent in some complexes while Pindan residential director Jo Chin said she had seen overseas investors account for up to 30 per cent of buyers, with investors from Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong the main players.\nLatest NAB estimates show the FIRB crackdown has not stopped the foreign investor spend, with 12.9 per cent of new apartment sales in Perth going to overseas buyers last quarter.\nBut prominent land developer Nigel Satterley, whose company has multiple Chinese backers, said apartment developers were trying to “flog” their product to overseas buyers because of lack of local interest.\n“We know Asia very well and they simply have no interest. They want Melbourne and to a lesser extent Sydney,” Mr Satterley said.\n“The apartment developers are doing what Shane Warne would call a ‘spin’ ... (Overseas) buyers are very savvy and know what the situation is with the massive apartment oversupply.”\nOpportunity: Shuo Yang, with husband Xinyu Zhang and sons, Zi Xuan and Ming Xuan, in their restaurant. Picture: Matthew Poon Source: News Limited\nNEW ARRIVALS QUICK TO CASH IN\nSINGAPOREAN investor Shuo Yang says she has no future in her homeland.\nCurrently waiting for approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board on an $800,000 home she is purchasing in Belmont, Ms Yang said Perth prices “were incredibly cheap” compared to Singapore, where she and her children lived in a “tiny condo”.\nUnlike faceless foreign investors, who will never see their property, Ms Yang and her husband, Xinyu Zhang, have relocated to Perth and bought the Yip Kee Noodle Restaurant in Maylands.\n“From my point of view, there is no future in Singapore – the space is so small and there is a limitation of resources,” she said.\n“Here, the prices are much cheaper, the house is half the price what it would be in Singapore where everyone has to live in an apartment. There’s a garden and space for the kids to play.”\nMs Yang, who has come to Western Australia with her husband, her two sons and her mother, said she liked the Perth lifestyle and the education opportunities for her children.\nPorter Matthews agent Greg Orbinski, who is selling Ms Yang her home, said he had seen an increase in foreign investors in the Belmont area over the past year.\n“They like it for its proximity to the city, but also the space and value for money they get, compared to some Asian countries like Singapore,” he said.\nOriginally published as ‘Cheap’ Perth units lure foreign buyers ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/apartment-boom-cheap-perth-units-lure-foreign-property-buyers/story-fndbaln9-1227504150122?sv=fb44c9acf7cd4196ea1a41ab6c7fd100&title=%26%238216%3BCheap%26%238217%3B+Perth+units+lure+foreign+buyers", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/realestate/news/apartment-boom-cheap-perth-units-lure-foreign-property-buyers/story-fnhlgriw-1227504150122", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/apartment-boom-cheap-perth-units-lure-foreign-property-buyers/story-fndbaln9-1227504150122?sv=fb44c9acf7cd4196ea1a41ab6c7fd100&title=%26%238216%3BCheap%26%238217%3B+Perth+units+lure+foreign+buyers", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/apartment-boom-cheap-perth-units-lure-foreign-property-buyers/story-fndbaln9-1227504150122?sv=fb44c9acf7cd4196ea1a41ab6c7fd100", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/apartment-boom-cheap-perth-units-lure-foreign-property-buyers/story-fndbaln9-1227504150122?sv=fb44c9acf7cd4196ea1a41ab6c7fd100&h=%26%238216%3BCheap%26%238217%3B+Perth+units+lure+foreign+buyers", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/apartment-boom-cheap-perth-units-lure-foreign-property-buyers/story-fndbaln9-1227504150122?sv=fb44c9acf7cd4196ea1a41ab6c7fd100", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=%26%238216%3BCheap%26%238217%3B+Perth+units+lure+foreign+buyers&c=TWO+in+five+apartments+at+new+Perth+complexes+are+being+snapped+up+by+foreign+investors%2C+with+Asian+buyers+honing+in+on+%26%238220%3Bcheap%26%238221%3B+WA+property.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/apartment-boom-cheap-perth-units-lure-foreign-property-buyers/story-fndbaln9-1227504150122?sv=fb44c9acf7cd4196ea1a41ab6c7fd100"], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:43:23.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
