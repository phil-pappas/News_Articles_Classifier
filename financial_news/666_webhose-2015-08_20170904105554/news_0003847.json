Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Jamie Freed Hotel chains are increasing the number of perks on offer for customers making direct bookings rather than through online travel agents like Booking.com, Wotif and Expedia as the latter groups raise the commissions charged to hotels for bookings.\nThe commission rates paid in Australia had long been behind the global average of 20 to 25 per cent because Wotif had charged less than Booking.com owner Priceline and Expedia did overseas. But after Expedia bought Wotif for $703 million last year, it raised Wotif's rates to 15 per cent from 12 per cent and Qantas-owned Hooroo raised its rates to 13 per cent from 10 per cent.\nMichael Issenberg, the Asia-Pacific chairman of Australia's largest hotel chain, Accor, said his group's focus on direct distribution had increased as a result of the Expedia-Wotif deal.\n\"The cost of [online travel agents] has traditionally been lower in Australia than in other markets,\" he said during a visit to Sydney last week. \"It is creeping up. And as it creeps up it is even more important than ever to generate business in your own distribution channels.\"\nAs a result, Accor, whose brands include Sofitel, Pullman, Mercure and Ibis, is taking a more focused approach to distribution by creating a single AccorHotels app for all of the brands. It is also creating packages for loyalty members, such as $20 a day adult drinks and children's meal deals which are unavailable for those booking through online travel agents. Rival Hilton Hotels is now offering free wifi for all members of its loyalty program, no matter how high their tier, so long as they book their stay directly.\nAccor opens to independents Accor has also opened its distribution platform to independent hotels, with a focus on providing more options for its customers in cities where it does not have many of its own rooms available, such as Kuala Lumpur.\n\"It will be less for us in Australia than in other parts of the world,\" Mr Issenberg said. \"It will drive traffic to our website. Research has shown us the more traffic that is drawn to our website the more we convert and the more our existing hotels will benefit.\"\n The online travel agents are fighting back with loyalty initiatives of their own. In May, Expedia launched its loyalty program Expedia+ in Australia, which allows travellers to earn points when booking with Expedia and other benefits such as priority customer care and exclusive hotel amenities. Booking.com gives its top bookers 10 per cent off rates for standard room types for booking hotels that participate in the program.\nFor online travel agents repeat business is very valuable because they otherwise have to spend a huge amount of money advertising through groups like Google and Facebook to acquire new customers.\nFocus on loyalty programs Expedia chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi last month told analysts his company was investing heavily in its loyalty program and customer service because repeat customers accounted for the majority of the company's profits.\n\"As far as our loyalty programs, we continue to see very nice traction there,\" he said. \"Hotels.com has got the biggest in the family as far as loyalty goes. There are over 18 million now hotels.com rewards members around the globe. I think of those 18 million members since the program started, I think they've stayed in 4.5 million motel rooms for free.\"\nPriceline chief executive Darren Huston last week said his company's most loyal customers were ones that had downloaded apps from its brands like Booking.com and Agoda.\n\"Once you have an account, we can store your credit card securely, we can store your name, and it leads to like one-click booking,\" he said. \"Then our challenge becomes really, and has been, how do we bring more customers into the franchise? And that's what we use paid marketing for. But generally speaking our direct business continues to increase, which is a reflection generally of repeat business.\"", "external_links": ["http://hotels.com/", "https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/qantas-hooroo-follows-wotif-in-raising-commission-rates-for-hotels-bbs-20150527-ghagk3.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/accor-boss-says-falling-a-prompts-aussies-to-holiday-at-home-20150803-giqtz5.html"], "published": "2015-08-09T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T20:13:02.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
