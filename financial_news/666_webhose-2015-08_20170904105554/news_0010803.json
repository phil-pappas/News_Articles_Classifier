This has more than doubled in square-metre terms since January 2010, and increased by 190 per cent in value terms. Boosting activity has been the strong inflow over the past year, with 56 per cent of office sales ($2.8 billion) to offshore groups.\nAdvertisement Over the same period, Greater China has had the strongest growth rate, up elevenfoldâ€‹ to $4.26 billion, accentuated recently by the Investa portfolio transaction to CIC, while North American investment also increased, most notably over the past 18 months. Canada has overtaken Singapore as the largest owner by country, with $3.45 billion of assets compared with $3.12 billion.\nSince January 2010, about 857,000 square metres, or 44 per cent, of the total turnover of Knight Frank's database has transferred to offshore ownership. Secondary grade stock acquisitions have dominated sales activity. A significant driver has been the demand for large, non-prime assets with redevelopment/change of use potential. Dalian Wanda, Visionary and Shimao have been active participants.\nIn the hotel sector, analysis of four and five-star hotels in the Sydney CBD (10,850 rooms) shows that since 2010, 4825 rooms, or 45 per cent, of these hotels have sold and all to offshore groups. Recent significant sales include the Westin Hotel (Far East/Sino Group), the Hilton Hotel (Bright Ruby) and the Sheraton on the Park (Sunshine Insurance).\nAsian ownership has increased to 8363 rooms. This is now 77 per cent, up from 51 per cent. Greater China increased from, effectively, zero to almost 2000 rooms or 18.4 per cent. Notwithstanding a slight decrease over the period, Singapore remains the dominant owner by country. It owns just over 3000 rooms or 29 per cent of total stock.\nMatt Whitby is group director, head of research and consulting for Knight Frank Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:39:23.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
