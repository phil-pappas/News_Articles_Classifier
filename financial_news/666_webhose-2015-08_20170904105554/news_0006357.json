Over the past five years, taxpayers have spent $260,237 on chauffeured cars, limousines and private-plated vehicles to drive Ms Bishop around Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and other capital cities.\nA digitally altered clip from the 1989 film Driving Miss Daisy with Bronwyn Bishop as Jessica Tandy’s character Daisy Werthan and Tony Abbott in Morgan Freeman’s role of chauffeur Hoke Colburn. Source: The Sunday Telegraph\nHer spokesman revealed she has often preferred Royale Limousines, that offers chauffeur-driven BMWs, because unlike Comcars they can drive in bus lanes allowing her to get around faster. An analysis by The Sunday Telegraph has revealed that on April 4, 2012, the night Mrs Bishop attended the premiere of Yes, Prime Minister at the Sydney Theatre at Walsh Bay, she booked two Comcars.\nThe first was for $468.50 and the second trip on the same day was for $602.50.\nMrs Bishop’s entry on the register of members’ interests also records separately that she received two free tickets to attend Yes, Prime Minister on April 4, 2012, and that two members of her staff also received free tickets.\nAngela Bishop and MP mother Bronwyn at premiere of 'Yes, Prime Minister' at Sydney Theatre on April 4, 2012 Source: Supplied\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott is under mounting pressure over his support for Bronwyn Bishop Source: News Corp Australia\nBronwyn Bishop at the Adopt A Change exclusive dinner on Saturday night.

Liberal frontbencher Andrew Robb was also photographed at the opening night. It is not known if she had any official events on the day of the $1000 chauffeured car booking as her office is refusing to provide details of her official diary while the ­Finance Department probes Mrs Bishop’s expenses.\n“All of these matters are now before the Department of Finance and it is not ­appropriate for our office to continue commentary now this process is under way,” a spokesman said.\nMrs Bishop’s office has previously defended her use of chauffeur-driven cars to attend the opera and theatre as “quite proper” after it was revealed she had spent ­another $1000 attending La Boheme in Sydney in 2013.\nFinance records show she spent $517 and $516 on two Comcar trips on the same day she attended the opera.\nRELATED: Bishop spent $1,071 on chauffeured trips same day she went to ‘freebie’\nRELATED: Bronwyn Bishop must go, frontbenchers tell Prime Minister\nSAMANTHA MAIDEN: Bishop’s refusal to step down will leave the government reeling\nOPINION: Bishop’s backpedalling would have won her a Tour de France stage\nEDITORIAL: PM must cut liability Speaker of the House Bronwyn Bishop loose\nAccording to parliamentary records, Mrs Bishop also spent $342 on Anzac Day for a chauffeur-driven Comcar to ferry her to official engagements as Speaker in Sydney.\nLast year, her car costs were $32,965, but this figure did not include land transport costs overseas of $14,000 during a $90,000 overseas tour.\nBut these costs were comparatively modest to the costs she incurred in 2010 when she lodged a combined bill for Comcars and hire cars of $39,088 for just six months from July to December. Her total chauffeured car costs in 2010 were $64,058.\nThe reporting period ­included the 2010 election. On August 8, 2010, the day before Tony Abbott formally launched the Coalition’s federal election campaign, Mrs Bishop spent $740.15 on a single Comcar trip.\nIn a final report for 2010, Mrs Bishop also reported multiple “infringement notices” for hire cars of $25 each. On one day on April 16, 2010, her hire car reported four $25 ­infringement notices totalling $100 on the same day that she hired Comcars in Melbourne for $166 and $40 respectively. In Brisbane, on May 17, 2010, she reported a $550 Comcar trip.\nIn 2011, Mrs Bishop reported car costs of $28,000 in just six months from July to December.\nOriginally published as Driving Miss Bronny: $1000+ chauffeured trips ", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fni0xqrc-1227466264482", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/bronwyn-bishop-must-go-frontbenchers-tell-prime-minister-tony-abbott/story-fni0xqrc-1227466297853", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/bronwyn-bishops-backpedalling-would-have-won-her-a-tour-de-france-stage/story-fni0cwl5-1227465928769", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fn5tas5k-1227466524859?sv=4c5c44f950d38e7d13e4acf0f0a9590d&h=Driving+Miss+Bronny%3A+%241000%2B+chauffeured+trips", "http://www.DailyTelegraph.com.au/news/national/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fni0xqrc-1227466264482", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/bronwyn-bishops-initial-refusal-to-step-down-will-leave-the-government-reeling-even-if-she-resigns-now/story-fni0cwl5-1227466203751", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fn5tas5k-1227466524859?sv=4c5c44f950d38e7d13e4acf0f0a9590d", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fn5tas5k-1227466524859?sv=4c5c44f950d38e7d13e4acf0f0a9590d", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Driving+Miss+Bronny%3A+%241000%2B+chauffeured+trips&c=HIGH-roller+Bronwyn+%26%23173%3BBishop+spent+%241071+on+two+chauffeur-driven+car+trips+in+Sydney+on+the+same+day.+But+that+was+hardly+a+unique+event.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fn5tas5k-1227466524859?sv=4c5c44f950d38e7d13e4acf0f0a9590d", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/tony-abbott-must-cut-liability-speaker-of-the-house-bronwyn-bishop-loose/story-fni0cwl5-1227466040264", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fn5tas5k-1227466524859?sv=4c5c44f950d38e7d13e4acf0f0a9590d&title=Driving+Miss+Bronny%3A+%241000%2B+chauffeured+trips", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bronwyn-bishop-spent-1071-on-chauffeured-trips-same-day-she-went-to-freebie-opening-night-of-yes-prime-minister/story-fn5tas5k-1227466524859?sv=4c5c44f950d38e7d13e4acf0f0a9590d&title=Driving+Miss+Bronny%3A+%241000%2B+chauffeured+trips"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T01:46:51.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
