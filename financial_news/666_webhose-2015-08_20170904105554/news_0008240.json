These results were published in the latest State of the Industry report, recently released by ACT Research Co. (ACT). The report covers Classes 5 through 8 vehicles for the North American market.Kenny Vieth, ACT’s President and Senior Analyst, noted that, at the midway point of Q3, the economy and freight markets are being buffeted by cross-currents, generating mixed signals. He added, “In July, Class 8 orders broke to the high side of expectations for the first time since February, producing seasonally adjusted net orders to 29,600.” According to Vieth, “Helping drive the high-side outcome in July was a large press-release worthy 9,000 unit, multi-year order, but even if this is excluded July’s orders were well ahead of expectations.”Concerning medium duty, Vieth said, “On balance, the Classes 5-7 market saw orders improve from June to July, with broad-based strength in Classes 6-7 orders (up 7% y/y) offsetting weakness in Class 5 orders, which were down 12% y/y.” He added, “The improvement in Classes 6-7 orders would have been stronger but for a sharp drop in step van orders versus a one-off order last July.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:35:25.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
