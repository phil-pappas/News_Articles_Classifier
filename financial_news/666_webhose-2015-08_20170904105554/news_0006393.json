Toshiba has announced plans to revise its earnings by Y152 billion ($A1.66 billion) or more to correct the mistakes. The company did not give a specific forecast for the fiscal year which ends on March 31, 2016. The management reshuffle plan calls for Toshiba's chairman and interim president, Masashi Muromachi, to stay on as president. An outside board member will be named chairman. The newly organised board is to have 11 members, seven of whom will be outside directors. The report by the investigation committee into the accounting problems outlined many instances of company officials underreporting costs, delaying reports of losses and other abuses including \"channel stuffing,\" or inflating sales figures by putting more products into a distribution channel than it can sell. In many cases it attributed the missteps to worries that upper management would not accept the losses and to lax internal controls. No charges have been filed related to the problems, which date back at least six years. Toshiba has pledged to create a functional whistleblower system to help stave off future abuses.
