He said a September rate hike seemed less compelling than just a few weeks ago, although he added that \"short-term\" market volatility did not have significant implications for the U.S. recovery. The dollar pared gains against the euro and yen after his remarks.\nData showed U.S. durables good order rose 2.0 percent in July, while non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 2.2 percent last month, the biggest rise since June last year.\n\"Today's durable goods figure makes good reading for the world's largest economy, but, after a chaotic start to the week for global markets, this jump in orders may not be enough to alter the Federal Reserve's likely plan to delay an interest rate rise a little longer,\" said Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, in Limassol, Cyprus.\nIn mid-morning trading, the euro was down 0.7 percent at $1.1427, with the single currency also hurt by comments from a senior European Central Bank official. Peter Praet said the risk of the ECB missing its inflation target has increased due to commodity price falls and weakness in some overseas economies.\nThe dollar was up 0.2 percent at 119.13 yen, having slumped to a 7-month low of 116.16 on Monday.\nBoth the euro and the yen have been underpinned after the current market turmoil prompted an unwinding of carry trades. In carry trades, investors sell a low-yielding currency to buy a riskier asset or currency for higher returns. But when volatility rises and markets come under stress, these trades are unwound.\nThe dollar traded above 125 yen while the euro was below $1.10 just two weeks ago, before widespread risk aversion swept financial markets and drove investors to buy back the yen and euro.
