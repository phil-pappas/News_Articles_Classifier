Sahlan Hayes by Ben Potter Andrew Stevens, chairman of the Abbott government's Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, is impressed by the advanced manufacturers that \"fly under the radar\".\nFrom automated machine tools and aerospace components made in Melbourne's suburbs to carbon fibre wheels in Geelong, microwave equipment and synthetic biological compounds in Brisbane and breathing equipment on the Gold Coast, they are everywhere.\nAnd if there's one thing these firms are telling the former IBM Australia chief executive, it's that the time for talk is over.\n\"One of the feedbacks (they've given) is, 'we have been involved in consultations on this stuff for a few years now, and we would rather do less consultation and see more action',\" Stevens tells The Australian Financial Review .\nCo-founder of automated cutting and drilling machine exporter ANCA, Pat Boland, a manufacturing success story. Wayne Taylor \"And so our orientation now is about establishment and action.\"\nAdvanced manufacturing is a curiosity.\nIt is one of five \"growth centres\" nominated by the Abbott government - at the urging of the Business Council of Australia - for special attention as the drivers of our post-mining boom economic growth.\nYet it's the one in which we have the weakest claims to global competitiveness.\n \"We haven't yet developed specialist, globally competitive enterprises to replace traditional manufacturing,\" Gordon Naylor says. Simon Schluter Notable success stories There are notable success stories - automated cutting and drilling machine exporters ANCA and Sutton Tools, aerospace parts supplier Marand, blood products group CSL and snackfood packaging machinery maker TNA.\nBut they are exceptions, and policies aimed at making them the rule have a chequered history.\nFormer Labor industry ministers Greg Combet and Kim Carr gave the sector a lot of care and attention - when they weren't lavishing subsidies on the unviable car assembly industry.\nUniversity of Technology Sydney business dean Roy Green sees a danger the pendulum could swing too far away from basic research, which produces the \"really big breakthroughs\". The Abbott government showed less interest. But Business Council President Catherine Livingstone - a former chief executive of ear implant maker Cochlear - got into Prime Minister Tony Abbott's ear and the \"growth centres\" were born.\nTwo of the growth centres - advanced manufacturing and food and agriculture - had close parallels among Labor's \"Innovation Precincts\". Food and ag even the same chairman, Peter Schutz.\nStevens himself chaired Labor's services leaders group, and growth centres advisory committee chairman John Grills filled a similar role for Labor.\nForging a consensus on how to build a globally competitive manufacturing industry from a game but undersized sector with a handful of star players is hard.\n'Bureaucratic and wasteful' ANCA's co-founder Pat Boland told the Financial Review two weeks ago that the focus on advanced manufacturing loses sight of basic priorities such as designing better products and updating obsolete equipment.\nThe government's well funded co-operative research centres are bureaucratic and wasteful, he added.\nThe sector lacks the critical mass of other growth centres - food and agriculture, energy and resources, mining equipment, technology and services, or medical technology and pharmaceuticals.\n\"We haven't yet developed specialist, globally competitive enterprises to replace traditional manufacturing,\" Gordon Naylor, chief financial officer at CSL, told the Committee for Economic Development of Australia last month.\n\"We have seen piecemeal measures over the years aimed at 'commercialising' Australia's research base, with varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\"Even so, growth in advanced manufacturing in Australia has lagged the economy as a whole and, over the last five years or so, failed to add new jobs to the economy.\"\nStevens has been frank about the obstacles facing advanced manufacturing in Australia.\nAustralia ranks tenth in the world for \"innovation inputs\" - basic research - but 81st in innovation efficiency, or the rate at which research is put to use in the economy, he told CEDA.\nWe rank last among 34 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries for collaboration between business and research institutions.\nMany of our most successful firms supply \"intermediate solutions\" - machines, parts or materials used as inputs by other manufacturers. But Australia ranks 33rd in the OECD in trade in intermediate goods.\nTax rate doesn't help In a story played out many times over recent years, CSL decided last year to locate a high tech plant in Switzerland - even though it would be using Australian intellectual property.\nOne of the most significant impediments to advanced manufacturing in Australia is the high 30 per cent corporate tax rate, Naylor said.\nThe manufacturing workforce shrank from 16.8 per cent of all workers in 1984 to 8.1 per cent in 2014, and 127,000 jobs have disappeared since 2008, a department of industry study said last year.\nA Boston Consulting Group study last year found Australia's manufacturing competitiveness fell by the most of 25 top manufacturing nations in the past two decades. The shrinking dollar has restored some but not all of this shortfall.\n\"We are not going to move the needle in manufacturing in this country unless we change the mindset,\" Stevens says.\nUnder the old mindset, Canberra poured $30 billion in tariff and budget support to the car industry over the 15 years before Ford, Holden and Toyota decided to quit local assembly.\nCo-operative research centres have soaked up $4 billion since 1991, and the Abbott government pledged another $731 million in this year's budget - including $40 million for an \"innovative manufacturing\" CRC. Millions of man hours have been poured into devising schemes to wean traditional manufacturing off subsidies, nurture technology start-ups and make us a \"clever country\".\nMultinational supply chains key Stevens is realistic - but optimistic.\nAdvanced manufacturing plays to Australia's strengths and capabilities - flexibility, great problem solving and the the application of technology to those things, he says.\nIt is more a process than a discrete sector. The successful firms have common characteristics: high value products and services; short production runs with high or even mass customisation; innovative value chains; specialised manufacturing; penetration of global supply chains; and a preference for competing on value not price.\nThe falling Aussie dollar has already boosted non-mining exports sharply. That's changed the environment for the better.\nBut to break the stop-start policy habit, growth centres have to aim for success on a ten-year horizon.\nA big focus is on locking local manufacturers into the supply chains of multinationals such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\nThis is \"the number one answer to the question, 'what would you need to do to double your business in five years?',\" Stevens says.\nProduction's share of the value of a product has fallen sharply since the 1970s, while the share taken by research and development and pre-and post-sales service has increased.\nLess driven by 'intellectual curiosity' This places a premium on Australia's weak suit - identifying basic research with potential and developing and nurturing it over the \"valley of death\" to commercialisation and exploitation.\nAustralia spends about $9.7 billion annually on research - $2.5 billion via business research and development tax breaks and $7.2 billion in government-funded research.\nStevens wants research - at universities and CRCs - to be more focused on competitiveness in global markets and less driven by \"intellectual curiosity\".\nHe wants to \"reach into the dark pools of CSIRO research that has never gone into the development stage\" and try to identify potential winners.\nNaylor, meanwhile, is pushing a special 10 per cent tax rate for advanced manufacturing.\nUniversity of Technology Sydney business dean Roy Green sees a danger the pendulum could swing too far away from basic research, which produces the \"really big breakthroughs\".\nBut as a former Labor advisor on industry policy Green says he's \"encouraged\" by the government's belated focus on industry policy and the \"close alignment\" with Innovation Precincts.\nGreen says Labor's preoccupation with preserving the car industry instead of transforming it handicapped the cause of advanced manufacturing in Australia.\nWe have no Fortune Global 500 manufacturer, he notes, and Scandinavia has five.\nStevens accentuates the positive.\nAll the successful firms he talked to \"were competitive and they were all majority exporters (and) they have all been through the 'stress test' of parity and beyond with the US dollar\".\nWe just need a lot more of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:38:46.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
