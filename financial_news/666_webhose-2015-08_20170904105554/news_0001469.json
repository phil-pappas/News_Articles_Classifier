Labor MP Tony Burke with his wife Skye Laris on holiday in Tasmania last year. Supplied Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Ex-Labor Speaker Harry Jenkins and former Liberal leader Brendan Nelson have been co-opted by the government to try to restore support for parliamentary expenses and calm the public outrage sparked by Bronwyn Bishop.\nAs the major parties continued to defend each other over ongoing revelations, the government announced that Mr Jenkins and Dr Nelson - now director of the Australian War Memorial - would join the review into entitlements to be led by former Finance Department secretary David Tune and Remuneration Tribunal chief executive John Conde.\nThe fifth member of the panel will be businesswoman and company director Linda Nicholls. The review, which will report back early next year, was announced last week in the wake of Mrs Bishop's resignation.\n\"While successive governments have made changes to strengthen the framework governing parliamentarians' expenditure, events of recent weeks have clearly demonstrated a need to significantly amend the way our system operates,\" said Special Minister of State Michael Ronaldson. \"We need to ensure that the Australian public has confidence in the system that governs this expenditure.\"\nEducation Minister Christopher Pyne says if Liberal colleagues want to give Bronwyn Bishop advice about her future \"they should do it to her face\". Andrew Meares Politicians of all hues are reeling at the ongoing ferocity from the public over the issue which began with Mrs Bishop and cost her the job of Speaker but which has now spread to others.\nShadow finance minister Tony Burke, who led the assault on Mrs Bishop, has been criticised for using the family allowance element of expenses to fly his children business class to Uluru and Cairns during his time as environment minster.\nOn Friday, he was taken to task for flying first-class to Europe in 2009 with several staff including his then chief of staff, now wife.\nAll trips were within the rules and connected to his ministerial duties, although Mr Burke conceded on Thursday that flying his children to Cairns and Uluru in business class was outside of community expectations.\n Prime Minister Tony Abbott and other members of the government have declined to criticise Mr Burke and, on Friday, the Opposition declined to criticise Education Minister Christopher Pyne after it was reported he flew his wife and children business class to Canberra for the opening of Parliament.\nMr Pyne said the actions he and Mr Burke had taken were within the rules and he was backed by frontbencher Anthony Albanese. Mr Pyne said he saw no problem flying his children business class and called on the media to stop taking \"pot shots\" at MPs for doing their jobs.\n\"All these stories about Tony Burke, so far none of them have been in breach of the rules. If the rules are the rules, and people stay within them, you can't then criticise them,\" he said.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten said Mr Burke retained his full confidence. He said Mr Burke's use of travel entitlements was within the rules, while those of Mrs Bishop were \"in a totally different league\".\nMrs Bishop had used a helicopter to fly to a party fundraiser and she attended the weddings of two colleagues and claimed there was official business attached.\nMr Abbott said he hoped the review would make the latest entitlements furore the last.\nSenator Ronaldson said the committee would look at all aspects of the current system and consider the duties that all parliamentarians are required to perform - be they parliamentary, party-related, ministerial or electorate duties.\nHe indicated the system needed to remain flexible enough given the many grey areas that define a politician's duties.\n\"It is also important to ensure the community continues to have ready access to elected representatives,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-07T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:08:16.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
