Steve Craig worked with city officials and other business leaders to organize the event in 2011. Boys and girls from elementary school age to their teens will be involved and Steve sees it was a way to instill civic pride. \nNonprofit organizations are involved as well and Steve donates $100 for each volunteer the organization has in attendance. In 2014, he donated over $100,000. \nThe Fifth Annual Clean Up Commerce Day begins with sunrise at 6 a.m. and runs until 1 p.m. Streets that will get attention this year are portions of: \n· Telegraph Road \n· Corvette Street \nCarrying on the Heritage \nCommerce was incorporated as a city in 1959 by, as the city's web site states, \"a hardy band of residents and business leaders …. These volunteers proclaimed their intention to establish a model city with unique advantages for industry and residents alike.\" \nManufacturing was once the most important sector for the city but the region changed over the decades and many buildings and streets fell into disrepair. Commerce runs along the I-5 and the city's identity has been overshadowed by Los Angeles. \nThe Citadel Outlet Mall is the most visible landmark thanks in part to the wall resembling an Assyrian fortress running parallel to the freeway. Steve Craig's company, Craig Realty Group, took ownership of the mall in 2002 and began to upgrade the property without the use of public funds. \nThe collection of stores is a major employer in the area providing over 2,000 jobs and a significant revenue source for the city. In the recent fiscal year, the Citadel provided about $10 million in sales tax revenue. \n\"That's pretty strong for a city with a budget of $55 million,\" Steve told me during an interview in 2014. \nYouth volunteers are being organized through the city's sports coordinator Frank Garcia via email at Frank@ci.commerce.ca.us . \nDonations from local businesses and adults interested in volunteering should contact Traci Markel, marketing director via email at Traci@citadeloutlets.com .
