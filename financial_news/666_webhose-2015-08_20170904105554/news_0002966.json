He doesn't think the government needs to change its strategy. \"We think the right adjustments are happening,\" he said. \"You're seeing the drop in the exchange rate, interest rates falling when everyone expected them to be rising. \"You're getting the right kind of adjustments that will cushion both the negative effect for the industries under pressure, but also provide a bit of a boost for the rest of the export sector that's going to benefit from a weaker New Zealand dollar.\" Mr English says he doesn't think there's any risk of a recession. But Labour isn't so optimistic, with leader Andrew Little calling the Westpac report a \"pretty grim forecast\". \"There's no question that the reduced dairy payout is having a significant impact already, not only to farmers, but to the communities they're part of,\" he said. \"The lower dollar is having a beneficial impact to manufacturing exporters, although I'm not convinced that's going to fill the hole left by our lower dairy payout.\" Labour's finance spokesman Grant Robertson says the government needs to step in and do something to stimulate the economy. \"We're looking at a significant downturn and if we're not careful we're heading to a recession,\" he said.
