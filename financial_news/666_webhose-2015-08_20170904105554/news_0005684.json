The linear fashion of their feed concedes focus and simply showcases less “noise”, which is refreshing. \nThe majority, especially brands, tend to post images in hopes that their visuals will ignite an immediate emotional reaction to their intended audience thereby provoking them to change the small blank outlined heart to a crimson red with the simple press of their finger. Even better, the ultimate goal is to entice audiences further to engage by typing a comment and/or tag their peers in an @ mention to further the virality. \nWe’re seeing more and more by way of Instagram advertising as well. While audiences say they’d rather the see the purity of Instagram maintained without ads, Instagram promises to home the quality of the user experience to the highest standard. \nThese are all good things in the shift we're seeing in the more transparent and emotional \"ways\" we go about marketing. \nDigital marketing specialists are busier than ever these days, even with a solid social media team in place for a specific brand or agency, their world never stops. The scheduling factor across all social media channels is crucial to not only their time management, but to also meet ideal deadlines, A/B testing, audience targeting, and (depending on the brand) a need to cater to a specific planetary time stamp. Almost every other social media platform has some nifty scheduling mechanism where a post can be scheduled and pushed out live at a specific date and time...making the life of a digital marketer slightly more efficient. And I say slightly, only because there’s still a borage of other details that go into the checks and balances of what their task list consists of! \nWhen it comes to integrated mobile app schedulers for Instagram, we’re almost there. I would say 99% of the way. This isn’t meant to be a dig on the work that’s already been created and is currently available. On the contrary, it’s absolutely a good thing! They’re all simply missing one component, and that is the automated ability within the app to push your post LIVE from your mobile device. \nCurrently, mobile app integration for Instagram post scheduling allows you to create a post with an edited image and content, but instead of offering the scheduling functionality to push it live at a later time, the post is saved until you are sent a pop-up “reminder” that alerts you that it’s “time” to publish your post. \nWhether this final step in the process is neither here nor there, and I honestly don’t think we’ll be waiting much longer for an integrated mobile app that allows for automatic Instagram scheduling. Until then, I’d like to share a few stand-out mobile solutions. Here are my top picks: \nHootsuite This is the latest and greatest! Instagram is now integrated within the Hootsuite platform so you can manage, schedule, and monitor activity. As with other apps, posts can be created and scheduled in advance and published when the time comes with a tap of your finger. For agency marketers with multiple accounts to manage, streams can also be set up to monitor published and scheduled posts, specific hashtags, and locations more directly from their robust dashboard. And if you have multiple team members managing your Instagram (or multiple accounts) you’ll definitely want to upgrade to a Hootsuite Pro and Enterprise account if you haven’t already. Why? This level allows you to share access/approval to other Instagram profiles without having to share passwords. \nLatergramme Similar to Hootsuite, Latergramme is a mobile app that also offers the ease of pre-planning to help you organize and schedule your Instagram posts...but again, it doesn’t post for you. It’ll send you a push notification to open in an app, then you’ll have to manually post. However, this tool stands out because it also allows you to search Instagram for other posts you’d like to repost on your feed and “regram” them. Latergramme offers a desktop, iOS, and Android friendly apps. There are several different account levels from free, to a paid premium version, and even business account which both offer increased capabilities. \nNOTE: There’s only one actual scheduler, that I know of, that will actually push your Instagram posts live and that is ScheduGram … but it can only be managed from a desktop. Which is great, but my focus for this post is on mobile applications with integrated functionality to post to Instagram, so we’ll stick with that for now. But ScheduGram is absolutely worth checking out! \nThis ever-changing digital landscape is warped speed ahead, so I’m confident that an integrated mobile app Instagram scheduler with the ability to automatically push posts live will be available soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:26:31.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
