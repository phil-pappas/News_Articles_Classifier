Canola oil, the world’s leading heart– and health-care edible oil, is fast growing in popularity in India based on 4 salient features: (a) the lowest (7%) content of saturated (bad) fat amongst all edible oils; (b) second-highest (61%) content of mono-unsaturated (good) fat amongst all edible oils; (c) significant (11%) content of omega-3 essential fatty acid (very difficult to find in cooking oils or any vegetarian source); and (d) highest content (211 mg per 100 g) of Vitamin E amongst all edible oils. Consumption in India has shown a rising trend. In 2014-15, imports of crude and refined Canola oil were 3,01,818 MT and 4,312 MT respectively. Canola oil is the No.1 vegetable oil in Canada and Japan and No.2 in Mexico and the United States. Overall, it is the 3rd most consumed vegetable oil in the world. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized a qualified health claim for canola oil's ability to reduce the risk of heart disease as follows: \"Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about one and a half tablespoons (19 grams) of canola oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the unsaturated fat content in canola oil. To achieve this possible benefit, canola oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day.\" To view the document click on the link: Aims n Objects of Canola Council of FIFI For News Release background on Canola Council of India click here Charu Sahu, Dalmia Continental Pvt.
