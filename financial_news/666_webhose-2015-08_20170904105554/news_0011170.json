The NOT SO fresh food people, I got food poisoning from the Blackburn South store. Five days in hospital. Woolworths won’t stand by what they sell. NOT GOOD.”\nIt seems not everyone appreciates the ute owner’s protest. Source: Supplied\nAfter several weeks, fellow customers tired of the protest and responded by leaving a note of their own for the ute’s owner, telling them that “S*it happens”.\nWoolworths’ management declined to comment when contacted by Leader Newspapers. The Leader has also contacted Whitehorse Council to ask if any complaints have been made about the store.\nHave you seen this ute at Woolies in Blackburn South? Do you know its owner?\nOriginally published as ‘The not so fresh food people’ ", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/disgruntled-ute-owner-stages-parking-protest-against-woolworths-blackburn-south/story-fngnvlxu-1227498310271", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=%26%238216%3BThe+not+so+fresh+food+people%26%238217%3B&c=THE+owner+of+this+ute+has+gone+to+a+lot+of+trouble+to+exact+revenge+against+Woolworths+over+an+alleged+food+poisoning+incident.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/not-good-disgruntled-ute-owner-stages-parking-protest-outside-woolworths-in-melbourne/story-fnkgdftz-1227499159165?sv=9bbb9760f2a3cafcdad3306984fba492", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/not-good-disgruntled-ute-owner-stages-parking-protest-outside-woolworths-in-melbourne/story-fnkgdftz-1227499159165?sv=9bbb9760f2a3cafcdad3306984fba492&title=%26%238216%3BThe+not+so+fresh+food+people%26%238217%3B", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/not-good-disgruntled-ute-owner-stages-parking-protest-outside-woolworths-in-melbourne/story-fnkgdftz-1227499159165?sv=9bbb9760f2a3cafcdad3306984fba492&h=%26%238216%3BThe+not+so+fresh+food+people%26%238217%3B", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/not-good-disgruntled-ute-owner-stages-parking-protest-outside-woolworths-in-melbourne/story-fnkgdftz-1227499159165?sv=9bbb9760f2a3cafcdad3306984fba492", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/not-good-disgruntled-ute-owner-stages-parking-protest-outside-woolworths-in-melbourne/story-fnkgdftz-1227499159165?sv=9bbb9760f2a3cafcdad3306984fba492&title=%26%238216%3BThe+not+so+fresh+food+people%26%238217%3B", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/not-good-disgruntled-ute-owner-stages-parking-protest-outside-woolworths-in-melbourne/story-fnkgdftz-1227499159165?sv=9bbb9760f2a3cafcdad3306984fba492"], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:36:27.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
