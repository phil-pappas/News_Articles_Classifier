Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Tony Smith's victory in a four-way race to replace Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker came courtesy of widespread support among the two largest states and the efforts of a new generation of numbers men in the Liberal Party.\nWith no candidate from NSW, the support of that state's 23 Liberal MPs was crucial. Social Services Minister Scott Morrison, who was helping Mr Smith, marshalled the bulk of NSW votes.\nPrime Minster Tony Abbott, from NSW, told colleagues he would be voting for runner-up Russell Broadbent but largely stayed out of the matter, at the behest of his MPs who are fed up with his so-called captain's picks.\nJoe Hockey, from NSW, began backing South Australia's Andrew Southcott but is understood to have switched to Mr Smith over the weekend.\nBackbencher Bronwyn Bishop looks on as Speaker Tony Smith takes the chair. Andrew Meares While Mr Morrison delivered NSW, Victorian ministers Greg Hunt and Josh Frydenberg, along with veteran Kevin Andrews, marshalled support behind Mr Smith in his home state.\nOne source said the contest was not so much about the speakership but a muscle-flexing exercise which exposed the new numerical superiority.\n\"Morrison now has more influence in NSW than Joe. Hockey's influence is declining\" said MP.\nFears from his supporters that his previous close association with former Treasurer Peter Costello may hurt his chances proved unfounded. Mr Costello has been annoying former colleagues lately with his frequently critical newspaper columns.\n Speaker Tony Smith is dragged to the chair by Lucy Wicks and Michael Sukkar. Andrew Meares 'Need not be rude' Upon his election, Mr Smith warned MPs on all sides he intended to lift the standards of Parliament.\nUpon being ratified by a sitting of the House of Representatives, Mr Smith said Parliament \"should be a robust place\" but \"it needn't be rude and it needn't be loud\".\n\"I'll give a fair go to all on the floor of this Chamber but in return I do expect a level discourse that reflects that,\" he said.\nTony Smith with his wife Pam. Matthew Bouwmeester Mr Smith said he would not be attending regular party room meetings.\n\"The Speaker should only be, but should be seen to be, independent of the partisan day-to-day fray.\"\nHis appointment was tense. Mrs Bishop sat at the back of the chamber, her expression unmoving.\nManager of Government Business Christopher Pyne protested her ouster, saying she had been \"felled in the most unfair circumstances\".\nSpeaker welcomed Before the 2013 election, the Coalition promised to maximise the independence of the Speaker by ensuring he or she would not attend party room meetings when Parliament sat.\nMrs Bishop, who was handpicked by Tony Abbott, refused to honour this and attended meetings. Her handling of the Parliament was also considered overtly biased.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten welcomed Mr Smith's decision to stay independent of the party room but also called on him to redress the overt bias Mrs Bishop displayed. During her short period in the chair, she rejected almost 400 Labor MPs and just a handful of Coalition MPs.\n\"You can make this a place where straightforward questions get straightforward answers,\" he said.\n\"The new Speaker has an opportunity and an obligation to lift the accountability of this Parliament.\n\"We cannot afford for Parliament to repeat the hyper-partisanship we saw under Bronwyn Bishop.\"\nMr Smith is the fifth Speaker since November 2011, when Harry Jenkins was forced out to make way for Peter Slipper so the Gillard government could buy a precious extra number in the hung Parliament.\nAfter Mr Slipper's fall from grace concerning allegations over his use of parliamentary expenses and sexual harassment claims, which were later dismissed, Labor's Anna Burke filled the chair.
