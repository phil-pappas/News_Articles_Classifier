Reuters by Greg Earl John Kehoe The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has been packaged in every which way during its short and controversial life: there's the US-built fence around China; the transformational open market extending all the way from Nova Scotia to Penang; and the sell-out of national identity to faceless multinationals.\nBut as 12 ministers bunkered down at the Maui Westin Hotel in Hawaii trying to end five years of negotiations on the proposed trade zone on Friday, it was looking more like a giant game of jenga. If the wrong block of export butter got pulled from the bottom of the pile, the whole edifice would come crashing down.\nCanada was resisting opening up what it politely calls a \"supply management system\" for its protected dairy industry ; Japan was taunting Australia, New Zealand and the United States with a promised new import quota which just left the little question of how to carve it up; and even Mexico was putting its hand up as an unexpected new dairy export power that wanted a share of the action.\nIt's not surprising that Trade Minister Andrew Robb seemed to toss down his blocks in frustration, declaring: \"It's the four biggest players – Mexico, Canada, US and Japan – who are still at sixes and sevens in resolving some of the big issues in the dairy space.\n\"It's important to us and New Zealand and others – but you know, we're not big enough to determine the outcome. It is those four big countries and we need the leadership from Mexico, from the US, from Canada and from Japan, because if all we get is a political fix and not true reform, then it will affect the rest of the agreement.\"\nRobb said that resolving the dairy dispute would have a \"snowball\" effect on the rest of the negotiations. And, indeed, AFR Weekend has confirmed that the US actually withdrew a standing dairy access offer to Australia and NZ, possibly because Canada was not making concessions to the US or to pressure Australia to concede to longer patents for new drugs.\nHopes for a breakthrough waned late in the week as old rows like the dairy industry stand-off overshadowed the decisions needed on important long-term issues like intellectual property rights protection for new medicines and how to create an even playing field for business when so many state-owned companies now operate across the region.\nOld-school struggle Observers forecast some form of in-principle agreement would be struck before the end of the weekend, but have been blindsided by how an intractable old-style struggle over milk trading could stymie a trade deal which President Barack Obama has declared will set the rules of commerce for the 21st century.\nBut the effort to go beyond traditional tariff-cutting on goods to set rules for the future of global commerce in data exchange, intellectual property and the cross-border flow of professional services has produced many contradictions.\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott used a speech on China to reject criticism of once-obscure clauses in some trade agreements that allow foreign companies to take action against governments in offshore arbitration tribunals.\n\"FTA critics have forgotten their history,\" he said. \"After all, we have investor-state dispute settlement provisions in our FTAs with South Korea, Singapore, Chile, Thailand and ASEAN.\"\nAbbott was technically right, but also studiously ignoring the fact that no less a line-up of eminent figures than High Court Chief Justice Robert French, Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris and Reserve Bank of Australia board member Heather Ridout have warned the government to review these clauses because they threaten national sovereignty.\nThen there is the contradiction over what has actually driven the US to seize on a minor trade agreement between NZ, Chile, Singapore and Brunei and turn it into the most complicated trade negotiation the world has seen.\nEconomics may have been the original driving factor behind the sought-after free trade and investment deal to cover 40 per cent of the global economy, but geopolitics is also much at stake.\nObama's much-hyped \"rebalance\" to Asia and a big part of his presidential legacy hinges on a TPP deal.\nThe greater focus on Asia by the Obama administration is officially to plug America in to the fast-growing economic region. But the unofficial objective is widely believed to be counteracting the strategic influence of China, which is growing more aggressive in flexing its security muscle in the region, including in the South China Sea.\nMixed messages These two objectives are not necessarily contradictory, but they have made for some mixed messages in the presentation of the TPP at home and abroad.\n\"If the United States does everything right in Asia, goes to the meetings, participates, but we don't get TPP done, it's very hard to succeed,\" said former US assistant secretary of state for east Asia and Pacific affairs, Kurt Campbell, in a Washington speech last September.\n\"If we make a lot of mistakes but get TPP done, we can still be successful in Asia. That's how important TPP is.\"\nAnother example of the contradictions at the heart of the TPP debate which have set old trading partners at loggerheads and provided anti-trade activists with fertile material for region-wide protests centred on intellectual property rights protection.\nThe US TPP push has been underpinned by pharmaceutical and software companies, which are among the country's most competitive industries, with big potential growth in Asia if they can rein in piracy and the push for generic medicines.\nExtending the life of intellectual property rights may be consistent with the idea that the TPP is paving the way for a new world of commerce involving data flows and creative products, but some economists argue this also curbs potential economic growth – especially in poorer countries – by locking up access to new ideas too long.\nThis conflict between pure commercial property rights and a more open approach to economic development is reflected in one of the most hard-fought battles among trade ministers over the patent period for drugs made from living cells known as biologics.\nHere, the US – driven by the interests of its pharmaceutical companies – wants 12-year patent protection for its drugs. But this has put it on the opposite side of the ledger from its usual close allies in Australia and Japan, who both want a shorter patent time to help keep down healthcare costs.\nRobb, one of the TPP's staunchest advocates , has faced many attacks from activists for risking Australia's public sector-dominated healthcare and pharmaceutical systems in the negotiations. But this week he could almost have been pounding the pavement with the activists declaring \"five years is long enough\" for biologic patent protection.\nBenefits 'over-hyped' It is this sort of complexity and ambition that means the expected final TPP document will run to 29 chapters – and that's before officials have to go back to the negotiating table to argue about how to actually implement agreements to let professionals operate across so many different countries.\n\"Neither the United States nor Australia has done anything as complicated as TPP in terms of content, sheer number of chapters and total number of parties,\" says Michael Smart, a former US trade adviser who is now a vice-president at Washington consulting firm Rock Creek Global Advisors.\nThis sort of complexity has prompted such long-time advocates of free trade as Bill Carmichael, former head of the Industries Assistance Commission, to argue that it would be more productive for Australia to simply introduce these economic liberalisations unilaterally if we really think they are useful.\nThe former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy​, told The Australian Financial Review in an interview this week that he thought a deal would be reached but the benefits had been over-hyped.\nMeanwhile, natural free-trade backers in the business community worry whether the TPP will make business more complicated in the short term by introducing yet another set of rules for determining which products and services qualify for open access.\nAs the Business Council of Australia said in a submission to the government this week: \"Often the cost of changing existing suppliers to comply with an FTA's rules of origin outweighs the benefits of a tariff reduction.\"\nBut those who see the TPP as something much more than a trade agreement argue that the short-term focus on more rules of origins or tariff rates for farm products is missing the point that the world needs a fresh framework for new forms of commerce.\n\"This will be an FTA, but it will also be more than an FTA,\" says Herbert Smith Freehills partner Donald Robertson.\n\"Any participant in most modern international trade is subject to multiple regulatory systems, as they typically add value to a product in four to five countries. So they need to have regulatory coherence across this whole production chain.\"\nHe is confident that when the trade ministers cut a deal, this detailed framework for 21st-century commerce will emerge, because so much planning has been going over the past five years.\nSticking points But back at the coalface of the Maui Westin Hotel, dozens of lobby groups representing diverse interests – from Australian sugar farmers to Vietnamese textile producers – are lobbying, as anti-free trade labour and environmental groups protests outside.\nAll trade policy is ultimately domestic, and Canada's Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper is facing a tight October election and doesn't want to upset the 12,000 local milk producers in rural districts of Quebec and Ontario.\nThat's a potentially big problem, because the US and Mexico are unlikely to open up their agricultural markets to Aussie and Kiwi farmers unless American dairy farmers can sell more dairy and poultry into Canada.\nJapan's protected farming market, including for beef, pork and rice, is another domino in the agriculture stand-off. Australia and New Zealand also want better access to sell dairy to Mexico, which gives the US industry preferential treatment due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nUS trade representative Mike Froman needs to return to Washington with some \"wins\" for US farmers if he is to entertain the idea of granting more access for Australian sugar and dairy to the huge American market.\nThe US's politically sensitive sugar sector has been a constant sore point for Queensland cane farmers, who missed out on better access to the US market in the 2004 free trade agreement signed by John Howard and George W. Bush.\nThe US is again playing hardball on sugar. US sugar growers and lobbyists hold enormous sway over Congress representatives, thanks to large financial contributions and influence over voting in party primary elections that determine who runs for office for Republicans and Democrats.\nTiming critical On dairy, Paul Ryan, an influential Republican congressman, has suggested Canada be kicked out of the TPP if it can't tear down barriers. Ryan's northern state of Wisconsin has a huge dairy constituency which wants to sell its produce over the nearby US-Canada border.\nBut booting out Canada may be off-limits. As well as being a crucial US ally, Canada is an integral partner in supply chains under NAFTA.\nChina is seeking to clinch its own multilateral trade pact in Asia.\nCanada's political timetable is not the only complication. Sealing a deal this weekend is crucial to avoid talks running into the US presidential and congressional election cycle, where anti-free trade rhetoric may ramp up.\nAlready, presumed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has hedged on whether she backs the TPP, despite previously being a strong proponent as the Obama administration's secretary of state, in which capacity she was a linchpin in the pivot to Asia.\nBlue-collar unions are worried that the tearing down of tariffs will see working-class jobs shipped to cheaper labour destinations like Vietnam. Those concerns caused Obama in July to almost be blocked by Congress from winning \"trade promotion authority\" (TPA) to fast-track a deal with the 11 other nations.\nA deal this weekend would give enough time for a trade bill to pass Congress before the end of the year – an objective of the White House and congressional leaders.\nIf such a deal does indeed get signed it would be one of Obama's biggest achievements. It may also re-make the tense geopolitics surrounding the Pacific, with the combined economic power of Japan and US brushing up against that of China.\nAnd depending on what happens to sugar, dairy, pharmaceutical prices and the investor state dispute resolution clauses, it could prove a headwind or a tailwind as Abbott heads to the next election.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/tpp_trade_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T16:04:44.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
