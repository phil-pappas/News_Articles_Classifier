Instead, it said the two brands \"could do something bigger to make a difference\" while saying that the \"friendly business competition\" between the two is not the same as \"the real pain and suffering of war.\" \nBehind the scene in the campaign is some of the financial power of Burger King's part-owner, Berkshire Hathaway (Sao Paolo: BERK34.SA - news ) head Warren Buffett. \nPeace One Day is strongly backed by the charitable foundation of the tycoon's son Howard Buffett, who is a director of Berkshire Hathaway and possible successor to his father as chairman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T18:01:49.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
