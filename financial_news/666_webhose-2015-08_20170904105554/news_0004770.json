At first, I thought the idea is novel and should be a do-able proposition. Later, I realised how foolish the idea was. The article was about an ‘earth-shaking discovery’—that infusing young blood into old/elderly is the treatment for old-age diseases; it also makes the recipient younger morphologically! For a lay-reader, this is very exciting. Who wants to grow old and die? History is replete with such crazy ideas. The elderly have been getting blood of the youth transfused into themselves, in the hope of staying eternally young—and immortal. All of them came to grief, though. There have been attempts at sleeping with young girls to get ‘rejuvenated’. Most, of course, went to their Maker a bit prematurely, some thanks to sexually transmitted diseases. Our memories are fresh about the macabre stories of young children being kidnapped for sacrificing them to supply blood for the rich old people. In January 2014, Wyss-Coray set up Alkahest, a company that aims to separate plasma into its constituent parts and combine them into a potent, rejuvenating cocktail. Wrote Ian Sample, “In Silicon Valley, scientists frequently launch start-up companies on the back of early-stage research—an alignment of the commercial and the scientific that some researchers still frown upon.” Sergio Della Sala, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, warns that it can raise a conflict of interest. “Science should first understand then sell,” he said. “We should always be sceptical when these two factors are reversed.” Unfortunately, that is exactly Western reductionist science is all about! Any scientific discovery that has a business possibility even attracts the attention of the Nobel committee. Real science, or what is called ‘The Reality’, is totally different. The human body cannot be cured or rejuvenated by any one of these reductionist methods. Human body is but the human mind or human consciousness. It can be preserved or rejuvenated by changing the human mind to be altruistic. Pain, even of the severest variety, could be controlled by our own mind helping our forebrain to produce powerful opioids and not by reductionist chemical pain-killers as the layman thinks. Ageing reversal also could be done through our consciousness. Mindful meditation has been scientifically demonstrated to increase the length of the telomeres—the circular bands at the end of chromosomes which keep becoming shorter as age advances. It is believed that this process can reverse ageing. History tells us that if man becomes tranquil and keeps his intellectual powers at the highest level, s/he does not age as fast as those who do not pursue intellectual excellence. Seventeenth century Edinburgh was called the ‘Athens of the North’ with many top intellectuals residing there. Medical history of those times has recorded that some of those people suffered from killer diseases like the plague, smallpox, cholera and typhoid but lived, all the same, into their 90s in good health with their intellects still alert and sharp! Khushwant Singh and Shivaram Karanth are among the few who come to mind immediately; they lived long with clear minds and sharp intellect. Only holistic measures to improve one’s consciousness (mind) will help and not young blood or young girls. The latter idea could be dangerous as it might bring back the macabre scene of children being kidnapped to keep our greedy rich people alive by our greedy middlemen and even doctors! “Liberate the minds of men and ultimately you will liberate the bodies of men.”— Marcus Garvey More in Moneylife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:05:50.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
