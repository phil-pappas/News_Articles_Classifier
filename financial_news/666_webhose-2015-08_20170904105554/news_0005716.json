Luis Ascui by Matthew Stevens Oh dear, Ivan will be disappointed.\nWhether Rio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh likes it or not, Ivan Glasenberg's acquisitive intent is the prism through which most will continue to interpret Rio's financial results. And as the Glencore man still has eyes for a takeover of Rio, there is not a whole lot of opportunistic oxygen to be drawn from Walsh's latest interim result.\nRio's June-half numbers are sturdy, generally slightly better than consensus, and reflective of the safe, mature hands that currently direct the business.\nSure, Rio's numbers are not what they were. Underlying earnings have fallen 43 per cent to $US2.9 billion ($4 billion) on an EBITDA that retreated 30 per cent to $US7.3 billion. But that is what happens when the cycle turns. Rio attributed a staggering $US3.6 billion of its earnings retreat to falling prices across its suite of commodities.\nBut the simple fact that underlying earnings easily outstripped consensus while EBITDA came in shy of forecasts is, I think, indicative of Rio management's sustained and clear-sighted focus on cost containment, productivity improvement and increased capital efficiency.\nMore spectacularly, Rio generated $US4.4 billion in net cash from its business over the half, which is a spare 19 per cent shy of the levels of 2014. This is an important measure of Rio's sustainability. It means, unlike another Collins Street miner, Rio has not needed to borrow to sustain its progressive dividend policy.\nAfter accounting for April's $US2.2 billion worth of final dividend payments and the $US1.2 billion bill for sustaining capital through the first half, Rio is left with $US1 billion \"to invest in growth\".\nMore likely it will be invested in sustaining a dividend that was increased by 12 per cent to $US1.07 cents, in line with Rio's commitment that its interim number will be half the previous year's annual dividend.\n For the past two years Walsh has been able to consistently boast about the quantum of protection Rio management has generated for their business. He was at it again on Thursday evening. Gains through the first half mean that since 2012 Rio has chopped $US5.5 billion from its cost base. But it is clear a lot of the lower-hanging fruit has been grabbed. Savings added $US600 million to June's bottom line and that about 25 per cent of the run-rate of the past two years.\nOf course, the way that Glasenberg sees the commodities world, Rio's Achilles heel is an approach to digging and selling bulk minerals that the South African marketing guru says is inevitably value-destructive.\nThis approach is most evident in iron ore, where prices have slipped by 60 per cent to something likely below long term trend as the pace of Chinese consumption growth has slowed faster than expected while production has continued to grow as a pace baked in through the final years of a now exhausted boom.\nGlasenberg has been brutally critical of the major's plans to send ever more production into a market already in obvious surplus. He reckons it is financial suicide. But Walsh and his peers at the biggest end of iron ore continue to insist that while their planned production increases result in lower average costs, they will be pursued.\nGlasenberg and Andrew Forrest were clearly front of Walsh's mind as he pr√©cised Rio's iron ore performance through the June half. He noted that while iron ore EBITDA has fallen from $US7.7 billion to $US4.0 billion over the half, the group's average margin continued to surf along at better than 60 per cent and that the group had made cumulative savings of better than $US1 billion over the past two years.\nWalsh noted that Rio continued to land iron ore in China more cheaply than any of its competitors and that cash costs in the first half came in at a daunting $US16.20 a tonne despite losing 7 million tonnes of production to cyclones through June. Walsh noted too that, at current exchange rates and energy prices, Rio is digging up iron ore at a spare, sector-leading, $US15 a tonne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:08:02.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
