Photo: Sean Davey\nANZ Bank has been unable to clarify if it will make any losses from the loans it made to Timbercorp investors despite the liquidator to the collapsed forestry scheme operator telling a Senate hearing the bank could end up breaking even.\nThe confusion about whether ANZ will book a loss on its Timbercorp investments came as Bendigo and Adelaide Bank chief executive Mike Hirst told the Senate hearing his bank had no moral obligation to investors who were placed into loans to invest with Great Southern through the bank by rogue financial planners.\nANZ deputy chief executive Graham Hodges told a Senate hearing on Thursday the bank had made no formal provisions against loans it made to Timbercorp investors.\nBendigo and Adelaide Bank chief executive Mike Hirst has defended the handling of investors.

We weren't lending to this company to not get our money back,\" Mr Hodges told the Senate hearing.\n\"It will depend on how effective the liquidator is. If the liquidator said we had a chance of getting our money back, I would read that testimony with great interest.\"\nEarlier, Mark Korda, principal of Timbercorp liquidator KordaMentha, said Timbercorp Ltd creditors, which include ANZ, could receive full repayment of the $250 million guarantee it provided to Timbercorp Finance – the entity that held the loans from investors into the company's managed investment schemes.\nBendigo and Adelaide Bank chief executive Mike Hirst faced questioning at the Senate hearing into collapsed forestry managed investment schemes. Photo: Pat Scala\n\"It doesn't take into account our costs. No one wins out of this,\" Mr Hodges said.\nANZ had also made improvements in the way that it had dealt with investors who were put into the scheme through large loans without their knowledge, according to Senator Sam Dastyari.\nMr Korda told the hearing that one group of investors – the Holt Norman Ashman Baker Action Group – had either had their loans written off or had paid the equivalent of 40¢ in the dollar.\nThe big bank also came out in favour of a last-resort scheme for investors unable to receive the compensation awarded to them by a court for poor financial advice because their financial planner had gone broke or was refusing to pay. This was despite the Australian Bankers' Association this week saying there was no urgent need for such a scheme.\n\"ANZ supports the implementation of a scheme and believes the scheme should be introduced sooner rather than later.\"\nEarlier, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank chief executive Mike Hirst said the bank had no obligation to the clients of a financial planner who put 247 of his clients into Great Southern loans issued by Bendigo Bank.\nLiberal Senator Chris Back told the hearing the planner, Stephen Navra, had worked in the same building as Great Southern and was one of the biggest promoters of the company's managed investment schemes and had provided faulty loan documents to Bendigo and Adelaide Bank despite these concerns\n\"Are you asking if I have responsibility to the clients of [Stephen] Navra? No I don't,\" Mr Hirst said.\nMr Hirst also told the hearing that of the $550 million in loans to Great Southern customers the bank had issued, $400 million had been paid back. The remaining $150 million in unpaid loans also carried $100 million in interest payments, leaving the bank still seeking $250 million from people who borrowed to invest in Great Southern's plantation schemes.\n\"Oh no it's cost us a lot. It's cost us a hell of a lot of time and an enormous amount in legal fees. It's put our insurance fees up.\"\nMr Hirst said the bank was raising capital during that period and the poor press it received had compressed its share price.\n\"I would suggest this has easily cost us $100 million,\" he said.\nBendigo and Adelaide Bank chairman Robert Johanson also defended the bank against criticism it had come out ahead by charging large rates of interest to its clients with Great Southern loans.\n\"This has been a serious event for us. This is not a trivial thing that you can ignore and it is not costless.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:16:51.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
