Franklin and Noam Gottesman to target acquisitions in the food industry , said it will acquire the continental European operations of Findus Group for £500m, adding to its scale as a frozen-food producer. \nThe purchase from investors including Lion Capital and Highbridge Capital comes four months after Nomad swooped in Birdseye fish finger and frozen vegetable owner Iglo Group , for 2.6bn euros (£1.9bn). \nThe Findus business brings leading positions in France, Sweden, Norway and Finland, Nomad said in a statement on Thursday. \n“Having the businesses under one umbrella brings together two talented, world-class teams, enabling us to share best practices and to elevate and evolve the brand,” Nomad’s boss Stefan Descheemaeker said. \nThe combination of Iglo and Findus will create a frozen food giant with products spanning fish fingers, peas and microwavable lasagna. Iglo is the world’s second-largest frozen food manufacturer, with 3.3pc of the market in 2014, according to data from Euromonitor International. \nThe founders of Nomad are known as dealmakers. Mr Franklin built Florida-based Jarden Corp (NYSE: JAH - news ) into a consumer-goods empire valued at about $10.4bn, while Mr Gottesman co-founded hedge fund GLG Partners and sold the firm to Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) in 2010. \nNomad raised $485m from an initial public offering in April 2014 to fund acquisitions in the food and beverage industry. \nAt the time of the Iglo acquisition, Nomad said it would raise about $750m more from a private placement to institutional investors. \nNomad said it will pay £400m in cash for the Findus business, funded through cash in hand and debt. It will also issue 8.4 million shares to the seller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T12:31:17.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
