Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP BP 6.21 % PLC, one of the world’s biggest refiners, warned last month that the company’s “very, very strong” refining profits wouldn’t last. “Actually, we see some of those correcting,” Mr. Dudley told analysts.\nThe International Energy Agency, a Paris-based watchdog for the world’s biggest consuming countries, said in a report earlier this month that “fissures are appearing” in the strong refining environment that has prevailed this year.\nENLARGE And on Friday, Jeffries analysts warned that “signs of weakness have appeared more broadly” for refiners over the past week, citing sharply falling margins in the U.S. and Europe. Average global refining margins contracted 15% last week, they noted.\nAnalysts don’t expect refining profits to crash in the same way oil prices have, at least in the near term. Major oil companies’ downstream businesses will likely continue to perform better than they have done for several years as weak oil prices and rising consumption help bolster their performance. But headwinds are building, especially in Europe.\nStocks of gasoline and diesel are near record highs in northwest Europe, according to the IEA. Meanwhile, European refiners—still suffering from overcapacity in many markets—are now facing new competitors.\nNew Saudi Arabian refineries are now exporting massive volumes of diesel and other fuels to Europe and Asia, raising the possibility of a glut, according to the IEA. And Russia has been exporting more diesel to the continent because of low domestic demand.\nAs recently as April, French oil major Total SA TOT 6.12 % ’s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné said the industry remained in a “crisis” in Europe. The company has plans to cut 20% of its refining capacity by 2017.\nAnalysts expect European refiners to shutter more plants. “If we’re looking out to 2020, I still expect to see some closures in Europe,” said Steve Sawyer, downstream consultant at FACTS Global Energy. “I don’t think the pressure has gone away for European refiners,” he added.\nThe prospect of reduced refining profits portends just how bad life could get for major companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM 3.24 % , Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A 4.95 % PLC and BP as they grapple with another plunge in crude-oil prices. These companies do it all: explore for oil, pump it from the ground, refine it into products like gasoline and then sell it straight to consumers at thousands of filling stations.\nThat model has helped them navigate market crashes in the past. When crude prices are high, their production divisions, or so-called upstream business, bring in cash. When crude prices are low, their downstream divisions—refineries and retail—often benefit from the cheap raw material, helping to cushion the upstream blow.\nAny dent to refinery earnings would come at the same time that oil prices are plunging below $40 a barrel in the U.S. and $45 a barrel for the global benchmark, Brent. That promises even more pain for oil companies’ already hard-hit upstream divisions.\nEarnings at Shell’s downstream business increased by nearly twentyfold in the first six months of 2014. Discounting interest and tax, BP’s profits in the sector also soared to more than twice their level for the same period. Even with those impressive numbers, Shell’s profits were down by 16%, and BP recorded a loss of more than $4 billion.\nExxon, BP and Shell declined to comment.\n“What’s helping the oil companies currently is the refining environment,” said Roberto Cominotto, investment manager at Swiss investor GAM. “I don’t think that’s sustainable.”\n—Alison Sider in Houston contributed to this article.\nWrite to Sarah Kent at sarah.kent@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/EM-BG213_REFINE_16U_20150828064511.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-28T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T13:59:28.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
