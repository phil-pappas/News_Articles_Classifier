Congratulations @isro for the successful launch of GSAT-6″ he tweeted.\nReferring to previous GSLV-D5 developmental flight with the indigenous cryogenic stage, Umamaheswaran said, “The onus was on us to maintain the standard set by the previous launch. This mission has achieved equally well orbit.”\n“On February 5, the naughty boy was tamed… now it has been transformed into the most adored boy of ISRO and that has been made possible by the awesome and fantastic team effort of all of you team ISRO,” he said.\nGSAT-6 is the 25th geostationary communication satellite built by ISRO and the 12th in the GSAT series. The satellite is equipped with five spot beams in S-band and a national beam in C-band for strategic users.\nThe “cuboid” shaped satellite has a lift-off mass of 2,117 kg. The propellants weigh 1,132 kg and the dry mass of the satellite is 985 kg.\nISRO said one of the advanced features of the communication satellite is its S-Band Unfurlable Antenna of six metre diameter, which is the largest satellite antenna realised by it.\nThe antenna is utilised for five spot beams over the Indian mainland and they exploit the frequency reuse scheme to increase frequency spectrum utilisation efficiency.\nAfter the injection of the satellite in the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit by GSLV-D6, ISRO’s Master Control Facility has taken control of GSAT-6.\nIt would perform the initial orbit raising manoeuvres by repeatedly firing the Liquid Apogee Motor on-board the satellite before finally placing it in the circular Geostationary Orbit.\nThe deployment of antenna and three axis stabilisation of the satellite would also be performed in the days to come.\nThe mission life of the satellite is nine years.\n 27, 2015 8:01 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:35:11.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
