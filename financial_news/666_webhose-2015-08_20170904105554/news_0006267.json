Julianne Hough, a judge and former dancer on the show, is also returning. \nBut how much does a DWTS pro dance get paid? Here’s a look at what the pros of “Dancing With the Stars” are worth and how much they earn on the show. “Dancing With the Stars” Pro Dancers Get Paid $5,000 a Week \nCelebrities who appear on “Dancing With the Stars” sometimes make astronomical amounts off the show, but their salaries for a season start at $125,000 and rise the longer they stay in the competition, according to entertainment news site Wet Paint. But are the pros paid as well? \nKarina Smirnoff confirmed with the New York Post in 2013 that the pros are paid weekly; the longer they last in the competition, the more they make. According to another report from 2009, salaries were around $5,000 a week, reports Wet Paint. But the pro dancers’ salaries have probably increased even more for DWTS Season 21. Karina Smirnoff Net Worth: $3 Million \nKarina Smirnoff took Season 20 off to promote her book “We’re Just Not That Into You” and appear in an indie film, reports Entertainment Weekly . “I was a little nervous about not dancing on the show at all last season,” Smirnoff said of her season off. “I was doing it for the last 10 years.” \nMost people would probably be nervous to step away from a lucrative job that had made them a multi-millionaire by the age of 37, which is what DWTS has done for Smirnoff. CelebrityNetWorth puts Karina Smirnoff’s net worth at $3 million. Julianne Hough Net Worth: $7 Million \nJulianne Hough has a reason to celebrate heading into Season 21 of “Dancing With the Stars,” as she just announced her new engagement to pro hockey player Brooks Laich. Hough’s bank account also gives her plenty of reasons to be happy, as it’s grown fat through her years as the standout on “Dancing With the Stars.” \nOriginally a pro dancer on DWTS, Hough switched to sit at the judges’ table in 2014 and will appear as a judge in Season 21. Her success on the show has also led to other endeavors, from singing in a pop album to starring in several films. Julianne Hough’s net worth is estimated at $7 million. Derek Hough Net Worth: $4 Million \nDerek Hough, brother to Julianne and a fellow pro dancer on “Dancing With the Stars,” is returning for Season 21. In addition to his dance career, Hough has also made some moves to branch out into acting, with his most recent work including a guest role on the TV show “Nashville.” Derek Hough’s net worth is $4 million. \nRead: 5 Celebs Who Could Have Used a ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Paycheck Witney Carson Net Worth: $300,000 \nWitney Carson first appeared on “So You Think You Can Dance,” where she wowed audiences but was ultimately eliminated.
