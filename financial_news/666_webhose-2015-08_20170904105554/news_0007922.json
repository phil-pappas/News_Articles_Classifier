AP China's stocks have slumped, extending Tuesday's plunge, amid growing concern the government will pare back support for the equity market and a weaker yuan will spur capital outflows.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index dropped 3.1 per cent to 3631.40 at the noon-time break, set to close below its 200-day moving average for the first time in a year. Eight stocks declined for each that rose on the gauge, which sank 6.2 per cent on Tuesday. PetroChina Co, long considered a favourite holding of state-linked rescue funds, tumbled 5.1 per cent.\nStocks have tumbled this week after the securities regulator said late Friday that China Securities Finance Corp., the state agency tasked with supporting share prices, will reduce buying as volatility falls. China's richest traders are cashing out of stocks, while a record drop in yuan positions at the central bank and financial institutions last month signalled investors are moving money out of the country.\n\"There's a big worry about how persistently the government could support the market,\" said Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital International in Hong Kong. \"The yuan's depreciation is causing a wave of selling, creating instability in the market as capital outflows become a reality.\"\nThe Shanghai Composite rebounded 14 per cent from its July 8 low through Monday after the government took unprecedented measures to end a $US4 trillion rout. The yuan tumbled by the most in 21 years last week after an unexpected devaluation by the central bank.\nThe yuan dropped 0.08 per cent to 6.3992 a US dollar in Shanghai on Wednesday, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.5 per cent to a nine-month low.\nVolatility in Chinese markets has reverberated around the world over the past two months as slowing growth complicates efforts by the ruling Communist Party to loosen its grip on the financial system and shift to a more consumer-driven economy.\nAs the state stepped in to shore up equities, China's wealthiest investors have been the quickest to sell. The number of traders with more than 10 million yuan ($US1.6 million) of shares in their accounts shrank by 28 per cent in July, even as those with less than 100,000 yuan rose by 8 per cent, according to data compiled by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corp.\n Margin traders cut holdings of shares purchased with borrowed money for the first time in eight days on Tuesday.\n\"We cannot see that the Chinese government is doing anything to stabilise the market right now,\" said Castor Pang, head of research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi Hong Kong. \"If the drop is too much they may come back and try to stabilise the market. But we don't know what level they will come back and that's why quite a lot of investors continue to sell.\"\nEnergy and industrial companies led declines on the CSI 300 Index, which slid 2.2 per cent. PetroChina, the nation's biggest oil company, headed for its biggest loss this month, while China Coal Energy Co. tumbled 6.6 per cent. China Shipbuilding Industry Co. sank 6.7 per cent.\nHithink Flush Information Network Co. dropped 8.5 per cent, heading for the lowest close since April 3. The company said it's under investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission for suspected law and rule violations.\nChinese equity valuations are still among the most expensive in the world. The median stock on mainland bourses traded at 72 times reported earnings on Monday, higher than any of the 10 largest markets. It was 68 at the peak of China's equity bubble in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Shanghai Composite has dropped 30 per cent from its June 12 peak, after a 152 per cent surge in the previous 12 months.\n\"It's still over-priced and would be vastly lower if it wasn't for ineffectual government intervention that is merely delaying the inevitable,\" said Michael Every, head of financial markets research at Rabobank Group in Hong Kong. \"The basic issue is that PE ratios are crazy in too many places.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:09:50.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
