Getty Images Share on twitter by James Chessell Rebekah Brooks will return to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media and entertainment empire as chief executive of its UK operations just over a year after being cleared of all charges related to the phone hacking scandal.\nAccording to a report in the Financial Times , Ms Brooks could return to the job she quit four years ago during the height of the scandal as soon as next month as part of a broader reshuffle of News Corp's UK executive ranks.\nHer return would mark a remarkable turnaround for one of Mr Murdoch's favourite executives. It also comes amid reports the British Crown Prosecution Service is considering bringing corporate charges against News UK over the hacking scandal.\nAlthough Ms Brooks walked free in June last year from a marathon trial into widespread phone hacking at News Corp's now-defunct Sunday Tabloid, News of the World , she was embarrassed by the case.\nFront page of Murdoch's Sun tabloid after the newspaper's former editor, Rebekah Brooks, was cleared of all phone hacking charges. The Sun Mrs Brooks was editor of News of the World from 2000 to 2003 when the phones of celebrities, politicians and crime victims were hacked by some journalists at the tabloid. Mrs Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks were charged in May last year with hiding evidence from the police. She denied all charges and was cleared after the eight-month trial.\nThe court heard a series of emails that revealed an extra-marrital affair with former News Corp editor Andy Coulson - who was found guilty of conspiring to ­intercept phone messages - and exposed the lengths to which senior UK politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron and former PM Tony Blair would go to cosy up to Murdoch editors.\nNevertheless, Ms Brooks always seemed likely to return to News Corp.\nAt one point during the height of the scandal, Mr Murdoch took a walk with Mrs Brooks shortly after closing the News of the World in July 2011. Asked what his \"top priority\" was, Mr Murdoch pointed to Mrs Brooks and said \"this one\".\n Ms Brooks and her husband stayed with Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan when she visited Australia in March 2013.\nIt had been reported Ms Brooks would rejoin the Murdoch empire by running its social media agency Storyful. However, the FT reports it was Mr Murdoch who convinced her to take on the top UK job. ​", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/28/phone-hacking-cps-may-bring-corporate-charges-rupert-murdoch-publisher", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e9fe5216-4d9d-11e5-9b5d-89a026fda5c9.html#axzz3k7WQFuPV", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/01/rebekah-brooks-rehired-rupert-murdoch-work-us-news-corp"], "published": "2015-08-29T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:04:27.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
