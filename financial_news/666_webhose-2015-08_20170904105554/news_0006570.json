But most of us do not put these safeguards in place.\nIt only takes a little bit of preventive medicine to make sure your laptop or desktop computer can be restored if something happens to it. Here is what you need to know:\nBACKUP DRIVES\nWhile the cloud is great for backing up data, Smith recommends a hard drive backup that you keep in your house - maybe even more than one, in case something happens to the first one. This will not only restore your data, but also your software programs and any other preferences, like web browsing bookmarks.\nAll it takes to get a backup going is to plug in a drive. On a recent-issue Apple Inc machine, the computer will automatically ask if you want to run Time Machine. Depending on your Windows machine, you may need to identify your pre-installed backup application and start it.\nGo with the automatic set-up. \"Backing up manually is a pain, and you'll miss files,\" Smith says. \"It's good to find a solution that's seamless. Then you don't have to remember to do something every week.\"\nBasic 1-terabyte models start around $60. A 2-TB drive runs about $100, but drives can often be found with significant discounts. You do not need a specific Mac or Windows drive, as most are compatible, just something sturdy and handy that you will actually use.\nAs for cost-savings, you might be able to avoid hiring somebody like computer consultant Laurie Duncan, owner of Mac Samurai in New York, to painstakingly rebuild your system. And you are also protected if any of the cloud services you are using goes out of business or changes hands and terms of service.\n\"You should have a copy of your own data somewhere,\" Duncan advises.\nCLOUD STORAGE\nMost cloud storage services offer a certain amount of storage for free, and you can mix and match according to your needs. If you need additional storage, you can purchase monthly plans. Apple's iCloud is free for 5GB, 99 cents per month for 20 GB and 3.99 per month for 200 GB. With Google Drive, the first 15 GB are free, and it is $1.99 per month for 100 GB. Dropbox is free for 2GB and $9.99 per month for 1 TB.\nDuncan is a big fan of Dropbox, because it is cross-platform and easy to use. She also likes Google cloud services, but for document access on the go, not for storage.\nLouis Ramirez, senior editor at DealNews.com, which aggregates retail bargains, finds iCloud to be seamless if you are an Apple device user. If you are on Android, he recommends Google Drive instead.

Smith says several services, like Backblaze and CrashPlan ( www.code42.com/crashplan/ ), both for $5 a month for one computer, will backup your whole computer remotely.\nSmith also says there are some router/drive combos that can create a wireless backup. You can also find some routers with a USB part that will connect to a hard drive. \"Once it's set up, it will go on its own,\" he says.\n(Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": ["http://www.code42.com/crashplan/", "http://dealnews.com/c56/Computers/Storage/Hard-Drives/"], "published": "2015-08-19T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T23:13:54.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
