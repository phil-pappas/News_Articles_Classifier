Previously, opening more than 600 new contracts met that designation, Zhang said. The CSRC has transferred 22 cases to the public security ministry, he said.\nThe nation’s margin requirements on stock-index futures currently stand at 20 percent, after being increased twice this week, according to the website of China’s Financial Futures Exchange.\nThe increase is the latest effort by the government to crack down on suspected market manipulation after a recent equities rout wiped out $5 trillion. Last week, the securities regulator said it will penalize major shareholders at publicly traded companies for violating rules that limit stake sales.\n“In the short term, a higher margin ratio can limit speculation,” said Ken Chen, analyst at KGI Securities Co. in Shanghai. “That can hardly reverse a long-term downtrend caused by the bursting of a valuation bubble. Some investors with hedging needs may find the 30 percent ratio a high cost and may have to quit the market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T14:11:10.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
