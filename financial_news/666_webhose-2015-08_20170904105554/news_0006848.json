Photo: Ryan Stuart\nEvolution Mining, one of the gold sector's most acquisitive players, has revealed its intention to trump a Chinese suitor in the tussle for control of a coveted gold explorer, as merger and acquisition activity in the gold space heats up.\nEvolution is the largest shareholder of explorer Phoenix Gold with 19.8 per cent and said on Thursday it will offer Phoenix shareholders 0.06 of an Evolution share and 6¢ cash for each share they hold. The offer would be conditional on the completion of Evolution's recent acquisition of La Mancha's Australian assets, among other things.\nEvolution's offer trumps a 10¢ a share cash bid from China's Zijin Mining and values Phoenix at about $56.4 million, higher than its current market capitalisation of around $49 million.\nZijin holds about 8.9 per cent of Phoenix but through a pre-bid agreement with Phoenix shareholder Geologic Resource Partners has a relevant interest of about 17.9 per cent.\nAdvertisement Phoenix has attracted the attention of both suitors due to its strategic landholding adjacent to the La Mancha operations and nearby the Paddington mill Zijin picked up in its recent takeover of Norton Gold Fields.\nPhoenix has advised shareholders to take no action on either offer at this stage.\nEvolution managing director Jake Klein told Fairfax Media he thought Evolution's potential offer for Phoenix gave the explorer's shareholders the best opportunity of realising value from the company's ground.\n\"Hornets nest\" Morgans analyst James Wilson said Evolution's move on Phoenix aimed to secure \"one of the last key strategic assets\" in the region but was likely to \"stir the hornets nest in a big way\" because both bidders saw significant value in the landholding.\nA spokesman for Zijin declined to comment on the company's reaction to the Evolution offer.\nMeanwhile, Saracen Minerals picked up St Barbara's King of the Hills mine and Kailis resource for $3 million. Both assets are located less than 80 kilometres from Saracen's Thunderbox project, which it expects to have in production mid-2016.\nSaracen Minerals managing director Raleigh Finlayson said the acquisition was a great bolt-on opportunity close to its infrastructure, with the potential opportunities at Kailis particularly attractive.\nMorgan's Mr Wilson said the deal was \"a prudent low cost value accretive acquisition but our preference right now is for the more aggressive players like Evolution and Northern Star Resources that have gone for big value accretive deals\".\nMr Finlayson said Saracen was content looking at smaller opportunities around its operations but wouldn't rule out bigger deals once Thunderbox was up and running.\n\"We have seen Northern Star Resources and Evolution ahead of us striking deals over the last few years but chasing slightly bigger prey and for us, recognising our size and where we are at in the cycle, we have a big development and our focus is primarily on getting Thunderbox going so this is by no means a distraction and who knows, the next step may well by larger.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:31:30.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
