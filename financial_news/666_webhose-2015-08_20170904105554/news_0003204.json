For Gen Z, a higher salary is the biggest draw. Getting a job and holding on to it is no longer a matter of pride; job hopping is no longer considered frivolous but as an opportunity to learn and climb the corporate ladder faster. Often, employees do not seem to think that an opportunity similar to the one they are seeking outside can exist in the company they are currently employed with. To avoid this, firms should encourage employees to be more open about their professional aspirations. Even in the digital age, there needs to be more focus on increased face time, which would make everything else fall in place as the employees will be well-informed.\nHere are a few perks you can miss out on when you plan to quit your current job for another opportunity:\nTRAINING SESSIONS AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES\nBefore you make a switch, you need to think if the new company offers you training that is more like spoon feeding aimed at only skilling you enough to go by a checklist or does it have a learning centric environment that allows you to grow as a professional and add life skills that can transferred in any type of setting.\nCOMPANY CULTURE\nTake a moment to think whether you feel disconnected to the company's culture. If you feel engaged in the work that you do and the space you are in and think highly of your peer group, do you really want to move? Given how much time you spend with your peers, good relationships at the workplace can boost your morale. Once you are in a comfortable zone with your peers, you are definitely more productive.\nChanging to adapt to a culture and engage with a new workforce that you don't feel at ease with could lead to a difficult transition. Shift gears only if you are ready.\nINFRASTRUCTURE AND OFFICE SPACE\nThis may seem trivial but note how it makes a difference to your day-to-day work and productivity. A healthy workspace layout and well ness initiatives offered on the job will keep you fit and productive for the long-term.\nDOES YOUR COMPANY TRUST YOU?\nThink about the level of empowerment you have at your level. Do you feel confident in your independence to get things done and do you feel trusted by your seniors and team mates? An organisation that enables you to step up and interact with the leaders is an indication of the trust it places in you: How valuable are you to the company and does it appreciate and recognise that? Think over it before you take a leap.\nMEASURING PERFORMANCE\nPay attention to the performance management system of the organisation. Most follow a model that is based on the principle of forced rankings.\nThis means your success will depend on how good or bad your peers on the project are. Firms that have performance review processes that are anchored in ongoing feedback and truly measure your impact and potential through a competency model are a better way of gauging your growth.\nThe competency model of your firm must allow for your growth through learning opportunities.\nBy Abhijit Nimgaonkar\nFor more stories, follow us on Twitter and Facebook\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Work,Switch,Quit,Opportunity,Job ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOIRelationship", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIRelationships"], "published": "2015-08-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:26:01.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
