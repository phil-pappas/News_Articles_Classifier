Photo: Aurora Images\nObstacles may be the key to running these races. But there seem to be no barriers to turning them into successful enterprises.\nMud Run. Tough Mudder. True Grit. Spartan Race. Operation BlackHawk. Mud Gladiators. The Stampede. Novel running challenges are springing up on the Australian landscape.\nThere is a strong trend towards obstacle running, fitness guru Cato Rutherford says. \"So much so that there are professional obstacle racers who follow a world circuit year round,\" he says.\nA True Grit competitor shows how it's done. Photo: Supplied\n\"As the health and fitness industry grows, so does the many businesses offering services for the average punter to compete, set a goal and train for an event.\"\nAdvertisement Adam McNamee, co-founder and managing director of True Grit, says there has been a massive increase in obstacle racing in Australia. \"I think it's only growing.\"\nIn 2012 McNamee, who was previously with the military within the Australian Special Operations, and his business partner formulated the plan to start the business of True Grit. Their first event was staged in April 2013 in South Australia.\n\"We saw an opportunity in the market which was dominated by Tough Mudder at the time,\" says McNamee.\n\"There were a couple of other events running. We went to have a look at those events and immediately thought that we could put on more successful and better events for participants.\"\nAnother business Maximum Adventure stages the Mud Run, the Tough Bloke Challenge and the Tough Chick Challenge.\n\"I set up the business in 2002 basically because there were no other event organisers doing adventure races in Australia at the time,\" says owner Gary Farebrother.\nHe says he saw an opportunity in the market to provide adventure racing events on the back of programs such as the Eco-Challenge and the Southern Traverse in New Zealand that were popular. \"And that's where we started our business,\" he says.\nAware of the fact that the market can be quite fickle, he says he didn't want to have all his eggs in one basket and decided to diversify the business.\nMaximum Adventure staged biking events and then launched an Urban Series of events.\n\"Then we also launched the Tough Bloke Challenge because we saw an opportunity in the market for that style of event. And lastly we launched the Mud Run off the back of that as well.\"\nTrue Grit's business revenue comes from purchase at the registrations, McNamee says. It operates around Australia. At the moment it has the two models - True Grit, the daytime obstacle course, is 10-plus kilometres and has 30-plus obstacles; Night Attack is five kilometres and has 17-plus obstacles.\nLast year True Grit ran five events, and this calendar year it is increasing it to eight.\n\"Our events run between 2500 to 5000 people depending on the location. Our pricing structure is on a sliding scale. The earlier people register the cheaper they pay,\" says McNamee. He says it costs almost up to $300,000 to stage each event. He says they also apply a percentage of the profits to two charities, Legacy and the Commando Welfare Trust.\nMcNamee says South Australia is True Grit's biggest market at the moment, while Sydney is its smallest market. He says their two key marketing points are social media, mainly Facebook, and radio.\nFarebrother says a lot of Maximum Adventure's marketing is done through the website and via social media. \"We're doing very little print advertising. We find that less effective. It's very hard to tell how effective the print advertising is. Whereas online, you get immediate feedback.\"\nThe Mud Run is an entry-level event and is designed to be fun and friendly, says Farebrother. \"It's a seven-kilometre course and 30-plus obstacles and it's not supposed to be gruelling, it's supposed to be fun.\n\"The Tough Bloke Challenge is the next step where the obstacles become more challenging and it's a timed event. So it appeals to those with a competitor nature.\"\nMcNamee says True Grit presents boutique events run in unique properties. \"Our South Australian event is held at Caudo Vineyard, and roughly half of the property is a vineyard, a quarter is sand dunes and desert, and a quarter is woodlands. And there is also about two kilometres of the Murray River.\"\nBut is the market now saturated with too many operators?\nRutherford, who runs his own gym Lift Performance Centre in Sydney, doesn't think so. \"The cream rises to the top. If you are very good, and have something genuine to offer, you will cut through the crowd.\"\nThe opportunities for entrepreneurs in this space, Rutherford says, are endless, and restricted only by one's imagination.\n\"It is important to remember however, the entrepreneurs must have a firm knowledge to support their product. People who enter the fitness industry with no education or experience get spat out very quickly.\"\nMcNamee says it is tough to run obstacle races. \"I think you're in an industry where you're only as good as your last event. And certainly a lot of companies have found that out on social media after an event.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T09:52:18.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
