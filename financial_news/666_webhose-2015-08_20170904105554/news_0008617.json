Nokia said it will get net proceeds on the sale of slightly more than 2.5 billion euros.\nWhile there has previously been limited cooperation on auto parts, a joint acquisition on this scale involving BMW, Volkswagen AG’s Audi division and Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler would be unprecedented. The deal underscores the German competitors’ push for self-driving systems independent of technology giants such as Google Inc. , which is looking at entering the auto industry.\nNokia is selling HERE, which supplies map data for about 80 percent of cars with in-dash navigation systems in North America and Europe, to focus on making mobile-phone network equipment. The price compares with the $8.1 billion that Espoo, Finland-based Nokia paid in 2008 for map provider Navteq Corp., one of the businesses that it combined to create HERE.\nSupplying HERE’s technology to other carmakers would also enable the German partners to tap into a market for automotive data and connectivity that consulting company McKinsey & Co. estimates could surge sixfold from current levels to 180 billion euros by 2020.\nIn addition to Baidu, earlier suitors for HERE included London-based private-equity firm Apax Partners in cooperation with U.S. online car-booking provider Uber Technologies Inc.; a group comprising China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., NavInfo Co. and Swedish buyout firm EQT Partners AB; U.S. private-equity firms Hellman & Friedman, Silver Lake Management and Thoma Bravo; and Microsoft Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.\nNokia agreed in April to buy French competitor Alcatel-Lucent SA to create the world’s largest supplier of mobile-network equipment. That deal received U.S. antitrust clearance in mid-June.", "external_links": ["http://company.nokia.com/sites/default/files/download/nokia_uk_ar14_here.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-08-03T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T08:34:17.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
