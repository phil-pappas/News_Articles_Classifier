Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Philip Baker For investors wondering what to do with any money they might have in a term deposit, or who will receive in dividends over the next few months, the most important question to answer from the Reserve Bank's latest decision is what it all means for the Australian dollar .\nInvesting in offshore sharemarkets for better growth opportunities, or local companies that get a fair chunk of their earnings in the United States, has been a winning strategy over the past few years.\nAnd a falling Australian dollar against the greenback, down from US93¢ a year ago to US73.50¢ on Tuesday, has been a driving force behind it.\nBut if the RBA's decision on Tuesday, to leave interest rates on hold at 2 per cent for a third straight month does signal the end of any further rate cuts as some economists think, it might just mean the central bank has called the low in the $A.\nFor now it looks like the bank is comfortable with where the currency is and there will be no more jaw boning from them.\nInvestors might have to wait for Friday's Statement on Monetary Policy for further insights and the fine detail but Annette Beacher from TD Securities has told clients they now have the green light to buy the $A against other commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar.\nShe thinks it makes sense the central bank is comfortable with the $A at a level that is still well below its post-float average of US76.4¢.\nAnd as for those calls that it could fall to US65¢, Beacher points out that sort of level is \"associated with recession and financial market dislocation, and we are nowhere near either just now\".\n Beacher was surprised, however, that the bank didn't give a few hints about any updated growth and inflation projections in the accompanying statement that many were looking for, while $A traders certainly took the view there will be no more rate cuts.\nInvestors will be able to compare the upbeat tone of the RBA with Thursday's employment report, that is now shaping up to be a very interesting report, but also the outlook statements from the chief executives of major companies as the reporting season rolls on.\nPrognosis alignment assessment If the economy is in good shape those statements will be closely gauged to see whether their prognosis is aligned with the market's new perception of better times ahead.\nBut if the RBA are done with rate cuts does it mean the Australian dollar can't keep falling?\nFinancial markets being what they are will now doubt play around with the idea of a rate hike sooner than later, but investors also need to remember the role of the US Federal Reserve in all of this.\nIndeed, in its statement the bank made a point of noting once again that it thinks the Federal Reserve will start raising rates later this year.\nThe reason is simple.\nThat move alone will help keep a lid on any rally in the $A that might start to flow as a result of traders believing that the RBA is no longer calling for a lower $A.\nFor that reason the Fed's meeting in September, and any chance of a rate rise then, will be a major focus for investors.\nIn addition, investors should also remember there are still a few reasons why the RBA might have to cut again.\nAccording to AMP Capital's Shane Oliver, the business investment outlook is still very poor, commodity prices are falling, the housing market – a significant contributor to growth – might slow as banks raise rates for property investors, while the de facto monetary policy tightening that is a result of those higher bank mortgage rates is another reason why the bank could still cut the official cash rate.\nIf that's the case stocks like Ramsay Health Care, packaging group Amcor, Cochlear, Incitec Pivot, insurer QBE, Orica and share registry business Computershare will still be sought after.\nAlong with ETFs like the Vanguard US share index that trades on the ASX under the code VTS and has tripled in value since the middle of 2011.\nThe top 10 holdings include exposure to Apple, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, Google, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase , Berkshire Hathaway and Procter & Gamble.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-04T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:40:34.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
