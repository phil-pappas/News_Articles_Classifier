And very obviously the fear of something big approaching is not confined to those on the fringes because mainstream investors are now losing confidence on an almost unprecedented level.\nRight now it is big news that the stock market just took one of its biggest tumbles in recent history while oil prices plummeted back down to historical lows touching below 40 per barrel. CNBC reports:\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 400 points as nearly all blue chips declined. In the last five years the index has only had four instances with closing losses of more than 400 points.\nOil reversed Thursday’s late gains to briefly fall below 40 a barrel to 39.86 for the first time since March 2009\n“Right now there is a feeling of fear in the marketplace and all news is interpreted negatively and it’s interpreted indiscriminately” said Tom Digenan head of U.S. equities as UBS Global Asset Management.\n“I think uncertainty about China (and) general negativity is weighing on the market.\n[David Kelly chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds] There’s a lack of positive economic news to motivate buyers” said David Kelly chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.\nFor a while now numerous economists have been warning that the system is headed for a collapse but that message has been tuned out of the mainstream feed. But not anymore.\nChina’s economic troubles now dragging down its manufacturing sector carry a major risk of spilling over into western markets and the Federal Reserve has all but admitted that it is has run out of ammo to artificially prop up the U.S. market.\nQE3 has failed and the negative effects of a zero interest rate are reaching a tipping point.
