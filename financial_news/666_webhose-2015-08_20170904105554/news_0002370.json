Two weeks on and one week off is considered the most family-friendly arrangement. However, more FIFOs are being forced to work four weeks on and one week off as the mining downturn starts to bite.\n“Two in ones are going to three in ones and some have gone to four in ones. That’s what we are hearing,\" Mr Midwood said.\n“They are having less time back home and more time at work.”\nAtlas Iron’s Mount Webber site in Western Australia. Source: Supplied\nIt is this rostering system, coupled with other social factors associated with the FIFO life, that the authors of a report into a spate of nine suicides among FIFO workers during a 12-month period in WA believe needs to change.\nIn June, a WA parliamentary committee that examined the deaths found that while it couldn’t confirm the nine suicides were directly linked to FIFO work, they did conclude the lifestyle increased a person’s risk of mental health issues.\nThey recommended that a new code of practice on FIFO work arrangements be introduced to address rosters and the impact of fatigue on mental health\nWA has one of the largest FIFO workforces in Australia. Despite the mass redundancies, it has been estimated there are still about 60,000 people who continue to fly in and fly out for work.\nMrs Midwood said those who have managed to keep their jobs or found new ones felt pressured into accepting what was on offer or learn new skills in order to keep their job.\n“There is a lot of insecurities and anxieties about ‘when am I going to be made redundant’,” she explained. “If there is a position to go for, there’s a lot of pressure on site to upskill. It’s sort of like an uneven playing field now.\n“I have a female client who has been told, ‘If you don’t like it, leave’.”\nRio Tinto Group workers from the West Angelas iron ore mine prepare to fly out.

It’s a bit like a snake: They have swallowed all this problem and it takes a long time for it to work through the snake,” he said. “Because people were beginning to be laid off prior to Christmas, we were only receiving people slowly in dribs and drabs. It does take a while for people to use up the savings they had or to become, it’s sad to say, desperate enough to seek help.\n“It’s that initial shock. It takes a little while for people to get over. And then it’s the shame and pride and all those other emotional type of things that force people to come and seek help.\n“A lot of guys come back depressed. They used to be the big chief and suddenly they end up having to do the dishes.”\nMr Brown said recent increases in utility prices and other cost of living items was adding further pressure on FIFO families who are struggling to cope with high mortgages.\n“One of the other things that has happened is the bankruptcy rate in WA has gone up. It is one of two regions that have increased. They have actually gone down in other states,” Mr Brown said.
