You can’t just make a change and be done with it. Making sure those process changes stick after they’re implemented is key. \nBy nature, people resist change . Even if that change is good for them and makes their job easier. We get stuck in doing things the same old comfortable way day in and day out. \nSo you have your work cut out for you when you’re identifying and implementing process change in your business. It goes without saying that you must have a good communication process and involve as many key stakeholders as possible during the stages of your change, but you can’t just walk away once it’s been implemented in your company. \nAfter all, way too many times things look great on paper but don’t actually work as prescribed once real human beings are involved. Recommended for You \nHere are 3 steps you can take after your new process has been implemented to make sure the change lasts. \nStep 1: Make Sure Team Members Understand What’s In It For Them \nBusiness moves so fast these days it sometimes seems as though change is made for change sake. The people who are affected by the process change need to be acutely aware of why this is impacting them in their day-to-day activities. Walk in their shoes, watch and listen for the things that are most important to them. Point out where the process changes will make it better. If you can help them own the new way of doing things, you’ll have a better chance of making things stick. \nStep 2: Broadcast Success Far And Wide \nThis is not the time to pull back on your communication plan . Ramping it up to share the good things that are happening as a result of a change will take you a long way toward success. Point out specific examples of how the change has helped a team member’s work life be better. Showcase departments that are getting better results and how much better those results are compared to the past. People need to “see themselves” in the changed state and be part of a winning team. Keep those successes in the limelight for as long as you can. \nStep 3: Be Open To Changing Things Up \nDon’t get so stuck in the work you’ve done that you’re not open to making small tweaks as needed once the new process is rolled out. Even if you conducted a pilot prior to a full rollout, you may still need to make changes. Make sure you assess how things are going and make adjustments. Let team members know when a change to the new process has been made and why it was done. And if a change can’t be made, let people know the why behind that too. People want to know they’re heard and that they make a difference. \nYes, It’s All About The People \nYou probably noticed that each one of these key steps in making your change stick depends on the people of your company embracing the change and moving it forward. You can have the best equipment, the best systems, and the best technology, but once you get to this point in your process change, people are what move it to success or failure. Put your implementation emphasis on people and you’ll hit it out of the park every time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:07:58.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
