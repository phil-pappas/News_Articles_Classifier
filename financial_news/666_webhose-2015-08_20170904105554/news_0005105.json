Its factory in Tianjin was unaffected, it added.\nSingamas said it has temporarily suspended operations at its affected unit, Singamas Logistics (Tianjin) Co Ltd, which accounts for a small portion of the group's total turnover.\n\"The board does not consider that the incident will have a material adverse impact on the group as a whole,\" Teo said.\nThe death toll from the disaster has risen to 112. The number of missing rose to 95, most of them fire fighters, state media said, suggesting the toll would rise significantly. More than 720 people remained in hospital.\nChinese soldiers and rescue workers in gas masks and hazard suits searched for toxic materials in China's port of Tianjin on Sunday as Premier Li Keqiang arrived to offer condolences, days after the explosions flattened part of a national development zone.
