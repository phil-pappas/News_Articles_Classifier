Lower than expected net immigration is cutting into the population growth rate.\nThat is likely to explain at least part of the improvement in the outlook for unemployment.\nLess immigration and lower population growth means fewer people looking for work. And, as the bank explains, people of prime working age have made the biggest contribution to the change in net migration.\nLower net immigration also means less production and less demand for goods and services including houses, cars, furniture and all the other things people need to establish their homes in Australia.\nHow will that affect monetary policy? That will depend on the balance of the effects on demand and supply.\nWell, despite the weaker economic growth outlook, the improvement in the outlook for the unemployment rate reduces the incentive for the RBA to cut rates, because the lower unemployment rate reduces the downward pressure on wage inflation.\nAs a technical assumption, the RBA has included the market's priced-in probability of a further cut in the official cash rate over the coming months. However, as the bank says, there also is a strong possibility that the gradual increase in the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy interest rates will see a further depreciation of the Australian dollar.\nA more competitive exchange rate would reduce the need for a further easing of monetary policy in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:09:48.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
