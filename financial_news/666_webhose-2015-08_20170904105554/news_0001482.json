Flight attendants are very friendly, the food, amazing cuisine. One thing I also enjoy about SAA is their in-flight entertainment…I’m really excited and looking forward to flying with them.” \nFormer Black Stars defender Samuel Osei Kuffour, who is a frequent user of SAA flights, also said the flight from Accra to Washington DC is “a great one. It a great opportunity for people living in Ghana,” so they don’t have to hustle with using several routes before getting to the US. \nFriday’s launch was attended by Nii Kpobi Tetteh Tsru, the La Mantse, South African High Commissioner to Ghana, Ms. Lulama Xingwana, Ms. Hannah Tetteh – Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Nana Oye Lithur, Gender, Children and Social Protection Minister and other dignitaries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T13:01:20.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
