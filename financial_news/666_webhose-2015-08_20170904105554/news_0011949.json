The Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, dropped 6.97 percent, or 131.18 points, to 1,751.28. \n\"Markets across the globe are in kind of a vicious circle now,\" Gui Haomin, an analyst from Shenwan Hongyuan, told AFP, predicting Chinese shares will keep falling for the immediate future. \nSlowing growth in Asia's largest economy has long kept investors on edge but China's shock devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago, following a string of weak economic data, has riled world markets. \nFears Beijing it tapering a massive share market rescue package helped push Shanghai down 8.49 percent on Monday, wiping out the year's gains in its biggest daily slump since February 2007. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's all about the market sentiment now and the market is panicked,\" Haitong Securities analyst Zhang Qi told AFP. \nOther regional markets opened lower Tuesday following the steep falls in Shanghai, but Tokyo, Sydney and Seoul all bounced into positive territory by mid-morning as relived buyers went bargain hunting. \nThe falls in Chinese shares have defied a government rescue package launched after a huge debt-fuelled rally, which saw the market rise 150 percent in 12 months, then collapsed in mid-June. \nIn the latest move, Beijing said on Sunday it will allow the state pension fund -- which had 3.5 trillion yuan of assets at the end of 2014 -- to buy stocks. \nInvestors are now waiting to see if the \"national team\", meaning entities buying stocks for the government, will intervene to prop up the market and if China's central bank will further loosen monetary policy. \n\"With such an unreasonable sell-off, they (regulators) should at least encourage the market and step up,\" said Zhang of Haitong Securities. \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) , the central bank, said on Tuesday it had injected 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) into the money market to ease tight liquidity. \nFunds have been pinched as the central bank has intervened to prop up the yuan currency after the surprise devaluation on August 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T06:23:58.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
