Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Australia should turn its attention to a multilateral free trade agreement which includes our largest trading partner, China, as the United States-led Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal falters, according to leading business figure Rod Eddington.\nSpeaking after the completion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's Business Advisory Council meetings in Melbourne this week, Australian representative Rod Eddington said that the Free Trade Area of the Pacific agreement had widespread support in the region because, unlike the TPP, it included China.\n\"If there is a key difference between the two agreements it is that FTAAP includes China and given that they are now the biggest-Asian economy and the second-biggest economy in the world, having China and Japan in FTAAP is important and it's important for Australia because our two biggest trading partners are China and Japan,\" Sir Rod told The ­Australian Financial Review, following the conclusion of the summit.\n\"Whatever the outcome of the TPP discussions, we have to press on with FTAAP,\" Sir Rod said. \"We've commissioned quite a big piece of work to help us prepare the ground for the forthcoming FTAAP discussions because we want to make sure that when the FTAAP discussions begin in earnest … we as ABAC, APEC's business arm are prepared to hit the ground running.\"\nAPEC's Business Advisory Council has commissioned a major report on the regional trade agreement including China for a meeting of APEC leaders in Manila in mid-November.\nAustralia's Trade Minister, Andrew Robb, told the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday that while the US, Canada, Mexico and Japan had reached a stalemate over the TPP, a deal was still \"doable\" but that \"the closer we get to a US presidential election, the more prospect (there is) of it falling over\".\nAs the TPP falters, attention is increasingly turning to a China-led free trade deal. Mr Hockey and Mr Robb met the Chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission Xu Shaoshi in Canberra on Thursday for the first strategic economic dialogue between the two countries.\n\"Since our successful meeting in Beijing last year, Australia and China have signed a landmark Free Trade Agreement … in addition, Australia signed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank articles of agreement, in Beijing in June this year. And today I introduced legislation into the House to give effect to our membership of the AIIB,\" Mr Hockey said.\n Legislation introduced on Thursday confirms Australia's participation in the $135 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-13/hockey-robb-attend-china-economy-trade-and-investment-talks/6694148", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "http://www.9news.com.au/national/2015/08/13/10/55/new-bank-real-game-changer-hockey-says"], "published": "2015-08-13T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:00:20.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
