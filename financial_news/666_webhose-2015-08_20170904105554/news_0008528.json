We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?\nFollowing a redundancy, my husband worked hard to find a new job as we have a young family and he is the main earner. As he is in a senior position, jobs were thin on the ground, and he reluctantly accepted one a long way from home.\nHe is away from Monday to Friday and although the job is going well he misses us all terribly. We are considering moving, and there would be some assistance for relocation. However house prices are significantly higher where he is working, and we all love where we live currently with great schools, friends etc.\nHe is trying to look for a job closer to home, but works very long hours in an open plan office, so any job searching has to be in the evening. In addition, jobs at his level don’t seem to be advertised as they rely on word of mouth and networking.\nWe are all agreed that we need to be back together as a family, but I feel helpless in making this happen. Are there any independent agencies/consultants who can actively help him search for a position closer to home, and do the networking for him?\nDo you need advice on a work issue? For Jeremy’s and readers’ help, send a brief email to dear.jeremy@theguardian.com .
