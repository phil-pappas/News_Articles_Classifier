Lawlessness will mount, if the issue of illegal mining is not confronted,\" the SAHRC said. \n\"The commission recommends that in order to pursue a path of economic inclusion ... there is a need for further research that identifies the size, shape, and scope of artisanal mining in the country. \n\"Without any comprehensive framework for improving the practices of artisanal mining, current characterisation simply as \"illegal\", will have the effect, in terms of the panel's prediction, of making artisanal mining more dangerous rather than causing it to disappear.\" \nIt said there was a need to \"explore opportunities\" for a framework partnership between zama zamas and large scale mining, particularly on those sites under the control of major mining houses that are no longer being used. \nThere also needed to be \"engagement\" into the development of a framework for \"direct access to historically mined sites under the control of the state\". \nThe SAHRC recommended that a final report into the Bontekoe mine incident be made available to the relevant communities, and a plan be put in place to deal with similar incidents that could possibly occur in other places around the country. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:09:09.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
