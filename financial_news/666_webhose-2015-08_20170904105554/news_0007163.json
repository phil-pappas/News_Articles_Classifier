Lending Club, a leader in personal loans for consumers, announced yesterday that its loan originations has grown by 90%, and its revenue has doubled compared to the same time last year. Lending Club is now originating in three months what the entire industry used to do in a year. The transformative marketplace lending business model has been rapidly expanding to other asset classes. SoFi, Earnest and CommonBond have been helping borrowers refinance student loans. And further meaningful expansion into mortgages and auto loans is expected.\nThe most controversial corner of the marketplace lending universe is small business lending. When Lending Club makes a personal loan, its average interest rate is 31% cheaper than a credit card. When SoFi makes a student loan, it can easily save borrowers $14,000 with incredibly low interest rates. However, if a small business borrows from one of the many new marketplace lenders, the APR could be 30% or higher. In small business lending, new providers are selling easy access to credit for many people who otherwise would not be able to get approved. The marketing is focused on speed, rather than price. Even if you want to determine the price and comparison shop, it can be difficult.\nAt MagnifyMoney (my website), I recently tried to create an exhaustive list of small business loan options, including the price range. I found a lot of options (at least 17, and counting). But I also found a wide variety of pricing models, which would make it difficult for small business owners to compare and find the best deal. One lender offers to finance your invoices. It will give you 85% of your invoice up front, and then the remaining rebate depends upon your creditworthiness and the term of the loan. Another lender offers six-month term loans. In the first two months, you would be charged between 1% – 12% of the loan amount, and then in the remaining four months, you would be charged 1% per month. Other lenders offer more traditional term loans with an up-front fee and an interest. However, it can be difficult to understand the range of possible costs before borrowing. And most lenders do not convert the fees and interest into an APR. Whereas a consumer can see a range of possible APRs before borrowing, the same is not possible for a small business owner. In many cases, the products being offered by marketplace lenders are more expensive than a cash advance on a credit card. However, because it is only disclosed as a low monthly fee, borrowers may not understand the true cost.\nRegulators and government officials are starting to pay attention to marketplace lenders. The Treasury Department initiated a request for information, and some form of action is expected. While regulators generally view the industry as beneficial to consumers, there are some concerns.\nTo stay ahead of the regulators, today a coalition of nonprofit and industry leaders joined together to launch a “Small Business Borrowers Bill of Rights”. Karen Mills, the former head of the US Small Business Administration, said that “small business owners are seeing the number of alternative sources for financing their companies grow at an unprecedented rate, and while this is a good thing in terms of increasing access to capital, borrower protections have not caught up.”\nThe Bill of Rights outlines six key rights that all borrowers should have. If a lender chooses to adhere to the criteria, the CEO signs the bill of rights and ensure compliance. The six key rights established include:\nThe right to transparent pricing and terms, including a right to see an annualized interest rate and fees. The right to non-abusive products, so that borrowers don’t get trapped. The right to responsible underwriting, so that borrowers are not put into loans that they cannot repay. The right to fair treatment from brokers, so that borrowers are not steered to the most expensive loans that pay the broker the highest commission. The right to inclusive credit action, without discrimination. The right to fair collection practices, to prevent harassment. In some of the worst examples today, small business brokers steer desperate borrowers to expensive products that the business clearly cannot afford or understand. And even if a borrower wanted to compare options before borrowing, she would find it nearly impossible given the poor disclosure of many lenders and the lack of a standard method for disclosing the cost of credit.\nSix organizations worked together to launch the bill of rights, including Accion, The Aspen Institute, Fundera, Funding Circle, Lending Club, MultiFunding, Opportunity Fund and Small Business Majority. You can read more about the Bill of Rights, and see who has signed it, at ResponsibleBusinessLending.org . For many of the lenders participating, this is a recognition that the industry needs to change. By signing up to the Bill of Rights, lenders are trying to help define the change that is needed, take a position of leadership and be ahead of any regulatory curve.\nI applaud the creation of the Bill of Rights. It is still too difficult for borrowers to understand the true cost of borrowing before signing on the dotted line. There is tremendous opportunity for marketplace lenders to use technology, data and advanced analytics to create better, lower cost credit for small businesses. Marketplace lenders have already helped people cut the cost of their credit card and student loan debt by transforming their lower cost base and superior analytics into value for consumers. It would be a shame if the value created in small business lending is not passed along to small business borrowers, simply because they have fewer options.\nGet The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/small-business/17-options-small-business-loan198853466/", "http://www.responsiblebusinesslending.org/", "http://ir.lendingclub.com/"], "published": "2015-08-06T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:19:47.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
