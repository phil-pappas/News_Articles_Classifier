In afternoon trade on Tuesday it fetched US71.97¢.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia strategist Richard Grace says the dollar got caught up in stock market volatility.

But the recent volatility in currency and equity markets has analysts pushing back the date. That in turn has been pushing the greenback lower.\nEconomists at Barclays now forecast the Fed will now wait until March 2016 to make their move.\n\"Although we continue to see economic activity in the US as solid and justifying modest rate hikes, we believe the Federal Reserve is unlikely to begin a hiking cycle in this environment for fear that such a move may further destabilise markets,\" the Barclays Research analysts said.\n\"Instead, we believe [the Fed] will delay the start of the rate hike cycle beyond September as a means to offset tighter financial conditions while it evaluates the effect of recent volatility.\"\nBut the chances of another rate cut in Australia appear to be rising, according to market pricing.\nUS investment bank Citi on Tuesday reported a surge in bets on a third cut for the year, with interest rate swap markets now showing a 76 per cent chance of a 25 basis point reduction by the November board meeting of the RBA.\nThis compares with a 48 per cent chance when measured on Friday morning, and a 64 per cent chance of a November cut before the Australian stock market opened on Monday.\nThe RBA has cut the cash rate rate twice this year, from 2.5 per cent to a record low 2 per cent, and now seems inclined to leave it there.\nBut UK-based Capital Economics, one of the most bearish forecasters on Australia, says Monday's stock market rout will not translate to weaker consumer demand and business investment.\n\"While we remain more concerned than most about the Australian economy, we don't think that the recent sharp falls in equity prices will filter through into much weaker investment or consumption,\" chief economist for Australia Paul Dales wrote in a note on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T12:06:29.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
