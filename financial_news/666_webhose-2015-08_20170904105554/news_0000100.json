The introduction of the yellow card also entitle them the benefit of a citizen in socio-economic sectors, which has made an impact in attracting and motivating an increasing numbers to take part in investment in various areas. Consequentially, cash flow into the country through remittances and investment has also grown steadily. \nThe Policy also allowed for a specific day- August 16- to be set aside for an annual celebration of the Ethiopian Diaspora. Ethiopia, therefore, is set to celebrate Diaspora week to help boost contribution of Ethiopians living abroad in the development endeavors of the country. Over 6,000 Ethiopian Diasporas drawn from all over the world are expected to attend the event that will commence the coming August 16. \nA Diaspora Day has a number of benefits including providing the creation of an opportunity for the Ethiopian Diaspora all over the world to engage with one another ;to connect with the people at home and create a chance for the young generation abroad to see something of their country and fully experience its culture and be an ambassador of their country.
