Mashesha \nMr Ralotsia said the situation became worse as it occurred during the critical stages of plant growth and development thereby adversely compromising both crop yields and vegetation for livestock. \nHe said with winter having set in, the situation has become worse than before, especially for livestock grazing. \nThe drought, the minister said, has reduced yields drastically, adding that average yields for commercial and subsistence farmers has been reduced from the normal 2.5 ton per hacter to 100 kilograms per hacter respectively, and that said farmers have reported a complete crop failure. \nMr Ralotsia said agriculture in Botswana was dependent on rainfall, which was erratic and unreliable, noting that this has been a limiting factor to the sector's productive capacity, and that it was a fact that this would increase as the intensity of the rainfall scarcity increases and hence the call to be aware of this and start doing things that would conserve the little moisture the country gets. \nHe said in addition to climate change, inadequate infrastructure, frequent outbreak of diseases and pests also affect the sector. He also cited poor utilisation of agricultural land which results in most of the land remaining uncultivated as one of the major challenges. \nFor his part, a member of the show committee who is also a farmer, Mr Matshego Gobuamang appealed to the President to consider pastoral farmers in the agriculture credit scheme as it was difficult for them to cope during trying times. \nMr Gobuamang asked the government to consider full compensation when their stud animals were attacked and killed by predators as they were expensive, noting that an average stud bull costs well over P60 000 and P30 000 for stud cattle. \nProposing a vote of thanks, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, Mr Fidelis Molao thanked President Lt Gen. Seretse Khama Ian Khama for gracing the show, and thanked all the sponsors of the show for the various logistical and financial support received, more specially Debswana and Stanbic for having sponsored the judging ring and kraals respectively. \nMr Molao also thanked organisations, exhibitors and farmers who agreed to partake in the show, and recognised their efforts in preparing their exhibits and their stalls for the display, adding that the quality of their exhibits were impressive. \nSource : BOPA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T13:21:18.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
