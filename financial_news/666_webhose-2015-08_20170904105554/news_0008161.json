Despite living in a country with low speed limits, Australians buy a surprisingly large number of fast cars.\nConsider this: in most advanced economies, Benz's high-performance sub-brand, AMG, accounts for about 3 to 5 per cent of all Mercedes sales.\nSuch a small proportion is easy to understand. The AMG cars, which include the hotted-up C63 version of the C-Class sedan and the unique coupe known as the Mercedes-AMG GT, carry a massive price premium to go with their outrageously enhanced performance.\nSo what is the sales percentage in Australia? Six? Eight? No, it's a remarkable 13 per cent.\nBMW M3 - 2015 model: BMW has already sold more M cars in 2015 than in the whole of last year. BMW M3 Yes, roughly one in eight Australian-delivered Benzes have been extensively and expensively modified by the company's official hot-rod division, now officially known as Mercedes-AMG and headquartered in Affalterbach​, Germany.\nA decent percentage of those that aren't have still been specified with so-called AMG packs to give a bit more sporty flair.\nThe story at Audi is similar and even more impressive – perhaps. Exact comparisons are hard because each maker has a staircase of modified vehicles and they can't necessarily be directly compared.\nHowever, 15 per cent of Audis sold in Australia are either modified S or RS models – or the R8 supercar.\n Mercedes-AMG C63. The really big jump for AMG came in 2008 with the first C63 model. Daimler AG - Global Communicatio That puts Australia in the top 10 markets for these cars in absolute terms, despite the relatively tiny size of our market.\nSporty culture The local managing director, Andrew Doyle, puts it down to a culture that embraces sportiness. \"This carries through to a high degree of preference for vehicles that have the same characteristics.\" (No wonder the car manufacturer has financially backed Race Week, for ten years straight.)\nAudi's go-fast division rose from a joint venture with Porsche to make the world's fastest station wagon (based on the Audi 80 wagon) back in 1994.\nAudi RS5 Coupe: Until a few years ago Audi produced only one RS model at any time. Supplied This car was known as the RS2 Avant, with RS standing for Rennsport (racing sport). It set the naming convention for the sub-brand up until the present day.\nUntil a few years ago Audi produced only one RS model at any time. Things have changed and it now has six different offerings on this market alone, plus the R8 supercar, which it counts in its \"Audi Sport\" family, along with all RS models. The tamer (though still pretty quick) S models are even more common.\nBMW started much earlier, with its M (Motorsport) division providing a road-going version of its M1 mid-engined race car in 1978. Ultra high-performance versions of the 3 and 5-series, known as M3 and M5, appeared in the mid-1980s and took the idea more mainstream. Nowadays, only the 7-Series limousine is quarantined from the M treatment.\nM models account for about 4 per cent of BMW sales downunder, though there is a range of less extreme BMW performance vehicles with various levels of M enhancement.\nBMW has already sold more M cars in 2015 than in the whole of last year and, with a coming onslaught of new models, expects big growth.\nA new version of the legendary M3 (and its M4 coupe cousin) has a sharper price to take the fight to the C63 and Audi's RS4/RS5 siblings.\nLexus, the most recent member of the performance club, has made substantial recent gains, albeit off a very low base. Its officially \"hot-rodded\" F cars may have sold a modest 86 units in the first half of this year, but that made Australia fourth in the Lexus F world rankings.\nFor the Japanese brand it's the milder F-Sport cars that have been the big success story. These carry some of the visual aggression and feature sports-oriented steering and chassis modifications, though no engine upgrades. They now account for almost exactly one in three Lexuses sold in this country.\nIn July Volvo Car Group bought the Polestar racing company (which has previously modified road-going cars for Volvo) so that it will have an inhouse brand to take the fight to the Germans and beyond.\nJaguar too can be expected to look for more volume by eventually releasing R and R-S versions of its new XE small sedan (to go with the equivalent offerings in the mid-sized XF).\nUp a notch Andrew Doyle confirmed to us that Audi will shortly turn up the notch, launching Audi Sport as a more separated brand in Australia. \"This step will see us re-brand key dealerships with Audi Sport showrooms which focus on our RS and R8 models as highlights to the range.\" This new company message will no doubt be communicated throughout AHIRW, which is a highly sought-after invitation for Audi's top dealers and customers each year.\nBrad Kelly, Mercedes-Benz's national sales manager, said the really big jump for AMG came in 2008 with the first C63 model. That took the sub-brand to about 10 per cent of volume.\nThe figure was 11 per cent last year, running to 13 per cent this year. Furthermore, a wide range of new products is coming, including hot versions of new Benz SUVs.\nPerformance versions of luxury cars are good for the brand image, carry healthy margins for their makers, and provide an effective way to link the companies' road cars and racing programs.\nOn this last score, Benz is currently a dominant force in F1 and the cars carry the AMG logo. Audi's Le Mans car is known as the R18, bringing its nomenclature in line with the R8 road-going supercar.\nThe M4 name is applied to BMW's current DTM touring car, in the popular German/European series. In July at the Zandvoort circuit, the M4 achieved the unprecedented feat of taking the first seven places in a round.\n\"F1 technology goes into AMG, in the transmission and braking technology, and the hybrid technology will also flow through,\" says Mercedes-Benz's David McCarthy.\n\"There will be at some point in the future an [F1-style] electric module … the ability to meet fuel and emission targets is incredibly challenging. So it's a chance to add performance but not at the cost of fuel use.\"\nAnother reason extreme performance cars are selling so well is that they have been making their way down the model ranges.\nThe Audi S1 and RS3 are based on the company's two smallest car lines.\nMercedes-Benz's A45 AMG, based on the compact hatch, is effectively half the price of the next model up, the big-selling C63. It is still monstrously quick, as will be the forthcoming BMW M2, based on its smallest coupe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:04:33.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
