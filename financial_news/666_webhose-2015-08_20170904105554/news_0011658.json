The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nFedEx Corporation provides transportation, e-commerce, and business services in the United States and internationally. \nTheStreet Rating: Buy, B- TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates FEDEX CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate FEDEX CORP (FDX) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, good cash flow from operations and solid stock price performance. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: FDX's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 0.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 2.3%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share. The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.48, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. To add to this, FDX has a quick ratio of 1.59, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. Net operating cash flow has increased to $1,893.00 million or 12.27% when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite an increase in cash flow of 12.27%, FEDEX CORP is still growing at a significantly lower rate than the industry average of 197.29%. FEDEX CORP has experienced a steep decline in earnings per share in the most recent quarter in comparison to its performance from the same quarter a year ago. The company has suffered a declining pattern of earnings per share over the past two years. However, we anticipate this trend to reverse over the coming year. During the past fiscal year, FEDEX CORP reported lower earnings of $3.60 versus $6.79 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($10.88 versus $3.60). Compared to where it was a year ago today, the stock is now trading at a higher level, regardless of the company's weak earnings results. The stock's price rise over the last year has driven it to a level which is somewhat expensive compared to the rest of its industry. We feel, however, that other strengths this company displays justify these higher price levels.
