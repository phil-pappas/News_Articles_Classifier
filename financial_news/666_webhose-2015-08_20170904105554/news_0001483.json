It says to have insurance coverage for holdings, and earlier this year attained ISAE 3402 accreditation following a review from KPMG. \nRecently, it sought to further enhance security through a partnership with Gem, employing the latter’s multisignature technology. It also recently launched a tool for bitcoin transaction monitoring and compliance. \nJames Smith, CEO and co-founder, commented that the startup plans on adding additional blockchain intelligence services in the coming months. \nThe Banker is a monthly financial magazine owned by London-based The Financial Times . Its Technology Projects of the Year awards recognize innovative technology contributions to the finance industry. \nThis year was the second for the awards. 270 submissions were received for 12 categories. \nFinance Magnates has inquired as to the total number of submissions for the security category.
