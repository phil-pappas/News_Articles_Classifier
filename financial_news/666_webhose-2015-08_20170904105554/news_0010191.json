Photo: Roslyn Budd\nGas pipeline owner APA Group is forecasting a jump of up to 60 per cent in core earnings as it reaps the benefits of recent acquisitions, including BG Group's pipeline that serves its Gladstone liquefied natural gas venture.\nManaging director Mick McCormack has also expressed keen appetite for further growth, including the proposed pipeline that would link the Northern Territory into the east coast gas grid, and a new pipeline servicing the goldfields region in Western Australia.\nThe company is also looking at further acquisitions, including EnergyAustralia's Iona gas storage plant in Victoria, which is in the process for a potential sale.\n\"We are always looking at greenfield opportunities: that's the nature of APA,\" Mr McCormack said. \"We will continue to kick tyres on any pipeline or related asset that is up for sale: that's again the nature of APA.\"\nAdvertisement APA securities were trading 7c lower at $8.45 by mid-morning.\nAPA has added pipelines and expanded its existing capacity to take advantage of the changing gas market in eastern Australia, where the start-up of the Queensland LNG plants is driving the need for a much more flexible gas transportation system able to ship gas across basins and state borders.\n\"The east coast grid is effectively a gas super-highway,\" Mr McCormack said on the conference call. \"We have built a gas super-highway without any government support or regulatory oversight: this is markets at work.\"\nAPA is forecasting an increase in core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 55-60 per cent in 2015-16, after a 10 per cent rise last financial year, broadly in line with consensus.\nStatutory EBITDA for 2015-16 was expected to be between $1.275 billion and $1.31 billion, APA said on Wednesday.\nEBITDA for this coming year will include a contribution of about $US355 million from the BG pipeline, acquired for $US4.6 billion in early June and now renamed the Wallumbilla Gladstone Pipeline.\nAPA's bottom line profit for 2014-15 surged 63 per cent to $559.9 million, thanks to a gain on the sale of a stake in gas distributor Envestra in August last year. Sales climbed 11.3 per cent to $1.55 billion.\nIn June, APA estimated statutory EBITDA for the full year of between $1.257 billion and $1.272 billion and it reported EBITDA within that range, at $1.269 billion. Normalised EBITDA from continuing operations of $821 million was within its guidance of between $810 million and $825 million.\nAPA declared a final distribution to shareholders fo 20.5c, in line with its announcement in June.\nAPA advised that former AGL Energy chief executive Michael Fraser has been appointed as a \"non-independent, non-executive\" director. Also appointed as a new non-executive director is Debbie Goodin, who is on the boards of Senex Energy and oOh!media Ltd. among other companies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T05:03:41.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
