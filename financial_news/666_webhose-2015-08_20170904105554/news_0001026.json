The views expressed are his own. \nAug 21 (Reuters) - Greece - the story that just keeps on giving - is in a new phase. Election time. But let's put that aside for a moment to look at the broader euro zone. \nThe economy has not been responding to the massive stimulus the European Central Bank is giving it. \nToday we get four bits of data that should tell us if that is changing - flash purchasing manager indexes and euro zone consumer confidence. \nOf the three PMIs due, France is already out, worse that expected and remaining poor. Germany, coming later, has been doing OK and the euro zone as a whole has been a bit better than Germany. \nConsumer confidence, meanwhile, has fallen for five months in a row, albeit from its highest level since 2007. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is supposed to show some improvement, although it will still be a negative number, as it has been since 2005. \nRegardless of these reports, however, it is all up in the air with China's dramatic economic slowdown. \nIn the meantime - and I know you will all be impressed by this - the euro zone one-year inflation swap rate has fallen below zero. For the less nerdy among you, this means that financial markets are betting that there will be deflation in the euro zone a year from now. \nThat is not good news for the European Central Bank, which has been hurling money around in an attempt to fight off deflation. \nIndeed, Austria's Ewald Nowotny, an ECB governing council member, said falling oil prices meant that no one should expect euro zone inflation to get back to the bank's roughly 2 percent target anytime soon. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) back to Greece. There are two ways of looking at Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's calling an election in a month's time. \nOne is that it is a huge dose of uncertainty heaped onto a euro zone that has only just settled into a new bailout relationship with Athens. Nothing will get done for a month as a result and Greece will not be ready to pass its October bailout review. A lot of market notes are taking this view. \nBut the second view is more positive, it is that having won an election, put up a good fight against insurmountable odds (Germany), won a referendum and pushed an unpopular bailout plan through the Greek parliament, Tsipras will now consolidate power to make sure it all gets done as promised. \nEurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem saw the possibility of that in a statement last night. \nEarly days, but let's hazard a guess for an outcome - a Syriza without hardline rebels, in coalition with leftist moderates from parties like To Potami and PASOK. That would be a popular left-wing government, committed to remaining in the euro zone and as likely as any to meet the demands of the bailout.
