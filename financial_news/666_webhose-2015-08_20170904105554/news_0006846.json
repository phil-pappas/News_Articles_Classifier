It will remain in the realm of technology, but will strive to expand its sphere of influence in the new generational businesses built.\nOn the crisis, the company said, “Despite being victimised and persecuted in an unjust manner, we at FTIL are not shattered by this and we posses the capability to rise like a phoenix.”\n“History will always remember FTIL 1.0 and 2.0 for its contributions to the growth of India financial and commodity markets,” it added.\n 19, 2015 7:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:39:17.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
