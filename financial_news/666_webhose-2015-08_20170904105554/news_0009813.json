It certainly opens the door to more organizing.\"\nRand Wilson, a veteran organizer and a communications and policy director at a Massachusetts chapter of the Services Employees International Union, said he saw potential in warehousing, cleaning services and health care.\nAnother segment widely cited by organizers and labor experts is the warehouses of companies like Amazon.com Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Google Inc, which are often filled with workers from staffing agencies or contract firms.\nThe Teamsters union recently won an election to represent warehouse and shipping workers at Google Express, the technology giant's shopping delivery service. The workers are employed through staffing firm Adecco.\nRome Aloise, president of the Teamsters in Northern California, said the Browning-Ferris ruling means Google will now have to be part of the discussions about working conditions with the union and the contractor.\n\"This is a classic case. We won and are going into negotiations and now Google will have to come to the table.\"\nIt was a local branch of the Teamsters that originally brought the complaint about a union election at the Browning-Ferris recycling plant to the labor relations board, and the union has been active in organizing truck drivers and warehouse workers at delivery companies and tech firms.\nAmazon, Google and Adecco were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart spokesman Brian Nick said the company was still reviewing the decision but has concerns.\nTOUGH CHALLENGE\nChallenging the ruling in court will not be easy, opponents say, because a court could only take up the case if closely-held Browning-Ferris refuses to negotiate with the workers' union. \"This will not be resolved quickly,\" said Browning-Ferris's attorney Stuart Newman. He declined to specifically comment on the company's next legal steps.\nTrade groups have little to no legal recourse, since they were not the subject of the NLRB's ruling.\n\"The litigation strategy is somewhere between challenging and nonexistent, and of course the NLRB knows that,\" said Michael Layman, a vice-president at the International Franchise Association on Friday.\nInstead, the IFA and other groups said they would focus their efforts on Congress, which could write its own definition of employer responsibility for contract workers into law or pass a resolution blocking use of the new NLRB standard.\nThe Republican chairmen of congressional committees with oversight of labor issues, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. John Kline of Minnesota, both pledged to introduce legislation that would roll back the decision.\nBut any bill targeting Browning-Ferris would join other Republican measures aimed at reversing NLRB decisions that have yet to become law, and would likely face a veto as long as a Democrat is in the Oval Office, said Walter Olson, a senior fellow who tracks labor law at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\"The politics are such that, even though Republicans have strong majorities in both houses of Congress, the NLRB is considered enough of a party-line issue that a bill would get a presidential veto,\" Olson said.\n(Additional reporting by Daniel Wiessner, Robert Iafolla and Mari Saito; Editing by Peter Henderson , Christian Plumb and Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T02:54:51.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
