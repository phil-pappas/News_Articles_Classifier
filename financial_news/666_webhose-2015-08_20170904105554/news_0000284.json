It is up to the Government to decide which of the proposals are within the means of the state and which ought to be whittled down or abandoned. In a circumstance such as this, it does not help anybody's cause to resort to open attacks on doctors and insults in the media. \nThe doctors' strike is barely four days old and already the impact is so drastic on the body politic that, it is in the interest of everybody of Ghanaian lineage for a negotiable end to the impasse. Yesterday, reports indicated that at least three people have died from the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital. All indications were that if the deceased had benefitted from medical care, they might have been living. \nThe doctors' strike is a very serious threat to our lives and national cohesion. That is why so-called communicators of the NDC, should refrain from antagonizing our medical experts and call for a negotiated end to the mess. I have a practical experience of how serious the doctors' strike could be. When doctors withdrew their services in 2014, I lost an aunt. Auntie Yaa Donkor complained of stomach ache and was rushed from her base at Gomoa Akropong in the Central Region to the Agona Swedru Municipal Hospital. With doctors on strike, she could not benefit from medical attention. \nShe was being rushed to the Oda Government Hospital, when she gave up the ghost. Auntie Yaa, was the widow of my late uncle, Kojo Edwun. With her husband dead, we the nephews were mandated traditionally to organize her funeral. Apart from this experience, the death of Esther Bambir, also known as Abena Supun, who died at the Apam Catholic Hospital in April this year, for lack of medical attention, readily comes to mind. \nEsther complained of breathing problems as she prepared to go to bed and was rushed to the Apam Catholic Hospital from her base at Gomoa Sampa. When the taxi cab got to Apam, Dum-so had visited the entire township, including the hospital. According to the doctor on duty, she needed oxygen, but with the black-out, it was not possible to administer the oxygen on her. Medical authorities were preparing to send her to the Winneba Government Hospital, when she gave up the ghost. \nEsther Bambir's funeral has been fixed for September 5, 2015, which coincides with the grand durbar to round-off the Akwambo Festival of the chiefs and people of Ekumfi Ekrawfo, my humble hometown. I am a confused man as I write this piece. As Chairman of the Planning Committee for the Akwambo Festival, I cannot see how I could absent myself from the key moment of the festival. On the other hand, as the traditional husband of the deceased, I am obliged to be present at Gomoa Sampa, to send my wife 'home.' \nThat is only an aside. The real issue is how to resolve the deadlock in the doctor's impasse that has left our medical doctors abandoning their Hipocratic Oath. The doctors' strike is a threat to life at the centre of the earth and national security. On Friday, Mrs. Ellen Nortey, a grand old lady of 87 years, visited a medical centre in Accra and was told that there was no doctor on duty. The old lady was obviously disappointed. \n\"Doctors,\" she said, \"may have genuine grievances. But sick Ghanaians should not suffer.\" As part of measures to mitigate the effect of the strike, the Ministry of Health has asked all heads of directorates in health facilities throughout the country to be at post to work with other non-striking staff available during the period of the strike. \"Heads of the various units should also ensure that there are continuous emergency services, including maternity services at all health services. All ambulance services are to remain on stand-by for emergency services,\" the ministry directed. \nAccording to information circulating on the social media, the striking doctors are demanding among others, 30 percent of their basic pay as book allowance. They have also tabled a demand for 40 percent of their wages to pay for accommodation, 20 percent core duty allowance, 30 percent clothing allowance, 20 percent special risk allowance and a special vehicle exemption package for doctors. \nThe Ghana Medical Association declared a strike action on Thursday, a day after meeting with Ministers of Finance, Health and Employment and Labour Relations The good news is that while the Rottweilers in the ruling party continue to rain insults on doctors, Mr. Haruna Iddrisu, Minister of Employment and Labour Relations, gave a conciliatory speech after meeting the doctors, a stance which portends good for negotiations, when he meets leaders of the GMA in Accra again, tomorrow. \n\"I am optimistic that negotiations will progress into the second and probably concluding stages. We have given in to some of their requests, some of them we have to do further financial implication analysis,\" he said, after Wednesday meeting in Accra. \n\"We trust that true to the calling of their profession, they will continue to render services and save lives as we also do our utmost best to meet some of their demands within the constraints of the budget and the challenges of the economy,\" the minister said, ahead of tomorrow's decisive encounter with the executive of the striking doctors' body. \nOn Thursday, the GMA issued a road-map for the withdrawal of medical services in state medical centres, beginning with a no show at the Out Patient Departments for a week, to be followed by lack of services at the Accident and Emergency centres, if government fails to meet their demands. Korle Bu Hospital, the largest centre for medical care, immediately announced the closure of its Out Patient Department. \nDeputy General Secretary of the GMA, Dr. Justice Yankson told the media in Accra on Wednesday that the time-table for full blown strike action by doctors was a notice for the resignation of all the 2,000 doctors in public employment in Ghana. Labour expert, Austen Gamey, a former Member of Parliament, was not too enthused about the doctors' demands. He told newsmen in the national capital that \"doctors are putting gun to the head of government, intimidating the employer to accede to their proposals.\" \nThis is not the first time the doctors are putting aside the tenets of their Hippocratic Oath in this country. What makes this action more serious is the avowed intention of the 2,000 public doctors to resign. I have had a good chat with Dr. Kwabena Opoku Edusei, GMA President and some members of his executives. I get the impression that the issue at stake is more serious than the media war developing out of the doctor's action. \nThe doctors believe they have been forced by circumstances beyond their control to abandon their Hippocratic Oath. For the information of the general public, the Hippocratic Oath is sworn by newly qualified doctors to serve as permanent reminder to the tenets of their profession. \nIt owes its genesis to the origin of medicine as a professional practice in ancient Greece. \nAmong the many requests on the doctor, the Hippocratic Oath compels the newly qualified medical officer to swear as follows: \"I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially, must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play God. \n\"I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to cure adequately for the sick. \n\"I will prevent diseases whenever I can, for prevention is better than cure. I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those of sound mind and body as well as the infirm. \n\"If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.\" \nAccording to Dr. Opoku Edusei, doctors take their Hippocratic Oath seriously, but they have been pushed by lack of faith exhibited by government representatives in negotiations over the years. \nTomorrow, I intend to look at the problem at hand and try and hazard a guess about how all Ghanaians could help to keep our doctors in the consulting rooms and the various wards at medical centres in the country. The doctor's strike, I dare state is a threat to life and national security. I shall return!
