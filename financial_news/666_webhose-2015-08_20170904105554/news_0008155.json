Erin Jonasson Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow UBS analyst Andrew Lilley has left the integrated investment bank to study a PhD at Harvard on a scholarship. Congratulations.\nLilley was one of the two analysts who co-authored a note on Mike Baird 's poles and wires privatisation that was published during the March NSW state election campaign.\nAs you may have read, that report was revised (with, among other things, its exciting headline: \"Bad for the budget, good for the state\" removed) hours after publication following much \"angst\", first in Baird's office and then the offices of UBS Australasia boss Matthew Grounds and his head of investment banking Guy Fowler .\nThe investment banking side of Grounds's mighty shop are Baird's advisers on the transaction. They are expected to make towards $20 million in fees from the $13 billion-plus privatisation.\nLilley's departure is not related to \"notegate\" though. The proof: he applied for the scholarship last year.\nFor now, he's taking a leave of absence as he studies. Very well done.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...
