But today, I am glad to say that all sides have respected their commitments. Greece is living up to its ambitious reform commitments,\" Juncker said in a statement. \n\"The message of today's (meeting) is loud and clear: on this basis, Greece is and will irreversibly remain a member of the euro area,\" he said. \nOfficials said a first disbursement for Greece next week could total some 13 billion euros. \nThat means Greece will have funds available to cover a debt payment to the European Central Bank due on August 20. \nThe 19 eurozone finance ministers gave their approval after Greek lawmakers voted through the accord early Friday following a bitter all-night debate on the unprecedented series of tough and wide-ranging reforms which Greece will have to implement. \nInternational Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde participated in the eurozone meeting via a teleconference link and was said to have judged the agreement \"positively\". \nTsipras came to power in January on a wave of popular anger against the austerity demanded by creditors in exchange for two previous bailouts costing 240 billion euros. \nCritics say the painful reforms have only undermined rather than help the Greek economy, which emerged from six years of brutal recession in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T23:20:59.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
