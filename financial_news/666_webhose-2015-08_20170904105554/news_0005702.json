When adjusted for one off items, the company earned 80 cents a share.\nRevenue fell 5.2 percent to $969.5 million.\nAnalysts were expecting adjusted earnings of 79 cents a share and revenue of $1.04 billion.\n\"While we are not pleased with our revenue growth, we delivered earnings at the high end of our previous guidance,\" Keurig Chief Executive Brian Kelley said in a statement. \"We are taking decisive actions to adapt and compete more effectively in today's rapidly-evolving, dynamic marketplace.\"\nThe company also authorized the additional repurchase of up to $1 billion in shares over the next two years.
