A new Bankrate study shows only 19% of workers are saving more for retirement now than they were one year ago . But that's only half the financial pain for moms and dads also burdened with college costs. Fresh data on that front from Sallie Mae shows college savings are in decline, too. So what's a parent to do when it comes to balancing retirement needs with college funding for the kids? It's not an easy decision, but most financial experts agree that retirement should always come before college savings. \"I'm almost finished putting my second child through college, with one left to go,\" says Jerry Rackley, chief analyst at Demand Metric, an Oklahoma City-based marketing advisory firm. \"There's an emotion there and a pride of wanting to pay for college, particularly for your children. However, this is far less practical, as higher education costs have soared from when my generation was in college.\" Rackley's not alone in that sentiment. Of ten financial experts who responded to MainStreet for this article, nine favored saving for retirement over saving for junior's college fund. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:19:04.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
