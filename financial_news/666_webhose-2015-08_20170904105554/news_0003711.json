It will be receiving a new name new label design and a new flavor. These changes aim to distinguish this product among the Vibrant Health product line. \n“To me Green Vibrance Junior was such a great product that people didn’t seem to know about and certainly wasn’t getting the attention it deserved. With this in mind I contacted an artist and good friend of mine Noelle Raffaele with an idea to create a relatable character who children would be excited to see. I envisioned a superhero character because well this product IS super. Noelle ran with the idea and with her artistic skill combined with the creative minds here at Vibrant Health I think we now have something very special that kids will love” says Vito Ramos Customer Service Specialist & Internet Accounts Manager.\n“When I saw the original Super Kids Vibrance design I wondered how we could make it even more personal and unique. That’s when I came up with the idea to have Noelle model the character after my daughter Paeten. My son Preston will also get a character on future bottles but I don’t want to give too much away just yet” says company Vice President Paige Parker.\nAdorned with a leaf cape and safari boots cartoon superhero Paeten looks like she’s ready to take on the world. is described as a full balanced meal of protein fruits and vegetables. Vibrant Health formulator Mark Timon explains further “Super Kids Vibrance fills in the gaps in a child’s often selective diet but also provides essential nutrients required for full and healthful growth.” The company is excited to see how the new look and new flavor are received among parents and especially kids.\nAbout Vibrant Health\nVibrant Health has been family-owned and operated since 1992.
