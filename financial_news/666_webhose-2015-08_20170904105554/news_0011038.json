Billionaire Tim Headington 's plans to develop the new home of Forty Five Ten across the street from The Joule in downtown Dallas could be stayed if an affiliated company of Forest City Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: FCE.A) gets its way in the courthouse. The Ohio-based development firm's affiliate, FC WP Building LLC, filed an amended petition Tuesday adding a Headington-owned subsidiary, Elm at StonePlace Holdings LLC, to the original suit and asking for temporary emergency relief from District Court Judge Martin Hoffman to stay development on the Main Street site. The amended petition also claims the Headington affiliate damaged a shared wall with The Wilson Building during the demolition of the neighboring building earlier this summer. \"They received a building permit and we need to fix the wall to the Wilson Building, which was a shared wall and damaged during the demolition,\" Jim Truitt , Forest City's senior vice president told the Dallas Business Journal. \"This is an old, historic building. The wall isn't perfect and we need to get in and fix it.\" Truitt said Headington's affiliated firm won't allow Forest City onto their property to fix the wall damage without some \"unacceptable\" conditions attached, which includes using a crane over The Wilson Building and its residents. However, William \"Bill\" Brewer III, partner at Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors and lead counsel for Elm at StonePlace Holdings said, \"It is not surprising to our client that Forest City is making such claims, given that the demolition of the existing structure on our client's property revealed the faulty construction of the Wilson Annex. \"Our client continues to believe the lawsuit by Forest City lacks merit,\" Brewer addded. \"We welcome the opportunity to bring the facts of this case into full public view. This projects is widely supported in the community â€” and promises to contribute to the revitalization of the central business district.\" On Monday, the Headington affiliate, through Brewer Attorneys & Counselors, filed for a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying the Forest City affiliate had not named the proper defendant. The next day, the Forest City affiliate amended the original petition to include Elm at StonePlace Holdings LLC, which they contend is an entity owned and controlled by Headington Realty and Capital LLC. Along with amending the petition to include a new defendant, Forest City also asked for temporary emergency relief to stay development on the site after Headington filed for a building permit on July 31. The hearing for a temporary injunction is scheduled for Monday. \"I would be shocked if the motion to dismiss was granted since Forest City's lawyers corrected it within one business day, but the more serious request is the request for injunctive relief,\" Dallas appellate attorney Chad Ruback told the Dallas Business Journal . \"This could show us how the judge believes the case will ultimately be decided based on his predictions,\" he added. \"If he denies temporary relief then Headington or Elm at StonePlace will begin construction right away. But if the judge grants the request of temporary relief this development could be frozen in time and everything would need to stay as it is until it's resolved a year or more from now.\" The legal dispute between Forest City and Headington began in early July , after the affiliate of Headington Realty and Capital LLC demolished adjacent buildings to The Wilson Building, with plans to build a five-story retail building that would impact the livability of the homes within the historic building. The Wilson Building is a designated historic structure that was converted in 1999 into a 143-apartment loft-style building with the help of public TIF funds from the City of Dallas. The 12-story building, which was built in 1904, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In the original complaint, the Forest City affiliate said Headington's development plans for the proposed retail boutique only includes a five feet setback, which \"would block almost entirely the air, light and view available to a number of rental apartments in the Wilson Building,\" The four-story, 50,000-square-foot development of the new Forty Five Ten shop would cause permanent damage to the Wilson Building's profitability and diminish its market value, according to the lawsuit. Residents in about eight apartments in the Wilson Building would be completely blocked from views with the new building's facade five feet out of their windows. \"I'm befuddled by all this,\" said Truitt, who helps oversee Dallas development for Forest City. \"I've never filed a lawsuit to stop development and I'm shocked at how brazenly (Headington's affiliate) has turned its back on the residents of The Wilson Building.\" Along with the hearing on the temporary injunction scheduled for Monday, Aug. 31, Judge Hoffman has also scheduled a hearing for Sept. 14 on the original petition. \nGet Dallas Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T02:26:39.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
