What happened in recent days is a shock on financial markets which is natural,\" he added.\nChina's stock markets have fallen more than 30 percent since mid-year. Following a slew of poor economic data, Beijing devalued the yuan in a surprise move last week.\nCottarelli said the IMF would discuss in coming months with Chinese authorities their decision to weaken the currency.\nChina is eager for the yuan to join the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies. But the fund is considering extending the current SDR basket by nine months until September 30, 2016.\nTurning to Greece, which is heading to an early election in September, Cottarelli said the IMF would decide in two or three months whether to join the latest international rescue efforts.\nThe IMF deems Greece's debt unsustainable and has called for debt relief as a condition to participate in a third bailout.\n\"The debt sustainability assessment will take place after the launch of the programme (agreed with creditors) in two or three months. The IMF will then be able to evaluate whether to intervene,\" he said.
