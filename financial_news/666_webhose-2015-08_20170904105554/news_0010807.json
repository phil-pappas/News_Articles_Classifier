Two of the key lots were quickly passed in, John Russell's Ariadne from 1883, estimated between $600,000 and $800,000, and John Brack's Junior Latin American from 1969, estimated at $1 million to $1.4 million.\nBut while buyers were certainly selective – around a third of the 116 lots went unsold – they weren't shy when they found blue chip works they liked. Sidney Nolan's The Emu Hunt from 1949 was an obvious target – it had not been seen in Australia since Nolan gave it to a United States collector over 60 years ago. It made $1.16 million on an estimate of $600,000 to $800,000. All sale results include a buyer's premium of 22 per cent while estimates do not.\nThree phone bidders wrangled over Arthur Streeton's 1905 painting Unloading Bricks , Kew, which had been given an estimate of $30,000 to $40,000. It climbed to $90,000 and the hammer looked set to fall when a new bidder in the room leapt in. They were outbid and the work then sold for $122,000.\nBidding moved at a glacial pace for Charles Blackman's 1964 painting The Yellow Flower . It eventually went to a phone bidder for over double its upper estimate at $183,000.\nSidney Nolan's The Emu Hunt, painted in 1949, sold for $1,159,000. Things moved more quickly for Sydney Long's 1920 painting of flamingos, which went for $134,200 on an estimate of $40,000 to $50,000. It followed the sale of another flamingo painting at Shapiro's Sydney art sale last week, which fetched $33,600 including a 20 per cent buyer's premium, above its $24,000 upper estimate. But the exceptional Sotheby's result had a lot to do with the work itself. Long had included a female nude in the composition, and it served as a better example of his art nouveau style.\nArthur Boyd's Irrigation Lake, Wimmera went for $152,500 on an upper estimate of $90,000 and Rosalie Gascoigne's Tesserae 3 and Brett Whiteley's Bondi were among other works that sold above estimate. These results helped the sale bring in $5.29 million despite the underwhelming clearance rate. Sotheby's chairman Geoffrey Smith says the results reaffirm confidence in the market.\nJeffrey Smart's Morning Practice, Baia was expected to be one of the highlights. Smart had called it one of his best paintings, and it had been out of sight in a private collection overseas for 40 years. It sold for $671,000 right at the lower end of its $550,000 to $750,000 estimate. Another smaller Smart painting, Theme from 1959, was passed in.\nSydney dealer Denis Savill bought John Olsen's watercolour Spoonbill and Lilypond II for $36,600, also at the lower end of its estimate. He called loudly at the time \"It should have gone for more\" and auctioneer Martin Gallon conceded it was a good buy before swiftly moving on. The work had not been illustrated in the catalogue – the artist had refused copyright following a protracted legal stoush with Sotheby's over The Mother , which finally sold in April – and Savill said later he thought the decision to withhold copyright had impacted presale marketing and devalued a \"seriously good picture\".\n Arthur Streeton's Unloading Bricks, Kew sold for $122,000. Christian Thompson was the only artist in the catalogue born after 1970. The punt on a younger contemporary artist paid off this time, and the three works from Thompson's Black Gum series sold for $23,180 above an upper estimate of $18,000. It set an auction record for the artist but as records go, it's worth noting it was also the first time multiple Thompson works had been bundled into one lot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:08:57.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
