Why? Because credit card companies are more lenient these days about approving card applications from consumers with weaker credit. That's the opinion from TransUnion , the credit reporting giant based in Chicago. TransUnion reports that credit card approvals \"have increased to subprime borrowers\" in the second quarter of 2015. What's more, even with new approvals to consumers with lower credit scores, credit card delinquency rates \"remain low,\" at 1.19% for the quarter. One downer for subprime credit card holders -- the average new credit line for such borrowers has sunk below $1,000, to $923, TransUnion reports. That's the lowest level in three years. Overall, though, the news is good for credit card consumers with weaker credit , with their numbers rising from 11.1 million in the first quarter of 2014 to 13.1 million in the first quarter of 2015. That's out of 160 million U.S. credit card customers, the company states. \"Subprime consumers continue to gain access to credit, but lenders have scaled back the average new credit line for this group,\" notes Paul Siegfried, senior vice president and credit card business leader for TransUnion. \"Distribution of originations across risk tiers has remained relatively steady in the past year, indicating that lenders are deliberate and approaching subprime originations cautiously.\" If you're a subprime borrower in the market for a credit card, now is the time to strike, while the proverbial iron is hot. \"Subprime borrowers are great business for credit card companies,\" says Andi Wrenn, an accredited financial counselor who works with low-credit consumers. \"They are typically the people who use their credit cards, pay the minimum due, and the companies make great interest off their spending because they rarely pay their credit card in full.\" \"Who wouldn't want to earn 24.99% APR off these folks?\" Wrenn added. \"They are often living beyond their means, and just aren't able to keep up with their bills.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:48:51.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
