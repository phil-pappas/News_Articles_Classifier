The 2016 election season hosted its first debate Thursday night in Cleveland with 10 of the 17 declared candidates on one stage for the first time. \nThere was a lot said during this debate’s two hour runtime, much of which was relatively predictable. The candidates vowed to undo Barack Obama’s presidency, competed with each other to out-hate Hillary Clinton and promised to step aside in favor of a third term for Ronald Reagan. \nThat much most viewers could see coming, like a Democrat chewing red meat about inequality or the George W. Bush years. \nThe volume of candidates on one stage made it hard to tease out anything meaningful about individual policies. With ten voices competing for time, no one got a chance to talk about every issue, and on many subjects the candidates shared a broad (almost uniform) consensus.

Quite the contrary, in an often thoughtful and occasionally fiery series of exchanges each of these candidates vying to be POTUS managed to carve out a unique personality in the upcoming race. \nWith a caveat that there’s still a long (long, long, long) race ahead, and another that only Donald Trump got more than nine minutes of airtime, here are a few early takeaways about some of the candidates in this first Republican debate. \nConsensus \nWhen it comes to keeping dollars and making cents, the candidates all agreed to do three things almost immediately: defund Planned Parenthood, lower taxes and rescind the despised Obamacare . \nWhile outright war on Planned Parenthood has something of the feeling of a flavor of the week, Obamacare has been on the right wing radar since long before it even passed. Setting aside whether a president on January 21, 2017 could actually act to unwind such a vast piece of legislation, doing so would mean higher health care costs for the average American. \nLike the law or hate it, Obamacare both caps premiums and has successfully bent the curve on medical costs for years.
