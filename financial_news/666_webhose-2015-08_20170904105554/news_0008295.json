According to The Verge, the images were posted on the Nexus Indonesia Google+ community.\nIn May, the reports suggested that Google was working with partners Huawei and LG to produce two new Nexus phones, a 5.7-inch Huawei device and a 5.2-inch model with LG.\nThe Google’s new Nexus image shows the back of a white Nexus device. At the base is a sticker featuring a small red circle that appears to be LG’s logo, suggesting that the phone is the LG device.\nIt also features a bulging camera, laser focus and dual-LED flash.\nAt the top is a camera and underneath it is a similarly sized circle that looks to be the fingerprint scanner.\nThe image resembles renders of the supposed LG device leaked late last week with a rounded back and a camera.\nThere is no solid date set for either phone’s launch.\n 17, 2015 5:35 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:05:42.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
