Louie Douvis by Trevor Hoey While my portfolio is still underperforming the index, the gap is closing with the S&P/ASX 200 up by approximately 2 per cent compared with my nominal gain of about 0.4 per cent.\nSlater and Gordon continues to place considerable downward pressure on the portfolio representing a paper loss of about $12,000, having now shed nearly 50 per cent since its inclusion.\nHowever, the reporting season delivered some encouraging news. As indicated last week, global financial services provider, Henderson Group would be the only company releasing its results prior to this update.\nThe company delivered an impressive performance for the six months to June 30, 2015, that subsequently prompted a 10 per cent share price rerating.\nAs I anticipated, there was little affect on the business from volatility surrounding the Greek economy, and the significant outperformance was typical of management's record of exceeding expectations.\nFeatures of Henderson's result were strong increases in assets under management, outperformance of its funds against set benchmarks and a substantial increase in annualised net new money growth.\nThe group finished in a financially robust position with a capital surplus of £113 million ($239 million) and this prompted management to initiate a share buyback program with shares to the value of £25 million to be purchased by the end of 2015. This will have the effect of increasing earnings per share, making the group all the more attractive on a price-earnings basis.\nWith a strengthened balance sheet this initiative will also leave the company well positioned to make further acquisitions following on from the recent purchases of Perennial Fixed Interest and Perennial Growth Management.\n Record net inflows Chief executive, Andrew Formica, said: \"We are very pleased to have delivered another six months of record net inflows built on consistently strong investment performance for our clients, which highlights the strength of our active approach.\"\nNet inflows for the period increased from £5 billion to £5.6 billion representing growth of more than 10 per cent compared with the previous corresponding period. Assets under management were up by similar a amount, totalling £82.1 billion.\nFormica highlighted that the group had continued its strategy of attracting inflows from an increasingly global client base and the acquisitions were in keeping with this goal as they substantially boosted Henderson's presence in Australia.\nIn terms of outlook, Formica sees Henderson as well positioned with strong sales momentum, increased brand recognition, investment outperformance and a disciplined approach to new investment initiatives. He believes this will see the company outperform the market and lay the foundation for future growth.\nAnalysts at Citi were impressed with the result, upgrading earnings per share forecasts between fiscal years 2015 and 2017 inclusive by 8 per cent, 2.4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.\nThe broker also retained its \"buy\" recommendation while increasing the 12-month share price target from $6.10 to $6.55. Macquarie is slightly more bullish with its price target of $6.90 and it has an outperform recommendation on the stock.\nThe broker sees the £25 million buyback as immaterial in isolation, but a clear signal that management will return excess capital to shareholders while still maintaining a preference to reinvest through acquisitions and organic opportunities.\nOutperformance through the cycle Macquarie summed up its take on the stock saying: \"This result highlights why Henderson is our number one Australian listed fund manager.\" The broker underlined on a risk return basis Henderson's diversification and operating performance has it well placed to outperform through the cycle.\nThe company is now vying for top place in my portfolio with both it and diversified retailer Premier Investments up approximately 30 per cent on their entry prices as at January 30. Better than expected retail sales figures released this week bode well for Premier Investments.\nAt the other end of the scale, both Slater and Gordon and Greencross continue to underperform with little hope of a recovery for the former unless it can settle uncertainties regarding accounting procedures and other anomalies.\nHowever, I'm hoping it's a different story for Greencross, the only company in my portfolio to deliver its results in the next week. The company will release its full-year result on Tuesday, August 11.\nManagement lowered its earnings per share guidance from 36¢ to a mid-range of 34.2¢ in May and since then the group's share price has collapsed, falling from approximately $7.00 to hit a 12-month low of $4.95 before staging a slight recovery in recent weeks.\nHowever, a good deal of the damage had been done in the three months leading up to the downgrade in guidance, as its shares traded as high as $9.90 in late February. This indicates there is a large degree of negative sentiment towards the stock with a mix of profit-taking and possible concerns regarding an overzealous approach to acquisitions, prompting the initial sell down.\nConsequently, management's main task in delivering next week's result will be restoring credibility. Firstly, it needs to meet revised forecasts, but arguably of more importance is that it can demonstrate from an operational perspective that Greencross is poised for a return to the consistent performances that were instrumental in driving a 10-fold share price increase between 2011 and 2014.\nI believe there is a good chance management will have to examine some of its asset values, potentially resulting in non-cash write-downs. If this unfolds it could draw an unfavourable reaction, but investors need to ask whether developments such as these are already factored into the depressed share price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:57:34.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
