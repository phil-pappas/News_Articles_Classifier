Over 90 percent of employed Dubai residents reported they have medical insurance, while all respondents that drive confirmed they have motor insurance - no surprise as they are mandated by the government. \nThe survey also revealed that some of the other insurance policies with low penetration levels among employed Dubai residents were travel insurance (36 percent), personal accident insurance (40 percent) and life insurance (45 percent). \nCommenting on these results, David Harris, RSA's sales & marketing director, said: \"While it is not surprising to see that the uptake of home content insurance remains low in Dubai, it is alarming that it is used the least compared to other types of insurance with only 3 out of 10 saying they have applied for it. \n\"These penetration levels are far lower than more mature markets in the West and can be attributed to the prevailing perception among a majority of residents that home and content insurance is not necessary or that it is not worth the expense. \n\"Furthermore, we have seen that people are often only likely to consider this type of insurance once the damage has already been done.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:49:32.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
