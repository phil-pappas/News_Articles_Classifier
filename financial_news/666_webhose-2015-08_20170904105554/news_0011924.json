The company has a vast network that supplies cooking gas to 1 million customers, mostly in rural areas, and 134 auto LPG outlets.\nRIL, the largest single location LPG producer in the country, had contested the ministry view saying rules do not mandate that all domestic LPG must be sold only to state firms.\nAlso, it was selling domestic LPG in parallel market because state oil marketing firms were not willing to pay market rates.\nRIL’s subsidiary LPG Infrastructure India Ltd (LIIL) is undertaking parallel marketing of LPG and has substantial customers. It told the ministry that the move to prohibit the company from marketing gas would deprive its rural customers of the fuel. Its customers are mostly in rural areas of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.\nFollowing this, the Ministry on August 5, 2014 permitted RIL to sell up to 10,000 tonnes per month of LPG to parallel marketers till March 31, 2015. This has now been further extended till March next year.\n“Since the earlier notification… dated August 6, 2014 was expired on March 31, 2015, this notification is being issued with effect from April 1, 2015 to give continuity to the notification dated the August 6, 2014. No one is adversely affected by giving retrospective effect to this notification,” the ministry order said.\n 31, 2015 9:29 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:07:20.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
