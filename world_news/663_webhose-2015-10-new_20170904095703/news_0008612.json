Cramer advises investors to buy some shares before they report 'but then you buy big after.' He notes that GE is getting out of its financing business and explains that, 'they're still going to be financing some of the big projects that they are involved in...but not just out there doing lending in shadow market lending so to speak that the government didn't like.' Cramer says 'this is an opportunity to recognize that if the stock sells off that Nelson Peltz is in there pushing for a much larger buyback, a 40 percent buyback, once the company is no longer an important let's just say regulated entity for the Fed and that is going to be terrific for GE shareholders.' Analysts are expecting GE to post earnings of $0.26 a share on revenue of $28.98 billion for the quarter. -- Get Cramer's top stocks with Action Alerts PLUS Trade with him FREE for 14-days.
