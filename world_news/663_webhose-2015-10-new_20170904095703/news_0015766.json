The pictures were beamed back by the space agency's New Horizons spacecraft, which is currently some 3.1 billion miles from Earth.\nThe spacecraft discovered Pluto's blue sky during its historic flyby of the icy dwarf planet in July. \nThe probe also detected small, exposed regions of water ice on the planet\nScientists say the particles in the atmospheric haze are actually red and grey, but they scatter a blue light. \nThe haze, comparable to that of Saturn's moon Titan, is likely caused by reactions of nitrogen and methane which create the soot-like particles.\n1 / 4 Gallery: Sept: Stunning New Images Of Pluto\nNASA has released new photos of Pluto taken by the New Horizon spacecraft. This image, taken near sunset, shows rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains. Scientist Alan Stern said said the photo was a \"scientific bonanza, revealing new details about Pluto's atmosphere, mountains, glaciers and plains.\" The icy plain known informally as Sputnik Planum can be seen on the right, while the mountains to the left rise up to around 11,000 ft (3,500m).

It's gorgeous,\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute in Colorado.\n:: Pluto: Five Facts About The (Little) Planet \nNew Horizons also detected small, exposed regions of water ice on Pluto.\nThe discovery was made from data collected by the Ralph spectral composition mapper on New Horizons.\n\"Large expanses of Pluto don't show exposed water ice because it's apparently masked by other, more volatile ices across most of the planet,\" said science team member Jason Cook.\n1 / 7 Gallery: Sept: Seeing Double - New Pics Of Pluto\nNASA released new images on 12 September of the dwarf planet Pluto taken by the New Horizons spacecraft\n\"Understanding why water appears exactly where it does, and not in other places, is a challenge that we are digging into.\"\nNew Horizons' next target, subject to approval by NASA, will be a much smaller object one billion miles beyond Pluto.\nIt also lies in the so-called Kuiper Belt, a frigid twilight zone on the outskirts of the solar system.\nFollowing a set of manoeuvres, New Horizons should reach PT1 - short for Potential Target 1 - in 2019.\nThe pictures comes around a month after NASA released photos of mountains and possible dunes on Pluto.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:13:33.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
