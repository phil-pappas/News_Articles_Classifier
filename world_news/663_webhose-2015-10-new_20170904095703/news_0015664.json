And they’re not wholly unwarranted.”\nOverall 14.4% of hotdogs in the research contained “problematic ingredients”.\nPA Science: Clear Food used special techniques to identify ingredients\nHotdogs are usually processed in factories where meat trimmings, spices, and other ingredients are chopped and blended into an emulsification and routed to automatic stuffers.\nThe stuffers pump the emulsified hot dog mixture into casings before they are cooked in a smokehouse, cooled by being passed under a water shower and packaged.\nIf animal parts such as livers, kidneys and hearts are among the ingredients the label should state “with variety meats” and the particular ingredient should be listed on the package.\nHot Dog\nA hotdog history The modern hot dog – or Frankfurter – can be traced back more than 500 years.\nIn 1987, the German city of Frankfurt celebrated the 500th anniversary of the boiled sausage of smoked pork encased in mutton intestine.\nThe sausages were given to local people to mark coronations, starting in 1564 with Maximilian II as Holy Roman Emperor.\nGerman migrants introduced them to the US and by the 1890s the hot dog had become an American favourite.\nPoll loading …\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MartinBagot", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:44:33.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
