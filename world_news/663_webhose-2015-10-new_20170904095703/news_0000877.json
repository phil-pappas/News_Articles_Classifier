Since the announcement of its Demos on Demand series, Concept Searching has received positive feedback from viewers, particularly for the flexibility of access the sessions offer.\nconceptTaxonomyManager , the topic of this latest Demo On Demand, is a component integral to all Concept Searching product platforms. Designed for subject matter experts, conceptTaxonomyManager can be rapidly deployed and managed with minimal training. The component is still unique in the industry, with several interactive features to enable the building and tuning of one or more taxonomies.\nThe combination of semantic metadata generation and auto-classification allows organizations to build highly accurate taxonomies. The categorization of taxonomies with the same or similar concepts can be provided to any search engine index to enable concept based searching and faceted search using the taxonomy hierarchy.\nconceptTaxonomyManager enables unstructured content to be grouped, based on an understanding of concepts and ideas that share mutual attributes, while separating dissimilar concepts. This approach is instrumental in delivering relevant information via a taxonomy structure, and uses semantic metadata in enterprise search to reduce time spent finding information. This increases the relevancy and accuracy of the search results, and enables the reuse and repurposing of content.\nUsing one or more taxonomies, unstructured content can be leveraged to improve any application that uses metadata. This adaptability extends to search, records management, information security, intelligent migration, text analytics, and collaboration.\nConcept Searching will continue to release new Demos On Demand, focusing on SharePoint, Office 365, Google Search Appliance, and heterogeneous environments. All the Demos On Demand in the series can be found on Concept Searching’s Product and Webcast Series website page.\nAbout Concept Searching\nConcept Searching is the industry leader specializing in semantic metadata generation, auto-classification, and taxonomy management.
