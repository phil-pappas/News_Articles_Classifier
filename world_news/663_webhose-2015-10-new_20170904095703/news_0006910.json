This detailed analysis detected signatures for purifying selection on regulatory elements as well as coding regions. \nToMMo also catalogued structural variants, including 3.4 million insertions and deletions, and 25,923 genic copy-number variants. The 1KJPN was effective for imputing genotypes of the Japanese population genome wide. \nThe data demonstrates the value of high-coverage sequencing for constructing population-specific variant panels, which covers 99.0% SNVs of minor allele frequency ≥0.1%, and its value for identifying causal rare variants of complex human disease phenotypes in genetic association studies. \nThis research has produced a basic analysis tool for the large-scale identification and study of the genes related to the physical constitution and diseases that are peculiar to the Japanese. It has so far yielded important results that can accelerate the research of personalized healthcare and medicine. \nThe results of this research were released in the online version of Nature Communications on August 21, 2015. \nBackground \nTohoku University Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (known as ToMMo) has been working in cooperation with Iwate Medical University on the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project. It is part of the universities' contribution towards reconstruction of the region, following the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. \nSince 2013, the two universities have been conducting cohort studies, which include some150,000 community residents in Miyagi and Iwate prefectures. \nProvided by: Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization 6 shares Contribution of coding variants to psoriasis much smaller than thought November 10, 2013 \nCoding variants in immune disease-related genes play only a small part in the overall genetic risk for psoriasis, according to a new study led by Anhui Medical University and BGI.
