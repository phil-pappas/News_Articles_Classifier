(AP) â€” Expedia's online travel sites are introducing tools designed to show the true cost of flying.\nThe features announced Tuesday will list the fees for checking bags and cancelling a reservation in addition to the ticket fare. Those fees typically remain hidden until a traveler is ready to buy a ticket.\nExpedia is hoping the additional transparency will help its sites, which also include Travelocity , Orbitz and Hotwire, to stand out from rivals like Priceline.com's Kayak and Google's extensive index of flight information.\nAdded airline fees have been a sore spot for travelers since American Airlines began charging to check bags seven years ago, but they are here to stay.\nBaggage and cancellation fees generated $6.5 billion in revenue for airlines last year.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:47:06.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
