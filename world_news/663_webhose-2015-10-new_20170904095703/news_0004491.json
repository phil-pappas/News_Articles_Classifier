Unusual Star Raises Talk of Aliens: A star spotted by the Kepler telescope is emitting a light pattern that seems to defy conventional scientific explanation. In fact, it looks \"like something you would expect an alien civilization to build,\" says one astronomer. The smart money's on something more mundane, of course, but SETI is working on a plan to take a closer look. Secret to Longevity May Be Deleting Certain Genes : After a decade of work, scientists have isolated 238 genes linked to aging in yeast cells. When any one isn't present, the yeast's life span goes up—in one case by 60%. The implication for us? \"Almost half of the genes we found that affect aging are conserved in mammals,\" says the lead author.
