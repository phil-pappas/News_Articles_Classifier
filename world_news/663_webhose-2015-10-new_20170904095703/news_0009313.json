The company claims it is the world's slimmest tablet; it is certainly the slimmest tablet with a 9.7-inch screen I have set my eyes on.\n\nThe tablet comes with a matte-finish plastic back. The right edge has the power and volume buttons and the slots for the SIM card and the microSD card. The speakers, microUSB port and headphones port are at the bottom.\n\nThe 4:3 aspect ratio makes it ideal for tasks such as reading. Not to mention that the Super AMOLED screen is brilliant. The hardware's good for gaming. While I'm no fan of Samsung's TouchWiz UI, the multi-window mode was a great help, especially when used with the Microsoft apps.\n\nIts eight-megapixel (MP) primary camera does a good job outdoors and in low-lit areas, it shows some noise. The 2.1MP front camera also clicks decent selfies. The fingerprint scanner is a marked improvement: Just press the home button with the designated finger, and it unlocks.\n\nHowever, its weakest point is the sound. The speakers sound tinny .Also, the battery life is short.\n\nAt Rs 39,400, the tab is a good choice if you want a multi-purpose Android tablet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:26:38.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
