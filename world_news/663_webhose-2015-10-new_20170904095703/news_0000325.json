While there's no silver bullet that will make you completely safe from hackers, there are some precautions you can take to help keep sensitive information private. How to protect your data in the cloud (CNN) - \nAuthorities have arrested a Malaysia-based hacker who they accuse of stealing personal information of U.S. military members and giving it to ISIS. Related Content US intel officials warn hacking is getting worse \nArdit Ferizi, a Kosovo citizen, was detained in Malaysia on a provisional U.S. arrest warrant alleging he provided material support to ISIS and committed computer hacking and identity theft, the U.S. Justice Department said. \nAccording to a criminal complaint, Ferizi hacked into the computer system of a company in the United States and stole personally identifiable information of more than 1,000 U.S. service members and federal employees. Then, he allegedly gave that information to several ISIS figures, including a prominent propagandist for the group, the complaint says. \nU.S. Assistant Attorney General John Carlin called the case against Ferizi -- which combines cybercrime and terror charges as U.S. authorities aim to step up their crackdown on ISIS -- \"a first of its kind.\" \n\"This arrest demonstrates our resolve to confront and disrupt ISIL's efforts to target Americans, in whatever form and wherever they occur,\" Carlin said in a statement. \nTies to prominent propagandist \nThe military members' data, including home addresses and photos, was scraped from publicly available websites and passed on to Junaid Hussein, a British hacker who was active on social media recruiting Westerners to join ISIS, authorities said. \nThe U.S. military announced in August that it had killed Hussein in an airstrike in Syria. \nHe was a leading member of ISIS' so-called CyberCaliphate, which has carried out mostly nuisance hacks on military and other government websites in the United States, France and other countries. \nMalaysia to extradite suspect \nMalaysia's state-run Bernama news agency reported that the 20-year-old alleged hacker had entered the country in August to pursue computer science and computer forensics studies. \nHis arrest was a result of close cooperation between Malaysian authorities and the FBI, Malaysian Police Inspector-General Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said, according to Bernama. \nMalaysian authorities agreed to extradite Ferizi to the United States, where he is expected to face U.S. cybercrime charges. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
