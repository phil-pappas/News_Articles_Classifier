Drawing on real-time data from the building systems, The Beacon expresses, in real time, how the building uses fresh air and sunlight to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and to create a comfortable and healthy work environment. It also shows how the building is recycling water and how much of The Tower’s waste is being diverted from landfill. \nTo encourage the public’s engagement with The Beacon, ESI Design created a website ( http://pncbeacon.com ) accessible on any digital device, including tablets located in The Tower lobby. Visitors to the site can explore the meaning behind The Beacon’s light and sound displays, as well as more about the building’s state-of-the-art technology and design. \nAccording to Gideon D’Arcangelo, VP of Creative Strategy for ESI Design, The Beacon sets a new model for how green buildings can engage and educate the public about sustainable design, green technologies, and the role that tenants and visitors can play in water and energy conservation, recycling, composting, and more. \n“Our goal in designing The Beacon for The Tower at PNC Plaza was to transform the way people experience the building—and communicate the many invisible things the building is doing, behind the scenes, to maximize resources,” said D’Arcangelo. “The Beacon is a dynamic, data-driven media installation that is intriguing and beautiful to look at and hear. It also rewards the curious, by explaining itself and encouraging people to dig deeper to learn how the building works and how it is performing at any given moment.” \nFor The Beacon at The Tower at PNC Plaza project, ESI Design deployed the same design philosophy the ESI Design team uses in producing engaging experiences for retailers, cultural institutions, museums and other public spaces under the leadership of interactive pioneer Ed Schlossberg. ESI drew upon the team’s experience design expertise in a variety of specialized disciplines, including interactive, visual, and website design. \nKey members of the project team for The Tower at PNC Plaza include Pittsburgh-based PJ Dick, Inc.; global design firm Gensler; UK-based engineering firm Buro Happold; and Seattle-based environmental consultant Paladino & Company. \nA fact sheet and media resources regarding The Beacon are available upon request. \nFor more information about The Beacon and ESI Design, please contact Jenny Chang at jenny@pkpr.com or 212.627.8098. \nFor more information about The Tower at PNC Plaza, please contact Emily Krull at emily.krull@pnc.com or 412-762-5654. \nAbout ESI Design \nESI Design has been a pioneer in experience design and audience engagement since its founding by Edwin Schlossberg in 1977.
