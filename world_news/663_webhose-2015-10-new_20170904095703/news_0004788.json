Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason ﻿ Netflix and the art of burying bad news Optus signs new Netflix deal for Christmas shopping season Netflix is betting on breaking through the 70 million paid subscriber mark by the end of 2015 as the US-based streaming giant plans to tap markets next year for more cash to fund content and international expansion.\nIn the third quarter, Netflix reported it had 66 million paid subscribers, up from 62.71 in the third quarter, and forecast to hit 70.4 by the end of 2015 – however the US streaming giant missed growth expectations domestically.\nNetflix missed analyst expectations for domestic subscriber growth with 880,000 paid users added in the quarter, analysts had predicted 1.2 million, to 43.2 million. The company forecast to grow US paying subscribers by 1.6 million in the final quarter of 2015 to 44.8 million.\nNetflix chief executive Reed Hastings. Supplied \"Our over-forecast in the US for Q3 was due to slightly higher-than-expected involuntary churn (inability to collect), which we believe was driven in part by the ongoing transition to chip-based credit and debit cards. In terms of US net additions, through the first nine months of 2015, we are slightly ahead of prior year, and we expect to finish 2015 at about 2014 levels. This would mark the fourth consecutive year we've added about 6 million members in the US,\" Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said in the company's statement to shareholders.\nThe California-based streaming company grew its paying international subscriber base by 2.7 million to 26 million in the third quarter, beating expectations, and forecast to grow to 29.5 million by year's end. Netflix does not break out subscriber figures by country.\nThe international arm of the business, which has long been loss-making, is planned to break-even through 2016 and deliver profits after that, Mr Hastings said, following launches in Spain, Italy and Portugal next week, as well as South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore in early 2016.\nNetflix launched in Australia and New Zealand earlier in 2015.\n More to come", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:25:27.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
