By Erin Harris , editor-in-chief, Innovative Retail Technologies \nNovember 2015 Innovative Retail Technologies \nYou can’t talk about innovative retail technologies without discussing digitization. Much has been written about retail’s digital transformation and what it means for the retailers who embrace it, or worse, the retailers who don’t.

You’ve long been moving back office processes away from pen and paper. The question is, who’s in control?

Digital transformation is not a megatrend to be feared, but rather a strategy to be defined. And that strategy should be omni-channel focused. Register Today.
