The end-to-end solution – part of Genpact's Systems of Engagement ™ portfolio that integrates a layer of technology on top of clients' existing systems to transform operational processing – features advanced capture technology, workflow for exception and alerts, mapping and matching algorithms, and comprehensive audit trails.\nTrade promotions contribute up to 20 percent of a CPG company's revenue, yet managing these activities often causes friction between manufacturers and retailers. Inefficient, manual processes can impede accounts receivable operations, delay payments, and hinder available credit. Lack of transparency and disparate procedures can leave manufacturers and retailers alike questioning whether their trade promotions investments are allocated fairly and spent effectively. Digital technology can significantly alter the way these processes run; however, complex legacy processes and systems across manufacturer and retailer often makes deployment difficult and possibly ineffective.\nGenpact's Lean Digital approach drives impact by architecting how enterprises run from front- to back-end, aligning digital interventions to measurable business outcomes and navigating the complexity of legacy processes and technologies. Its TPP solution reduces invoice processing cycle time, standardizes procedures across all users, increases productivity, and improves compliance and control.\nGenpact is helping a global CPG market leader automate its promotional invoice processing and payment operations by deploying TPP. Results include plugging revenue leakage by matching 100 percent of the retailer deductions, ensuring faster turnaround time for processing, and bringing the complete operation under audit control.\nGenpact's TPP is the latest addition to its family of trade promotion management offerings which connect all relevant components across front and back office, making trade promotion operations more intelligent, able to execute faster and more accurately, as well as adapt over time. The combined benefits help enhance marketing return on investment as a whole.\n\"Our deep F&A and CPG domain experience, combined with Genpact's Lean Digital approach and SEP methodology, helps companies dramatically transform trade promotion operations,\" said Sanjay Srivastava , senior vice president and chief digital officer. \"Our new cloud-based TPP solution can scale quickly and easily to harness the power of automation across the enterprise irrespective of legacy processes and systems, which significantly increases productivity and improves the bottom line.\"\nFor more information, see http://www.genpact.com/home/industries/consumer-goods/trade-promotions and http://www.genpact.com/leandigital .\nAbout Genpact\nGenpact (NYSE: G) stands for \" generating business impact .\" We architect the Lean Digital SM enterprise through a unique approach based on our patented Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP SM ) framework that reimagines our clients' middle and back offices to generate growth, cost efficiency, and business agility.
