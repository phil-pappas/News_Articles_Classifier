Founded by the “father of sports sponsorship,” Horst Dassler, arena’s development of cutting-edge men’s, women’s and children’s swimwear has, for more than forty years, been propelled by what the company calls a deep and enduring “water instinct.” Dassler, a scion of the Adidas dynasty, was inspired by swimmers’ performance at the 1972 Munich games to research materials and designs to improve the performance of aquatic athletes.\nToday, the brand has a broader audience. arena creates collections for swimmers, triathletes, and all water-sports lovers in a range of markets all built on that same elemental connection to water. arena ’s innovation-driven internationalization has translated into record revenues.\nAs General Manager for Brand Development, Giuseppe Musciacchio, explains, “Our destiny is to continue to grow, and this global success has accelerated our need for a fully integrated process and technology.”\n“The need for such integration is why we felt it was the time to kick off a new strategic project,” Musciacchio continues, talking about arena’s decision to work with Centric Software. “Our absolute priority is now to use PLM to refine our core line planning , budgeting, and collection development . Centric 8 will also allow our product teams to better assess the market performance of individual products. And our management will be able to make better decisions as a result.”\nPerformance in and out of the water remains critical to arena, with the brand citing its work with universities and research institutes as being instrumental to continued success. arena’s experimentation with hydrodynamic technologies and new materials has resulted in numerous innovations, such as the Powerskin racing swimwear series, the Cobra Ultra goggles, and the “Freestyle Breather,” a revolutionary system to used to develop improved breathing technique for freestyle swimming.\nThat thirst for invention, Musciacchio believes, is one that Centric Software shares. “Everyone in the market knows of Centric,” he says, “and we were impressed by their forward-thinking mobile portfolio and clear, visible attitude to rapid innovation.”\nIn selecting a PLM provider, arena sought the right mix of vision, technology, expertise, and user experience that would together secure a partnership for the next decade.\n“Our users recognize the potential of PLM and are excited by the way that Centric 8 will streamline complex processes,” Musciacchio explains. “It was the users’ recognition of Centric as the best on market that influenced our decision. We have high expectations because we know that we are doing something that will truly change the life of our company.”\nSpeaking about arena’s decision to adopt Centric 8 PLM, Centric Software CEO Chris Groves says, “We are excited to work with arena, a partner that understands that PLM’s reach adds both an immediate operating advantage and a long-term strategic benefit.”\n“Critical to any brand’s identity and on-going evolution is what arena refers to as ‘being in your element,’” Groves continues. “Whether it’s creating products that help athletes and families swim faster or designing technologies to create better products, innovation without compromise is essential. Innovation is a common element that we share with arena. I’m thrilled to be able to support the future of their decades-long appreciation for the water and for what people can achieve both in and out of it.”\narena Italia S.p.A ( http://www.arenawaterinstinct.com )\nSince 1973, arena has created and marketed waterwear products for competitive swimmers and swimming fans worldwide, and is universally recognized as one of the premium brands of high quality swimwear and equipment.
