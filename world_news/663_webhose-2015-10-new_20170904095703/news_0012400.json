EZchip shares rose 14% to $25.02 in recent premarket trading. Mellanox fell 29 cents to $39.50.\nThe companies said the deal implies a transaction value of about $811 million, or $620 million net of cash. Company-provided deal values sometimes include debt. Representatives for the companies weren't immediately available to comment.\nMellanox provides interconnect products for data centers--essentially pipes that connect servers and other hardware to each other. The company said the acquisition is part of its strategy to become a leading data-center supplier. Yokneam, Israel-based EZchip makes chips for networking equipment for carrier, cloud and data-center networks.\nThe combined businesses currently have roughly 2,400 employees, and generated combined revenue of $668 million for year ended June 30.\nMellanox projects that the transaction will start boosting its earnings immediately after the deal closes, expected in the first quarter of next year.\nThe boards of both companies approved the deal, which requires regulatory approvals as well as the approval of EZchip shareholders.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nSeptember 30, 2015 08:56 ET (12:56 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:46:47.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
