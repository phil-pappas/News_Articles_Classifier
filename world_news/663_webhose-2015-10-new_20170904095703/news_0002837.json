The butchered body of the British lawyer was found in his Carnbee home, while his wife was found in their yard with her throat slit. The bodies were apparently first discovered by their gardener.\nThere have been no arrests in the apparent home invasion. Acting Senior Police Superintendent Joanne Archie said Wednesday that investigators are \"following every possible lead\" in Tobago, the smaller and less developed of the two islands that make up the twin-island Caribbean nation off the coast of Venezuela.\nIt's the latest unsolved attack by a machete-wielding assailant in tourist-dependent Tobago. A German couple in their 70s were found fatally hacked on a beach last year near their vacation home on Tobago's southern coast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:14:30.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
