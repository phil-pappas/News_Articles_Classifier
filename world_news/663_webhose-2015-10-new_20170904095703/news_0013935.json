Tours of the $1.1 billion West Closure Complex in Plaquemines Parish will be conducted by the West Bank levee authority to educate residents about the area's hurricane protection system in advance of a tax election in November.\nOn Nov. 21, West Jefferson residents will be asked to consider a 5.5-mill tax increase that would raise an additional $5 million a year. Algiers voters will be asked to renew a 6.35-mill tax for 30 years that brings in $1.2 million annually.\nThe Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-West has said the taxes are needed to pay for maintenance of nearly 80 miles of levees, floodgates and floodwalls, the mammoth pump station and work required to maintain federal certification.\nThe tours begin Thursday at 10 a.m. and on Saturday, at 9 a.m. The West Closure Complex is located at 500 East Bayou Road in Belle Chasse.\nVisitors will get a close up look at the massive facility as it is put through an exercise. The 11 pumps, driven by 5,400-horsepower engines, are capable of filling an Olympic-sized swimming pool in 5 seconds.\nThe 50-acre site -- equivalent to two football fields -- also boasts the largest sector gate in North America. The 225-barrier, which takes 15 minutes to close, is designed to block storm surge from pushing up the Harvey and Algiers canals and flooding thousands of West Bank homes and businesses.", "external_links": ["http://slfpaw.org/"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:55:28.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
