'You won't even know about it' \nAnd Apple doesn't necessarily notify you if someone downloads your backup file: \"You won't even know about it.\" \nHe added that Apple started sending out notifications shortly after the celebrity hacks, but stopped at some point. Vladimir Katalov is CEO of Elcomsoft Ltd., a company that makes digital forensics software for customers like U.S. intelligence agencies. He spoke at the SecTor IT security conference in Toronto last week. (Emily Chung/CBC) \nThe good news is that you can disable iCloud backups completely, making them impossible for anyone to download, Katalov says. \nMeanwhile, the amount of information from your Google account — from both mobile devices and desktop use — is vast as well, from your photos to your browsing history and your profile for targeted ads to your chats in Google Hangouts. \nAnd it's not necessarily as easy to figure out exactly what or how much there is. \nKatalov said you can get most of it by using Google's Takeout service , which allows users to export and download all their data from most Google services. But that's not complete. \nGoogle usually sends notifications if someone logs into your account from a new device or location, alerting you that someone may have your password. But it's possible for hackers to use developer tools to access some information in your account without detection, such as your Hangouts conversations and your location history. \nUnder some circumstances, it may be possible for hackers to get into your Apple and Google accounts without your password — they can instead use malware to steal a small file on your device called an authentication key that will let them into your account until you change your password. In that case, Katalov said, you will never get any notification that someone has accessed your account. \nWhile both Apple and Google encrypt your stored passwords, they store the encryption keys with the data so it's not hard for someone to decrypt the data, Katalov said. Apple does have one additional level of security: extra encryption tied to the identity of your device. \n\"So even if you restore them from iCloud backup to new device, your passwords are not being restored because your hardware is different,\" Katalov said. \"So losing your Apple ID and password is much less risky even if the iCloud backups are there.\" Tips to reduce your risk \nThere are steps you can take to minimize your risk of your accounts getting compromised. Katalov recommends that you: Use a strong password and change it regularly. Pay attention to notification emails about logins to your account. Use two-factor authentication . \nUltimately, though, Katalov warns, even if you're careful, you can never expect your information to be completely secure. \n\"Basically, you can forget about privacy if you're using a smartphone or any device. If you're using the cloud, that means the government has for sure access to that information with our without your knowledge,\" he said. \nHe added that most of the time, users have no way of knowing how their information is stored, whether or how it's encrypted, and who can access it. In many cases, companies like Apple use servers from other companies such Microsoft and Amazon. \n\"If you're using the internet,\" Katalov said, \"at least some of your information will be leaked somewhere.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:44:51.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
