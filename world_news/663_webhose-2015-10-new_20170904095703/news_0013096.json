(HLI), the genomics-based, technology-driven company working to revolutionize the practice of medicine, announced today the launch of the company's first Health Nucleus, a genomic powered clinical research project that has the potential to transform healthcare. The inaugural Health Nucleus is located in San Diego, CA , at HLI's headquarters facility. More Health Nucleus facilities are slated to open in 2016 in other US and International cities. \nThe Health Nucleus platform uses whole genome sequence analysis, advanced clinical imaging and innovative machine learning – combined with a comprehensive curation of personal health history – to deliver the most complete picture of individual health. \nThe Health Nucleus provides a novel approach devoted to exploring, quantifying and beginning to understand as much as possible about individual health and disease risk. Supported by the world's largest genome sequencing center and the leading experts in translating genomics data into clinically relevant information, this platform embodies HLI's philosophies and ideas on how individuals can better understand their health. It is the first center to combine genomics with a complete array of other clinical and biological measures, including: Whole human genome sequencing, spanning all 6 billion base pairs of DNA (most DNA tests examine less than 2% of the full genetic code); Microbiome sequencing which quantifies the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live inside and on the human body (it is estimated that there are 10 times more microbial cells than human cells in our bodies); Metabolome characterization which enables us to measure the unique chemical fingerprints that cellular processes leave behind; A comprehensive body MRI scan to screen for any abnormalities and provide a baseline for the future; Customized laboratory tests and screenings. \nAn experienced team of clinicians, geneticists and bioinformaticians curate these data and produce an integrated report that can inform clients' care. The Health Nucleus team will work hand-in-hand with the individual and their physician. As future risk associations are validated in the HLI database, a web-based portal will be updated with this curated information. The Health Nucleus clinical team is led by Medical Director Pamila Brar , MD, Clinical Geneticist Eric Dec, MD, and Functional Medicine Physician Helen Messier, Ph.D., MD. \n\"The Health Nucleus is our opportunity to lead the way to genomic health, enabling individuals and their physicians to pivot towards a more proactive, preventative and predictive healthcare future,\" said J. Craig Venter , Ph.D., Co-founder and CEO, HLI. \"When I sequenced the first human genome in 2000, I saw the potential for a genomics-driven approach to healthcare, as I uncovered personal health-related insights I would have never otherwise known. The Health Nucleus is a critical step to realizing that potential and providing that kind of insight to individuals worldwide.\" \n\"When individuals sign up with the Health Nucleus, they're enrolling in a year of health insight and analysis,\" said HLI's Chief Medical Officer, Brad Perkins , MD. \"HLI is combining an advanced series of screens in partnership with primary care physicians, paired with a visit to our Health Nucleus facility, to generate a comprehensive look at personal data that will inform and impact care in new ways.\" \nThe Health Nucleus uses the latest technologies from the following companies: General Electric (GE), makers of the whole body MRI and other technologies ProKinetics for gait assessment 3DMD for whole body digital assessment ResMed to monitor sleep iRhythm to monitor heart InBody to monitor body composition \nHuman Longevity, Inc. (HLI) was founded to enhance the healthy, high-performance lifespan. HLI is building the world's largest, most comprehensive database of whole genome, phenotype and clinical data. From there, HLI's team develops and applies large scale computing and machine learning to make novel discoveries to benefit both Health Nucleus guests, and pharmaceutical companies, insurers and healthcare providers worldwide. This combined power in HLI provides the underpinning for the Health Nucleus reports. \nThe Health Nucleus is operating under an IRB approved protocol.
