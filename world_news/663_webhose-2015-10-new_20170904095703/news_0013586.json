He and his family looked after it at home. \nCharlie \"roamed freely around the house. He spoke so well that it felt like he was taking part in our conversations. Everybody loved him.\" \nBut a few days before Tripoli was taken over by the revolutionaries, \"a missile fell right next to the house. The explosion blew the windows open, and he flew away.\" \n- 'Most terrifying day' - \nKaal says he had never been as scared as one night returning to Tripoli from the border. \nAt a pro-Kadhafi checkpoint that was regularly targeted by revolutionaries in the coastal town of Zawiya, militiamen \"told us to drive with our lights off so we didn't become targets\". \n\"A trip from Djerba to Tripoli that usually doesn't take more than four hours took us 14,\" he says. \"It was the longest, the most tiring and the most terrifying day.\" \n\"It was only when we got back to Janzur\" on the outskirts of Tripoli \"that we looked at each other and burst out laughing.\" \nToday -- with Libya divided between rival governments and still plagued by violence -- the clinic's rooms are run down and the cages that housed the animals are empty. \n\"I need to break it all down and build it up again to be more modern,\" Kaal says. \n\"Some of the pet owners still haven't paid their bills but... nothing is better than the joyful tears of the owners I reunited with their pets.\" \nDespite his feat, the vet remains modest. \n\"I'm terrified by war,\" he says. \"I've never even touched a handgun. \n\"I can tell you, I'm actually a great scaredy-cat.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:58:50.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
