They have the nerve to point fingers and laugh at students and say that they must fall, what is that? It doesn’t make sense, it actually makes me angry,” said Vumelani Sibeko, a South African visual artist on a work trip in New York.\nSibeko was one of the close to 100 people who gathered in front of South African cuisine restaurant Madiba located in Brooklyn, to show their support to the thousands of protesting students.\nHe too was a victim of financial exclusion. He was forced to drop out in his final year as a fine arts student at the Vaal University of Technology. “My parents weren’t earning enough money. So I had to have a job,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:49:05.980+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
