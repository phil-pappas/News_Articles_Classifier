Odeon took ‘tens of thousands’ of bookings before lunchtime and ‘thousands’ each hour throughout the afternoon. \nBoth said the film was already the most pre-booked since their records began. \nSo many tickets have been sold that extra showings have been added into cinema schedules, with some planning to screen the film 24 hours a day during its opening week. \nProblems with slow or crashing websites brought out the dark side in some fans. ‘The Odeon website is so slow at the moment. I just wanna buy Star Wars tickets!’ wrote one. \nThe Force Awakens is set 30 years after Return of the Jedi – the third film in the original trilogy – and brings together the original cast of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. –Daily Mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:07:22.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
