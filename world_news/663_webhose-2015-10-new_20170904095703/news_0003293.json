Our companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it in ways that (European firms) can't compete,\" Obama said in response to a question about European actions in the digital sphere. \n\"And oftentimes what is portrayed as high-minded positions on issues sometimes is just designed to carve out some of their commercial interests.\" \nBuy time for Europe \nThat view was echoed by Kati Suominen, who heads the Future of Trade initiative for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank. \nEurope sees it is lagging and is moving on policies in order \"to buy time,\" she argued. \n\"Europe is seeking to build its own digital economy by complicating the operations of foreign companies on European soil. In that sense, it is protectionism,\" she said. \nRather than throw up new barriers, she argued, Europe should be tearing them if it wishes to foster a digital economy—notably to enable better access to venture capital. \nLast month Guenther Oettinger, the EU commissioner for the digital economy and society, brushed aside suggestions of protectionism. \n\"Our rules on a European level are relevant for everybody, for European producers and players, for Asian players, and for American players as well,\" he said during a visit to San Francisco. \nSnowden impact \nWhile Google has been the target of a contentious EU anti-trust probe among other issues, Facebook has been especially impacted by privacy rules , with Ireland become the latest to examine the legality of its transfer of user data across the Atlantic. \nBelgian officials have also sought to prevent Facebook from using a data \"cookie\" that gathers information about users. The social media giant says the tool helps verify legitimate accounts and combat spam. \nA key element in the US-EU row over privacy has been the fear that US Internet firms are handing over data to the National Security Agency, in light of revelations from former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. \nTo address those concerns, US lawmakers have moved to pass a bill allowing non-citizens to enforce their data protection rights in US courts under the Privacy Act. \nBerin Szoka, president of the activist group TechFreedom, said the bill was a step toward \"repairing America's tarnished image on data privacy.\" \nHe noted that the failure until now to address the issue in Washington \"has provoked an international crisis—one that could lead to a European blockade of American Internet companies.\" \nSuominen argued that the US and EU have an chance to foster a flourishing digital economy—with appropriate rules—as part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently being negotiated. \nBut she warned that policymakers need to bring their thinking up to date. \n\"Policymakers are struggling to understand what these technologies are and what they can do, and we have archaic policies from the 20th century,\" she said. \"I worry that we are not on the right path for the 21st century.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:58:15.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
