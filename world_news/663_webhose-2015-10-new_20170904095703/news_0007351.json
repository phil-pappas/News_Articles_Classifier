Alan Wolk, TDG senior analyst and author of The Future of Social TV: Strategic Insights report report , said that Facebook will be the primary beneficiary of this shift. \"It already enjoys a much larger user base than other platforms, and it is the only platform with census-level user numbers. This will spur TV networks to put a majority of their social media dollars into Facebook, which has five times the user base and a much wider demographic reach than Twitter.\" \nWolk also noted that going forward consumers will likely spend less time viewing live TV broadcasts, turning to time-shifted viewing instead. He predicted that those engaged in social TV conversations would be less likely to require real-time interaction, as a result making real-time platforms like Twitter less relevant and indeed decline slowly. TDG predicted that the time users spend on Twitter will decline by 31% between 2015 and 2025, taking on a less important role, especially when compared with its current position as the platform by which many network digital departments measure success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:11:01.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
