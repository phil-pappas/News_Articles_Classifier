Today, Southeast Asia again stands at the brink of transformation as RIS PACS enter their second or third generation of deployment. In an effort to address the challenges and flaws of previous systems, providers are now cautiously moving toward enterprise archiving with medical imaging data forming an integral part of enterprise data. Next-generation solutions that allow seamless interoperability between radiology and other hospital departments are beginning to make their presence felt. Key Findings The Southeast Asia (SEA) market for radiology information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) is projected to be worth $ million in 2019, with Thailand accounting for the largest market size and Indonesia being the fastest-growing market between 2014 and 2019. Imaging IT will continue to be the front-runner in technology adoption across healthcare. However, the types of technologies adopted in SEA are largely dependent on the external market environment and thus, very different from the footprint observed in the West. SEA providers, in an effort to address the challenges and constraints associated with legacy systems, will gradually move toward deconstructed PACS in the next 5 years. 1 Next-generation imaging IT tools in SEA will focus on improving patient engagement and interactions.
