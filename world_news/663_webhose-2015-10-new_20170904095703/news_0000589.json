(NASDAQ: APDN) (Twitter: @APDN), a provider of DNA-based supply-chain, anti-counterfeiting and anti-theft technology, product genotyping and product authentication solutions, has partnered with Hi-Rel Group, a leading manufacturer of highly specialized metal components for the microelectronic packaging industry, to offer SigNature ® DNA-marked hermetic lids and support components to manufacturers of high reliability electronic devices. This collaborative work is being performed under Applied DNA Sciences' two-year contract with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) announced in June 2014 and in support of the MDA's Phase II SBIR program [Contract HQ0147-14-C-7002]. \nJanice Meraglia, Applied DNA Sciences Vice President of Government and Military Programs, and Tom Dolan, Vice President of Business Development at Hi-Rel Group, will jointly present at the International Microelectronics Assembly and Packaging Society conference on October 29 th in Orlando, FL. The presentation will highlight a full spectrum of versatile supply-chain security and traceability solutions, beginning with SigNature DNA marked lids and packaging that can be verified downstream with Applied DNA Sciences' Multi-Modal reader and On-Site DNA authentication readers. \nMr. Dolan of Hi-Rel group stated, \"For 40 years we've focused on building relationships by providing innovative solutions for our customers. Working with Applied DNA follows this mission of continually expanding our capabiltities and value-added offerings to our industry. We have definitely seen an increase in requests for traceability and security-based protection features and we believe there is considerable upside potential in that market segment.\" \nMs. Meraglia, commented, \"The further upstream our forensic taggant technology can be implemented into a supply-chain, the more effective it becomes and the greater the benefit it offers to downstream participants. DNA marking of microcircuit lids at the point of component packaging is a seamless insertion point for our technology and has been recommended by several original component manufacturers. We're delighted to commence this strategy with Hi-Rel Group, a trusted industry leader.\" \nAbout Hi-Rel Group \nHi-Rel Group, founded in 1976 and headquartered in Essex, Connecticut, is a leading manufacturer of highly specialized metal components for the microelectronic packaging industry.
