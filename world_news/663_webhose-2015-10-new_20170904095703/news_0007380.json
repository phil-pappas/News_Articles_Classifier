Peterson, 56, is chairman of Johnson & Johnson’s worldwide group, and Warrior, 55, is Cisco’s former chief technology officer. Their addition would bring the board’s total to 11 from 10, including three women.\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has emphasized that diversity is a priority for the world’s largest software maker, and at the company’s last shareholder meeting he pledged to make progress in hiring, retaining and promoting a more varied workforce. Twenty-eight percent of Microsoft’s total employees are women , according to the company’s website, a proportion that falls to 17 percent in technology positions.\nMicrosoft’s filing also showed Nadella received $18.3 million in compensation in fiscal 2015, a drop from the previous year, when he received a large stock award related to his promotion to CEO. His pay included salary of $1.2 million, a cash bonus of $4.32 million, and stock valued at $12.8 million, according to the filing. The total may include some awards in the year they’re granted rather than for the year they’re earned. His reported pay in the previous year was $84.3 million.\nChief Financial Officer Amy Hood got a pay package worth $8.75 million for the year, the filing shows, including salary, bonus and stock awards. Her compensation was $10.5 million a year earlier.", "external_links": ["http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/default.aspx#epgDivFocusArea\\"], "published": "2015-10-20T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:40:17.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
