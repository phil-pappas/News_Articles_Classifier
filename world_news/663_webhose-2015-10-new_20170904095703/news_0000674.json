The $1.5 billion-plus sale is seen as a race in five, with suitors including Sigdo Koppers , Rhone Capital , TPG Capital and Blackstone as well as a mystery trade buyer.\nBlackstone has been previously labelled the frontrunner but there are suggestions funding may be hard to come by for private equity firms, with Sigdo Koppers assuming favouritism as a result. The Chilean firm recently made a failed play for ASX-listed Bradken . There’s also talk Arrium may abandon the sale on worries about its ability to operate as a going concern sans Moly-Cop.\nSantos continues to claim plenty of the M&A spotlight as its asset sales push proceeds to the business end. As ever, there’s mixed views on its plans with one report suggesting the besieged energy firm is looking to hive off local assets and retain its offshore operations. This would suggest the firm could soon sell its WA portfolio alongside its stake in Darwin LNG and Cooper Basin assets.\nThe Cooper Basin and WA assets could reap $1.5bn apiece, while its share of Darwin LNG is likely worth about $400m.\nHowever, The Australian Financial Review is adamant a portion of Santos’ stake in PNG LNG remains on the table, with assertions a deal could be sealed this week. Japan’s Marubeni is believed willing to part with as much as $2bn for a 3.6 per cent slice of the project.\nAlso in energy, Beach Energy and Drillsearch sealed a long-awaited merger on Friday. The $1.2bn tie-up of the two Cooper Basin mainstays will be wrapped up early next year.\nIn the IPO market, traders are uncertain on the prospects for a positive showing from Link Group in its much-hyped ASX debut tomorrow. The $2.3bn firm has just successfully raised close to $950m, but while there was strong demand, the high price has many cautious about its prospects. Tuesday’s showing is perhaps the biggest test for the IPO market this year.\nIt comes as intellectually property firm Xenith upgrades its valuation ahead of a bookbuild, with the firm now expected to list with a valuation around $89 million.\nElsewhere, Australand could return to ASX boards next year, with Frasers potentially eyeing a quick flip after its 2014 purchase. At this stage there appears little movement at the station, but the AFR reports confidence among investment bankers that a deal could be in the works shortly.\nIn finance, progress on a deal for GE Capital’s remaining local assets appears to have stalled two weeks after it appeared a sale was just days away. The lack of a decision has many wondering if GE is dissatisfied with the offers it has received from suitors Lonestar Capital and Sankaty Advisors .\nThe finance sector has been hot for M&A this year and it appears likely to stay that way in the near-term as the big banks hive off non-core assets. Among the divisions believed to be up for grabs is ANZ’s life insurance unit, with NAB’s recent deal with Japan’s Nippon Life potentially providing confidence a suitable deal could be found.\nFellow big four bank Westpac is also eyeing an auction, with its Hastings Funds Management business on the chopping block, according to the AFR .\nFinally, Investa Commercial Property Fund is seen close to securing the management rights to the Investa platform. The drawn-out sale process should reap about $150m for owner Morgan Stanley , the AFR reports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:50:35.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
