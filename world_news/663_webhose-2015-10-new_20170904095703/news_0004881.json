However, they are not required to do so.\n\"As a next step, we believe [OMB] should issue guidance to require relevant agencies to take the necessary steps to adopt and maintain a Yelp page,\" the 21 Democrats wrote. \"Especially given the success with which most federal agencies have adopted many social media platforms, we are confident that, with appropriate guidance from OMB, agencies can promptly and successfully begin using Yelp to better respond to public feedback.\"\nMore from the Washington Examiner Kentucky insurer shuts down Co-op closing after Obama administration gives it $9.7 million to cover sick patients, not $77 million.\nBy Robert King • 10/09/15 7:05 PM The New Democrat Coalition, which was founded in 1997, is a 46-member group led by Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis. Less than half of the coalition signed the letter. The most notable non-signer included Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who also serves as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.\nUsers can already set up pages on Yelp to review federal agencies. One such page for the Internal Revenue Service has 11 comments, with one representative piece of feedback saying, \"The IRS is my charity of choice. It gets 5 stars 'cause I don't wanna get audited.\" The agency has an overall rating of 2.5 stars out of 5.\nUnder the Democrats' proposal, presumably, the agencies would be forced to acknowledge in some manner the feedback they receive.\nTop  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:16:07.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
