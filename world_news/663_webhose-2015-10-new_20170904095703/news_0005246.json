(AP) â€” The Wyoming Stock Growers Association has filed a legal challenge to a series of federal sage grouse plans, saying they overstep the government's authority.\nThe stock growers filed a petition for review Wednesday in federal court. It is the first challenge to the federal government's strategy to conserve the bird in Wyoming.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service amended nine land management plans in the state to include new grouse conservation measures. The stock growers argue the new rules hamper ranchers' ability to effectively run their operations.\nOfficials say Gov. Matt Mead is reviewing the lawsuit. Mead has praised the federal approach to conserving the sage grouse.\nA Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman declined to comment.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:34:30.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
