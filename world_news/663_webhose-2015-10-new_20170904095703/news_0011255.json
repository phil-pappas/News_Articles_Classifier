The line stretches from the Houston ship channel in Texas to New Orleans, Louisiana, and supplies over 1.4 billion feet of hydrogen every day, from over 21 hydrogen production facilities. \nPallas chief executive officer Steve Dopuch said: \"The strategic location and direct access to their Gulf Coast Pipeline affords us great confidence with respect to safe, reliable and economic delivery of hydrogen to the Pallas ammonia plant. \n\"We look forward to a long-term, mutually successful relationship for this plant and our future work with Air Products.\" \nPipelines offer a safe and reliable supply of hydrogen to the refinery and petrochemical industry throughout the world and apart from GCP, Air Products has other hydrogen pipelines in thw US, Canada, and the Netherlands. \nHydrogen is used in ammonia production, petroleum refining processes and other activities. \nImage: Construction of Air Products' Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline.
