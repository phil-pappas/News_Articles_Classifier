The 18-year-old company’s gGastro EHR system has earned Black Book Rankings’ award for Top Ambulatory EHR for gastroenterology for five consecutive years, and combined with gPM, gMed’s integrated practice management system, offers a complete gastro-specific suite. gMed will also be demonstrating gGastro’s endoscopy report writer which was chosen by Olympus as a preferred replacement for its EndoWorks platform which is being discontinued. \n“Being handpicked by Olympus to be only one of two select vendors to provide software to current EndoWorks and future Olympus customers is an honor,” states Joe Rubinsztain, MD, president of gMed. “We look forward to showing our gGastro Suite and data-driven gastroenterology-specific solutions to ACG attendees.” \nBuilt by practicing gastroenterologists, EMA Gastroenterology is pre-coded with gastroenterology-specific medical knowledge and knows the workflow of physicians in this specialty. The intuitive solution is available as a native iPad application and can be accessed via the Internet virtually anywhere and anytime. EMA Gastroenterology’s structured data collection, combined with a user-friendly touch-screen interface and automated ICD-10 capabilities, gives providers the technology they need to efficiently run their practices and the comfort of knowing that charting, coding and billing can be completed before they leave the exam room. \n“At this year’s ACG we are pleased to showcase our built in ICD-10 solution which has received rave reviews from clients. They appreciate that the new, more complicated coding is completed simultaneously along with the exam note, saving them time,” said Dr. Julie C. Servoss, EMA Gastroenterology Medical Director at Modernizing Medicine. “In addition, physicians utilizing our new Protocols solution can customize their workflow and develop their own master visits. EMA already includes intuitive adaptive learning, and now with only two clicks a physician can pull the master visit into the current visit to quickly document while seeing a patient.” \nDr. Servoss and EMA Gastroenterology Team Lead Dr. Elliot Ellis will be at booth #1219 demoing EMA Gastroenterology and showcasing all of the specialty-specific attributes and features available. Attendees can see gMed’s award winning gGastro Suite and Endoscopy Report Writer at booth #932. ACG 2015 is taking place at the Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu, HI, from October 18 – 20, 2015.
