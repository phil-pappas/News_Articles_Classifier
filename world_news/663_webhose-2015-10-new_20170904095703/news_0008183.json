The new Teradata ® Listener™ and Teradata Aster ® Analytics on Hadoop make it possible to intelligently listen in real-time and then use analytics to see the distinctive patterns in massive streams of IoT data. The world is full of connected devices generating a massive and constant stream of data. In recent years, advances have been made with instrumentation of devices and their pervasive connectivity. However, the focus has not been on ingesting and maximizing value from the data with machine learning algorithms. Even the most technology-savvy organizations recognize that extracting value from data generated by the IoT is a difficult, skills-intensive process. Even more difficult is integrating the IoT data with business operations and human behavioral data. To respond to the challenges, Teradata's latest innovative IoT software capabilities eliminate complexity and latency, while providing organizations with entirely new capabilities to leverage data. Teradata Listener is intelligent, self-service software with real-time \"listening\" capabilities to follow multiple streams of sensor and IoT data wherever it exists globally, and then propagate the data into multiple platforms in an analytical ecosystem. Data propagated to the recently-released Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 provides access to large volumes of data with its native support of JSON (Java Script Object Notation) data. Data propagated to Hadoop® can be analyzed at scale with Teradata Aster Analytics on Hadoop. \"Customers can now take full advantage of IoT data generated from nearly an unlimited number and type of devices. In addition, Teradata enables customers to combine IoT data with business operations and human behavioral data to maximize analytic value,\" said Hermann Wimmer , co-president, Teradata. \"Teradata Listener and Aster Analytics on Hadoop are breakthrough IoT technologies that push the analytic edge, making the 'Analytics of Everything' possible.\" For example, a Teradata customer and major manufacturer sells and services magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiography, and ultrasound imaging equipment to global hospitals and clinics. These medical devices have become indispensable in global healthcare, with thousands of patient scans daily. Text logs describing patient behavior and sensor data are streamed 24/7 from the equipment into the manufacturer's Hadoop data lake. Teradata runs text analytics on the data to uncover insights that help global field service personnel improve machine up-time and extend maintenance windows. Simultaneously, data from the equipment manufacturing process flows into a Teradata Appliance where advanced analytics offer insights for improving quality and manufacturing efficiency and help ensure that problems are not passed to the next product generation. \"Daily, we collect millions of sensor observations from our equipment, and from our Engineers we receive thousands of written reports that are digitized. We subject the data to a variety of analytics to discover hidden patterns in order to ensure optimal equipment performance. Our partnership with Teradata has helped us predict the leading indicators for train equipment breakdown,\" said Gerhard Kress , director, Analytical Services, Siemens Mobility Division. \"The collection and analysis of senor and IOT data has been integral to driving the efficiency of the rail business.\" Teradata Listener - Teradata Listener is intelligent, self-service software for ingesting and distributing fast-moving data streams--either individual or multiple streams--at one time. It allows customers to push data to Hadoop, Teradata Aster Analytics, Teradata Database, and other platforms. It enables data scientists, business analysts, and developers to quickly and easily analyze new data streams for faster answers to business questions. Without needing to rely on IT for help, users can analyze data from numerous sources including sensors, telematics, mobile events, click streams, social media feeds, and IT server logs. Teradata Aster Analytics on Hadoop – Unique in the industry, the enhanced Aster Analytics on Hadoop is an integrated analytics solution from Teradata now featuring a set of more than 100 business-ready, distinctly different analytics techniques and seven vertical industry applications to run directly on Hadoop®. This allows organizations to seamlessly address business problems with an integrated analytics solution. The flexibility and simplicity of these capabilities enables everyday business analysts to perform as data scientists by tackling the organization's most challenging problems. Teradata Aster Analytics on Hadoop allows users to combine machine learning, text, path, pattern, graph, and statistics within a single workflow. Teradata offers flexible Aster Analytics deployments that include the Teradata Big Analytics Appliance, Hadoop , the software only version, or in the Teradata Cloud. Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 Released on Monday, October 19 , the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 is the ideal platform to support the new IoT capabilities. It enables customers to perform complex analytics at scale and is available at a cost-effective price of approximately $1,000 per terabyte of compressed data. The Teradata Database , running on the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform, provides access to data in many formats, including XML, name-value pair, BSON (Binary JSON) and JSON from web applications, sensors, and Internet of Things-connected machines. Teradata Listener is now available in beta, and will be generally available globally in the first quarter of 2016. Teradata Aster Analytics on Hadoop will be shipped globally in the second quarter of 2016. The Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 is now available globally.
