Meridios has met HCI 3 's requirements and now works with customers who submit their data for a performance assessment for scoring using the BTE Recognition Care program criteria. The scoring results are then communicated back to the clinicians and practices. This automated performance assessment process allows for rapid and independent medical record-based clinician performance evaluations by connecting electronic medical record data sources or data aggregators to a network of performance assessment organizations. \nBTE works with Meridios to facilitate clinician performance assessment in order to: reduce the reporting burden for clinicians; leverage existing reporting/data aggregation initiatives; reduce data collection and reporting costs; facilitate the connection between quality improvement and incentives; and speed up cycle times between reporting and quality improvement. \n\"These data ggregation programs are instrumental to helping health care providers bridge the gap between perception and reality,\" says Patrick Clark , CEO of Meridios. \"Our team is really excited and proud to work with HCI 3 on programs like these. HCI 3 continues to prove they are leaders in this space.\" \nBridges to Excellence Clinician Recognition programs are intended to identify clinicians who deliver high-value care to patients with specific chronic conditions. The programs each comprise a set of clinical measures representing standards of care for patients with these conditions. Programs include: Asthma care Cardiac care in collaboration with the American College of Cardiology Congestive heart failure care Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care Coronary artery disease care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:19:50.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
