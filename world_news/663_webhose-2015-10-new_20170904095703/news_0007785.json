Latest news on Asia India and South Korea drive SAP record quarter in Asia Pacific \nSK said that together with Ericsson, it was also able to isolate and protect the virtual network slices from one another, solving a big challenge that perplexed developers until now: How multiple virtual networks can share a single physical space. \nWith 5G network slicing, a single physical network can be partitioned into multiple virtual mobile networks and still support different types of 5G services. \n\"The development of 5G is in a very exciting phase right now with important achievements in research and development. The success with the network slicing technology is critical to enable the network to be an innovation platform for new types of applications and thereby meet future expectations,\" said Ulf Ewaldsson, chief technology officer at Ericsson. \nThe new tech has the attention of international standardisation organisations, such as 3GPP and the ITU, as well as global operators, equipment vendors, and software companies. \nThis technique developed by SK and Ericcson could become the solution used for supporting future 5G services. \nThe companies are also currently preparing to launch a joint 5G test bed at SK Telecom's Corporate R&D Centre to set up this state-of-the-art end-to-end 5G system. \nSource: ZDNet.co.kr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:38:34.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
