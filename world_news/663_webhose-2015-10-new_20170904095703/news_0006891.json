By contrast, the last time US wildfires burned more than 9 million acres by October 8, in 2006, the number of fires totaled 84,578. \nBut NIFC data revealed a more worrying long-term trend: Since at least 1960 and up until the early 1980s, the US saw more than 100,000 individual wildfires each year, which, despite their numbers, never burned more than 5.5 million acres. \nBetween 2000 and 2014, however, the number of fires exceeded 90,000 only twice, but in nine of those years the total acreage burned exceeded 5.5 million. \nThat rise in more-damaging \"mega-fires\" has been widely attributed to fire management practices, a growing number of homes in or near major forests and, especially, a trend toward hotter, drier seasons. \nThose effects may be most obvious this year, as fires have torn through drought-parched California and other western states. \nThe more than 11 million acres burned by just 51,110 wildfires so far this year means each fire burned on average 220 acres—more than twice the average acreage per fire through this point in the year over the past decade, according to an AFP analysis of NIFC data.
