On this watershed day, President Jacob Zuma appointed Madonsela as the third Public Protector of democratic South Africa becoming the first woman to hold the position. I must admit I had no intimate knowledge of Madonsela struggle credentials but there was no doubt in my mind that she was a trusted ANC cadre who would toe the ANC line just like her predecessors.\nIt is also important to note that this was one of President Zuma`s first appointments since his Inauguration in May of that year and will no doubt go down as one of his best appointments during his term of office.\nIt is important that we as the broader public give credit to President Zuma, National Assembly and the ruling party at large for giving us such a strong, courageous woman and cadre. This is one good example of cadre deployment and the broader public service should take a leaf from her conduct. Since her appointment Modonsela has used powers vested in her office by the Constitution to enter a terrain that no previous Public Protector has ever had the courage to enter.\nShe had the courage to investigate maladmistration, misconduct and corruption against not only public servants but also their political masters. Her investigations, findings and remedial actions speak truth to power and this has no gone down very well with the powers that be. One thing I respect about her is the way she exercises impartially and non-biasedness towards the ruling party considering that it has been her political home for many years.\nShe fully understands and appreciates that she does not serve the ruling party but rather serves the public on behalf of country`s Constitution.\nA woman with impeccable struggle credentials she was an around when Ready to Govern, a key ANC policy document which provided for the establishment of “a full time independent office of the Ombud” was developed in 1991. It is therefore important to remember that it is this ANC that appreciated the need to have independent democratic watchdogs such as her office to guard us against ourselves.\nWe should therefore, as a matter of principle, at all times be thankful to the ANC for the Office of the Public Protector generally and Advocate Thuli Madonsela in particular.\nThe ANC produced great women leaders during the fight against apartheid but I have no doubt in my mind that she will go down as one of the top performers in terms of ANC policy implementation during first 21 years of democracy. I am sure that in due course the ANC and its Womens League will honour and thank her for all her hard work during her seven year term.\nKhaya Tyatya", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:35:24.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
