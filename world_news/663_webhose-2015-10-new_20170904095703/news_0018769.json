While the app gained popularity because of its disappearing videos, photos and text messages, the company also made a foray into providing news content with the launch of its Discover platform in January. \nThat section of the app serves up swipe-friendly content from publishers like Comedy Central, National Geographic and CNN, interspersed with ads. \nA Snapchat Inc. spokeswoman said Snap Channel is winding down, but did not rule out future plans to produce original content. \nThink your friends should see this?
