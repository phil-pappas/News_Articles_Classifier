Analysts had predicted a non-IFRS net profit of EUR1.09 billion for the quarter, according to a recent poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal.\n\"Clearly the third quarter is a beat,\" said Chief Executive Bill McDermott, suggesting that the company had a chance to \"outrun\" its guidance for the full year.\nSAP last week reiterated its outlook for fiscal year 2015, saying its expects full-year non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to be in a range of EUR1.95 billion to EUR2.05 billion at constant currencies. Full year non-IFRS operating profit should be in a range of EUR5.6 billion to EUR5.9 billion at constant currencies.\nSAP pre-released some of its third quarter figures last week, reporting a 5% increase in the company's closely watched operating profit, to EUR1.21 billion. Total revenue rose by 17% to EUR4.98 billion, buoyed by strong growth in the cloud and a solid uptake of new on-premise software licenses. Cloud subscriptions and support revenue increased by over 100% to EUR599 million year-over-year.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n 20, 2015 01:28 ET (05:28 ", "external_links": ["http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:26:51.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
