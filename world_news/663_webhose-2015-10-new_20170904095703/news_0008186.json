James Alcock Share on twitter by David Ramli M2 Group chief executive Geoff Horth has called on Labor not to change the national broadband network's rollout technology because doing so would delay construction.\nOpposition communications spokesman Jason Clare last week said that Labor would ramp up the amount of homes and businesses connected directly to the NBN using fibre optic cabling if it won the next election.\nIt delivers much faster broadband at a higher cost compared to the Coalition's preferred technology, which runs fibre to streetside node cabinets before switching over to the existing copper phone network.\nBut M2's Mr Horth said that the time for debate over technologies must come to an end because internet service providers need stability to decide how and when to invest in infrastructure.\nM2 is the nation's fourth-largest internet service provider, with Dodo and iPrimus as its subsidiaries. It is also set to become Australia's fourth-biggest telecommunications company pending approval for a merger with Vocus Communications.\n\"We think the NBN is a good thing for Australia and we think it's a good thing for industry,\" he said. \"But certainty around the way that it's going to be deployed and the timeframes for deployment is really important for everyone.\n\"I think any further change in deployment model would be ill-advised [and] I wouldn't advocate for any change.\"\nCurrent model Mr Horth said taxpayers had spent large amounts of money gearing up for the current model and it should be allowed to play out. M2 also benefits from the NBN being deployed faster because it is a reseller that currently buys many of its services from Telstra at a higher price.\n\"The reality is that a fibre-to-the-node deployment in time gives us a chance to go to fibre-to-the-premise if we think it's justified,\" he said. \"[Connecting premises directly with fibre] would absolutely take longer to connect – there's no way they could build fibre to the premise at the rate they're proposing to build fibre to the node.\n\"NBN has been pretty good in the last 12 months and they have definitely got better at timeliness and its provisioning has improved so we've definitely got more confidence in its capacity to deliver these days than we ever had.\"\nDoubt over rollout But Labor's Mr Clare has cast doubt on NBN's ability to ramp up construction, pointing out that much of the planned increase will only take place after the next election.\n\"This is a ramp Evel Knievel couldn't jump,\" he said on Friday. \"The rollout plan is all about making [Prime Minister] Malcolm Turnbull look good on Election Day.\n\"He promised that his second-rate NBN would be rolled out to all homes and businesses by the end of 2016 – that's now more than doubled to 7 years.\"\nNot all internet service providers support the status quo. iiNet was previously a strong backer of fibre to the premise, although it has not voiced an opinion on the issue since being bought by TPG Telecom.\nSingaporean broadband provider MyRepublic has a business model based on selling services on fibre-to-the-premise networks and its co-founder Malcolm Rodrigues previously said that he \"loved\" the previous NBN model because the current system would make Australia fall behind – a point NBN and the government refute.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-threat-myrepublic-details-australia-launch-and-slams-nbn-20150810-givgk6.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/nbn-would-go-back-to-fibre-optic-under-australian-labor-party-says-jason-clare-20151013-gk8fih.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:19:01.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
