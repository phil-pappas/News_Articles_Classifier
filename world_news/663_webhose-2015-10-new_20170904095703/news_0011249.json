What they need to do instead is create a team and an organisation that can monitoring the changes taking place around them. The bigger the team, the more feelers they have out.\nIt’s the quality of the team and ability of the organisation to recruit the right kind of people that counts.\n“It’s not so much that the manager has to do it themselves but they have to build within the firm a fabric that is part of a broader social network,’’ Lim says.\n“In order for a firm to absorb external knowledge it needs to have the capability in that space. You need to have some people in the organisation to make sense of those trends and follow those trends and adopt the relevant bits.”\nThere are all sort of tools to monitor what’s going on. Besides checking the papers, industry portals and magazines every day, regular news feeds like Google News are invaluable. News Map is good too. It’s basically a front page with all the top news headlines captured in a graphic format. Google Alerts is also a good system for staying on top of trends. Just type in keywords relative to your industry, market, news or competitors, and you will get email notices.\nTwitter lists can be a great way to curate fresh ideas from some of the most influential people in your industry Source: Supplied\nTwitter is also an invaluable source, and a helpful trick is to set up Twitter lists , where you can group influential people in the sector you want to follow and receive a steady stream of information on what they think is important. Hashtags can help on Twitter too, but tend to be much more firehose than curated feed.\nOf course, tools can only do so much. You have to know what you’re looking for and the key here is to follow the money. Given that most disruptions of the last 20 years have come out of Silicon Valley, look to where the smart money is going. A great resource is Crunchbase , a database that tracks investments in start-ups. You can see the kind of companies that are getting funding, track the influential investors like VC funds as well as follow the investments of visionaries like Elon Musk. Crunchbase also runs CBInsights which digs deep into investment trends and draws the dots for you.\nInvestment tracking platform Crunchbase published insights into where Silicon Valley investment is going.

McKinsey publishes an insights series quarterly (they even have an app) while other consultancies like Boston Consulting Group, Bain, Deloitte, PWC and Accenture are worth checking out too..\nYou can also pick up some fantastically fascinating trends visiting The Futures Company which has a blog and trends section, telling us all the latest and little known things that are going on in the world. Did you know MasterCard is using selfies to verify payments? Check it out.\nAnother one not to be missed trendwatching.com which offers premium and free services. Lots of consumer insights, as well as a handy downloadable guide to help you work out what trends your business can capitalise on.\nAll of this should keep any company’s trends team busy.
