Projects involving in vitro demonstration of biological compatibility and efficacy are appropriate, but the program can support only limited in vivo studies.Tissue engineering and drug/gene delivery projects must have a specific focus on fundamental materials development and characterization.Studies of the mechanical behavior of hard and soft biological materials and tissues and projects in molecular biophysics may be more appropriate for one or more of the NSF programs listed below under Related Programs.Projects with an emphasis on device design and fabrication are generally more appropriate for a program in the NSF Engineering Directorate.
