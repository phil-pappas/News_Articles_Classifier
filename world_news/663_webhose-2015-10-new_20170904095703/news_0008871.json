It also provides an in-depth analysis of the market and discusses market characteristics such as size, revenue forecasts, drivers, restraints, market penetration and market attractiveness for both the digital radiography (DR) and the computed radiography (CR) markets. Market participants in these countries were interviewed to obtain their perceptions of DR and CR. The regional scope of this research service includes Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Italy, Benelux, and Scandinavia. Key Findings From 2014 to 2019, the European Digital Radiography (DR) market is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of %, while Computed Radiography (CR) is expected to decline at %. - Europe has been facing a budget deficit for the last three years and there has been no significant increase in both DR and CR revenue. - Penetration of DR in European countries varies between % to %. This provides potential for new DR installations. However, in the next two years, European countries are expected to be under financial strain and the hospitals have prioritised capital expenditure based on replacement. - DR systems are sold as packaged solutions with Radiology Information Systems (RIS) or Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). As a result, manufacturers with a diverse product portfolio have a better chance of expanding their installed base. - It is expected that the growth of the economy will cause hospitals to invest in interoperability, data exchange modules, and digital radiography. - Computed radiography is saturated in most European countries and is declining in terms of unit shipment and revenue. However, CR technology cannot become obsolete, as diagnostic centres and small hospitals (facilities that have less than beds) will keep the market active. - The price of DR systems has declined significantly in the last three years after the introduction of retrofits.
