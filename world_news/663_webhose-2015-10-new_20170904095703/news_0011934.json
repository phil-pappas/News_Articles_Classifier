Mayo. \nIn his analysis, Dr. Mayo states: \"As seen in both studies, much of the recent evolution in the telecommunications industry has happened in wireless and broadband, two areas where regulation has generally followed a light-touch approach. Yet much of the current, largely residual regulatory framework in wireline telecommunications was put in place in an era where the industry was dominated by local monopolies and competition from wireless communications or broadband did not exist.\" \nThe Mayo study continues: \"The analysis indicates that the steps New York has taken to reform regulatory constraints on local exchange telecommunications providers have been met with a host of beneficial results for consumers. It also indicates that New York can both confidently move forward with a more relaxed regulatory posture toward the industry and, armed with the results based regulatory principles (as described in the study), can adapt in the future to the evolving market.\" \nThe company said it supports the commission Staff's assessment that the communications market has radically changed and is highly competitive. It added that the commission should stay the course on its regulatory policy which has incentivized competition and technological advancement. \nSpecifically, the company called on the commission to implement the following principles: -- A \"light touch\" regulatory regime; -- Leveling the competitive playing field; -- Primary reliance on competition rather than regulation to serve consumer interests; -- Periodic regulatory review and sunset; and -- Avoidance of protectionism. \nThe company added that \"measures consistent with these principles have been adopted in a number of other states with good results.\" \nAs its comments note, the company is fully committed to New York State as one of the largest employers, one of the largest real property tax-payers and a major supporter of businesses, including minority- and women-owned business enterprises throughout the state. \nGood Corporate Citizen \nVerizon creates jobs through the billions of dollars it spends annually with vendors. The company is a charter member of the Billion Dollar Roundtable, one of only 21 U.S. companies that conduct more than $1 billion in business with U.S. minority and women-owned enterprises (MWBEs) each year. Last year, Verizon spent more than $5 billion in business with MWBEs and provided business opportunities to thousands of small and medium-sized businesses across the country. In addition, the company has been named, among other acknowledgements, on Working Mother's \"100 Best Companies for Women\" list, a \"Top 50 Employer\" by Workforce Diversity Magazine, and by Military Times as the number one company in the country for recruiting and hiring veterans and service members. \nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) employs a diverse workforce of 177,900 and generated more than $127 billion in 2014 revenues. Verizon Wireless operates America's most reliable wireless network, with 110.8 million retail connections nationwide.
