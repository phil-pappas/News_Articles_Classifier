Sharon Reich reports.   \nSTORY: While you can't predict an emergency situation ... you can plan for one. That's where the SkySaver backpack comes in. Yoav Preiss, SkySaver's vice president, explains how the easy to use knapsack can provide you with an instant escape route. SOUNDBITE: YOAV PREISS, SKYSAVER'S VICE PRESIDENT, SAYING (English): \"It's a backpack that you put on, you click, No. 2, you go to the wall to a pre-existing installed anchor, you hook it on and No. 3, you exit the window and the SkySaver does the rest for you.\" Preiss says the bag was developed after the September 11th attacks, as an easy exit strategy. It's available in different extension ranges. The maximum length is 260 feet or 79 meters from the window to the ground. All one really needs to do in advance is install a hook inside the building's window. SOUNDBITE: YOAV PREISS, SKYSAVER'S VICE PRESIDENT, SAYING (English): \"It shouldn't take more than 15 seconds until you're outside the window.\" The backpack costs between $750-850 (USD) and is being sold on Amazon. A version for pets and children will be available soon.  //reut.rs/1MOBo55", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:30:00.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
