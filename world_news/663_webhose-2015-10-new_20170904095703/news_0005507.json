The products have been designed to maximize the potential of existing equipment with simplified deployment, monitoring, security, and management tools,” shared Dan Lane, CEO Merchant Link.\nDan Lane added, “Blending the products that Merchant Link has with those from Precidia gives all of our merchants a simplified payments integration with a layered security approach for their credit card security, as well as flexibility in deployment and in support.”\n“Being a predominantly technology development shop, it makes sense to take our Merchant Link partnership to the next level and join forces with their team. Working with Merchant Link over the last few years has given us a good idea of their customer base, how they handle service, and how we could come together to bring even more flexible solutions to market,” commented Deepak Wanner, President, Precidia.\nMerchant Link and Precidia will continue delivering quality products, solutions and service. Over the next few months Merchant Link will work diligently with its merchants, partners, and vendors, to ensure a smooth transition into one company.\nAbout Merchant Link\nMerchant Link is a leading provider of cloud-based payment gateway and data security solutions, removing the risk and hassle of payments for more than 300,000 restaurant, hotel and retail locations.
