Bolden, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\nThe crux of the letter is a preemptive attempt for a commitment from NASA to continue to perform aerial monitoring of toxic algal blooms in the lake, as well as to seek funding for algae monitoring through the 2017 budget year.\nOhio Senators Brown and Portman have sent a letter to NASA asking that high-tech aerial monitoring -- such as these photos -- continue in the efforts to track harmful algal blooms on Lake Erie. Photo courtesy of NOAA NASA's remote-sensing program \"serves an integral role in the efforts to provide early warning of harmful algal blooms,\" the letter says. \"In water quality emergencies, responsive monitoring of microcystin and other cyanobacterial levels is essential to public health and economic sustainability of coastal Lake Erie cities.\"\nThis summer's toxic algal bloom has been one of the largest on record, falling just short of the 2011 bloom in coverage and bacterial concentration, said Rick Stumpf, an oceanographer and algal bloom specialist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe bloom will continue until the lake cools down, Stumpf said. Past severe blooms have run well into October, he added.\nAlgal blooms are the product of heavy agricultural runoff of fertilizers and manure, primarily into the Maumee River, and concentrated in the western basin of Lake Erie. In 2014, bacteria from the bloom polluted the drinking water in Toledo and Monroe County, Michigan, shutting down the water-treatment systems for three days.\nCLICK ON IMAGE TO ENLARGE Letter courtesy of Sens. Brown, Portman The USEPA estimates that harmful algal blooms are responsible for $64 million in losses per year due to the additional cost of drinking water treatment, the loss of recreational water usage, and a decline in waterfront real estate values, the letter says.\nThis summer, NASA collaborated with NOAA and the U.S. Naval Research Lab to deploy a hyperspectral imager and miniature spectrometers aboard aircraft from the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland to monitor the algal bloom, the letter says. The aircraft collected up to 50 gigabytes of data per flight, which it could then process and analyze in as few as four hours.\nDuring the Toledo water crisis, monitoring flights were more than tripled to 14 per week. The flights also allowed NASA to foresee a toxic algal bloom forming near Kelleys Island in time to adjust water treatment to maintain safe conditions, the letter said.\nBy comparison, satellite imaging of the algal blooms can take up to two weeks to process, and the orbital routes must be pre-planned.\n\"With harmful algal blooms remaining a threat to our drinking water and to local tourism, NASA must continue to devote resources to monitoring these blooms,\" Brown said.\n\"NASA has made great progress in advancing imaging in the Western Lake Erie Basin. NASA's efforts are an integral part of the coordinated approach to addressing the threats posed by algal blooms to our water sources and local businesses,\" Brown said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:01:02.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
