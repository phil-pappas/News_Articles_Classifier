The donations will provide an entertaining outing for club members in the Southern Nevada area, most of whom live at or below the poverty level. Agilysys maintains a regional office in Las Vegas. \n\"We are grateful to Agilysys for their faith in our organization and for believing in the potential of our kids,\" said Ken Rubeli, chief executive officer of Boys & Girls Clubs of Southern Nevada. \"This donation, in particular, will give our members a fun and entertaining excursion. Many of these kids have never seen a movie in a real theater, so this will be an extra special experience for them.\" \nLast year, in conjunction with the rGuest ® 'World Premier' product launch at HITEC 2014, Agilysys donated movie tickets to Boys & Girls Clubs in several locations where the company maintains an office. Earlier this year, Agilysys donated an external hard drive and three Adobe Creative Cloud licenses to the Brookhaven (Atlanta) Boys & Girls Club in conjunction with its annual sales kick-off meeting. \n\"We are pleased to make this donation to Boys & Girls Clubs of Southern Nevada and reaffirm our commitment to Boys & Girls Clubs of America,\" said Jim Walker, vice president of sales and marketing at Agilysys. \"It's particularly rewarding to partner with an organization that promotes the welfare of children and teens and helps ensure that they have a more meaningful and productive future. We hope we can play a role in bringing hope and happiness into the lives of these kids, and we encourage our employees to do the same by donating their time to Boys & Girls Clubs and other worthwhile organizations in their own communities.\" \nFor more than 100 years, Boys & Girls Clubs of America have enabled young people in need to achieve great futures as productive and responsible citizens.
