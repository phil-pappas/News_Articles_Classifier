The service monitors hundreds of risk indicators - as categorized in 10 security categories captured in a graded scorecard dashboard-- allowing Zurich to identify partner security issues and prevent the impact from third party ecosystem breaches. With the new visibility discovered in the platform, Zurich expects to gain efficiencies in remediation and partner collaboration. \n\"As one of the world's largest business insurance companies, Zurich has hundreds of third-party partners across dozens of countries, so it has long taken a proactive approach to averting any possible breach in its IT ecosystem, no matter how small,\" said Dr. Aleksandr Yampolskiy, CEO and co-founder of SecurityScorecard. \"We're confident that our platform will help to ensure that this safe environment continues to thrive.\" \n\"As we looked to further fortify our defensive layers against threats, it was clear that nobody else had the capabilities of SecurityScorecard's benchmarking and security intelligence service,\" said Troy Mattern, Zurich's Deputy Head of Cyber Security. \"Rather than just providing a snapshot in time of potential security risks, the system is designed to work continuously, providing a previously unobtainable level of threat information that supports our decision making.\" \n\"SecurityScorecard simply doesn't have a lot of competitors in this space,\" added Mattern. \"This test will help us garner additional understanding of what risks we're exposed to in our partners' environments. \nAbout Zurich Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich) is a leading multi-line insurer that serves its customers in global and local markets.
