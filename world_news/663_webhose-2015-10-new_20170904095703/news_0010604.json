Without this, one of the other main barriers — measuring and monetizing value — will probably be very difficult to overcome. Battery storage can provide a number of services, but if they aren’t used fully in enough real-world situations, you can’t measure their value, and therefore monetizing their value is challenging.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:14:23.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
