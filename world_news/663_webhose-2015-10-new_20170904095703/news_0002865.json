Klimek, Special for USA TODAY)\n5 CONNECT 26 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE SAN FRANCISCO - While government officials have hinted that connected-car laws could be in place by year's end, a leading consumer-focused agency is saying not-so-fast.\nIn testimony Wednesday before Congress , a Federal Trade Commission representative expressed concern over proposed legislation governing connected vehicles, specifically noting that the data security of such automobiles could be compromised by laws that did not provide enough government oversight of auto manufacturers' tech initiatives.\nThe end result could be little consumer group insight into both the data privacy policies and data encryption tech those making connected cars, which could leave drivers in the dark as to the use of information generated by their vehicle use, the FTC argued.\n\"(The proposed legislation) grants a broad safe harbor from FTC law enforcement actions to any vehicle manufacturer who submits a privacy policy to the Secretary of Transportation that explains the notice, choices, and privacy related commitments the manufacturer will make,\" testified Maneesha Mithal, associate director of the FTCâ€™s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection. \"Under this proposal, manufacturers can satisfy the requirements of this section without providing any substantive protections for consumer data.\"\nUSA TODAY\nFeds speed up timetable for safer 'connected cars'\nMithal also said that cars could be particularly vulnerable to hackers if a section of the new law is not amended, one that would prohibit unauthorized access to the data control unit and other key parts of a car's computer brain. While on the surface such a provision would sound like a logical way to keep hackers at bay, Mithal argued that the law would also hamper the efforts of private data security researchers who might be able to assist automakers in their efforts to keep their connected car systems safe.\nLast spring, Wired magazine challenged two such experts to hack into their Jeep remotely. The pair succeeded, taking over control of the vehicle from miles away and running it into a ditch.\nIn Palo Alto on Oct. 14, 2015, USA TODAY's Marco della Cava tested out the new autopilot feature of Tesla's Model S. The updated software enables the car to change lanes by itself. Theresa Chong\nSuch nightmare scenarios are increasingly of concern as global auto manufacturers and Silicon Valley tech companies alike - namely Google with its self-driving car project and Apple with its growing automotive team - are working feverishly on making cars increasingly self-sufficient. Last week, Tesla demonstrated its new Autopilot system, which allows its Model S and Model X electric vehicles to steer, lane-change and park on the own.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nHack of connected car raises alarm over driver safety\nIn May, Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced that the timetable for a proposal that would require that cars electronically talk to each other to avoid accidents be completed by year's end. \"Connected, automated vehicles that can sense the environment around them and communicate with other vehicles and with infrastructure have the potential to revolutionize road safety and save thousands of lives,\" Foxx said in a visit to Delphi Labs in Mountain View, Calif.\nWhile auto and tech companies agree that smarter cars should equal fewer road fatalities, there is still much work to be done to create a fully connected transportation network.\nCars such as Google's self-driving pods and Tesla's four-door family machines rely mainly on in-car radar, cameras and ultrasonic sensors to guide a vehicle down the road. But ultimately the idea is to have so-called Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication, with information either pinging between like-minded (as in, the same brand) cars or traveling between cars and stationary high-tech infrastructure.\nUSA TODAY\nTesla's new software helps Model S drive itself\nThe FTC's testimony clearly meant to alert lawmakers that while the coming age of connected cars should be embraced by government, automakers and consumers alike, any laws governing this new age need careful vetting.\n\"In sum, the Commission understands the desire to provide businesses with certainty and incentives, in the form of safe harbors, to implement best practices,\" Mithal said. \"However, the security provisions of the discussion draft would allow manufacturers to receive substantial liability protections in exchange for potentially weak best practices instituted by a Council that they control. The proposed legislation, as drafted, could substantially weaken the security and privacy protections that consumers have today.\"\nFollow USA Today tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter @marcodellacava .\n5 CONNECT 26 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LLCTlw TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c874ad012946e9810f89cfbf35e0d07a60863a97/c=1-0-540-405&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810253281872913-ggg.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LLCTlw&text=FTC%20says%20not-so-fast%20on%20new%20connected%20car%20laws&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4558202569001_Tesla-Thumbnail.jpg", "http://www.freep.com/story/tech/2015/07/21/hack-connected-car-raises-alarm-over-driver-safety/30462317/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LLCTlw&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56bca165df98080e25948b9895962d11fce8e0fc/c=152-76-513-437/local/-/media/2015/07/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635730797170337901-wired.jpg", "https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/826551/151021vehiclesafetytestimony.pdf?utm_source=govdelivery", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4558238178001_Tesla-Marco-Driving-Handsfree.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0d3cd70c739687456ed0d94ac924bbff211d6d42/c=797-0-3982-3185/local/-/media/2015/05/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635671443069732015-foxx.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1ROvbYL", "http://usat.ly/1LLCTlw", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810253281872913-ggg.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4558202569001_Tesla-Thumbnail.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4558202569001_Tesla-Thumbnail.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://twitter.com/marcodellacava", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810253281872913-ggg.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0eb679d028b5476ee2ea93b17c6de4d6a0292ae0/c=186-0-1302-1116/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804395082366624-tes1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:58:31.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
