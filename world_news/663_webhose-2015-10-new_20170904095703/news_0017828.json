Whipping out his phone, he showed me photos of his beautiful garden in the unfurlings of spring.\nLike his portfolios, I imagine, his flowers and herbs were organised neatly and hedged creatively.\nThis particular man maintained a spreadsheet: date of planting, first shoots, \"friendly plants\" (strawberries apparently speed onion growth and marigolds encourage most other flowers) and pests.\nIf you've an inkling to begin seed sprinkling, here are some gardening apps to help you turn your texting thumb into a green thumb.\nThe ABC Vegie app has a wide ranging compendium of vegetables and advice on planting direction, harvest times and potential problems. Supplied Aussie challenge Unfortunately, most gardening apps are developed overseas and don't include the varied and unique horticultural conditions in Australia. But there are some.\nABC Vegie Guide (developed by those noble folk at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in their spare time) determines your location, climate information and the current date to recommend what kinds of vegetables will burst forth.\nIt has a wide-ranging compendium of vegetables and advice on planting direction, harvest times and potential problems. It also has a cute feature allowing you to monitor your own patch of plants, which is very 2015.\nGlobal Shark Tracker opens and a beautiful map of planet earth appears and a sprinkle of orange and blue dots signal the sharks tagged by various scientists. OCEARCH The day you plant your beetroot (beta vulgaris), plant it in your digital garden as well and it will link to your smartphone's calendar. Your patch then keeps track of which seed/seedling/cutting was planted when and gives you hints on when to harvest or whether to look out for bugs, slugs and garden fairies.\nABC Vegie Guide also has plenty of information on maintaining a garden in the city - no-dig garden beds, grid planting, concrete potatoes etc.\nThe Yates My Garden app was another Australian-specific product I found. However after looking through its features, it's more a shopping guide for Yates plants, pesticides and particulars. The \"Ask An Expert\" forum was quite active and had interesting discussions on composting in the city and such, but it didn't seem half as useful as ABC Vegie.\nTracking Jaws Since there's only so much gardening you can do on a sunny weekend, I also stumbled across a great app that is great for when you throw down the pruners and hit the beach.\nGlobal Shark Tracker opens with a beautiful map of planet earth and a sprinkle of orange and blue dots signalling the sharks tagged by various scientists. There's information on each shark: its name, where it was tagged, how big it is.\nI spent the best part of an hour following a 3.3-metre great white called Wyatt off the coast of Mozambique. A green, stringy line shows where the shark has swum since tagging and there are photographs of the shark itself. It's seriously fascinating.\nThe app was developed by some Australian scientists and shark tracking organisation OCEARCH.", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/yates-my-garden/id388924198?mt=8", "http://www.ocearch.org/", "https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/abc-vegie-guide/id600755873?mt=8", "https://plus.google.com/118426044981129025592", "https://twitter.com/jessicasier"], "published": "2015-10-19T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:20:19.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
