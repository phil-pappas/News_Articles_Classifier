Now is the perfect time to experience what you've been missing.\"\nThe campaign comes amid a slowdown in the PC market with shipments plunging 10.8 percent year-on-year in the third quarter on this year, according to market research firm IDC.\nMicrosoft unveiled its new Windows 10 operating system earlier this year and was offering users free upgrades, a reason analysts say was behind the market decline. But there is reason for optimism.\n\"While PC shipments will be hampered in the short run by the availability of a free upgrade to Windows 10, the improved PC experience across user segments should drive longer-term demand for new PC hardware that is expected help stabilize the market in 2016 and beyond,\" Jay Chou, research manager at IDC Worldwide PC Tracker, said in a note earlier this month.\n?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"> The manufacturers will be hoping this is true but have been focusing on new products to bolster sales of hardware. Earlier this year, Microsoft unveiled its first ever laptop – the Surface Book – which has a detachable keyboard to turn it into a tablet.\nLenovo is another company that produces a tablet with a detachable keyboard – known as a 2-in-1 or hybrid tablet in a bid to boost its tablet sales, while Apple has launched a large-screen iPad Pro with a similar function.\nThe PC Does What campaign will launch on October 19 and run until November 20 across online, TV and social media, the companies said. It will cost $70 million, according to a report by the Associated Press.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:49:21.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
