Reports of the incident say nothing about what happened at the moment of severance — it’s hard to imagine a cable at that voltage being severed without some spectacular fireworks — but there were no reports of any injuries. \nIn something of an understatement the cable’s owner, power company Ausgrid, was quoted saying it was: \"very fortunate to not have any injuries on this site. It could have easily been a different story.\" For injuries, read fatalities. \nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported that the cable had been cut by a contractor working for the local council on a new stormwater drain, curbs and guttering on Pittwater Road in the suburb of East Ryde at about 3pm cutting power to parts of Ryde, West Ryde, Meadowbank, Eastwood, Putney, Denistone and Rhodes. \nIt said that power had been cut to “thousands of families, Ryde Hospital and 20 sets of traffic lights across six suburbs, leading to peak hour traffic chaos and inconvenience to commuters, residents and businesses in the area.” Some of those affected were without power until nearly midnight. \nPress reports conflicted as to whether or not the Dial Before You Dig Service had been used. The Sydney Morning Herald quoted a council spokesman saying: \"In preparation for these works, Ausgrid together with the appointed contractor had several on-site visits in confirming the location of the high voltage cables prior to excavations commencing on the site. Confirmation was also made with the Dial a Dig [ sic ] service in confirming the location of the cables.\"\nHowever, another newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, appeared to leap to its own conclusion. “The workers who cut the cable obviously did not use the dial-before-you-dig [ sic ] service to check where cables are before starting work,” it said, but gave no indication that it had made any effort to verify this assumption. \nThe sad fact is that cable location information is not 100 percent accurate. Ausgrid’s own documentation on working near underground cables warns: “Not all cables are recorded on Ausgrid’s plans. Some are missed due to errors.” \nAn Ausgrid spokesman told the Sydney Morning Herald that there would be a formal investigation into the incident. So hopefully the truth will be revealed in the fullness of time. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:44:10.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
