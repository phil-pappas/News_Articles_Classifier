It comes as the group celebrated its 20th birthday on September 3 this year and after it split its PayPal business into a separate company in July - a move which prompted analyst concerns as it was the faster growing side of the business. For the three months to end September net income at the group fell to US539 million or 45 cents per share compared to 54 cents per share a year earlier. But excluding items that meant the company earned 43 cents per share which beat the average analyst estimate of 40 cents. Revenue in the quarter fell to US2.1bn but was up about 5% after excluding changes in currency rates.  Analysts had expected revenue of US2.09 billion. \"We drove solid results in the quarter in which we completed a complex separation\" eBay's president and chief executive Devin Wenig told investors. \"We also marked eBay's 20th anniversary and made progress on executing our strategy to reposition the company to deliver stable and profitable long-term growth.\" The group has 159 million active buyers and said its classifieds and StubHub ticket re-sale businesses had both had strong quarters. Looking ahead eBay  raised its forecast for adjusted profit from continuing operations for the full year to US1.80 to US1.82 per share from 1.72-1.77 previously. That was better than a consensus analyst forecast of 1.78 per share. After hours eBay shares rose almost 8% to US26.13 each.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:47:59.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
