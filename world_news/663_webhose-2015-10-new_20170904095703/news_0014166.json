With its unique multitenant architecture and dual format in-memory database technology, Oracle Database 12c is already helping customers embrace the cloud, deliver real-time analytics and harness Big Data. \n\"Oracle Database 12c Release 1 innovations such as the new Multitenant Architecture and Database In-Memory helped move our customers to the cloud and perform real-time analytics on their transactional data. Oracle Database 12c Release 2 continues to refine and enhance these capabilities,\" said Andy Mendelsohn, executive vice president, Database Server Technologies, Oracle. \"With Oracle Database 12c Release 2 beta program kicking off, we're delighted to bring our customers and partners into this next phase of the database development cycle.\" \n\"Having the opportunity to test and plan with early access to Oracle Database 12.2 has been very helpful while preparing for the 2020 census,\" said Subu Korisapati, Chief of Database and Middleware Services Branch of the US Census Bureau. \nOracle Database 12c Release 2 further simplifies the journey to the cloud and provides efficient delivery of database services, with greater consolidation density and more administrative agility at cloud scale. Focus areas that are planned for Oracle Database 12c Release 2 include: \nImproved Agility and Capacity with Enhancements to Oracle Multitenant : Planned enhancements include online movement of pluggable databases between servers, data centers and the Oracle Cloud. \nRefinements to Oracle Database In-Memory: Features to boost performance, automate management, and provide flexibility in deployment options are planned. \nEnhanced Support for Big Data Analytics: In addition to enhancements to Database In-Memory, plans include spatial performance improvements and improved support for graph analytics. \nHundreds of other new features: Drivers for all the key programming languages and frameworks have been enhanced. The release includes improvements to all the other main areas of customer interest including security, high availability, scalability, performance, and manageability. \n\"Oracle Database 12c Release 2 beta features, such as interval partitioning support on spatial indexes, can greatly speed up performance. We have built a platform that processes over 800 million rows of vehicle tracking data for a large European airport for real-time decision making. Oracle Spatial and Graph is the best engine to correlate this information, and Oracle Database 12c Release 2 can enable analysis in a few minutes instead of days,\" said Olivier Dubois, CEO, Oscars. \nSupporting Resources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:59:52.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
