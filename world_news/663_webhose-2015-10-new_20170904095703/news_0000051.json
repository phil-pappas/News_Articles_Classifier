The Surface Pro 4, along with the Surface Book, is now being shown at several Microsoft Store locations, including ones in Los Angeles, Dallas, New York City and Chicago. On the Microsoft Surface Forums , a user named “Philymonster” talks about their first impressions after seeing the device on display. \n“I saw the Surface Pro 4 at the Westfield Century City store in Los Angeles this weekend and I am very impressed. From the announcement, I didn’t realize how much everything has been improved. The Type Cover this time is actually usable and the screen looks absolutely amazing. They had the i5 model up and it seemed to be faster than the previous i5 model.” \nThe Surface Pro 4 shows a lot of changes from previous versions of Microsoft’s hot device.

Tech Times recently talked about the improvements made on Microsoft’s latest Surface Pro , which are a lot more than people previously expected. \n“The first visible upgrade is the Surface Pro 4’s 12.3-inch display, supporting a 2,736 x 1,824 resolution. It might not seem much considering that the 2014 model had a 12-inch screen, but it is noticeable. Also, the devices are equal in width, which offers users the familiar 3:2 aspect ratio from the prior model.” \nTech Times adds that not only is the Surface Pro 4 lighter and thinner than the Surface Pro 3, but that they keys on the Type Cover are more spread out. They also note that the Surface Pen is radically improved in terms of design and functionality. Christina Warren of The Mashable is impressed with the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover’s trackpad. \n“Additionally, Microsoft made the trackpad a lot nicer. It’s now 40% bigger and made of glass. To me, a better trackpad is even more important than the better keyboard. Even with Windows 10, I don’t really want to touch the screen all the time; sometimes I just want to do a gesture or point and click.” \nThe trackpad on the Surface Pro 3 Type Cover has been described as “unusable.” [Photo by Daryl Deino] Even though the Surface Pro 3 has received excellent reviews, many say that the Type Cover makes it barely usable, especially since the rubberized trackpad not only feels uncomfortable, but it is also erratic. Microsoft seems to improve things with every generation of the Type Cover. Those who don’t like the trackpad have always used the Microsoft Wedge Mouse , which works perfectly. \nTwitter is afloat with praise for the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. @JediIsAmmy Surface Pro 4 great for artists lots of amazing features and the touch sense is on point like a drawing pad, that is whats said", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:57:13.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
