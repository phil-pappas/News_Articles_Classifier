The system was developed by the subsidiary and will allow unused ink to be conserved, thereby improving the efficiency of the printing process of the 3D printer.\nNano Dimension Technologies applied for this patent in February 2015 . This is the second time that the subsidiary received a notice of allowance for a utility patent application within a year of the date of filing for the patent.\nThe system switches between three different modes: inkjet, cleaning and suction. The system, which is cooled either by a cooling liquid or air, supports an automatic switching between the modes, which allows the ink to maintain a certain temperature and avoid overheating.\nThe design of the system features a lid with narrow slots that are placed under the printheads during the inkjet process, in addition to a set of wider slots under the printheads that are adjustable during the cleaning process to provide easy access. In the suction mode, the printhead injects ink into a bath while a tube sucks the ink back into the main tank for reuse.\nAmit Dror , CEO of Nano Dimension, commented: \"The notice of allowance for our Utility Patent Application acknowledges this technological breakthrough and strengthens both our position in the market as well as our intellectual property portfolio. We are glad to receive this notice of allowance after such a short period of time following the filing date.\"\nAbout Nano Dimension\nNano Dimension was founded in 2012 and focuses on the research and development of advanced 3D electronics printing, including a printer for printing PCBs (printed circuit boards), and the development of nanotechnology-based ink products, which are complementary products for 3D printers.\nThe company was established by four seasoned entrepreneurs - Sharon Fima , Amit Dror , Simon Fried and Dagi Ben-Noon whose backgrounds are in world-class digital print companies and technology companies.\nNano Dimension uses a unique, novel technology which combines three technologies: inkjet, 3D printing and advanced nanotechnology, enabling the use of conductive ink for printing the conductors on PCBs. By integrating innovative, groundbreaking technologies, Nano Dimension is developing a unique and innovative 3D printer, which is capable of printing multi-layer PCBs, and supplies conductive Nano-inks to other fields in the electronics market.\nNano Dimension trades on OTCQXÂ® Best Market in the U.S and on the TASE in Israel .
