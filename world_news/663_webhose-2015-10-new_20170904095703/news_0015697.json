Photo: LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images Twitter has new analytics tools it says will provide marketers with additional insight into brand conversations, audiences and trends. The Twitter Brand Hub, unveiled today , is meant to give brands a \"360-degree, real-time view\" of their initiatives on the platform. One new metric called TrueVoice allows advertisers to track in real time what share of a conversation a brand has compared to its competitors. Along with a timeline of notifications, the tab also shows the total impressions that came from conversations about the brand in the past week. Another display details information about the people actively talking on Twitter about a brand broken down by gender, location, income level and occupation. Other pages let advertisers see how users are discussing the brand, including top phrases, brand loyalty and purchase intent. Lastly, big companies can segment conversations related to sub-brands and products. \"Every day, millions of people tweet about brands,\" according to a Twitter statement about the product. \"Each tweet has the potential to give advertisers new insights to better understand what customers, prospects, and influencers are saying, thinking, and feeling about their brand. To date, marketers haven't been able to gather these valuable insights in one place.\" Get the Technology Today newsletter: \nCheck out our other newsletters: Daily Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:43:43.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
