The findings inspired concept images outlining how we may shop for clothes in the future and what features people would like to see. \nThe fashion world is always quick to embrace new technologies. Now researchers at an online voucher code website have unveiled concept images detailing the findings from their recent study which revealed how Britons would like to shop for their clothing, shoes and accessories in the future. \nThe team at myvouchercodes.co.uk polled 3,486 UK adults aged over 18 as part of their study, equally split between men and women. Those polled were initially asked how much time they spent shopping for clothes each month. The majority of female respondents (26%) stated that they spend about 3-6 hours shopping in stores, whilst the majority of male respondents 46% said they spent 1-2 hrs clothes shopping per month in store. \nThe participants were then asked to reveal how important technological changes in the way we shop were to them. The majority, 43% agreed that they are 'very important'. \nAdditionally the respondents were then asked to look ahead 10 years into the future and to choose from an extensive list of technological changes to the way we will shop in store. The most popular answers were split between women and men and emerged as follows: Female Personalised holog­raphic manne­quins – 25% Geo-targeted discounts & voucher codes – 25% Virtual stores with touch­screens – 23% Self-service contactless payment – 20% Social media connected changing room – 8% Male Virtual stores with touch­screens – 24% Perso­nalised holographic manne­quins – 21% Geo-targeted discounts & voucher codes – 19% Social media connected changing room – 9% \nThe results from the extensive study were then created as concept images by MyVoucherCodes' patent designer to show the most popular features people would want to see in the future. They can be found here: \nMark Pearson founder of MyVoucherCodes made the following comment on the image created alongside the research: \"With this research we wanted to find out exactly how we could be shopping in the future and what technological advances Britons would like to make it a better and faster experience. Over the last few years we have seen technology change the way we do everyday tasks and looking ahead, the way we shop for clothes will no doubt change considerably.\" \nHe added: \"One thing for sure is that we know that mobile technology will have a huge impact, it already is doing. The way we use newer technologies will no doubt change the way we shop. It might seem scary at first but eventually, like all new technologies, it will soon become the norm quicker than we think. Many of the ideas and concepts are already available in some form or another and others will no doubt be available within the next decade if not the next five years.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:05:11.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
