Directions by Justice Rajive Bhalla of the High Court came during the hearing of the traffic regulation and road safety case. Taking up the matter, Justice Bhalla asked the state to file an affidavit specifying the reasons why six-laning had come to a standstill. The state was also asked to specify in particular the reason resulting in stopping of the project “particularly the area that passes through Zirakpur”. The directions came after a report was filed before the High Court after “inspection of the national highway and the highway around Zirakpur”. Taking the report on record, Justice Bhalla asked the National Highway Authority of India, Zirakpur Municipal Council, and the state of Punjab to file their response. “The NHAI shall consider putting guardrails along the stretch of the national highway that runs through Zirakpur so as to ensure that there is no encroachment on the national highway,” Justice Bhalla added before parting with the orders. The High Court has also already directed the Mohali police to initiate immediate action against vehicles parked along the stretch of the national highway passing through Zirakpur to ensure free flow of traffic under the flyover. Justice Bhalla, on the previous date of hearing, had also asked the in charge of the Zirakpur traffic wing to ensure that vehicles were not parked in the service lanes constructed within the right of way (ROW) or on the land of the national highway. Justice Bhalla had also directed the municipal council to instal more CCTV cameras under the flyover at the turnings towards Patiala and Baltana to watch and regulate the traffic. The court also asked the municipal authorities to carry out a survey first. The MC counsel informed the court that efforts were being made to demarcate an area, public or private, where street vendors would be encouraged to vend their wares, at a location to be identified by the civic body. Justice Bhalla had also rapped the state of Punjab, Zirakpur Municipal Council, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for the unplanned urban development in the area. Justice Bhalla had also asserted categorically that the authorities were apparently indifferent towards the plight of the travelling public. Blaming them for squabbling among themselves on inconsequential questions such as jurisdiction, Justice Bhalla had also called for the holding of a joint meeting for resolving daily traffic-related issues. Justice Bhalla added the parties concerned were also dodging liability for muddle beneath the Zirakpur fly-over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:55:46.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
