Some die from pneumonia or malnourishment. Some with the defect, which is basically a hole in the mouth, are euthanised.\nBut the same techniques that repair cleft palates in children can be used with dogs - even in challenging cases like Mr Moo, a 9-month-old mixed breed puppy who was eating through a tube because of a cleft palate.\nUsually soft tissue from the same area of the mouth is used to build a flap to cover the hole. But there was no soft tissue near Mr Moo's defect. Dr Bryden Stanley, chief of surgery for small animals at Michigan State University's College of Veterinary Medicine in Lansing, wasn't sure how to solve the problem.\nThen she met Dr John Girotto, director of craniofacial surgery at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Girotto told Stanley he would do for the puppy what he does for children with no soft tissue - take it from the inside of the cheek.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:27:08.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
