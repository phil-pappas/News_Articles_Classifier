Despite that, given what they found, and how this was handled, they are 'excited' to offer me a reward.\"\nGoogle to companies: Be nice to hackers Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGiving money to people who flag up potential security or administrative flaws is a common practice at Google and other tech companies.
