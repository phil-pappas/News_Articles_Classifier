A second Google phone, the Nexus 5X, will be made by South Korea's LG. \nAt a time when Chinese firms are struggling to break the dominance of Apple and Samsung on the high end of the smartphone market, the partnership is a milestone for Huawei. \n“Clearly, working with Google is vote of confidence in the technology of the product,” said Ian Fogg, senior director at the consultancy IHS Technology. \nFogg said the Nexus devices “are intended to be showcases of the best of Android technology, and are designed to be seen as innovation leaders... that's an incredibly valuable association to have”. The new Nexus 6P phone was introduced by Google at a press event in San Francisco, California. The Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P phones run on Android Marshmallow.

The company denies the allegations. \nLast year, news reports said the US National Security Agency had been secretly tapping the company's networks for years. \nHuawei is one of the largest providers of network infrastructure globally, but its consumer products are less well-known outside China. \nSome analysts say it remains questionable whether Huawei can parlay the Google deal into a stronger position in the smartphone market. \n“I think people gravitate toward Nexus because it is a Google device,” said Ramon Llamas, who follows mobile technology for research firm IDC. \nLlamas said other manufacturers partnering with Google on Nexus - HTC, LG and Motorola, for example - have failed to get a major boost for their brands from the deals. \n“Huawei could see some boost in sales but not enough to catapult them to a challenge of Samsung or Apple,” he told AFP. \nWhile Chinese makers have gained ground recently - lifted in part by Lenovo's acquisition of the Motorola brand - “none of them are breaking away from the pack,” Llamas said. “Apple and Samsung really control the high end.” \nBut IHS's Fogg said the mobile market can shift quickly, pointing out that previous market leaders like Nokia and BlackBerry have seen their leadership fade quickly. \n“Nothing is forever in the smartphone market,” Fogg said. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:29:02.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
