In chemical composition , they are similar to kaolin and can be considered as rolled kaolin sheets with inner diameter of 10 to 20 nm, outer diameter of 40 to 70 nm and a length of 500 to 1500 nm. The internal side of halloysite is composed of Al2O3, while the external is mainly SiO2. \nThe inner lumen of halloysite may be adjusted by etching to 20 to 30% of the tube volume and used as a natural nanocontainer for loading and sustained release of chemical agents. These ceramic nanotubes form a \"skeleton\" in the bulk polymers, enhancing the composite strength and adhesivity. These \"skeleton bones\" may be loaded with active compounds, like real bones are loaded with marrow, providing additional functionality for polymers (antimicrobial, anti-aging, anticorrosion, and flame-retardancy). \nHalloysite tubes can encase enzymes for longer storage, higher temperature, and extended functionality, while the tube's opening allows for delivery of small substrate molecules into the tube interior for biocatalysis. Loading DNA into halloysite is another prospective research direction. As functional nanoblocks, halloysite tubes may be used for building on biological cells, like the formation of spore-like microbial shells providing microorganisms with additional functions. \nIn vitro and in vivo studies on biological cells and worms indicate the safety of halloysite, and furthermore, it can store and release molecules in a controllable manner, making these tiny containers attractive for applications in drug delivery, antimicrobial materials, self-healing polymeric composites, and regenerative medicine. \nThe material, however, is not biodegradable, as there are no biological mechanisms to degrade this alumosilicate clay in the body, and it cannot be injected in the blood intravenously, but rather may be used for external medical treatment with slow release of encapsulated drugs (e.g., in creams, implants, or wound treatment of tissues). Tiny 'Lego' blocks build Janus nanotubes with potential for new drugs and water purification November 14, 2013 \nResearchers have created tiny protein tubes named after the Roman god Janus which may offer a new way to accurately channel drugs into the body's cells. Studying the behaviour of steel tubes filled with concrete foam March 31, 2014 \nUiTM researchers have found that steel tubes filled with foam concrete was inferior in strength as compared to that of normal concrete. Wrapping carbon nanotubes in polymers enhances their performance March 31, 2015 \nScientists at Japan's Kyushu University say polymer-wrapped carbon nanotubes hold much promise in biotechnology and energy applications. The paper was recently published in Science and Technology of Advanced Materials.
