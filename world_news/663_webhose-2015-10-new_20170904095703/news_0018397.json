The new app being hailed as the “Yelp for People” has mysteriously vanished, along with some of its social media accounts. \nThe new app called Peeple had plans to launch in November of this year. It would be the first app that would allow users to rate and review each other, just like businesses on Yelp. Peeple’s official website has gone offline , along with the company’s Twitter and Facebook accounts. That means users are no longer able to access the social media accounts to share their thoughts on the new app. Some are saying that the backlash was so strong that it crashed the app’s website and Facebook page. \nCo-founders Julia Cordray and Nicole McCullough have not addressed why they removed their Facebook page, but they did address the deactivation of Peeple’s Twitter account in a recent blog post on LinkedIn . They’re still hiding out on the professional social networking site if you want to know where to find them. \n“We have only ever had @peepleforpeeple and have removed it off of Twitter as we felt that Twitter is a place for abuse not business and they don’t do anything to protect its users.” \nThat’s ironic since there would be no way for people to protect their identity on the Peeple app. According to the sites that are now offline, anyone can rate and review anyone else in the world. There’s no way for you to remove a review about you that’s placed on the app. Cordray insists that Peeple is a “positivity app,” but that hasn’t stopped her from receiving death threats and harassing comments after her infamous interview with the Washington Post . \nThe controversial Peeple app no longer has social media accounts or a website http://t.co/y3t3CN0RPn pic.twitter.com/5wRxnm3njE \n— BBC Newsbeat (@BBCNewsbeat) October 5, 2015 \nThe company still has remained mum as to why their Facebook page and official website has gone offline. When attempting to access forthepeeple.com, the “Not Found” page pops up instead. However, some users have claimed that they were taken to another landing page with the following message , “Join the positive revolution #Oct12,” according to a recent report via BBC News . \nOctober 12 is presumably the day when Cordray and McCullogh will address the controversy surrounding their new app. According to the report, they “will be taping for an exclusive talk show and expose our concept to the world,” the co-founders stated in an email to the British broadcasting company. \nNow some are speculating as to whether or not Peeple is just another online hoax. According to the myth-busting website Snopes.com , some have remarked how the company’s announcement of the Peeple app was so abrupt, since there were no previous mentions of it on tech blogs or news sites. There were also no other specific details about the app, including what it may look like and any of the app’s impending features. \nPeeple, the “Yelp for People,” dropped off the face of social media. Thank god. http://t.co/aYi55MD4YQ \n— Moneybox (@SlateMoneybox) October 5, 2015 \nCordray has denied allegations that the new app was a hoax in her blog post on LinkedIn. \n“The answer is: It’s real but not in the way it’s currently being portrayed. We are in fact creating an app called Peeple and have every intention of releasing it at the end of November.” \nIn her blog post, she kept referring to as a “positivity app.” Cordray then added that a previously announced feature that would allow negative reviews after a certain amount of time would no longer be a part of the app. According to a previous report on the Next Web , the Peeple app is completely pointless since you’re just gloating about the people in your life. \n“I want the world to be positive and this is how I’m going to inspire it by creating the world’s largest positivity app.” \nThat hasn’t stopped some from creating a petition on Change.org to ban the launch of the Peeple app. The petition currently has over 3,000 signatures. \nCordray also addressed the concern that has been on most user’s minds: would they have their names listed on the app without their permission? \nShe wrote, “You will NOT be on our platform with your explicit permission. […] Simply stated, if you don’t explicitly say ‘approve recommendation,’ it will not be visible on our platform.” \nBut the people of the internet are still not impressed, even with the co-founder’s attempts change Peeple the app. Some have created the hashtag #PeoplevsPeeple on Twitter to complain about the app while others have resorted to making accounts mocking the new app. \nWhat are your thoughts on the Peeple app? Do you think it should still launch or that it should disappear, much like the company’s website and social media accounts?
