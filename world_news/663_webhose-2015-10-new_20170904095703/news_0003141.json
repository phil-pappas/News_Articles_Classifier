( 1.usa.gov/1Gbb31A ) \n\"We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce,\" Dorsey said in a letter to employees. \"And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.\" \nShares of Twitter, which had about 4,100 employees globally as of June 30, rose 1.5 percent to $29.18 in premarket trading on Tuesday. \nThe company said it expected to incur about $10 million-$20 million in severance costs and $5 million-$15 million in restructuring charges.
