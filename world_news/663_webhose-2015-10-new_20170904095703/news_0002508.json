PFSA agents will be able to access member data and submit new business applications via Andesa’s online agent portal, with zero paper and a process that limits data entry to one-time; with data flowing directly from the illustration to the admin system. \n“We are excited at the opportunities created by this move,” PFSA Executive Treasurer and CFO Helen Vieira said. “Andesa’s solutions will allow us to provide policy information to existing members, bring new products to market faster via a streamlined sales cycle, mitigate risk, create efficiencies in the home office and more. We fully expect that these business process improvements will result in increased member satisfaction and sustainable growth.” \n“Updating to a modern and flexible technology platform can be a positive game changer for a fraternal organization,” said Ron Scheese, President and CEO of Andesa Services. “Our team is beyond excited that PFSA has chosen Andesa to partner in helping achieve their business objectives.” \nPFSA is the second nationwide fraternal society to choose Andesa’s robust, cloud-based life insurance solutions. Earlier this year, the National Catholic Society of Foresters announced its decision to move more than 30,000 active contracts to the Andesa system. \nAbout PFSA \nThe Portuguese Fraternal Society of America is committed to drawing together families of Portuguese-American and other nationalities in the states of California, Nevada and elsewhere in the United States of America; promoting Portuguese–American cultural, social, fraternal, and charitable activities to our members, their families, and others; and issuing life insurance, annuity certificates and other products for the protection and benefit of our members and their dependents.
