Sonus' WebRTC Services Solution is the most scalable, secure WebRTC offering—balancing the usability advantages of WebRTC with the security provided by Sonus' core SBCs.

WebRTC SDK – JavaScript libraries and Application Program Interfaces (APIs), including media stream, peer connection and data channel support for voice, video, IM, desktop sharing, presence and conferencing. The Sonus WebRTC SDK enables developers to quickly build new mobile and desktop applications and services for the two billion WebRTC enabled endpoints today. Sonus' WebRTC solution supports iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, native WebRTC supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox and Opera) and via SDK plugin, non-WebRTC browsers (Safari, Microsoft IE). The Sonus WebRTC Solution integrates with the SBC Release 5.0, allowing media interworking of the WebRTC Solution with SIP by providing secure media interworking.
