That will come at some point in the future,\" said Musk.\n\"It should not hit pedestrians, hopefully,\" he said. \"It should handle them well.\"\nTo minimise risk, the driver must keep their hands on the wheel when the autopilot mode is enabled. The car will chime out if the hands are removed to remind them.\n\"We’re being especially cautious at this early stage, so we’re advising drivers to keep their hands on the wheel just in case,” said Musk. Adding that the software \"is very new.”\nTesla The software will use sensors and cameras on the car as well as mapping software to determine its position\nAbout 60,000 vehicles around the world will be receiving the update. Some of the older versions of the Model S aren't able to receive it because they don't have required sensors for the software to work.\nAccording to Tesla, the software will continue to improve itself by \"learning\" the driving abilities of people behind the wheel.\n“I think this is going to be quite a profound experience for people,” Musk said. “It will change people’s perception of the future quite drastically.”\nGetty Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla\nOther companies, most famously Google , but also Volvo, Audi and BMW are experimenting with autonomous and semi-autonomous cars.\nEven Apple is rumoured to be building its own car .\nGetty A Tesla Motors Inc. badge is displayed on the company's Model S sedan electric vehicle\nThe average driver in England spends 235 hours driving every year - the equivalent of six working weeks.\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:39:28.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
