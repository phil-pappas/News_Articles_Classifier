Credit: NRL/NASA/NOAA \nNASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite passed over Tropical Depression Nora on October 14 and saw strong wind shear pushing the bulk of clouds and showers northeast of the center. \nAt 12:15 UTC (8:15 a.m. EDT) on Oct. 14 infrared data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite or VIIRS instrument that flies aboard Suomi NPP revealed most of the depression 's thunderstorms were being pushed northeast of the center from strong southwesterly vertical wind shear. \nThe latest University of Wisconsin- Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies vertical wind shear analysis showed 44 knots (50.6 mph / 81.4 kph) of wind shear from the southwest and ships guidance showed 34 knots (39.1 mph/62.9 kph) of shear from the same direction. \nVIIRS is a scanning radiometer that collects visible and infrared imagery and \"radiometric\" measurements. Basically it means that VIIRS data is used to measure cloud and aerosol properties, ocean color, and ocean and land surface temperatures. The Suomi NPP satellite is co-managed by both NASA and NOAA. \nOn October 14, 2015 at 11 a.m. EDT (5 a.m. HST/1500 UTC) Nora was a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds near 35 mph (55 kph). It was centered near 14.9 North latitude and 151.1 West longitude, about 425 miles (680 km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression was moving toward the west near 5 mph (7 kph) and is expected to turn northwest then west by October 15. \nNOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) said that swells generated by Nora will produce hazardous surf along the southeast facing shores of the big island of Hawaii through Thursday evening, October 15. \nCPHC expects the depression to weaken to a post-tropical remnant low pressure area late on October 14. NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP peers into Tropical Storm Dujuan September 23, 2015 \nNASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite passed over Tropical Storm Dujuan on Sept. 23 and saw a large and elongated circulation. NASA sees wind shear affecting Tropical Storm Niala September 25, 2015 \nNASA's Aqua satellite saw wind shear was affecting newborn Tropical Storm Niala as it continued moving through the Central Atlantic Ocean. NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP sees wind-shear battered extra-tropical Oho October 8, 2015 \nInfrared data from NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite showed Tropical Storm Oho weakening over cool waters and transitioning into an extra-tropical cyclone while being battered by strong wind shear. Suomi NPP gets an infrared look at Tropical Storm Nora October 13, 2015 \nTropical Storm Nora's cloud top temperatures appeared to be warming up on infrared imagery from NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite. Warming cloud top temperatures means less uplift in the air and a weaker storm. Nora is on a ... Suomi NPP spots twenty-fifth tropical depression in Northwestern Pacific October 13, 2015 \n2015 has been an active year for tropical cyclones in the northwestern Pacific Ocean as NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite spotted the twenty-fifth tropical depression.
