It’s all part of the job if you’re a woman reporting on sport. \nYou might think there’s never been a better time to be a female sports writer or broadcaster, but a nasty current of abuse hovers just out of sight. \nBy the time The Footy Show presenter Erin Molan quit Kiis FM last year after being asked how many sportsmen she’d had sex with and whether she’d had a boob job, she was more than used to it. \n“When I started I got a lot of ‘You should be in the kitchen’, and those were the nice ones,” the Channel Nine presenter told news.com.au. “I’ve copped some nasty tweets and comments. You always see them, but I’m much better at dealing with them now. You’ve got to have a good support network and be in a good place. If I’m feeling tired and vulnerable, it will affect me more.” \nNo wonder — logging on to vitriolic tweets including, “You are a filthy b**** who has sucked c*** 2 get where u are” and “F*** off @Erin_Molan I hope fatty kicks you in the c***” can’t be easy, but the 32-year-old is philosophical.
