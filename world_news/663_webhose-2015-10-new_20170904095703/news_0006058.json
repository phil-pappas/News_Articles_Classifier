Matthew Busch Share on twitter by John Davidson Michael Dell has struck back at critics of his $US67 billion agreement to purchase EMC, labelling as \"ridiculous\" the criticism from HP Enterprise boss Meg Whitman that the purchase will burden Dell and EMC with so much debt that the combined companies won't be able to serve their customers properly.\nEarlier in October, Dell, one of the world's biggest PC and server manufacturers, announced it had struck an agreement to purchase EMC, one of the world's largest data storage manufacturers, for $US67 billion, most of which will be borrowed.\nIf the deal makes it through regulatory approval and through EMC's \"go-shop\" period where it can look for higher bidders, it will be the largest tech merger in history, turning the privately owned Dell into a dominant force in the data centres that drive much of the internet and so-called \"cloud computing\".\nAfter the deal was announced, Mr Dell's rival Ms Whitman said it would hobble both Dell and EMC:\nAfter the EMC deal was announced, Mr Dell's rival Meg Whitman of HP said it would hobble both Dell and EMC. Reuters \"To pay back the interest on the $US50 billion of debt that the new combined company will have on their balance sheet, Dell will need to pay roughly $US2.5 billion a year in interest alone,\" She said.\n\"That's $US2.5 billion that they will allocate away from R&D and other business critical activities, which will keep them from better serving their customers\".\nWhitman hypocrisy But speaking to The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday at Dell's annual user conference here in Austin, Texas, Mr Dell accused Ms Whitman of hypocrisy.\n \"In the last year HP spent more than $US4.5 billion on interest, dividends and share repurchase. So I think it's a bit ridiculous, the comment she has made, in the context of what she herself is doing. I don't know that there is much more to say about that,\" he said.\nDell's acquisition of EMC will leave it with a similar structure to HP, which recently spun off half its business to create two separate companies: HP Inc, which will sell PCs and printers; and HP Enterprise, which will sell servers, storage, networking and services.\nThe Dell/EMC merger won't leave the two companies as neatly split as that - EMC and Dell will each have a number of products in the enterprise space - but it should leave Dell/EMC and HP/HP Enterprise as fierce rivals. Indeed, Ms Whitman said she views the Dell deal as vindication of her own strategy, but one that will help HP as Dell struggles to digest all it has bitten off.\nAt the Dell World conference, Mr Dell, who owns roughly 75 per cent of Dell Inc after leading a management buyout in 2013, explained some of the thinking behind the record-breaking deal.\nDell and EMC had formed a partnership last decade, in which Dell sold servers and EMC sold storage to large customers, which at its peak was generating almost $US2 billion a year in revenue, Mr Dell told the AFR.\nThat partnership came unstuck in 2009 and 2010, leaving Mr Dell thinking about buying EMC.\n\"[This is] not the first time I've had the idea to acquire EMC. In fact, we've had discussions in the past.\" he admitted.\n\"Then about a year ago I talked to [EMC chairman and CEO] Joe [Tucci], talked about this as a possibility.\n\"What I saw was the businesses were highly complimentary, and where you look at where the world is going in terms of digital transformation, software-defined [data centres], converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud, security and mobile, the combined company has a very strong position in all those areas, maybe the strongest in the industry.\n\"And there is also, let's not forget, how work is done today in the world. And the combined company has a world-leading position in those areas as well: in servers and storage and virtualisation and PCs.\n\"There are highly complementary go-to-market engines - at Dell we have incredibly reach and breadth with customers of all sizes all over the world, [while] EMC is really at the top of the world with these 1000 largest companies.\n\"They have an innovation and R&D engine and the ability to incubate businesses that is second to none; we have a global supply chain and scale that is the strongest in the world; and we'll be able to do all this as a private company.\"\nNot only would EMC be better off as a privately owned company, no longer subject to the \"90-day shot clock\" that made it hard for technology companies to invest in medium- and long-term technologies, but indeed the merger may never have happened if Dell hadn't been a private company, he said.\n\"It would have been technically possible, but probably extremely difficult, for Dell if it had been a public company. Certainly being a private company has given us great flexibility and agility, even as a large company, to re-imagine what our company can become and to make forward-thinking investments without really being obsessed with the short-term impact of those decisions,\" Mr Dell said.\nJohn Davidson is attending Dell World as a guest of Dell.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:22:58.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
