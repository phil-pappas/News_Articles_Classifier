Bloomberg Kantar's strategic insight director for Asia Tamsin Timpson said 74 per cent of Australian iPhone 6 buyers in the past three months had owned an iPhone previously, but about 8.5 per cent of buyers had jumped ship from Samsung and Sony. Those asked by Kantar why they had switched mostly said they had been driven by exclusive promotions on offer from the large carriers.\nIt was a disappointing quarter in Australia for Samsung in terms of market share, which fell from 35.1 per cent in August 2014 to 33.7 per cent in August 2015. But its volume sales were up 30 per cent year on year, aided by strong sales of Australia's second most popular phone, the Galaxy S6. Notably the older Galaxy S5 still ranks third.\n\"While Samsung flagship model sales are healthy and other brands such as Huawei, Acer and Asus continue to gain momentum, the decrease in Android share performance continues to be driven by the sharp losses experienced by Sony and HTC, with LG showing some uplift on the July figures, due to the G3,\" Ms Timpson said.\nMicrosoft push The Samsung Galaxy S6 is on top of Apple's iPhone 6 in this picture, but sits second behind it in the Australian sales rankings. John Davidson Of note in Australia were promising signs for Microsoft, which is betting big on phones and devices running its new Windows 10 operating system to make it a force in the mobile world. The company held a product launch in New York on Wednesday, but even before that the August quarter showed Australians were among the most receptive globally to ditching Android or iOS for Windows.\nWindows' market share in Australia increased by 2.3 percentage points year on year, from 5.1 per cent to 7.4 per cent. It also has notable market share of 10.5 per cent in Germany, 13.7 per cent in Italy, 11.3 per cent in Britain, and 13.1 per cent in France. But in the US, Windows was languishing, with a market share of just 3.5 per cent, Kantar said.\n\"Windows Phone share has experienced some growth in France, Germany and Australia and maintained share elsewhere, but we have not seen any major impact on the overall market, despite some aggressive price points,\" Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar, said.\n\"At the Windows 10 New York launch on October 6 we saw Microsoft refocused on offering a companion phone for users of Windows 10, and enterprise-class devices to IT departments â€“ a more modest goal perhaps, but certainly a more realistic one.\"\nKantar Worldpanel ComTech smartphone sales for the August 2015 quarter. Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Chinese battle Elsewhere in the world, US market share for Apple iOS was at its lowest point since August 2014, as consumers waited for the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to become available in September.\nMs Milanese said such a slowdown was to be expected before a new release and early indications suggested a very strong current quarter for Apple after the new iPhones went on sale.\n\"While a month from now may still be too early to report initial sales numbers for the new models, we can say today that 11 per cent of iOS owners told us in August that they plan to replace their current phone in the next three months, and 87 per cent of these have told us Apple is their preferred brand,\" Ms Milanese said.\nOf most importance to Apple in recent times has been its bid to dominate the enormous and growing Chinese market, in the face of competition from lower-priced rivals.\nMs Timpson said smartphone sales represented 84 per cent of overall phone sales in urban China during the three months ending in August, with the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus at the top of the list of best-selling models.\nIn China Android dominates, with 78.1 per cent of the market. But that fell by 5.6 percentage points during the August quarter. Apple's iOS, meanwhile, grew by a similar 5.1 percentage points to have 19.4 per cent of the Chinese market.\n\"Buyers mentioned clarity and resolution of the screen, quality of the camera and the size of the screen as the three most important purchase drivers,\" Ms Timpson said.", "external_links": ["http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/smartphone-os-market-share/"], "published": "2015-10-08T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:19:25.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
