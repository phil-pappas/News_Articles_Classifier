The report states that \"Sars should consider investigating circumstances that led to the reduction of Ronnie Kasrils ' interest for the tax period between 1999 to 2006\".\n\"In light of the activities of (former SARS acting commissioner Ivan) Pillay during the aforesaid period, it may as well be that the reduction of interest was done unlawfully and influenced by partisan political considerations. In an event where such reduction was made unlawfully, Sars should consider recovering the amount,\" the report states.\nKasrils explained to City Press this week that a bungle by his previous tax advisor - who failed to inform Sars that he was married to his late wife Eleanor in community of property, understated his expenses, and told the taxman that he had bought a house in the Cape Town suburb of St James for private and not investment purposes - had led to an initial tax bill of R255 000.", "external_links": ["http://whoswho.co.za/ronnie-kasrils-915", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=915"], "published": "2015-10-10T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:54:15.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
