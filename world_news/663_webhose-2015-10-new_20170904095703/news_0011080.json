Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET\nHulk punching Thor? Check!\nAgent Coulson punching Loki with a spring-loaded boxing glove gun? Check!\nHot Dog Man? Er...Check?\nBehold the New York Comic Con trailer for Lego Marvel's Avengers game -- due out January 26 from TT Games.\nThe new Lego Marvel's Avengers game trailer features multiple heroes and villains from not only \"The Avengers\" and \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron\" movies but also the standalone Marvel character films \"The Captain America: The First Avenger,\" \"Thor: The Dark World,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Iron Man 3.\"\nThat means you'll most likely get to relive your favorite battles including the Battle of New York between the Avengers and Loki, as well as the Age of Ultron battle. There's even a slap fight between Captain America and Iron Man.\nWhile the heroic battles are similar, there are still quite a few unusual gags fans can expect in the game that only Lego can provide. After all, who else would make the Hulk fall in love with a chicken?\nThe game, which comes out next year, will be available for Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo's Wii U, Nintendo 3DS and PC.", "external_links": ["http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/12/70e22c49-e9f1-4f7d-88e2-620cb6df53c0/resize/570xauto/034df27088c25b84500ce31a6cee2f21/avengers2.jpg", "https://youtu.be/mBvhzBh5BZI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mBvhzBh5BZI"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:15:10.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
