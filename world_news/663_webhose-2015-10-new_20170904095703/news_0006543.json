ITx 2016, to be held at Wellington’s TSB Arena and Shed 6 complex on 11-13 July 2016, will include 12 individual tech-related conferences under one roof. Aimed at those working in the software and IT industry, ITx 2016 will include diverse specialist conferences focusing on areas such as testing, tech education, agile, communications, innovation and the internet, IT project management, professional practice, open source, exporting and commercialization, and more.In announcing ITx 2016, IITP CEO Paul Matthews said that the ITx concept had been born as a 3-conference collaboration in 2014 and the model had been hugely successful. “ITx brings the wider tech community together while maintaining specialisations, the best of both worlds”, Matthews said. “ITx will bring together leaders in the tech sector from around New Zealand and the world”. NZTech CEO Graeme Muller pointed to ITx as a great example of a united industry working together. “While we and others have growing individual programmes of events and other activities, ITx is a great opportunity for our sector to come together as one”, Muller said. itSMFnz President Tristan Boot echoed that sentiment. “For the first time, itSMF Conference delegates will not only get the best of service management, but have the opportunity to learn and network with professionals from right across the sector”, Boot said. “Being involved with other organisations in the ICT area fits nicely with our common need to collaborate as we look to raise New Zealand into a top 10 nation for business usage of ICT,” said TUANZ CEO Craig Young . NZRise Co-chair Victoria MacLennan also welcomed ITx 2016 and the unashamed focus on the industry. “New Zealand’s digital technology industry is a thriving sector and large employer. It makes perfect sense to bring as many smart people as possible together under one roof”, MacLennan said. Computing and IT Research and Education New Zealand (CITRENZ) Co-Chair Alison Clear says ITx as an opportunity for even greater collaboration across education and industry. “The successful CITRENZ conference has been fostering that education/industry partnership since 1988, and ITx is a great opportunity to grow that massively”, Clear said. InternetNZ Chief Executive Jordan Carter also highlighted the importance of collaboration and the tech industry working together. \"We are pleased to be a part of ITx as an opportunity to work together with organisations and events from around the tech industry. ITx will be an exciting opportunity for collaboration in shaping the future of the Internet for the benefit of New Zealand,\" says Carter. The Project Management Institute of New Zealand’s South Island Chair, James Dobson , is thrilled that PMINZ are a part of ITx. “Our annual Conference (usually held in Sept/Oct) focusses on Project Management across all industries. 40% of our members are IT Project Managers, so getting the chance to rub shoulders with the key players in the industry is a great opportunity. One of PMINZ’s key goals is to work more closely organizations where there is a crossover with project management – this will certainly allow us to do just that!”, Dobson said. ITx 2016 will also see conferences across health IT, testing, agile, telecommunications, internet innovation, open source and IT project management. Health Informatics NZ (HINZ) CEO Kim Mundell said ITx was a great opportunity for those involved in Health IT to get together to hear about the latest in both health informatics and the sector as a whole. “This is the best of both worlds”, Mundell said.
