Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey is hitting the reset button with developers.\n“Somewhere along the line, our relationship with developers got a little confusing, a little complicated, a little unpredictable,” he said at the company’s Flight conference for software programmers in San Francisco. “We want to come to you today and — first and foremost — apologize for the confusion and reset the relationship. We are learning, we are listening and we are rebooting.”\nDorsey is working to appeal to the engineers who write applications that tie into Twitter’s platform for sending and sharing 140-character updates. In the past, the social media company has shut down popular applications after changing rules about how developers could use its data; now Dorsey is asking developers for feedback on the company’s service.\nDorsey is setting the stage for his CEO tenure, which officially began two weeks ago. He’s has already made some big moves, cutting 8 percent of the staff last week and appointing the former chief business officer at Google, Omid Kordestani, executive chairman.\nSarah Frier is a Bloomberg writer.
