Williamsburg, Va. (UPI) Oct 2, 2015 - Until recently, researchers had few clues as to where exactly young peregrine falcons go on their inaugural trip from natal territory to wintering grounds.\nThey knew it was an important time in a young bird's life. In between, the adolescent falcons learn how to become self-sufficient. Their paths of self-discovery don't follow strict north-south trajectories, but neither are they aimless. \nNew analysis of more than a decade's worth of satellite tracking data suggests maturing falcons are drawn to significant geologic formations, as well as towering urban structures. The falcons move from place to place, convening with other falcons, visiting places their parents and relatives likely visited -- the peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Brooklyn Bridge. \nResearchers at the Center for Conservation Biology, a joint effort between the College of William and Mary and Virginia Commonwealth University, tracked peregrines across 23 states. The birds' flight patterns revealed a strong affinity for the major cities of the East -- Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Cleveland and Detroit. \nTheir movements are most concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard and southern Appalachians. Moving inland, the birds' migrations are bounded by the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. \nTheir paths from natal territory to winter grounds averaged a length of 48 days. \nDespite the new insights provided by center's tracking efforts, scientists say the exact nature of the interactions between young falcons -- or what exactly they learn from their travels -- isn't clear. \nConservationists say worsening haze in Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia is causing problems for animals, especially migratory birds. \nNow is the time when birds move from their breeding grounds to their wintering grounds. Their trips are made using a combination of navigational skills -- innate mental maps, as well as visual, electromagnetic and astronomical cues. \nHeavy smog and haze created by poorly regulated industry and auto traffic in Southeast Asia are disrupting traveling birds' ability to see the visual and astronomical cues they rely on. \n\"People think the haze has caused them problems but animals, in particular migratory birds, have it much worse,\" Vincent Chow, Malaysian Nature Society Johor chairman, told reporters. \"They need to see the stars to guide them from East Asia to South-east Asia, making their way to the coastline of Johor to find food such as small fish.\" \nChow says the smog can also prevent animals on the ground from successfully foraging for food. \nWhile Chow doesn't cite new scientific evidence on the subject, previous studies have proven the potential problems man-made pollution can cause migrating birds. \nResearch has shown growing light pollution disrupts the biological clocks and behaviors of a range of birds and mammals, and a 2014 study in Denmark suggested AM radio waveband electromagnetic interference can drown out the magnetic compass of robins. \nMalaysia is an important stopover point in the middle of the East Asia-Australasia Flyway, an expansive north-south migratory route -- from Australia up along East India and Southeast Asia, and north towards China and Mongolia -- used by some 50 million birds and nearly 500 species. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:35:00.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
