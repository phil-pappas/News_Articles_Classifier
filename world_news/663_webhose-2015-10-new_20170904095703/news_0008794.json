CEO Kazuo Hirai told a technology conference on Tuesday that following the hack, the movie studio has \"come out more resilient, more strong and they have a very good management team in place now.\" Hirai said there wasn't much of a business impact from the hack, although he said employee morale was hurt for a short time.\nFormer Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal left her position after a trove of embarrassing emails was leaked, including racially insensitive remarks about President Barack Obama 's purported taste in movies. She continues to run a production venture at Sony that will handle major blockbuster franchises such as the \"Spider-Man\" series.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/47/8821199/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/47/8821199/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:58:28.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
