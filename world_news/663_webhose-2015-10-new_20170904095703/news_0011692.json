You roll up your sleeve, a phlebotomist searches your lower arm for a suitable vein, inserts a sterilised needle and extracts a blood sample that is then labelled and sent off to a lab for analysis.\nDepending on your condition, this can happen a lot. If you are a cancer sufferer on chemotherapy, for example, you may come to think of your arms as pincushions and you sometimes have to watch in dismay as the phlebotomist hunts up and down for a suitable vein. Although the analysis of blood samples is now highly automated and efficient, at the sample-collection end it’s very time consuming and resource intensive.\nThe mind boggles at the amount the National Health Service must spend on it every year. And yet it is an absolutely central part of modern healthcare: blood tests are on the critical path of a very large number of diagnostic and treatment regimes.\nEnter Theranos , a California startup that has (or claims to have) developed novel approaches to laboratory-based diagnostic blood tests using the science of microfluidics , which concerns the manipulation of tiny amounts of fluids (think ink-jet printers, for example). Its unique selling point is that it can do this by using tiny amounts of blood obtained by a finger prick rather than by the traditional phlebotomist-based method. And it has been offering this service on a DIY basis in branches of Walgreens, a US pharmacy chain.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration by Matt Murphy.\nTheranos was founded in 2003 by Elizabeth Holmes, a 31-year-old who dropped out of a chemical engineering degree course at Stanford Univeristy to start the company. Like many tech startup founders, she is smart, articulate and persuasive. But the fact that she is female in a largely male world means that, from the beginning, Theranos has attracted a lot of media attention.\nIt has also attracted a lot of investment – at least $400m for a company valued at $10bn . This probably makes Holmes the youngest female billionaire in the world, a fact that is not lost on picture editors and gossip columnists everywhere.\nBut media attention can be a double-edged sword. Recently, the Wall Street Journal published two reports suggesting that Theranos wasn’t quite as innovative as its image suggested. According to the paper , the company wasn’t using its ultra-clever, patented technology for all of the 240 tests it currently offers.\nThis attracted the interest of the US Food and Drugs Administration and has led Theranos to stop collecting blood from finger pricks for all but one of its tests. As a result, says the WSJ : “Theranos is operating more like a traditional lab that draws blood with needles from patients’ arms.”\nRelated: Chemistry set pencils can turn life-saving tests into child’s play\nOuch! Since Theranos is a private company, we don’t know what impact, if any, this setback has had on its perceived value. But there are companies such as cbinsights.com that conduct what they call “sentiment analysis” by monitoring social media. Its graph of Theranos’s public standing following the WSJ stories is damning: it ends in a vertical dive as steep as the ones you see at the Olympics.\nAgainst that, though, there is the thought that much the same happened to public sentiment about Uber a while back, but that particular tech pariah recovered and seems set to prosper in the long run. The same thing may happen to Theranos after the dust settles.\nBut if it turns out that all those claims about the widespread applicability of microfluidics technology were overblown, then the game’s over and the folks who have poured $400m into the company will have to put it down to the triumph of hype over experience.\nSo two cheers for the WSJ ? Not quite. The prospect that a critical and expensive part of medical diagnostics could be commoditised is a heartening one, even if it makes creeps like Henry Kissinger (one of the directors of Theranos) rich. The spiralling costs of healthcare in an ageing society are scary and if technology can – for a change – reduce them, then that’s good for us all.\nJust imagine, for example, what a difference it would make to NHS cancer patients – and those who care for them – if getting a blood test could become as simple and speedy as paying for a sandwich with a contactless card. So let’s tone down the schadenfreude and hope that Theranos can deliver.", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerstick", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hot-startup-theranos-dials-back-lab-tests-at-fdas-behest-1444961864", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Healthcare%20innovation%20causes%20bad%20blood%20in%20US%20%7C%20John%20Naughton&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4dh3y%2Fstw%23img-1", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4dh3y%2Fsfb%23img-1&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4dh3y&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ff721e9cf8186bcdf3b88c667aee839e865be276d%2F0_0_1669_1198%2F1669.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Healthcare+innovation+causes+bad+blood+in+US+%7C+John+Naughton&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fcommentisfree%2F2015%2Foct%2F25%2Fhealthcare-innovation-casues-bad-blood-in-us&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ff721e9cf8186bcdf3b88c667aee839e865be276d%2F0_0_1669_1198%2F1669.jpg", "https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/theranos-news-sentiment/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f721e9cf8186bcdf3b88c667aee839e865be276d/0_0_1669_1198/master/1669.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2ee5a6a16c55a3094e586720a4a278e7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f721e9cf8186bcdf3b88c667aee839e865be276d/0_0_1669_1198/master/1669.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=b0c578b977635bc0bfa3addd0fc38ab4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f721e9cf8186bcdf3b88c667aee839e865be276d/0_0_1669_1198/master/1669.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=7b26e7cc4c61fba80aa38c7c8358d2de", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f721e9cf8186bcdf3b88c667aee839e865be276d/0_0_1669_1198/master/1669.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ffa70bcd625449d8540b64a9c3fd71d2", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-08/fingerprick-lab-test-startup-theranos-strikes-insurance-deal", "https://www.theranos.com/"], "published": "2015-10-25T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:22:02.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
