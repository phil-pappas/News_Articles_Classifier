Chandigarh offers great quality of life and some city-based startups are already well-known names,” Nandwani, who is also the founder and CEO of fin-tech firm uTrade Solutions, added. Kunal Nandwani, founder and CEO, uTrade Solutions \nCAN also counts Sameer Guglani (founder, Morpheus), Samar Singla (founder & CEO, Jugnoo), Sameer Jain (CEO, Net Solutions) and Mohit Chitkara (vice president, Chitkara University) among others as members. \n“Our key motive is to build an ecosystem for startups in Chandigarh so that potential entrepreneurs do not have to move out to bigger cities. We want to help them with funding and mentorship,” Nandwani said. \nLike most angel networks, CAN would also provide investee firms with contacts and office space. It may soon put money in an e-commerce returns platform. The network will announce its first investment within a month. \nAt-least one of CAN’s immediate investee firm will be a startup that solves a social need, Nandwani. \nA recent study had suggested that India’s startup ecosystem is being propelled by a 123 per cent rise in the country’s active investor count. \nWhile the number of startup accelerators/incubators in India grew by 40 per cent to 110 this year, the country’s angel investor count grew by over 150 per cent to 292, the study found. \nIndian Angel Network (IAN) is one of the country’s largest angel networks. Founded in 2005, IAN incubates about 20 startups every year. IAN last put money in Mumbai-based Vonken Technologies Pvt Ltd, which runs logistics tech venture Quifers .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:07:35.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
