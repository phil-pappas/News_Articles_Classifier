We want to get a major route between Paris and Le Havre through transport infrastructure and investments in port structures.” \nJacques Saadé said: “Half our French calls are made at Le Havre of which we are the largest trading customer.” \nThe event confirms that HAROPA and the port system of the ports of Le Havre, Rouen and Paris, are sustainably included in the logistics schedules of the world shipping leaders. \nAs the leading container port for the external trade of France, HAROPA posted an increase in container traffic by 4% in 2014 to 2.5 million TEU. \nIts port facilities – and especially Port 2000 in Le Havre – make it the only port on the northern range with Rotterdam - to be capable of accommodating the biggest containerships fully laden twenty-four hours, seven days a week. \nThe CMA CGM Bougainville will call every 88 days at the Port of Le Havre. It is positioned from Le Havre on the French Asia Line (FAL1), the flagship service of the company connecting the Asia and North Europe markets. \nCMA CGM recently announced that the Bougainville ship has been equipped with TRAXENS technology in order to make it a 'smart ship'. It is the first ship in the world to be equipped with this technology. \nThe vessel provides the group’s customers with a weekly connection between HAROPA and Central and South China (the main exporting zones of the country).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:43:23.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
