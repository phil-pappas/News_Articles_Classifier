These evergreen conifers are the highest trees on earth. Credit: Save The Redwoods League \nIn a study published in the research journal Global Change Biology , climate scientists from the University of California, NatureServe and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) conclude that a warmer future with normal rainfall on California's coast will leave coast redwoods south of San Francisco Bay with significantly different climate than they have experienced for decades. \nFourteen redwood parks are located in this area, including Big Basin Redwoods in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park south of Carmel, and Garrapata State Park between Carmel and Big Sur on the Monterey coast. \nScientists also predict that redwood forest bioclimate, marked by fog, ample winter rain and moderate year-round temperatures, will expand by 34 percent northward from the coast of California into southern Oregon. \n\"With warmer climate forecast for more than half the coast redwood range in the next 10-15 years, we are eager for research that helps identify those areas that are most sensitive to climate change ,\" says Paul Ringgold, Chief Program Officer for San Francisco-based Save the Redwoods League, the land trust which catalyzed the study under its Redwoods and Climate Change Initiative (RCCI). \"These key findings help us better understand the future impacts of climate change and how to manage for these impacts on our redwood forests.\" \n\"Redwoods will still exist in the most vulnerable areas, while continued research on changing redwood bioclimate will help us identify and address redwood forest regeneration challenges. Moreover, locally unique weather patterns such as fog may influence projected climate trends in the future,\" he says. \n\"Coast redwoods have endured climatic changes over thousands of years. We are encouraged by our RCCI research, which shows that redwood trees continue to grow, even under warmer conditions, and will thrive further north into Oregon.\" \nWritten by Miguel Fernandez, Healy Hamilton and Lara Kueppers and entitled \"Back to the Future —using historical climate variation to project near-term shifts in habitat suitable for coast redwood,\" the study sifts through the range of climate change predictions from global circulation models and analyzes which ones are most likely to occur in coastal California's future. \n\"Current global climate models often fail to capture climate change's impact on local weather patterns,\" says Fernandez of the University of California and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv). \"This data is critical to predict how individual species, like the coast redwood, will cope with climate change.\" \nFernandez's team of researchers used historical climate extremes as indicators of short- and medium-term changes in future climate and modeled coast redwoods ' geographic distribution in the smallest discernible detail. \n\"This approach is particularly suitable for regions such as North America's West Coast, where local conditions strongly influence climate,\" he says. \nThis is the seventh study funded by Save the Redwoods League's RCCI, a $4 million, multi-year research program whose mission is to study coast redwood and giant sequoia ecosystems in a changing world. Eight scientists from Humboldt State University, UC Berkeley, and UC Merced have undertaken research for RCCI producing four peer-reviewed papers since 2009. \nProvided by: German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig 0 shares Fog has declined in past century along California's redwood coast February 15, 2010 \nCalifornia's coastal fog has decreased significantly over the past 100 years, potentially endangering coast redwood trees dependent on cool, humid summers, according to a new study by University of California, Berkeley, scientists. Scientists study global warming's effect on California redwoods July 5, 2010 \nTwo of his colleagues dangled on ropes 100 feet above from the gnarled branches of a giant sequoia tree. Steve Sillett could hardly contain his excitement. Redwood forest ecosystem of northern California depends on fog to stay hydrated during rainless summers July 8, 2010 \nAs the mercury rises outdoors, it's a fitting time to consider the effects of summertime droughts and global warming on ecosystems. Complex interactions among temperature, water cycling, and plant communities create a tangled ... How does climate change affect ferns and fog on the forest floor? July 19, 2010 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- Ferns play an important role in California's redwood forests by transferring moisture from fog to the forest floor -- even when it's not raining. If these plants can successfullly adapt to reduced rainfall, ... Redwood trees reveal history of West Coast rain, fog, ocean conditions October 29, 2013 \nMany people use tree ring records to see into the past. But redwoods – the iconic trees that are the world's tallest living things – have so far proven too erratic in their growth patterns to help with reconstructing ... The shortest DNA sequences reveal insights into the world's tallest trees March 30, 2015 \nCoast redwoods are famous for being the tallest trees in the world, but their height is not the only thing that sets them apart. Unlike most conifer trees, coast redwoods can reproduce by sprouting from cut stumps, fallen ... Recommended for you Researchers find more atmospheric rivers will hit western North America October 16, 2015 \nA strikingly large increase in the number of atmospheric river days awaits the U.S. west coast if climate warming remains relatively unchecked. Researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory came to that conclusion ... Climate change leaves its mark on the sea floor? Maybe not, study says October 16, 2015 \nThe texture of the ocean floor is determined by the enormous stretching and cracking that takes place at the mid-ocean ridge, where tectonic plates are pulling apart and magma is rising to form new sea floor. On either side ... New study questions long-held theories of climate variability in the North Atlantic October 15, 2015 \nA University of Miami (UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric-led study challenges the prevailing wisdom by identifying the atmosphere as the driver of a decades-long climate variation known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal ... Ocean protection gaining momentum, but still lags progress made on land October 15, 2015 \nExtraordinary progress in the past decade has brought 1.6 percent of the world's ocean to a category of \"strongly protected,\" researchers say in a new analysis, but the accomplishments are still far behind those that have ... Sea level rise will swallow Miami, New Orleans, study finds October 12, 2015 \nSay goodbye to Miami and New Orleans. No matter what we do to curb global warming, these and other beloved US cities will sink below rising seas, according to a study Monday.
