The debt financing was led by Oxford Finance, LLC (“Oxford”), a specialty finance firm that provides senior debt to life sciences and healthcare service companies. “We are grateful for the continued support of our current investors and Oxford,” said R. Terry Dunlay, President and CEO of IntelliCyt. “We are rapidly growing and these funds will be used to continue to scale our commercial efforts globally and expand our product offerings to rapidly accelerating markets including immuno-oncology.” IntelliCyt’s flagship product, the iQue® Screener platform, is an integrated instrument, software, and reagent system that enhances suspension-cell screening workflows from sample preparation through results. It enables rapid, high content, multiplexed analysis of cells and beads in suspension in 96, 384, and 1536 well plates.
