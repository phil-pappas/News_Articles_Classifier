Stocks on Friday tumbled in the wake of the report early Friday, only to reverse course and push higher into Monday.\n\"It's a follow-through from Friday's reversal rally,\" Bill Nichols, head of US equities at Cantor Fitzgerald, said of Monday's gains. Contributing to the gains was a rebound in commodity prices, he said. He said the September jobs number will likely be revised higher in the months ahead, as has been the case in the past.\n\"You have to be cautious either way,\" he said. \"The economy is probably okay, but you can make the case that there are growth concerns.\"\nEnergy stocks posted some of the widest gains Monday as oil prices continued their recent climb. Crude oil prices rose 1.6 per cent to $US46.26 in New York. Financial stocks also rose.\nUltra-low interest rates have buoyed shares in the US for years, but worries over slowing growth overseas have prompted a pullback in recent months. Labor market strength is one of the factors the US Federal Reserve looks at when deciding whether to raise interest rates.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 rose 3 per cent, led by gains in energy stocks that were buoyed by steadying oil prices. Germany's DAX added 2.8 per cent. France's CAC index rose 3.5 per cent.\n\"The weekend has given traders the time to digest the weaker-than-expected jobs report on Friday and it seems we are back with 'bad news is good news' for the equity markets,\" Jonathan Sudaria, night dealer at London Capital Group, said.\nUS Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Saturday that his confidence that the central bank can raise rates soon had fallen after a jobs report Friday came in well below economists' expectations.\nThe yield on 10-year US Treasurys rose to 2.021 per cent as prices declined.\nFinancial markets rising reflect investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will delay raising interest rates off rock bottom, according to Tim Crockford, a fund manager at Herm√®s Investment Management.\n\"The Fed still remains the main provider of liquidity to markets. It definitely has an effect on equities and all asset prices,\" Mr Crockford said.\nIn Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225 both ended up 1.6 per cent. Stock markets in mainland China were closed for a holiday.\nSome investors said they expected more stimulus from Beijing following weak economic data in the region. The World Bank downgraded its economic growth forecasts for the East Asia and Pacific region, and China's expected growth rate was cut to 6.9 per cent from 7.1 per cent.\nInvestors in Europe were also considering the results of Portugal's elections. Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, who oversaw years of unpopular austerity measures, finished far ahead of his Socialist rival, but his center-right coalition lost its majority in Parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:15:36.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
