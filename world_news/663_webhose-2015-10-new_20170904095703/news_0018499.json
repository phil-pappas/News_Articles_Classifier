The court also said there was thin evidence that the original inside tippers at Dell and Nvidia received any personal benefit from disclosing the information.\nLawyers for the two traders had urged the Supreme Court to stay out of the case and leave the lower court ruling in place. They said the decision was correct and wouldn't have the disruptive effects the government claimed.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nOctober 05, 2015 14:45 ET (18:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:30:55.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
