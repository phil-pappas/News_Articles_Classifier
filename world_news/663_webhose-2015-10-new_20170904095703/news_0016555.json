It has notified both U.S. and international law enforcement. Experian North America's parent company, Experian is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.\n\"The investigation is ongoing, but what we know right now is that the hacker acquired the records of approximately 15 million people, including new applicants requiring a credit check for service or device financing from September 1, 2013 through September 16, 2015,\" Legere wrote.\nIn a refreshing change from the corporate-speak often used by CEOs whose businesses are breached, T-Mobile's Legere stayed true to form with his directness.\n\"Obviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach,\" he said, saying he would conduct a \"thorough review\" of his company's relationship with Experian but that his top concern for now was \"assisting any and all consumers affected.\"\nThe compromised information includes customers' names, addresses and birth dates as well as encrypted fields with Social Security number and ID number, which could be a driver’s license or passport number.\nExperian told T-Mobile the encryption protecting those numbers may have been compromised, Legere said.\nExperian and T-Mobile have set up two years of free credit monitoring and identity resolution services for compromised customers. Ironically, the service is being offered through Experian's own credit monitoring service.\nExperian cautioned consumers that under no circumstances would either Experian or T-Mobile call them or send them messages asking for personal information in connection with the breach.\n\"You may go to the website, but you should not provide personal information to anyone who calls you or sends you a message about this incident,\" Experian said in a statement.\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Elizabeth Weise on Twitter: @eweise.\n176 CONNECT 293 TWEET 14 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT //usat.ly/1FJoV3a TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793197145894975-AP-EXPERIAN-T-MOBILE-DATA-BREACH-76403592.jpg", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/experian-notifies-consumers-in-the-us-who-may-have-been-affected-by-unauthorized-acquisition-of-a-clients-data-300152926.html", "http://www.t-mobile.com/landing/experian-data-breach", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793197145894975-AP-EXPERIAN-T-MOBILE-DATA-BREACH-76403592.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FJoV3a&text=Experian%20breach%20may%20have%20exposed%2015%20million%20T-Mobile%20records&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8d3a239b038e92e39c9731f10e4fea399782ef7f/c=318-0-5298-3744&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793197145894975-AP-EXPERIAN-T-MOBILE-DATA-BREACH-76403592.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FJoV3a&mini=true", "http://www.protectmyID.com/securityincident", "http://usat.ly/1FJoV3a"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:04:33.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
