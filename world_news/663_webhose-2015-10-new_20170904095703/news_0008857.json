But will it make that call and is Woolworths also eyeing a surrender?\nElsewhere, APA Group claims the box seat in the Iona gas plant auction, Hutchison Ports Australia is floated as a takeover target and Seek presses ahead with an IPO of IDP Education.\nInvestors are looking for clarity on Woolworths’ beleaguered Masters hardware chain and they could receive some as early as October 20 when JV partner Lowe’s is able to exercise a put option on the venture. Should the US giant flag an exit then Woolworths would have 13 months to either buy back Lowe’s 33.3 per cent stake or pursue a sale of the business.\nThere is rising speculation that Woolies, led by new chairman Gordon Cairns , could indeed pull the trigger on a steady retreat. Already Colliers is testing the market on a potential sell-off of Masters properties, according to The Australian Financial Review , with Bunnings potentially interested in 15 sites and Ikea a further one or two.\nShould Woolies hang in and Lowe’s depart however, the Australian retailer could be on the hook for as much as $1 billion to buy out its JV partner’s stake.\nMeanwhile, the auction of the $1bn Iona gas plant is creeping slowly to the finish line as owner EnergyAustralia takes its time assessing final bids. The AFR reports a winner is unlikely to be announced in the next fortnight, a sign the owner may be waiting on the ACCC’s official view on a potential purchase by APA Group .\nAPA has long been a frontrunner but it’s unclear whether it will be successful in overcoming regulatory concerns. Rival bidders include QIC and Jemena .\nThe energy sector has been a hot topic this year amid slumping sentiment, but a sharp recent uptick in crude prices has granted breathing room to the likes of Santos as it undertakes a strategic review. It’s also aiding Origin Energy’s push to complete a $2.5bn capital raising as its share price surges well clear of the $4 a share rights offer.\nElsewhere, Hutchison Ports Australia may be on the chopping block as Li Ka-shing pursues asset sales across the globe. The container terminal operator reportedly discussed a sale with International Container Terminal Services three months ago, but has yet to hire advisers. Its value is unclear, but there has been around $700 million invested into the business.\nIn mining, Glencore has said a review of its 20 Australian coal mines is ongoing amid speculation of divestments, while Fortescue Metals has again hosed down rumours of an imminent sale of a minority stake in its lucrative infrastructure assets in the Pilbara. The iron ore miner has reportedly been engaging with Hebei Steel & Iron on a potential multi-billion deal.\nIn the IPO market, action has accelerated on the oft-delayed $500m float of the Seek -backed IDP Education . Research on the company will be released this month, around two years after Seek first announced plans to list the group.\nIn finance, the AFR reports ANZ and Macquarie Group still haggling on a few details over the potential sale of the Esanda Dealer Finance business, but a deal is still expected this week.\nFinally, SABMiller has rejected a sweetened $144bn bid by suitor Anheuser-Busch InBev . The new proposal represents a 44 per cent premium and has the backing of a key SABMiller investor, but the target’s board is still adamant it “very substantially undervalues the business”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:55:34.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
