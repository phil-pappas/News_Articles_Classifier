The power plant incorporates panels manufactured by Canadian Solar, and the panels are installed at an angle of 45Â° as measures against the piling up of snow. Fig. 1: Sakura Internet Ishikari Solar Power Plant featuring 200kW of output (source: Sakura Internet) \nSolar power plants of this class are normally connected to the grid via high-tension distribution lines, and a PV inverter and a booster transformer are installed on the sites. Direct current output from solar panels is transformed to alternating current by the PV inverter and is boosted to 6.6kV by the booster transformer for transmission to high-tension distribution lines. \nHowever, the site of Sakura Internet Ishikari Solar Power Plant is spacious because it does not have this large electrical equipment for connection to high-tension distribution lines. The DC power generated by the power plant is transmitted to \"Ishikari Data Center,\" which is located about 500m from the plant, without selling power under the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme and is consumed inside the company as the power for operation of servers at the center (Fig. 2). Fig. 2: \"Ishikari Data Center\" of Sakura Internet (source: Sakura Internet) \nServers in about 4,000 racks consume the power if all of the buildings (eight buildings are planned) are in operation. The company decided to consume the power generated by the solar power plant in house without selling power because the center is large enough to consume all the power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:05:25.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
