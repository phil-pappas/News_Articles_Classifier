The deal with Westpac, struck last week, marked the fourth major agreement for the emerging company in less than three months.\nManaging director Megan Boston said the deals with Telstra and Westpac were validations of the technology.\n\"We have another 10 ASX-listed clients in the pipeline, of various sizes,\" she said.\nOmni Market Tide managing director Megan Boston says the contracts with Telstra and Westpac have validated the technology. \"We're branching out as well and we've started talking to universities about how they could use the app for voting too.\"\nShareholder convenience As well as removing paper from the shareholder voting process, the app gives shareholders real-time access to company announcements and also facilitates live streaming of meetings, meaning people no longer need to physically attend an AGM or watch it from their desktop computer.\nCurrently neither Westpac or Telstra have agreed to do voting through the app, but this could be an option at a later date.\n \"As a shareholder in a number of companies I found it a very inefficient process to get lots of paper in the mail to vote ... I would have good intentions to vote but just never get to it,\" Ms Boston said.\n\"To be able to do it all in one app is a big step forward.\"\nOmni Market Tide also has an agreement with share registry company Boardroom Limited's Australian subsidiary to integrate the app into its digital solutions business, enabling its clients to use the app.\nDiscussions are also under way with Boardroom's Singaporean parent company, which will kick-start Omni Market Tide's presence in Asia.\nGlobal potential Omni Market Tide started trading on the ASX in late July after reverse listing through the shell of SWW Energy . It was previously called GRT App, which was founded by GRT Lawyers and backed by accounting firm Moore Stephens Queensland.\nSince listing, the company has been trading down on its open price, currently fetching about 6Â¢. Foster Stockbroking rated the stock a speculative buy in September.\nThe app developer also has a presence in Europe, the Middle East and North America through a global sales referral agreement with Euroinvestor.com.\nHowever, Ms Boston said the company's focus was on consolidating the business in Australia before looking overseas.\n\"No one else is doing voting through an app anywhere in the world, so this has the potential to be global,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:27:11.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
