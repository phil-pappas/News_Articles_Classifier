March 15th 2015 /video/video.news.com.au/TV/Environment/ A Sense of Place Thanks to a progressive public transportation portfolio that includes train, streetcar, bus and aerial tram, the American city of Portland has become a global model of transit-oriented development. 1 of n \nBefore it was axed by Abbott government in November 2013, the High Speed Rail Advisory Group released a report arguing the biggest threat to high-speed rail in Australia was not cost or any other obstacle, but “inertia”— brought about by perceptions a bullet train was unrealistic or would simply take too long to build. \nAccording to an independent report into high-speed rail released by think tank Beyond Zero Emissions last year, Australia is the only continent — barring Antarctica — not to commit to high-speed rail. Even the US has plans in the works to commit to high-speed rail as early as next year. \nCo-author of the Beyond Zero Emissions report Gerard Drew said there is “a window of opportunity” right now for high-speed rail, due to the downturn in the construction sector, bewildering property prices and low borrowing rates. A high-speed rail network would provide thousands of jobs, boost tourism, develop and connect regional areas, and provide affordable housing to commuters.
