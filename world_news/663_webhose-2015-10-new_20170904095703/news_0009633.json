Photo: Bloomberg\nApple has been told to pay $US234 million ($322m) to the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing arm for infringing the school's patent on microprocessor technology.\nThe amount set by a US federal jury in Madison was less than the $US400 million ($550m) sought by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Apple's lawyers argued the amount should be a fraction of the $US110 million ($151m) Intel paid in 2009 to settle an earlier dispute over the same patent.\nThe dispute concerns the design of a processor chip to improve performance. The foundation argued that Apple refused to pay royalties on its A7 and A8 processors in the iPhone 5s and iPad even after learning of the patent, issued in 1998. A second case, filed in September, focuses on the A9 and A9X processors in newer models of the iPhone and iPad.\nThe school contends its technology \"has been recognised as a major milestone of contemporary computer processors\" and led to awards for its inventors.\nAdvertisement \"This is a case where the hard work of our university researchers and the integrity of patenting and licensing discoveries has prevailed,\" Carl Gulbrandsen, managing director of the foundation, said in a statement.\nRachel Wolf Tulley, a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment on the jury's decision. The company reported $US10.7 billion ($14.7b) in net income in the three months that ended June 27.\nApple will appeal the decision, and has a good track record of getting large verdicts and damage awards overturned. In July, a judge threw out a $US533 million ($733m) award against the iPhone maker and ordered a new damages trial. That new trial was put on hold while Apple appeals the finding that its iTunes store infringed the patents related to digital rights management.\nCarnegie Mellon\nMost universities that get into royalty disputes look to settle quickly, but they do win when they go to trial. Carnegie Mellon University in August won an appeals court ruling that Marvell Technology Group used its patented technology on computer disk drives, although a reconsideration of the original $US1.17 billion ($1.6b) damage award was mandated.\nThe foundation argued that it's entitled to about $US2.74 ($3.77) for each device, which it said is based on the contribution to the value of Apple's integrated circuits. Apple contends the figure is closer to the 7 US cents (10 cents) per unit that Intel paid.\nThe Intel settlement was based on 1.5 billion processors sold while Apple has sold 150 million, Apple's lawyer, William Lee of WilmerHale, told the jury, according to a partial transcript posted in court documents.\nApple argued that it was one of about 70 that covered the specific technology to select the order of processing, including one the iPhone maker received.\nWarfarin Source\nThe foundation, known as Warf and the source of the name of the blood-thinner warfarin, has been in business for 90 years to commercialise the school's research. Some of the money goes to the inventors and some gets ploughed back into the school to fund further research.\nAcademic research US-wide led to some $28 billion ($38.5b) worth of product sales in 2014, and 965 new products were created by companies using licensed university work, according to the Association of University Technology Managers.\nThe Wisconsin foundation, which gets licensing fees for things like drug, plant and computer research, received $US178 million ($245m) in income from 2012 to 2014, according to the association.\nThat puts it in the top 15 schools and teaching hospitals collecting more than $US100 million ($137m) in that period. Still, it's far less than the $US740 million ($1b) received by Northwestern University or $USA614 million ($845m) for New York University, and $US404.7 million ($557m) for Princeton University.\nEven those figures don't represent a complete picture -- companies often provide other types of financial assistance to universities through joint research contracts, endowments or building funds. The judge in the Marvell case said the chipmaker could have avoided its billion-dollar fight with Carnegie Mellon had it just reached a licensing agreement such as creating \"the Marvell Hall of Engineering at CMU\".\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:03:43.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
