These vessels utilise new advanced technology to reduce CO 2 emissions per TEU by 60%, compared with 13,500 TEU capacity ships delivered just three years ago, and are the largest vessels powered by either liquefied natural gas (LNG) or conventional heavy fuel oil.\nThe vessels are the first to have received DNV GL certification of compliance with the latest LNG regulations.\nCarla Debart, Managing Director of APMT Zebrugge, said: “United Arab Shipping Company is setting a new world standard in environmental performance for liner services, as well as fleet growth, and we are very proud to be a part of this historic process.”\nUASC has a total fleet of 56 vessels, representing an overall capacity of more than 482,000 TEU.\nThe shipping line has recently started an expansion plan, which includes pending deliveries of four 18,800 and six 15,000 TEU ships, which will add approximately 170,000 TEU of capacity, increasing its fleet size by 35%.\nAPMT Zeebrugge, which is one of a select group of European container terminals which can accommodate ULCS with containers stacked 10-high on deck and rows of 24 containers wide, handled 406,000 TEU in 2014 in Northern Europe’s seventh busiest container port.\nFor all the latest on APMT, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:38:33.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
