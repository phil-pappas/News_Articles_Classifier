To further support partner business growth in the cloud, Oracle announced a new cloud program within Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN). This builds on Oracle's award winning program and enables existing and new Oracle partners to grow their cloud business with Oracle. \n\"Cloud is our top priority and we are aligning our resources to that strategic initiative,\" said Shawn Price, senior vice president, Cloud, Oracle. \"We will work with our partner ecosystem to pivot to the cloud and fully capitalize on the historic opportunity before us. We remain committed to expanding our partner community and providing all of its valued members the tools, technology and expertise they need to deliver excellence to our joint customers and succeed in the market.\" \nOracle has seen rapid adoption and growth of its vast and expanding portfolio of cloud products and services. The newly announced cloud program is designed to help partners take advantage of Oracle's integrated cloud portfolio to successfully transition new and existing customers to the cloud, assuring partners' success in this accelerated market. \nNew cloud program designations unveiled today within OPN will be launched February 1, 2016, offering OPN members the opportunity to showcase expertise, skills and their investment in the Oracle Cloud as well as differentiate themselves with Oracle's Integrated Cloud Applications and Platform Services. These designations complement existing OPN program levels to provide tiers of recognition and progressive level benefits. Working with Oracle in the cloud will significantly support partners' cloud business strategy, and provide them with the framework to build that success. OPN now offers the most comprehensive portfolio of cloud programs to enable partners to fully realize the competitive advantages offered through Oracle's cloud services. \nIn addition, Oracle launched a new entry point into the OPN program called the Cloud Registered level. This program provides immediate opportunities for new cloud partners to begin their journey and grow their business with the Oracle Cloud, requiring no initial investment. New cloud partners are encouraged to join OPN at the Cloud Registered level between today and May 31, 2016 to take advantage of key Oracle Cloud focused benefits with no membership fee. Cloud Registered level members will be eligible for benefits including the ability to resell Oracle Cloud Platform solutions, including Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions, access to the OPN Cloud Business Builder for sales, marketing and technical training and resources, as well as OPN branding. For more details, visit: http://bit.ly/1MZ0uAh . \nLast year, Oracle launched Oracle Cloud Connection online community and we have over 350,000 views from partners to explore, learn, and engage in the Oracle Cloud as well as a wide range of cloud programs and enablement resources that help partners speed time to market with cloud-based services and solutions. \nTo amplify Oracle's reach in the broad marketplace and help partners extend their opportunities and revenue potential with the cloud, OPN added the complete portfolio of PaaS and IaaS offerings as well as new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions to its Oracle Cloud resale program in FY16. The program enables both Value Added Resellers and Distributors to take advantage of new OPN incentive rebates for Cloud services across the majority of Oracle's SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS offerings. In addition to rebates, the Oracle Cloud resale program provides partners the ability to sell multi-year deals, as well as take advantage of renewals and up-sell opportunities to gain ongoing annuity through a front-end margin. In the last quarter alone, Oracle's cloud resale program has grown year over year more than 122 percent. \nAdditional Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:11:36.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
