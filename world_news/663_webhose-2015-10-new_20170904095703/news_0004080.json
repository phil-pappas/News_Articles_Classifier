This opinion is solely based on our knowledge, research and understanding of the relevant market gathered from various secondary and primary sources of information. CHAPTER OUTLINESChapter 2 provides an executive summary of the insights captured in our research. The summary offers a high level view on where the ophthalmic drug delivery systemsmarket is headed in the short, mid and long term.Chapter 3 provides a general introduction to the ophthalmic drug delivery market. We have discussed, in detail, the anatomy of the eye. The chapter also outlines details on different types of ocular drug delivery implants. In addition, several ocular indications, which are being targeted by sustained release implants, are also covered in this chapter. Chapter 4 provides an overview of the ophthalmic drug delivery systems market with respect to the available marketed technologies and companies active in the field. We have provided a detailed pipeline of systems that are either marketed or are under clinical/ preclinical development. The chapter includes pipeline analysis by phase of development, system type, and indications targeted. It also covers the sustained release systems that are currently being evaluated by academic researchers and universities. In addition, we have also provided information on gene therapies that are being developed to provide a controlled treatment to several ocular indications.Chapter 5 provides detailed profiles of 13 systems which are marketed and/ or arein late stages of clinical development (Phase II and Phase III). These profiles cover information on underlying technologies, development history, principal features (size of the implant, drug elution rate, life of the implant, related patents and intellectual property, nature of the insert) and current status of development. For each system, we have also estimated the future sales potential over the next ten years. Given the uncertainty surrounding the adoption rates, we have done a multivariate sensitivity analysis to present different tracks of industry's evolution.Chapter 6 reviews the 13 leading companies which are active in the area of ophthalmology sustained release drug delivery technology. Each company profile includes information on the company overview, financial performance, marketed / pipeline systems, fundings, partnerships, and recent developments.Chapter 7 provides information on several investment instances which have driven research in the area of sustained release ocular drug delivery systems. These investments are a testament to the growing interest of different stakeholders in this industry.Chapter 8 covers details on the recent partnerships which have taken place in this industry. We have discussed the various partnerships models in existence and the most common forms of deals / agreements which have evolved over time.Chapter 9 provides our analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the ophthalmology drug delivery systems market, capturing the key elements likely to influence future growth. Chapter 10 is a collection of transcripts based on our discussion with some of the leading players in the industry. Examples of companies interviewed include Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, Mati Therapeutics, On Demand Therapeutics and Euclid Systems. Chapter 11 summarizes the overall report. In this chapter, we provide a recap of the key takeaways and our independent opinion based on the research and analysis described in previous chapters.Chapters 12 and 13 are appendices, which provide tabulated data and a list of companies mentioned in the report.EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHTS1. More than 25 companies are currently working on developing sustained release drug delivery systems for the treatment of ocular indications. Examples of some key players include pSivida, Allergan, Ocular Therapeutix, Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, Icon BioScience and GrayBug. 2. Vitrasert, launched in 1996, was the first ocular implant. It was, however, taken off the market in 2013. Only three more implants have received regulatory approval since 1996; these are Retisert, Ozurdex and Iluvien. 3. Majority of the systems (52%) are in preclinical stage of development. Over 10 systems are currently undergoing late stage clinical trial studies. Once approved, these inserts are likely to provide a major impetus to the overall market.4. DME and Uveitis will provide the much needed boost to the sustained release ocular drug delivery systems market in the short-term. In the mid to long term, the growth will be fostered by launch of sustained release systems for glaucoma and AMD. In fact, more than 15 sustained release formulations are under development for the treatment of glaucoma.5. Interest of venture capital firms, licensing/ partnership opportunities will continue to act as key growth drivers of this market. During our research, we identified several instances where venture capitalists and other strategic investors have actively supported the research efforts.6. The overall market is likely to be more than USD 6.5 billion in the coming decade. The opportunity could be much higher in the outer years, especially driven by the regulatory approval of implants for delivery of biologics.
