We greatly appreciate our shippers’ continued confidence in the Port of Long Beach.” \nThrough the first nine months of 2015, the port has seen a 5.2% increase in cargo volume compared to the same period in 2014. \nAt this rate, the Port of Long Beach would finish the year with more than 7 million TEU for only the third time in its history – the first time since 2007. \nFor September, imports dipped 1.9% compared to the same month in 2014, to more than 332,000 TEU. Exports grew 6.1% to more than 125,000 TEU. \nWith an ongoing, multibillion-dollar program to modernise its facilities, the Port of Long Beach continues to build the ‘Port of the Future’ by investing in long-term, environmentally sustainable growth. \nThe results follow a record two-month run, where cargo volumes grew 22.8% in August, 2015 . This is a strong result in comparison to the struggles with congestion earlier in 2015, which saw volumes drop considerably as a result of the major shutdown of a number of US West Coast Ports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:39:08.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
