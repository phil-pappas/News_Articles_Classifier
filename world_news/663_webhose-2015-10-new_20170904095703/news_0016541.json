Either click on the \"play in Sideplayer\" button while you are watching a video on YouTube, or paste a YouTube video url directly into the form that opens up when you click on the extension's icon in Chrome's main toolbar. \nThe video starts to play in the top right corner of the screen automatically either way and remains visible even when you switch tabs in Chrome or switch between different instances of the browser. \nThe top right corner may not be the best position necessarily as you find important controls, such as sign in links there often. You may move the player to another location in the browser window using drag and drop. Just click and hold the left mouse button on the player and drag it to another location. \nYou may also resize the player window or use playback controls such as pause or seeking while hovering the mouse cursor over the interface. \nThere you find the option to cancel the video which you can only do while hovering over the player and not through the extension icon. \nYou are probably wondering who this is for. The one use case that I can think of is if you are working on a screen that is not wide enough to display two browser windows at the same time, and if you want to watch YouTube videos while doing other things on the Internet. \nYou get the same features that Sideplayer offers when you place two browser windows next to each other with one playing videos on YouTube so that you can use the other for other tasks. \nYou could use the extension for instance to play tutorial videos for WordPress or other web applications while working on the site or in the application at the same time. \nObviously, it is possible to play entertainment there as well or any other form of YouTube video, for instance movie trailers. \nClosing Words \nSideplayer may be useful in certain situations but the fact that I can place two browser windows next to each other for the same effect and the extension's permission request are reasons why I won't be using it. \nAs far as permissions are concerned, it requests to read data you copy and paste, and to read and change all data on websites you visit. While both are necessary to power the functionality it provides, it is somewhat of a scary prospect. \nNow You : Discovered any cool Chrome extensions recently?
