While US production has started to decline this year, other major suppliers like Russia and Saudi Arabia, OPEC's most important member, have kept the crude taps wide open.\n\"Short-term supply imbalances remain, with Russia increasing oil production to new highs, while OPEC production cuts are mostly seasonal adjustments and exports are unlikely to be affected,\" said Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy at ING Bank. \"While the demand side has been improving the pace is very gradual and does not provide any material support to short-term forecasts.\"\nIn midmorning trading in Europe, Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was flat at $US49.87 a barrel on London's ICE Futures exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading 0.4 per cent lower at $US46.08 a barrel.\nOn Tuesday, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell PLC said he saw the first sign of a recovery in oil prices. \"It remains uncertain how fast prices will recover and where they will settle,\" Ben van Beurden said at the Oil & Money conference in London.\nOPEC's secretary-general also said that oil prices are set to rebound amid steep cuts in global oil investments. There will be \"less supply in the very near future. Less supply means high prices,\" Abdalla Salem El-Badri said at the conference.\nIn November last year, the 12-nation oil producer group embarked on a policy to defend its market share by keeping its output stable despite the slump in prices. OPEC has since indicated it will only consider a cut if other big suppliers, such as Russia, join it.\nBut any production cuts by Russia remain unlikely, given the country's current economic situation, Mr Khan of ING said.\n\"Since the imposition of financial sanctions on Russia, export of fossil fuels is the major source of foreign currency inflow to Russia and, given low crude oil prices, higher production is the only way to keep revenue stable,\" he said. In September, Russia produced oil at levels not seen since the fall of the Soviet Union, pumping an average of 10.74 million barrels a day.\nLater Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, will publish its US oil inventory data, while on Wednesday, the US Department of Energy will release its official inventory estimate. Some analysts are predicting a build in US crude-oil stocks after previous data showed a four million-barrel increase the week earlier.\nNymex reformulated gasoline blendstock -- the benchmark gasoline contract -- rose 0.2 per cent to be at $US1.38 a gallon.
