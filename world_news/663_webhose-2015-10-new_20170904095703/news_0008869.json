It’s important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion.” \nThis reasoning doesn’t ring true, however. The announcement to ban the TV streaming products comes soon after the reveals of the next generation versions of both products: the new Apple TV will be available later this month, while the new Chromecast can already be ordered from the Google Store. \nStreaming media analyst Dan Rayburn points out the flaws in what Amazon claims is its reason for the decision: “If you’re trying to remove confusion about Prime streaming, why didn’t you remove that confusion six months ago or a year ago?” asks Rayburn. “If you’re going to do that, why aren’t you removing TVs from your marketplace that don’t support Prime streaming? Why aren’t you removing tablets from your marketplace that don’t support Prime streaming? There’s a lot of other things they could be removing.” \nAmazon doesn’t seem to be taking a stab at the entire world of TV streaming competitions, though, since products like Roku and the Xbox and Playstation—both of which have streaming available—can still be purchased in the store. \nThe ban likely won’t be too big of a blow to Apple TV and Google Chromecast sales, since they can both be purchased elsewhere. \n“It would be a much, much bigger deal if it were impacting someone like Roku,” says Rayburn. “But it’s not as if people can’t pick up an Apple TV at a physical store. “With Chromecast, it’ll certainly impact things, but if you really want to get it you can get it at a lot of places.” \nJackdaw Research CEO Jan Dawson points out that the decision to ban competition will likely have a negative impact on Amazon’s image: “For all that Amazon is dressing this up as providing the best customer experience, it certainly looks like an anti-competitive move, and goes against Amazon’s reputation as the ‘everything store.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:10:42.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
