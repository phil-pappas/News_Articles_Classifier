In the 1980s, this would be slasher season, in the 1990s we got a ton of twisted teenage slashers and serial killers, while the 2000s gave rise to the Saw series and so called “torture porn.” Now we live in the era of Paranormal Activity movies. This year, the franchise’s sixth installment has hit a major roadblock with it’s October 23rd release: some theater chains have banned it. \nJason Blum of Bloomhouse Productions is partially to blame for finding Oren Peli’s first Paranormal Activity that was made for around $15,000 and ended up grossing over $190 million. His company has clung to and developed the model of shooting films for peanuts and paying for all of them with a single success. The Paranormal Activity series that has been running since 2007 always have a found footage element that makes the production of the films super cheap. Paranormal Activity \nAs the movies have progressed, different writers and directors have boarded the franchise to refresh the premise of a ghost haunting a house in a found footage movie. Peli exited the franchise immediately, passing on directorial duties on Paranormal Activity 2 to Tod Williams. His installment focused on the sister of the protagonist from the first film. The third movie was given to Ariel Shulman and Henry Joost, the directors behind the documentary Catfish, and the pair teamed with writer Christopher Landon to sculpt the previous two movies into something resembling a mythology. Following Katie and Kristi, the sisters from parts one and two through their lives as their grandmother inducts them into some sort of demonic cult. Paranormal Activity 2 \nAfter Paranormal Activity 4 wasn’t as well received as Paranormal Activity 3 , Christopher Landon was promoted from writing the inter-connected installments to writing and directing the next installment titled Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones . Conceived as a way of tapping into the horror Latino audience, The Marked Ones first looked to be a generic spin-off of the Paranormal Activity formula. It isn’t until the film’s final moments that it connects to the Paranormal Activity mythology, opening the door for further exploration of Katie and Kristi. Paranormal Activity 3 \nApparently, this new Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension installment will be the series last and will wrap up the story of the demon possessed sisters by telling the story of a game developer named Ryan whose family is terrorized by a ghostly presence. Chances are Katie and Kristi’s family demon cult will show up, because it’s supposed to cap the narrative somehow. Paranormal Activity 4 \nIt might be harder to find out than it usually is, because exhibitors including Regal Cinemas and Cinemark, the first and third biggest theater chains respectively, have started banning the film from distribution in their theaters. The dispute has nothing to do with content or simply being sick of the Paranormal Activity movies, but is totally about when The Ghost Dimension is set to hit Video On Demand services. Usually there is a thirty day gap between a theatrical release and a digital or VOD release so theater chains can complete the run of the film before letting the lazy couch potatoes at home have a shot at it. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension is only going to wait 17 days. Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones \nThis last Paranormal Activity has added 3D to boost the experience (the first time the franchise has done so), but not as many people are even going to have the chance to see it that way. The movie is set to play at 1,350 theaters, a little less than half the 2,867 locations The Marked Ones debuted in. Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension \nThe good news is that 3D camcorders in theaters feel weird in the first place and Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension still has found footage elements. If it isn’t your cup of tea, the only downside to the consumer is having to wait another 17 days to see how it ends. For theater owners, this is a line in the sand and for everyone releasing the movie, the VOD numbers suddenly became more important.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:10:14.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
