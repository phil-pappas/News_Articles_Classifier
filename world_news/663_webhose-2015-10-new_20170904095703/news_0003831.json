I'm not kidding.' By Jenn Gidman   9, 2015 9:31 AM CDT COMMENTS (25) (Newser) â€“ Just over a week ago, Elon Musk introduced the \"Bioweapon Defense Mode\" in Tesla's Model X, and now he's going nuclear on a new target: Apple. Per the German newspaper Handelsblatt , the Tesla CEO was in Berlin Thursday and had some choice things to say when asked to respond to rumors Apple was stealing away some of his workers to work on an alleged self-driving-car project. \"Important engineers? They have hired people we've fired,\" he said, Ars Technica UK reports. \"We always jokingly call Apple the Tesla Graveyard. If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I'm not kidding.\" Musk, who Engadget says was in the German capital to talk about the future of electric cars, didn't stop there with what Ars Technica calls his \"sick burns.\"\"Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?\" he said. \"Cars are very complex compared to phones or smart watches. You can't just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: 'Build me a car.'\" But to Musk, it seemed to make sense Apple is supposedly getting into the automotive business. \"For Apple, the car is the next logical thing to finally offer a significant innovation,\" he noted. \"A new pencil or a bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough.\" (Musk also wants to go nuclear on Mars.)
