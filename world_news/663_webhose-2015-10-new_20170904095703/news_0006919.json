Independent modern controls on all test machines enabling engineers much greater control and flexibility for more complex testing with no reconfiguration. Increased number of data logging points / variables. The new test sets are also fitted with Quartzteq's Lifeview condition monitoring system, enabling live customer demonstrations. \nWith the move to the new purpose built facility, over 200 tonnes of equipment for the test bed had to be moved. There was also 2127m of power cable (150mm2 and above) removed from the old facility, with 70-80% reused and a further 1500m of new power cable installed. \nOver 200m of copper busbar was removed and re-installed (180 joints/720 nuts and bolts) and over 720m of aluminium busbar removed and reinstalled (660 joints/3000 nuts and bolts).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:19:35.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
