VADs are often used in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). HF is a chronic disease that occurs when degeneration of the heart muscle reduces the pump power of the heart, which causes the heart to become too weak to pump blood at a level sufficient to meet the body's demands. \nThe condition may be caused by arterial and valve diseases or cardiomyopathy, which is disease of the heart muscle itself. Other conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes may also lead to HF. \nAbiomed had the lion's share of the U.S. market for pVADs in 2015, with CardiacAssist making up the balance. However, the competitive landscape may soon change. On July 13, 2015, Thoratec announced that their HeartMate PHP® (Percutaneous Heart Pump) had received CE Mark approval. With enrollment in U.S. clinical trials for the HeartMate PHP® slated to begin in the third quarter of 2015 and St. Jude Medical's commitment to developing a portfolio of cutting edge devices for treating heart failure, a new pVAD could enter the U.S. market within the forecast period. \nThe U.S. market for intra-aortic balloon pump disposable devices comprises conventional and fiber-optic balloon catheters. Fiber-optic intra-aortic balloon catheters are distinguished from conventional fluid-filled intra-aortic balloon catheters by their ability to transmit precise arterial pressure signals to the intra-aortic balloon pump console at the speed of light. \nIn 2015, SynCardia was the sole competitor in the U.S. market for artificial heart replacement devices. As of August 2015, the company's Total Artificial Heart was only approved for commercial use as a temporary device. However, the U.S. market for artificial heart replacement devices may soon grow to include permanent artificial heart replacement devices. \nIn December 2014, SynCardia's investigational device exemption application to conduct a study of the effectiveness of the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart for destination therapy was approved by the FDA. Approval of the Total Artificial Heart for destination therapy would allow for treatment of a new cohort of patients and impel rapid growth in the U.S. market for artificial heart replacement devices. \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:37:44.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
