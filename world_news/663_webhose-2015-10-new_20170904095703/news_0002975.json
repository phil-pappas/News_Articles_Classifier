The closing of the transaction is still pending a vote of Solera stockholders, among other conditions.\nSolera provides software to the automobile-claims-processing industry. An affiliate of U.S.-based Vista Equity purchased all outstanding shares of Solera for $55.85 each in cash, representing a premium of 53% over the company's closing share price of $36.39 on Aug. 3.\nThe deal included a combination of common and preferred equity contributions by investment funds affiliated with Vista, Koch Equity Development and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nSolera is home to brands such as Audatex, CarweB, and AUTOonline, serving customers that include car-insurance companies, collision-repair facilities and independent assessors. Tesla Motors Inc., for example, uses Solera's software to process collision-repair estimates and insurance claims at its collision-repair centers.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at Ezequiel.Minaya@wsj.com\n 13, 2015 06:50 ET (10:50 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:08:28.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
