The modules are individually designed to measure analogue, digital, temperature, pulse, CAN, and NVH signals. V-Max 4000 is designed with ten times the sampling capacity of the model's predecessor, allowing much faster sample rates in the data.\nIt is also showcasing LabLINK, an advanced testing application that will streamline testing processes and help increase the utilization of test equipment. Visitors should also stop by Link Engineering's booth for more information on all of its product lines for brake and friction, transmission and driveline, and wheel end testing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:50:42.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
