My phone conked out just a few days ago, in perfect timing for Gitex,” she beamed. Anna, who works as an admin officer in a private firm in Dubai, also picked one for her husband.“Actually, I bought two. One for me, and one for my husband. It’s our 10th wedding anniversary, and I thought the iPhone6s Plus would be the perfect gift we could give each other.” While the official release of UAE is October 10, some retailers at the Gitex Shopper are already offering the latest gadget.“There is a huge demand for both iPhone 6s, and iPhone 6s Plus. Within a few hours (on the opening day), I’ve run out of stocks for the iPhone 6s Plus, and have asked my boys to bring in a fresh batch,” said the manager at Viva Star General Trading. UAE’s telecom operators Etisalat and Du are allowing customers to pre-book the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus if they sign up for their monthly rental schemes. The eight-day consumer electronics shopping convention at the Dubai World Trade Centre is on till October 10. Tickets are priced at Dh30 for adults and kids above five years.
