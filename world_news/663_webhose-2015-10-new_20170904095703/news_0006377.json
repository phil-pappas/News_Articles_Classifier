The Innovation Award specifically highlights Autodesk's leadership in private cloud development and exceptional use of Tintri storage. Autodesk uses Tintri to manage 1.8 petabytes of storage across four data centers. A single (non-storage) admin manages all storage actions for over 8,000 virtual machines in less than two hours per week. Autodesk was on hand to accept the award in front of hundreds of peers at Tintri's annual user conference. \nTintricity was a packed event -- other highlights include: Kieran Harty, Tintri CTO and Co-Founder, walked through Tintri's vision for VM-aware storage that includes VM scale-out, advanced analytics with insight across all applications and data center, and containers support Carl Eschenbach, VMware President and COO, stepped away from VMworld to speak on stage at Tintricity and stated that VM-aware storage is central to the software-defined data center Cirrity, a cloud service provider, signed an agreement on stage to replace all of their NetApp storage with Tintri VM-aware storage Keith Pratola, Atlantic Metro Communications Senior Cloud Architect, was awarded with Tintri's Champion Award for the individual that best evangelizes VM-aware storage \nSummarizing Tintricity, Tintri CEO and Chairman, Ken Klein stated: \"We're so proud of the relationship we have with our customers. It's built on the strength of our product today, our future roadmap and our prioritization of service. It was energizing to see so many familiar faces and meet new friends on our mission to champion VM-aware storage.\" \nFor those who missed Tintricity, you can watch live presentations of customer-led breakouts from the event as a three-part webinar series.
