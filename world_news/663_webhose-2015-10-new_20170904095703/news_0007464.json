Bloomberg by Karen Maley Twitter's share price may have perked up after Jack Dorsey was anointed as chief executive last week, but the social media company still faces an uphill battle when it comes to mending its relationship with Wall Street.\nBut Twitter is far from the only high tech company keen to improve relations with investors, who have grown become decidedly cooler on the tech sector this year.\nLast Wednesday's initial public offering of Pure Storage – the first float of a tech company in almost three months – was meant to be a confidence booster. But the data storage company saw its share price tumble to $16.01 on its first day of trading, well below the offer price of $17 a share.\nAlthough some high-tech giants such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon have seen their share prices hit record highs this year, these gains mask savage declines elsewhere in the sector.\nFor instance, shares in Twitter have fallen almost 50 per cent in the past year, while Yelp, which specialises in publishing consumer reviews, has suffered a share price drop of more than 50 per cent this year.\nOther debutants fare worse And the more recent sharemarket debutants are not faring much better. Six months after its spectacularly successful share market listing, the artisan craft site Etsy is trading below its IPO price, as are Lending Club, the world's biggest peer-or-peer lender, and the online storage company, Box.\nAfter hitting a $119 high last November, the share price of the Chinese technology giant Alibaba has since tumbled to $68.73, only slightly above the IPO price.\n One reason for this dismal share price performance is that investors are finally realising that their earlier hopes for the sector were grossly unrealistic. For instance, Twitter's share price soared to a record high of $US74 in December 2013, which gave it a market capitalisation of more than $US40 billion or more than 35 times the revenue the company was expected to generate in 2014.\nWith such an extreme valuation, it was always going to be difficult for the San Francisco-based company to live up to expectations. And so it was not surprising that Twitter's share price dropped sharply after the company delivered a lacklustre second-quarter result and warned of slowing user growth.\nIndeed, the unveiling of quarterly earnings reports is becoming an increasingly perilous exercise. At the end of July, Yelp's share price fell by more than 20 per cent in a single trading session because of disappointing second-quarter earnings.\nSliding share prices also have a huge impact on the hip-pockets of employees, particularly since it's commonplace for Silicon Valley companies to attract talent by handing out free options to purchase shares.\nBut as their share prices wobble, many high-tech companies are finding their workforce is coming under increasing attack from \"unicorns\" – the name given to start-ups valued at $US1 billion or more.\nHiring sprees In particular, Uber – the largest unicorn, with a valuation of more than $US50 billion, and Airbnb have engaged in hiring sprees, poaching highly skilled workers from other tech companies with the offer of generous salaries and lucrative stock packages.\nTo retain key talent, tech companies have had to boost salary levels but this causes a blowout in costs, making it even more difficult for them to deliver the ambitious results that investors expect.\nAnd there is little sign that these pressures will abate any time soon, particularly after venture capitalists poured more than $US17 billion into start-ups in the second quarter.\nThis easy access to funding also removes any pressure on the unicorns to seek a sharemarket listing. Not surprisingly, the unicorns are very wary of subjecting themselves to the whims of the market, where they could suffer the same fate as Twitter, Yelp or Etsy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:28:03.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
