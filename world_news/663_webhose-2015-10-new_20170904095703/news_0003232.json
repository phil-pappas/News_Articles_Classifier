This assumption has historically kept the volume of tricuspid repair and replacement procedures relatively low. While the volume of tricuspid replacement procedures has remained low in recent years, the volume of tricuspid repair procedures has increased strongly, reaching over 10,000 procedures in 2015. \nThe increase in tricuspid repair procedures has been pushed by a growing awareness among cardiologists of the hazards of leaving severe tricuspid regurgitation untreated. The volume of tricuspid replacement procedures has remained low due to the lower mortality rates associated with tricuspid repair relative to replacement. \nThe U.S. market for transcatheter heart valve devices comprises transcatheter repair and implantation devices. Though the markets for transcatheter repair and implantation devices have both experienced rapid growth in recent years, as of 2015, the majority of the U.S. market for transcatheter heart valve devices is represented by transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) devices. Strong growth in the U.S. market for TAVI devices has been set in motion by FDA approvals expanding the indication for use of these devices. \nIn June 2015, the FDA approved Edwards Lifesciences' SAPIEN 3® Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) and Medtronic's CoreValve Evolut R® System for treating patients who are at high risk for open-heart surgery. The wider range of patients able to receive treatment with TAVI devices has driven double-digit growth in unit sales in recent years. Medtronic's entry into the U.S. market for TAVI devices has also helped to power growth in the value of the market. Since receiving approval from the FDA for the CoreValve® in early 2014, Medtronic has rapidly gained share in the U.S. market for TAVI devices. Despite the growing popularity of the CoreValve®, Edwards' SAPIEN® valve continues to hold the largest share of the U.S. market for TAVI devices. \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:36:37.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
