(NASDAQ: CDRB), an enterprise software development firm that licenses its proprietary software solution to enable simplified secure access and communications between PC and Mac environments on virtually any computer, tablet, or smartphone, today discussed top trends shaping security within enterprise mobility IT infrastructure and how the Company is positioning itself to support customers' security vulnerabilities through continued product improvement and innovation. \nMore and more enterprises with a regional and/or multi-national presence have personnel in the field or on the go. The cost- and productivity benefits of \"Enterprise Mobility Solutions\" such as virtualization and cloud computing for companies and personnel are significant and gaining recognition. Virtualization continues to be in the high demand with cloud computing not far behind it. Tom Moreno, Code Rebel President, commented on the trend, \"We are still not in a place for companies to completely trust their data out in the cloud, but more and more IT managers are starting to utilize and take advantage of the flexibility and mobility a virtualized infrastructure can provide like off-site backups and storage.\" \nWhile larger companies are focused on implementing virtualization and/or transitioning to virtualized environments, smaller companies are looking to Remote Access, an extension of virtualization, to meet enterprise mobility infrastructure needs. \"Remote Access continues to be important component of all deployments -- large or small -- especially as more personnel are operating and conducting business from mobile devices such as tablets, smartphones, wearables and smaller laptops,\" stated Moreno. \nDue to the recent rise in hacking incidents of large well-known enterprises, there is another trend that Code Rebel is keeping a close eye on -- Security. Not only do security breaches expose critical business and personal data to internet thieves, but also these breaches cost corporate victims staggering amounts of money -- millions upon millions in losses. \nGiven the importance of what is at stake and rise in mobility, companies are beginning to make earnest efforts to be more assured of the integrity of their deployed solutions. Management believes demand for an aspect of security called \"integrity verification\" where both devices and applications are verified before allowing connections into the enterprise, will grow alongside other security measures. \n\"Trends that suggest that enterprise virtualization, cloud and mobility are being fast adopted will not be successful unless we make security our first priority. We at Code Rebel recognize the importance of these trends and are focused on developing and deploying secure cross platform enterprise solutions to our customers that support virtualization, cloud and mobility. Among our many goals for the iRAPP protocol is to eventually allow for secure connectivity across all of the facets of technology no matter where you are located or what device you choose to operate from,\" added Moreno. \nLeading Code Rebel customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as AT&T, Microsoft, Cisco and Bloomberg, use iRAPP to enhance enterprise collaboration, employee productivity and services. Additional customers include Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, Lloyds Bank, Merck, Panasonic and IKEA, as well as organizations such as the University of California, University of Texas and University of Missouri. \nFor more information on Code Rebel products and current uses, please visit: http://www.coderebel.com/products/ and http://www.coderebel.com/about/news/casestudies/ \nAbout Code Rebel \nCode Rebel is an enterprise software company that develops, licenses, and supports software designed for cross-platform enterprise security and productivity.
