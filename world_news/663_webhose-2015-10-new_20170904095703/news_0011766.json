Biogen had about 8,000 employees globally before the cuts, a spokesman said.\nBiogen said it would reinvest the money in its most promising research and development programs, including an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's disease that recently entered late-stage studies. Biogen also will use the money to fund increased sales and marketing initiatives, including a direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, for its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, its largest product by revenue.\n\"This year has been a challenging one for those of us here at Biogen,\" Chief Executive George Scangos said during a conference call with analysts Wednesday. \"This decision to reduce our workforce was extremely difficult.\"\nEven amid the cost-cutting, Biogen said it had spent $3.9 billion to repurchase its own stock on the open market. The company had $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the third quarter.\nIn addition to the restructuring, Biogen also reported third-quarter results and updated its 2015 guidance, both of which largely exceeded analyst expectations. The company said profit rose 13% to $965.6 million, or $4.15 a share, in the third quarter, up from $856.9 million, or $3.62 a share, a year earlier.\nRevenue grew to $2.78 billion from $2.51 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $3.80 a share in earnings on $2.65 billion in revenue.\nShares of Biogen, which had fallen 35% over the past three months, rose 2.2% to $271.52 in recent trading.\nIn July, the company lowered its revenue and profit growth expectations because of slowing growth for Tecfidera. Fewer new patients are being prescribed the drug, Biogen has said, in part because of doctors' concerns about a rare side effect that was linked to a patient death last year.\nEarlier this month, Biogen's sales chief, Tony Kingsley left the company. Mr. Scangos said Wednesday that Mr. Kingsley had been \"instrumental\" to launching new drugs at Biogen since joining the company more than five years ago.\nIn the third quarter, Tecfidera revenue rose 19% to $937 million. But the growth rate slowed from the 26% year-over-year growth in the second quarter and the 63% growth in the first quarter.\nTecfidera revenue benefited from a price increase, which was partially offset by factors including rebates given to health insurers, Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy said on the conference call. About $10 million to $15 million in Tecfidera sales were the result of increased purchases by government health care programs seeking to increase their inventory before the end of their fiscal years, Mr. Clancy said.\nShares of biopharmaceutical companies have fallen significantly in recent months amid increasing political and media scrutiny of drug prices and concerns that equity valuations had become unreasonable after years of outperforming the market. Biogen, like many drug makers, has relied on price increases to help drive revenue growth in its core franchise of multiple sclerosis treatments.\n\"There's been a lot of rhetoric about drug pricing recently, part of that is the presidential campaign,\" Mr. Scangos said during the call. \"I don't expect that rhetoric to go away any time soon.\"\nMr. Scangos added that the biopharma industry was preparing a \"thoughtful presentation\" in response to pricing concerns that would characterize the value that drugs bring to patients.\nCambridge, Mass.-based Biogen is the first of the four largest biopharma companies to report third-quarter earnings and is seen as a bellwether for the industry.\nSeparately, Biogen announced a setback in the failure of its drug Tysabri to help patients with a severe form of multiple sclerosis.\nFor 2015, Biogen said it now expects revenue to grow 8% to 9% from a year ago, up from its predicted growth of 6% to 8% in July. The company also raised its outlook on per-share earnings excluding certain items, to a range of $16.20 to $16.50 from the July estimate of $15.50 to $15.95.\nAnalysts, on average, had expected per-share earnings of $15.84 on revenue growth of 8%.\nWrite to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com and Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n 21, 2015 11:04 ET (15:04 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:09:09.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
