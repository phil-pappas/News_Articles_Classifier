PACE lets property owners borrow money for energy upgrades including solar panels and then pay back the loans with their property taxes, much like an assessment.\nThe program helps property owners tackle the high uprfont costs for such upgrades as roof-top solar.\nBrandsMart obtained its latest loan through a program run by Ygrene Energy Fund in a PACE district that now spans more than 20 municipalities in Miami-Dade County. (Ygrene is energy spelled backward.)\nThat South Florida program probably will provide up to $50 million in PACE loans this year, more than seven times the volume last year, said Joseph Spector, vice president of operations for Ygrene Florida.\nNext year, its PACE loans could reach up to $200 million, thanks in part to new rulings by Florida's Supreme Court that uphold validations on bonds backing PACE loans, Spector said.\nSome cities in Broward also are looking to join Ygrene's PACE district in South Florida, since Broward's countywide programs have not begun, Spector said.\nAt its Miami Gardens store, BrandsMart plans to install energy-efficient LED lights, a new more energy-efficient roof and more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment.\ndhemlock@sunsentinel.com , 305-810-5009, @dhemlock on Twitter\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56166e05/turbine/fl-pace-update-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:56:28.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
