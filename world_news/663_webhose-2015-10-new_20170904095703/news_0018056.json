China's giant manufacturing industry contracted and euro zone and U.S. growth eased in August, data published earlier this month showed, while the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for world growth this year.\nTaiwan's tech titans are also downbeat.\nManufacturers in the upstream supply chain such as TSMC and Mediatek Inc, both chipmakers, and ASE , which tests and packages chips, have warned recently against being optimistic about the second half of the year, traditionally a peak season for the tech sector.\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:51:15.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
