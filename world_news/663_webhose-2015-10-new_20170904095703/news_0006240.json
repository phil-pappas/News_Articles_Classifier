The two companies now collaborate on AWS technology that lets companies run SAP software, commonly used for essential corporate chores like tracking inventory and maintaining financial records, on Amazon's cloud-computing network instead of on their own internal facilities.\n\"We partner with Amazon in some areas and compete in others,\" Mr. Lucas said. A spokeswoman for AWS didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSAP said its new software differed from rival offerings in giving companies the ability to spot trends gleaned from every digital nook, such as tying an increase in warranty claims in one part of the country to a local uptick in air pollution.\n\"That to me is more than visualization of data,\" Mr. Lucas said.\nWrite to Shira Ovide at shira.ovide@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nOctober 05, 2015 15:16 ET (19:16 ", "external_links": ["http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:28:02.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
