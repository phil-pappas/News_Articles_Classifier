How the probe will approach the moon\nDr Curt Niebur, programme scientist on the £2.1billion space mission, said: “This incredible plunge through the Enceladus plume is an amazing ­opportunity for NASA and its ­international partners on the Cassini mission to ask, ‘Can any icy ocean world host the ­ingredients for life?’”\nAt 310 miles across, ­Enceladus is the sixth largest of Saturn’s satellites and its about a seventh of the size of our own Moon .\nOn Wednesday, at 3.22pm UK time, the Cassini probe will shoot through the plume above the satellite’s south polar region at an altitude of 30 miles.\nThe same spacecraft first spotted the plume in 2005, a year after it arrived in Saturn’s system.\nAround 100 geysers erupting from the surface, known as “tiger stripes”, have been identified as its source.\nJPL-Caltech/Nasa/PA What lies beneath? An artist's impression of Enceladus\nThey are thought to have a fiery origin deep beneath the satellite’s surface and are believed to be similar to ­hydrothermal vents on Earth.\nThese are volcanic fissures on the ocean floor where sea water percolating through fractures in the bedrock is heated to high ­temperatures.\nTheir chemistry gives rise to areas teeming with life in some of the deepest, coldest and darkest corners of the world’s oceans.\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:43:36.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
