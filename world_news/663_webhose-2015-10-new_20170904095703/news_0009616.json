The company purchased the 56,666-square-foot, two-story building and renovated the facility into 51,000 square feet of office space and roughly 6,000 square feet of warehouse space. In addition, construction is wrapping up on a 34,000-square-foot building specifically designed to house the company’s document restoration equipment and services.\n“The move into our new headquarters is a significant moment in our 67-year history. It reflects the growth we have experienced and represents the continued expansion we are driving toward,” said Tom Head, president of Blackmon Mooring and BMS CAT.\nThis new office building allows for the previously separate headquarters of Blackmon Mooring and BMS CAT to be combined under one roof, streamlining several corporate and operating functions and providing ample space for existing and future staff.\n“With its advanced technology and collaborative work environment, the new headquarters is providing our employees with great opportunities to come together as one team,” said Head. “There's genuine excitement about our new home, and more importantly, greater excitement about our future.”\nIn 1948, best friends Bill Blackmon and Scott Mooring opened a furniture and dye shop together in Fort Worth, Texas, under the name Blackmon Mooring. They quickly added carpet cleaning and rug cleaning to their service line.\nIn May of 1949, the Trinity River levee broke, causing major flooding in Fort Worth, and Blackmon Mooring was there to help clean up the aftermath. It was the company’s first foray into disaster recovery and lead to a full line of fire and water restoration services.\nOver the next few decades, Blackmon Mooring expanded its services and opened additional locations in nine cities across Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia. In 1981, the company expanded its reach globally with the addition of the BMS CAT division and since then, it has responded to some of the world's most devastating disasters.\n“Our founding fathers’ entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well today and is only part of what has brought us success,” said Head. “Blackmon Mooring and BMS CAT would not be possible without the support of our valued customers, and we look forward to continuing to find ways to better serve them.”\nBlackmon Mooring and BMS CAT specialize in disaster restoration, clean up and reconstruction services for both commercial and residential customers.
