The proliferation of mobile devices, such as phones and wearables which include a varying amount of sensors, are part of an expanding computing environment that combines data streams and services. The large amounts of data coming from the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, and wearable devices creates opportunities for companies to develop analytical apps that deliver timely information to the end user. Big Data is becoming more connected through mobile devices and IoT sensors, and all that data creates opportunities for businesses to focus their marketing efforts to prospective customers, and develop in depth user profiles. New methods of reaching end user customers are growing to include the “endless payment” subscription model and the “pay for-use” model. The subscription model creates a long term recurring revenue stream, and the customer gets access to the latest software, phones, hardware, etc. The pay-per-use model is expanding to such areas as services (Uber), people (movers), places (parking spots), and systems (cloud service). Smart machines with advanced algorithms combine advanced robots, virtual personal assistants and smart advisors to create a new age of machine assistants. Cloud and mobile computing are converging to allow customers to have coordinated access to any device, and organizations will need to apply more sophisticated risk assessment and mitigation tools, where every app will need to be self-protecting since firewalls are no longer effective. \nPlease see full Newsletter below for more information. \nFirefox recommends the PDF Plugin for Mac OS X for viewing PDF documents in your browser. \nWe can also show you Legal Updates using the Google Viewer; however, you will need to be logged into Google Docs to view them. \nPlease choose one of the above to proceed! \nLOADING PDF: If there are any problems, click here to download the file. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Buchalter Nemer …\" By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy Policy.
