But few solutions on the market today address the business and workflow issues that come with the next generation workplace,” said Ira M. Weinstein, senior analyst and partner at Wainhouse Research. “Polycom’s new releases challenge the notion that work happens in traditional meeting rooms only. Instead, these solutions bring collaboration to the places customers want to work including small meeting rooms and informal meeting spaces.” \nPolycom’s new solutions expand the company’s rich collaboration product and services portfolio that fully interoperates with the broadest set of ecosystem partners and provides customers the opportunity to build a comprehensive culture of collaboration and to make the workplace of the future a reality.
