Excluding currency fluctuations and divested businesses, revenue fell 1%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of $19.62 billion.\nFor the year, and excluding certain items, the company lowered its per-share earnings estimate to $14.75 to $15.75 and relatively flat cash flow, compared with its previous estimate for per-share profit of $15.75 to $16.50 and positive cash flow.\nBig Blue has been shedding unprofitable hardware businesses as it reorganizes itself around a set of emerging cloud, security and data analytics businesses that Chief Executive Virginia Rometty has dubbed the company's \"strategic imperatives.\"\nFor the latest quarter, revenue from its strategic imperatives increased 17%, and grew 27% excluding currency impacts and divestitures. That marked a decline from the 20% growth, and 30% increase, excluding currency fluctuations and divestitures, reported for the second quarter.\nOverall, IBM reported a profit of $2.95 billion, or $3.01 a share, up from $18 million, or two cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included pretax charges of $4.7 billion related to IBM's former chip operations, which were taken over by Globalfoundries Inc.\nExcluding such one-time items, per-share earnings from continuing operations fell to $3.34 from $3.68. Analysts expected per-share profit of $3.30.\nGross margin rose to 48.9% from 48.6%.\nThe company reported sales declines across its major businesses, led by a 39% drop in its hardware segment to $1.49 billion as growth in revenue from its z Systems mainframe server products was offset by declines in power systems revenue and system storage revenue. But excluding currency impacts and the divestiture of its lower-end-server System x business, hardware segment sales dropped 2%.\nBeyond its hardware business, IBM reported that global-technology-segment revenue fell 10% to $7.94 billion, but excluding the divestiture and currency impacts, revenue improved by 1%.\nSoftware-segment revenue declined 10% to $5.14 billion, but excluding currency fluctuations, revenue dropped 3%. Also excluding currency impacts, revenue from IBM's key middleware products fell 1% and revenue from operating systems decreased 7%.\nGlobal business-services revenue decreased 13% to $4.21 billion, but currency impacts dropped 5%.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"NIRI Demo Co\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014\n 19, 2015 16:35 ET (20:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:20:59.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
