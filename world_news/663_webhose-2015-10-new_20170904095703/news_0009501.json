It will also support corporate efforts to bring automated vehicles to market, the province said. The initiative will make Ontario Canada’s first province to allow driverless or self-driving vehicles to hit the streets. \nIn addition to the program, Ontario is also pledging $500,000 in further funding to the Ontario Centres of Excellence Connected Vehicle/Automated Vehicle Program, a fund it says brings academic institutions and business together to promote and encourage innovative transportation technology. \n“In the world of transportation, Ontario has the opportunity to show leadership on automated technology,” Steven Del Duca, Ontario’s Minister of Transportation, said. “Today, Ontario is making its claim in the global marketplace by taking the next steps in automated vehicle innovation. The automated vehicle pilot will ensure that the province’s roads remain safe without creating burdens that stifle investment and innovation in Ontario’s dynamic business environment.” \nAlong with increasing safety, autonomous vehicles have the potential to cut down on gridlock by operating more efficiently than traditional vehicles. Driverless vehicles could also prove to be a significant boon from a climate change perspective. Coupled with less time spent in wasteful gridlock, the technology could lead to a multitude of efficiencies not possible with a human behind the wheel.
