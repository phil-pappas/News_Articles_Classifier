By eating invasive vegetation, these animals will help to maintain the steppe character of the land.\nAfter a nine-hour drive and few more minutes of hesitation, six calves — five cows and a bull — jumped out of a truck at dawn to take the first look at their new home at the former Milovice military base, 35 kilometers (22 miles) northeast of Prague.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/10/8782397/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/10/8782397/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/10/8782396/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/10/8782398/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/10/8782398/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/10/8782396/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:34:13.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
