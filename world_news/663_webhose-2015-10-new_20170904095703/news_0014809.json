The center's furtive recordings of Planned Parenthood officials discussing their retrieval of fetal tissue have sparked an uproar by conservatives.\nThe federation obtained a court order in San Francisco against public release of footage recorded at its recent gatherings. But videos have been posted online at a conservative website, GotNews.com.\nWebsite founder Charles C. Johnson says on his site that he believes the court order does not apply to him.\nThe federation says releasing more videos \"will likely lead to more threats, intimidation and possibly violence.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:16:02.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
