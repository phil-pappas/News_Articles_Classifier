They consume content, communicate, shop, and bank online. Technology has become a key part of our daily lives. With the many benefits of technology also come some risks so it’s important to promote online safety and support safeguards, especially for young people.\nAt AT&T, we support the continued need for consumer education and awareness. Our Smart Controls website provides comprehensive access to information for our customers about AT&T safety and control tools, expert resources and tips designed to help customers manage their technology choices and address safety concerns about children’s use of our products and services.\nWe also collaborate with many external organizations and experts to support online safety and privacy education for all ages. For example:\nThrough FOSI, we have supported various such initiatives, including Good Digital Parenting , which is a project focused on providing advice, tips and tools to parents so they can help encourage their kids to become good digital citizens, engage in responsible online behavior and use technology for positive change. We recently launched Digital You — a comprehensive AT&T program that offers tools, tips, apps, guidance and community education events for people of all ages and levels of online experience to learn more about how to have a safe and secure online experience.

Stakeholders – from government, law enforcement, industry, non-profits, parents, teachers, researchers, media and young people – all have an important role to play. Indeed, as FOSI’s Founder & CEO Stephen Balkam highlighted at the conference, the best way to ensure an effective framework is developed and implemented is to bring together all stakeholders in an open, ongoing dialogue.\nWe are committed to the multi-stakeholder process as a way to build effective partnerships and develop innovative solutions for global Internet policy issues. Open discussion across the industry, along with NGOs and various government organizations and regulatory agencies, is the best way to develop an effective consensus on appropriate consumer safeguards.\n ", "external_links": ["http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/desi", "https://www.fosi.org/events/platform-good-launch/", "http://about.att.com/content/csr/home/issue-brief-builder/technology/protecting-privacy.html", "http://www.att.net/smartcontrols", "http://digitalyou.att.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:48:57.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
