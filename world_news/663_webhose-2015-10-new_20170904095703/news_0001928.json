First of all, a brand new mobile app, Track My Mac , that is designed to facilitate the process of recovering lost or stolen Macs directly from an iPhone. Secondly, all attendees will see the presentation of Memory Cleaner , a newly launched cleaning tool that can free up RAM (Random Access Memory) with one click and make the cleaning process on Macs easier and more effective.\nMoreover, the webinar attendees will get a special opportunity to have a personal session with Head of Support Department of MacKeeper. The details will be available at the first webinar.\nApart from the introduction of the new tools, during the autumn season of webinars the MacKeeper support expert will speak about:\nWebinar #1: 4 ways to protect your personal data from hacking attacks and leakage; Webinar #2: How to track your Mac with MacKeeper mobile app; Webinar #3: First-aid tips for your slow performing Mac.\n“The goal of the upcoming webinars is much bigger as compared to the previous seasons. All attendees have an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone: see the preliminary presentation of MacKeeper’s new tools, win the brand new license with Memory Cleaner, and those who will attend the last webinar will get a special offer. However, our educational initiative is not limited only by webinars. This autumn we kicked off our educational giveaway: free MacKeeper licenses for schools, colleges, and university computer labs. Therefore, don't miss a chance to help your school and apply for free licenses,” says Alexander Kernishniuk, CEO of MacKeeper.\nMac users and everyone who wishes to see the functionality of new MacKeeper tools, are welcome to attend the upcoming webinars.\nReminder: the webinar series start on October 17, with “4 ways to protect your personal data from hacking attacks and leakage”.\nTo join the first webinar, register for free using this link:\nhttps://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1624017526855182594\nPlease note that the number of webinar attendees is limited by 500.\nAbout MacKeeper\nAll-new MacKeeper 3.x is an award-winning service with 16 advanced Mac utility tools and the Human Inside feature.
