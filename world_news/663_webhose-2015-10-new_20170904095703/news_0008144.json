LiGo – is a face-to-face networking tool that enables participants to meet the right people at events.\n4. PheedLoop – an event engagement tool that gathers actionable data and analytics.\nThe shortlist was selected from a total of 26 companies that entered this year’s contest.\nThe panel of judges included: Greg Bogue of Maritz Travel; Brandt Krueger of brandtkrueger.com; James Morgan PhD, CSEP Event Tech Lab; Julius Solaris, Event MB and IMEX Group’s Miguel Neves, CMP.\nThe winning product is set to benefit from publicity across IMEX America media and PR channels as well as free of charge exhibition space on the Technology Pavilion at IMEX America 2016.\nThe winner of last year’s inaugural competition, Speecheo, which offers a speaker effectiveness app, has been making the most of its complimentary booth at IMEX America this year. Since winning the award, the company has attracted investor interest and has been accepted into one of the best startup incubators in Paris.\nJulius Solaris commented “The attention on event technology in the industry is unprecedented. Our commitment at EventMB is to foster innovation and give a chance to innovative start-ups to showcase their technology. The role that IMEX has in giving such a platform for recognition is inspiring. IMEXpitch has become the de facto event to learn about innovation in the industry.”\n“So many great entrants were in the mix this year and it was certainly challenging to choose,” said Miguel Neves, IMEX’s Senior Online Community Manager. “Luckily everyone in the industry is a winner because there are a lot of great technology options out there to make meetings more engaging, plugged in and manageable for meetings professionals and delegates.”\n“I’m really excited to win the #IMEXpitch,” said Loopd CEO Brian Friedman. “Engagement is getting a lot of attention at IMEX America and that’s really good to see and hear.
