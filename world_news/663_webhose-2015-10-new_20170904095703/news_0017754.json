Through Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 26% in the past 12 months.\nAdobe projected adjusted earnings for its 2016 business year of about $2.70 a share on about $5.7 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast per-share earnings of $3.19 and revenue of $5.93 billion.\nAdobe, famous for its publishing software like Photoshop that is widely used by creative types, as well as popular Flash software, has benefited recently from higher digital-media revenue. It forecast digital-media revenue growth of about 20% in fiscal 2016 and annually through 2018.\nIn its third quarter of this year, the latest available, the company posted digital media revenue of $769.7 million, up 24% from the same period a year earlier.\nThe company in mid-September announced a leadership shake-up, as David Wadhwani, its senior vice president and general manager for digital media, left to take a chief executive post at AppDynamics Inc. Bryan Lamkin, who previously headed the document cloud business, stepped up to lead a combined digital-media business.\nOn Tuesday, the San Jose, Calif., company also provided longer-term forecasts, saying it expected compound annual growth rates from 2015 to 2018 of about 20% for revenue and about 30% for adjusted earnings per share.\nWrite to Nathan Becker at nathan.becker@wsj.com\n 06, 2015 17:15 ET (21:15 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T09:41:41.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
