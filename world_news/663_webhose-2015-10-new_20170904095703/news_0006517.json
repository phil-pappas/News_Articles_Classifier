To this day, some of the best-known, including aspirin, morphine and digitalis, are either made from plants or based on plant molecules. So the fact that artemisinin, the newest treatment for malaria, is derived from a plant used for that purpose in China for well over 2,000 years should be no surprise. The earliest recipe consulted by artemisinin’s discoverer, Tu Youyou, was “The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies”, written in 340BC by Ge Hong (depicted alongside). It gave her helpful hints on how to extract the herb’s active principle.\nArtemisinin has played a pivotal role in the halving, since 2000, of the number of deaths inflicted by malaria (see article ). Dr Tu was therefore a laudable winner of a share in this year’s Nobel prize for physiology or medicine. She took an idea she had developed originally in a secret Chinese project designed to help keep North Vietnamese soldiers malaria-free during the Vietnam war, and pushed it forward to become the saviour of a field in which existing drugs were becoming less and less useful, because of the evolution of resistance to them by the parasite that causes malaria.\nIn this section Wisdom, ancient and modern Particle biology Looking for answers On the other hands Japan Malaria Contagious and infectious diseases Health and fitness Parasitic infections\nThe other winners of the medicine prize, William Campbell of America and Satoshi Omura of Japan, claim their shares for the discovery of another drug, avermectin, which is deployed against certain parasitic worms. This, too, is derived from a living organism, a bacterium called Streptomyces of which Dr Omura grew thousands of strains during the 1970s. He was looking for potential drugs, inspired by the fact that it had been the source of streptomycin, an early antibiotic. Dr Campbell then picked up on this work and struck lucky with one of Dr Omura’s compounds, which he found killed nematode worms of the sort that cause filariasis and river blindness. Today avermectin’s descendant, ivermectin, is regarded as so important that it is on the World Health Organisation’s List of Essential Medicines, which catalogues those drugs that even the most basic medical system needs.\nStaying on message\nThe chemistry prize went to three researchers—Tomas Lindahl, a Swede, Paul Modrich, an American, and Aziz Sancar, a Turk—who between them helped work out how living creatures keep DNA’s message legible and ungarbled in the face of a hostile world. DNA faces a constant stream of chemical and physical attacks. Mutated or damaged DNA causes cancer, seems to be one reason why animals age, and is behind inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and haemophilia. To try to counteract this, cells nurse their DNA with a variety of proteins designed to repair damage before it can cause problems.\nDr Lindahl discovered one type of damage. DNA, he found, is not a stable molecule. A variety of chemical processes degrade it, including one in which cytosine (which is one of the four bases that encode genetic information) spontaneously transforms into an unwanted chemical called uracil. Having worked out the rate of decay, Dr Lindahl realised that multicellular life ought to be impossible: the DNA in its cells would simply crumble away too quickly.\nSince multicellular life clearly is possible, some sort of repair mechanism must exist. Working on bacteria, he discovered two proteins designed to fix this sort of damage. A whole suite of such “base-excision repair” proteins is now known to exist, in complex life as well as the single-celled sort. These are capable of fixing more than 100 different types of DNA damage.\nDr Sancar’s work illuminated how cells repair the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation. Exposure to ultraviolet can cause adjacent bases on a DNA strand to form bonds with each other, rather than with their counterparts on the other side of the molecule’s famous double helix. Dr Sancar helped elucidate the chemical mechanism, called “nucleotide-excision repair”, by which the damaged chunk of DNA is cut out and replaced with a fresh, correctly functioning piece.\nDr Modrich, meanwhile, studied the damage that can occur during DNA replication. The original DNA molecule present in a fertilised egg cell is copied and recopied trillions of times over the course of an organism’s life. But the process is imperfect. Dr Modrich helped discover the “mismatch repair” system, which, as the name suggests, fixes mismatches that arise between DNA’s two strands during the process of cell division, reducing the error rate a thousandfold.\nParasite control is immediately relevant to human well-being. Understanding DNA repair points the way to better medicine. The physics prize went to a more rarefied piece of research—but an important one, nevertheless, because it may lead to an explanation of why the universe is made of matter rather than having been an equal mix of matter and antimatter that would have long since annihilated itself. This is the discovery that subatomic particles called neutrinos have mass. The winners here were Takaaki Kajita, of Japan, and Arthur McDonald, a Canadian.\nOnce upon a time\nNeutrinos were proposed in 1930 as a way to balance the equations of nuclear decay. They exist in immense numbers, seeping from Earth’s core, streaming from the sun, and sailing across the galaxy from far-flung supernovae. Yet they are exceptionally disinclined to interact with other types of particle. It took until 1956 to catch one in a laboratory.\nNeutrinos come in three “flavours”—electron, muon and tau—that correspond to the fundamental particles of those names. Originally, they were thought to be massless, but two things were amiss. The first, noticed originally in the 1960s, was that not enough neutrinos were coming from the sun. Theory suggests solar neutrinos, generated by the fusion reactions that power the sun, should all be electron neutrinos, and these were the only sort that early detectors could register. But when, in 2001, Dr McDonald used more sophisticated detection equipment he found that the missing neutrinos were there—they just weren’t electron neutrinos. Dr Kajita, meanwhile, had discovered a second anomaly three years earlier. This was that when cosmic rays smash into the atmosphere they create fewer muon neutrinos than they should.\nOne explanation tied the whole mess together: neutrinos must change flavour as they travel. And for this to happen, theory requires they have some mass.\nThat they do is now accepted—hence the prize. How this could explain the universe’s existence relies on a complex chain of reasoning that leads to the formation out of the Big Bang of much heavier neutrinos than those of today. These then decayed asymmetrically, with a preference for particles made of matter rather than antimatter, leading to all the matter now around. This may sound a far-fetched conclusion to base upon a mathematical calculation. But then, back in 1930, so did the very existence of neutrinos.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/20151010_STP003_apple_news.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:26:00.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
