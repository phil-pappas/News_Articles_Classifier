The new plant highlights a flurry of recent openings for PENETRON, underlining the company’s continued strong growth around the world.\nEast Setauket, New York (PRWEB) October 19, 2015\nThe newest PENETRON production facility – and the first in Latin America – was recently inaugurated in Lorena, Brazil. The new plant highlights a flurry of recent openings for PENETRON, underlining the company’s continued strong growth around the world.\n“We invited key clients, engineers and partners to the opening ceremony prior to the biggest construction concrete trade show in Brazil,” explains Cláudio Neves Ourives, Director General of PENETRON Brazil. “It was a chance for everyone to learn about our growing local capabilities.”\nThe new plant is located close to the Atlantic coast, between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and provides work for over two dozen people. The production team has already ramped up output for virtually the entire PENETRON product line, including best-sellers like PENETRON ADMIX , PENETRON crystalline material, PENECRETE MORTAR and PENEPLUG rapid-setting crystalline compound.\nThe layout of the new production facility was planned to accommodate future growth. “Only the warehouse will need to be expanded to store the finished products,” says Cláudio Neves Ourives.\nHe adds that “Brazil is a large and steadily growing market for PENETRON products, and it is an ideal export base to the rest of Latin America. We see the new Lorena facility as the future hub for PENETRON in this part of the world.”\n“The past 12 months have been an extremely busy period of expansion for PENETRON around the globe,” notes Robert Revera, CEO and President of The PENETRON Group. “Along with the new facilities that came online in Europe and Asia, Lorena will add to our international network to help meet the growing market demand with local production capacity.”\nThe PENETRON Group is a leading manufacturer of specialty construction products for concrete waterproofing, concrete repairs and floor preparation systems. The Group operates through a global network, offering support to the design and construction community through its regional offices, representatives and distribution channels.\nFor more information on PENETRON waterproofing solutions, please visit penetron(dot)com or Facebook(dot)com/ThePenetronGroup, email CRDept(at)penetron(dot)com, or contact the Corporate Relations Department at 631-941-9700.\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13026067.htm\nInformation contained on this page is provided by an independent third-party content provider.
