AG set to release Ghost 2 in 2016 Article By: Hadlee Simons Mon, 19 Oct 2015 5:19 PM Share The AG Mobile Ghost. \nSouth African smartphone manufacturer AG Mobile will release a second flagship phone next year. \nIn an interview with iafrica.com, AG Mobile CEO Anthony Goodman said that the company will release a high-end smartphone in 2016. \nPlans for the Ghost 2 are still in the early stages, but Goodman shed some light on specs, saying it would have a 21-megapixel main camera and 10-core MediaTek chip. \nThe company added that it would possibly be 5.99mms thin, depending on the final design. \n\"It's about taking the chip and building an ID (design) around the chip as opposed to... the opposite,\" Goodman said. \nThe AG Mobile CEO added that in addition to Cell C, the company was looking at MTN as one partner for the device. So does this mean the device won't have a dual-SIM design then? \n\"The operators are starting to become much less particular than what they were. In the past it was an absolute no. And now a lot of the products we supply MTN are dual-SIM,\" Goodman explained, before adding that the issue still needs to be discussed. \nGoodman added that the extensive aftermarket support seen on the Ghost would also be available on the Ghost 2. \nGoodman said consumers can expect the Ghost 2 to hit the market in early 2016. \nGhost's performance? \nAs for sales, the Ghost ( review ) isn't laying waste to competitors, but its performance isn't bad either. \n\"We're doing about 800 a month, so not a lot... But it's Cell C only at the moment,\" Goodman explained. \nGoodman acknowledged that the contract pricing (at over R300 a month) may have hurt sales, so he revealed plans for a price cut later this year, down to a starting price of R249 a month. \nHe also added that as part of the promotion, the Ghost would be updated to enable WiFi-Calling on Cell C's network. \nStill, AG Mobile seems happy with the sales, seeing that it's the firm's first foray into high-end devices. \n\"I must say... for our first flagship, it's been good,\" Goodman continued. \nWhat about software updates for the Ghost? \nGoodman explained that over-the-air updates aren't supported on the device, but they will allow users to bring their phones in to be flashed to Lollipop. \n\"So we'll have OTA on Ghost 2... it'll probably come out with Marshmallow. But Ghost 1... assuming a customer really wanted a Lollipop upgrade, we'll flash it for them,\" he explained. \nCould a move to prepaid help the Ghost's sales though? \n\"As a prepaid offering, I think it may be a little bit pricey... It'll probably stay post-paid.\" Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:44:18.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
