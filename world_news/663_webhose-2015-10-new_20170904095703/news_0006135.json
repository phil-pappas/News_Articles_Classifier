Listen in as Dr. Rodriguez gets to the truth behind some of today's trending buzzwords in the workplace. \n\"There are a lot of conversations happening about the evolving workplace,\" stated Rodriguez. \"We decided to create a podcast series, something with a bit of an unexpected twist, to take the spirited dialogue we have about work and share it with the world in a snackable and entertaining way.\" \nThe first six episodes of the original podcast series explored the disruptive forces unleashing accelerated generational change and the path to employee wellbeing and sustainable organizational effectiveness.
