Cybersecurity pros caution that IoT devices lack sufficient security. ETCIO | 15 October 2015, 11:10 AM IST By Ashwani Mishra With ubiquitous network and interconnectivity, Internet of Things or IoT is laying the foundation where devices, machines, appliances etc. will be connected to the internet and talking to each other. Though it's prophesized to be the ultimate game changer, security is a major concern from an enterprise business prospective. A global survey from ISACA finds that IT and cybersecurity professionals depict an IoT that flies below the radar of many IT organizations, an invisible risk that survey respondents believe is underestimated and under-secured. As per the findings, 73 percent estimate the likelihood of an organization being hacked through an IoT device is medium or high while 63 percent state that the increasing use of IoT devices in the workplace has decreased employee privacy. The report found that 50 percent of respondents stating that their organization's BYOD (bring your own device) policy does not address wearable tech. \"In the hidden Internet of Things, it is not just connectivity that is invisible. What is also invisible are the countless entry points that cyber attackers can use to access personal information and corporate data. The rapid spread of connected devices is outpacing an organization's ability to manage it and to safeguard company and employee data,\" according to Christos K. Dimitriadis, International President, ISACA. The survey also said that 73 percent do not believe that security standards in the IT industry sufficiently address the IoT (and that updates are needed), and roughly half (49 percent) do not believe that their IT department is even aware of all of its organizations connected devices. However, there are some positive aspects to IoT adoption in the workplace. Seventy-seven percent of IT professionals say that the IoT has benefited their company, bringing things like greater accessibility to information (44 percent), greater efficiency (35 percent), improved services (34 percent), and increased productivity (25 percent). ISACA states that business risk of not embracing the Internet of Things - and falling behind competitors - may well outweigh any potential cost of a cyberattack.
