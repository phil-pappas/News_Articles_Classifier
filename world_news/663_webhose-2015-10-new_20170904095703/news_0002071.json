Don't click on them. (Contributed photo/Facebook) Comments \nQuick! Click this Facebook link so you can get a free iPhone 6 that's being given away by Apple in memory of founder Steve Jobs! Claim yours today! \nYou may have seen that message – or a similar one – on social media in recent days. But as with most things that look too good to be true, this is just another example of a scam that could open your computer up to spam and possibly compromise your data. \nThe post shows a photo of boxed iPhone6s with the following message: \"Apple CEO is giving free iPhone6s in memory of Steve Jobs. Claim your free iphone now!\" \nJobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He died Oct. 5, 2011. A motion picture about his life is scheduled for release later this month. \nIt's around the anniversary of Jobs' death each year that such scams as the free iPhone giveaway crop up on social media, according to the website hoaxslayer.com. \n\"The post is yet another Facebook scam designed to trick users into spamming their friends with the same fraudulent material and divulging their personal information via dodgy 'survey' and 'free offer' websites. Those who participate will certainly not get a free iPhone,\" the website noted. \nPeople who click on the iPhone post will be taken to another site that is designed to look like a Facebook page. Users will be instructed to go through a series of steps to claim their phone, including sending the message to other Facebook users. Participants eventually land on a page that offers more prizes for participating in various surveys with a requirement that users provide their name, address, email address and phone number. \nThat personal information will then be shared with marketers for use in phone calls, letters and emails. Participants will not receive a phone. \nThe iPhone giveaway isn't the only online hoax promising free Apple products. Snopes points to a variety of giveaway scams related to the anniversary of Jobs' death. Past \"offers\" have included free iPads, iPods or MacBooks. \nSnopes' said clicking on such offers isn't just a waste of time; they can actually open you up to harmful malware. \"All too often such adventures in clickjacking also result in the download of Trojans and other viruses onto the computers of those looking to score the promised goodies,\" the website said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:27:21.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
