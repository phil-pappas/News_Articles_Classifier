He also said he had every right to take the decision of suspending the Panj Pyaras. SGPC executive Karnail Singh Panjoli in Amritsar acknowledged having received such a communication. Soon after receiving the backing of CM Parkash Singh Badal and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Makkar told The Tribune the suspension of the Panj Pyaras would stay. The suspension of the Panj Pyaras has not been ratified by the SGPC executive committee. Makkar said he would now try to build a consensus on a possible solution to the crisis. \"I have the right to take this decision and I stand by it. However, to find an amicable solution, I will try to build a consensus among the Sikhs,\" he said. Makkar declined to reveal his strategy or tell whether he would arrange a meeting between the jathedars, Panj Pyaras and Sikh leaders. “I will only say that I am making efforts to build a consensus,” he said. Makkar is in the centre of a piquant situation confronting the Sikhs. It all began with Akal Takht pardoning the Dera Sacha Sauda chief in an alleged incident of blasphemy that took place in 2007. Makkar, in consultation with jathedars of four other temporal seats of Sikhs, later reversed the decision. However, the Panj Pyaras summoned the jathedars to elaborate on their decision of pardoning the dera chief. Makkar suspended the Panj Pyaras, thereby triggering another crisis as to who ruled supreme in the Sikh Panth. SAD spokesperson and Education Minister Daljeet Singh Cheema said: \"The Chief Minister and the Akali Dal expressed solidarity with Makkar.\" However, an Akali source said: “If the SGPC goes ahead and dismisses the suspended Panj Pyaras, religious feelings will be aroused further.” Major Singh, one of the Panj Pyaras, said the deadlock between them and the SGPC was still on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:59:26.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
