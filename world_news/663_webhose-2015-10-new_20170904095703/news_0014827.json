The display, too, isn't the best I've seen - it isn't full high-definition and appears washed out in direct sunlight. Browsing websites, email and social media are quite good, but the volume on the speaker leaves a lot to be desired - till we connect the Audio Cover. There's a marked improvement in acoustics, and the simulated 5.1 experience does make a difference. The cover makes for a great portable speaker as well. Asus also bundles in apps to customise the sound as well as the colour mode of the display.\n\nI tried playing Angry Birds 2 and Real Racing 3 on the tab - and I wasn't impressed. Not only do the games stutter sometimes (despite the 2GB of RAM), the tab also heats up. Funnily enough, the RAM suffices for all other tasks, and multi-tasking is quite smooth otherwise. The five-megapixel (MP) back camera is decent for casual outdoor shots, but the 2MP front camera will disappoint selfie addicts.\n\nThe Asus ZenPad 8.0 (Rs 17,999 with the Audio Cover), is a decent enough mid-range tab, provided one doesn't want to play games or click selfies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:26:40.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
