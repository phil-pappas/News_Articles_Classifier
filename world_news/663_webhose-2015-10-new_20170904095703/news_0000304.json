Email address 1: James Rundle 16 October 2015 The London Stock Exchange Group has announced that it will launch a new derivatives venue, known as CurveGlobal, along with a consortium of banks and a US exchange, in the second quarter of 2016. iStock \nCurveGlobal is backed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Societe Generale and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. It will initially offer trading in short-term interest rate futures in Euribor and short sterling, and long-term interest rate futures in bund, bobl, schatz and gilts. \nA fully fledged futures market has long been regarded as the missing piece of the puzzle for the LSE, which has eyed a business such as this for years. It lost out on a bid to buy Liffe, the dominant European venue for interest rates, in 2001. Liffe later became part of the Intercontinental Exchange Group, when it bought NYSE Euronext in 2013. \nIn its early stages, CurveGlobal was known as Project Rita, a tongue-in-cheek reference to stalled attempts in Europe to get new futures venues up and running that paid homage to the film Groundhog Day. The LSE believes that combining a derivatives venue with its upcoming portfolio margining service, which allows traders to net transactions and reduce their collateral costs, will differentiate it from other venues. \nProducts offered through CurveGlobal will be admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange Derivatives Market, and cleared at LCH.Clearnet, which is majority-owned by the LSE. The exchange group will initially take a 31.67% shareholding in CurveGlobal, but plans to reduce this to 25% over time with the addition of new shareholders. \nMichael Davie, formerly the chief operating officer of LCH.Clearnet, will take on a chairman role in the new firm, and has also become the LSE's new head of rates services. CurveGlobal's CEO is yet to be announced. \nIn a statement, Davie said: \"Rate markets have undergone considerable change in recent years, and market participants are under ever-increasing cost pressures. Customers want to safely manage risk and to maximise efficiency which the compelling combination of CurveGlobal and LCH.Clearnetâ€™s portfolio margining will deliver.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:03:51.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
