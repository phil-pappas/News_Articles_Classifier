People can check at www.floodsmart.gov . Wright said flood insurance has to be purchased 30 days before a flood hits.\nWright said if you buy flood insurance for just one year this is the year because more than one-third of California flood insurance claims in the past 27 years came in just four El Nino years.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:36:23.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
