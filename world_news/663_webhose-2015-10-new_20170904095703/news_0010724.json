Most of the costs related to fraud are passed on to merchants and consumers. That’s why the magnetic stripe has been in place for the last 40 years.\nThis month, the new federal standard for credit card payment terminals became the microchip. But let’s not kid ourselves about chip-embedded credit cards — fraud isn’t going to decline in any significant way. Chips are a half-step. Our credit card transactions will still be less secure than nearly every country in the G-20 because of a lack of willingness on the part of banks and credit card companies to institute a simple PIN number as a security check — the same PINs that are required for a bank’s ATM. The same PIN technology that in the United Kingdom has caused merchant fraud losses to fall by 67 percent.\nBut with the advent of Windows Hello, we now have a way to bring the numbers of lost and stolen card fraud to zero.\nBiometric technology is at the point where it’s basically 100 percent reliable. Consumers wouldn’t even have to carry a credit card. They would just look into a point-of-sale camera and the device would ask which method of payment they’d want to use. There would be no credit card number to steal.\nWhile new Windows phones contain iris scanners that recognize the patterns on the colored part of the eye, desktop devices go farther. New laptops that contain the Intel RealSense 3D Camera use infrared light to look for thermal signatures on your face. The camera senses depth, and therefore cannot be tricked by a photo.\nPayment terminals that featured a RealSense camera would basically be foolproof. To give you an idea of cost and feasibility, the Intel RealSense developer kit is priced at $99 and works like a normal Web cam.\nObviously there’s a downside here, and that’s privacy. But, consumers still have the option of carrying cash. And I’d argue you can’t expect the way your face looks to be considered private, especially in our YouTube-ubiquitous world.\nWe’re about to enter an era where our apps and email are more secure than a good chunk of our finances. And that’s something every American should be concerned about.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Booting+Up%3A+Iris+scans+better+than+chips+for+card+security"], "published": "2015-10-12T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:27.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
