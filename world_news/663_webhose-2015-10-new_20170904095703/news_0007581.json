This year, Millennium Distinctions will be awarded to M-Files Oy and Sebastiaan van Dijken, professor of physics at Aalto University.\nTAF awards the Millennium Distinction in alternate years with the Millennium Technology Prize. The distinction is granted to experts who operate in Finland and whose work is connected to the research field of the winners of the preceding Millennium Technology Prize. The Millennium Technology Prize 2014 winner was Stuart Parkin, 2012 Linus Torvalds, and the first award was given in 2004 to Tim Berners-Lee. The award has been compared often to the Nobel Prize per meaning of it.\n\"With this year's Millennium Distinctions, TAF wishes to pay tribute to the ground-breaking work carried out in Finland in the Big Data application field,\" said Juha Yl채-J채채ski, Chairman of the Selection Committee and President and CEO of TAF. \"This year's distinctions also highlight the impact around the globe as a result of the research and innovative work carried out in Finland.\"\nThe M-Files enterprise information management (EIM) solution is different from traditional folder-based systems in that it leverages metadata to classify and organize data and information by \"what\" it is instead of \"where\" it's stored. Thanks to the metadata, organizations can better leverage Big Data in business processes, analyzing and reporting data, and also in the integration between different systems.\n\"We are very honored by this prestigious recognition. M-Files has always been a forerunner of intelligent and effective use of metadata in information management. It is wonderful that our innovations and international growth are recognized in such a way,\" says Antti Nivala, Founder and CTO at M-Files Corporation.\n\"Quickly locating the correct versions of documents and automating manual business processes are issues that degrade productivity and quality in many organizations. The M-Files vision is to change the way the world manages data and information, and we're delivering on this vision today,\" says Miika M채kitalo, Chief Executive Officer at M-Files Corporation.\nM-Files revenue increased more than 75 percent in 2014, culminating in a robust six-year growth rate of nearly 1,100 percent.
