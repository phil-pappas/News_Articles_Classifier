Should Micron and SanDisk reach an agreement, Micron would face \"huge operational risk\" integrating the company and would likely take on more debt than the coverage ratio outlined by Micron, according to Iyer, Barron's reports. \nSanDisk is in talks to sell itself to Western Digital (WDC) as well. Talks accelerated this weekend, and an agreement between the two companies could happen as early as this week, sources told Bloomberg. \nBased in Boise, ID, Micron Technology is a global provider of semiconductor devices. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC (MU) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its attractive valuation levels, expanding profit margins and notable return on equity. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including feeble growth in the company's earnings per share, deteriorating net income and weak operating cash flow. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The gross profit margin for MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC is rather high; currently it is at 50.50%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 13.08% trails the industry average. MU, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 14.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues fell by 14.8%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC has experienced a steep decline in earnings per share in the most recent quarter in comparison to its performance from the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share have declined over the last year. We anticipate that this should continue in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC reported lower earnings of $2.46 versus $2.55 in the prior year. For the next year, the market is expecting a contraction of 43.7% in earnings ($1.39 versus $2.46). The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 59.0% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $1,150.00 million to $471.00 million.
