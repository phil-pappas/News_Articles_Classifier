Powered by IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) architecture, VoLTE brings a host of benefits to mobile operators ranging from the ability to refarm legacy 2G and 3G spectrum to offering their subscribers a differentiated service experience through capabilities such as HD voice and video telephony.First deployed by South Korean operators in 2012, VoLTE is beginning to gain momentum globally. As of Q3'2015, more than 20 operators have commercially launched VoLTE services and several roaming and interoperability agreements are already in place.SNS Research estimates that VoLTE service revenue will grow at a CAGR of 36% between 2015 and 2020. By the end of 2020, VoLTE subscribers will account for nearly $120 Billion in revenue. Although traditional voice services will constitute a major proportion of this figure, over 12% of the revenue will be driven by video calling and supplementary services.The \"VoLTE (Voice over LTE) Ecosystem: 2015 2030 Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts\" report presents an in-depth assessment of the VoLTE ecosystem including enabling technologies, key market drivers, challenges, collaborative initiatives, regulatory landscape, standardization, opportunities, operator case studies, future roadmap, value chain, ecosystem player profiles and strategies. The report also presents forecasts for VoLTE smartphone shipments, subscriptions, service revenue and infrastructure investments from 2015 till 2030. The forecasts cover 7 individual submarkets and 6 regions.The report comes with an associated Excel datasheet suite covering quantitative data from all numeric forecasts presented in the report.
