These weight sensors are used by drivers to help the train take corners properly.\nCrowded platform at London Bridge train station, London, England, UK\nWhen the weight of the carriage is matched to historical data that includes CCTV footage and ticket barriers at different stations, it's possible to discern how the people are spaced. And to predict future behaviour.\nOnce completed, Open Capacity could be used to display information on station platforms around the country advising people on the best place to stand.\nIt could also be used as an app on a smartphone to let people make their commute more efficient.\nThe Open Capacity software could revolutionise crowded British commutes\n\"By distributing people along the platform it can reduce boarding and alighting time, to make the trains more punctual,\" Gerrit Boehm, a PhD graduate from University College London who came up with the idea, told the Times.\nOpen Capacity is currently working with train operators and hopes to have a working version of the software to demo by the end of the month.\nPoll loading â€¦\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.boehmdesigninnovations.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:18:59.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
