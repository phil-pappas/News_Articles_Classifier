It creates video ad inventory through a simple YuMe JavaScript tag, and is available programmatically or on a direct basis. \n\"YuMe has driven some of the most innovative advertising solutions in video,\" said Jayant Kadambi, co-founder and CEO at YuMe . \"Given the increased demand from both publishers and advertisers for brand safe ads that are 100% viewable, delivered at a point of heightened attention, that can be delivered across platforms at scale, we are confident that out-stream will be the next chapter of that innovation. We have always believed in evolving our offerings to build global audiences at scale.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:12:58.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
