PAUL, Minn., Oct. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Booty Chaser Linked Bingo, the new and exciting release from Electronic Game Solutions (EGS), is now being played in bars and fraternal clubs across the state of Minnesota. As new locations are brought online each week, the game continues to attract more and more players as the progressive must-go jackpot grows by the hour. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20141113/158610LOGO \nFor $3, a player gets nine cards and seven opportunities to win cash. A player can win in as few as 49 numbers on a coverall. So far in 2015, five progressive jackpots have been won around the state: -- May 22 - Steve S. waved in $7,298 at the Shorewood Pub in Detroit Lakes -- June 26 - Kim K. pirated $4,398 at the Dry Dock in Duluth -- July 28 - Ross O. raced home with $2,316 at the Pit Stop in Proctor -- September 6 - Jessica & Dain B. scored $4,272 at Rack's Sports Bar in Burnsville -- October 24 - Tim B. carried away $8,492 at Kalli's Place in Wright \nIn between games, a player can play pull-tabs right from the same handset. Oasis, a Division of International Gamco, provides traditional electronic pull-tabs games with Golden Touch, while EGS provides a traditional-style linked bingo game with Booty Chaser. \nMore installations are planned through 2016 and will expand the Booty Chaser network to reach more players and give away more jackpots in every corner of Minnesota. \nEGS has been in the bingo electronics industry for more than 15 years, and currently has over 16,000 globally-distributed handsets domestically and internationally including Disney and other commercial cruise lines. EGS's Xtreme handset is not an \"off the shelf\" electronic device, but rather is a commercial grade device manufactured in the U.S.A. by American citizens. EGS's core business is with veteran, fraternal and charitable organizations and it was imperative to EGS's owners to make sure revenue generated by these American charities helped generate more American jobs. \nFor more information please contact EGS at 866-828-2600 or our website at www.egsol.com .
