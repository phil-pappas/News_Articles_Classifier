When asked early whether fliers should continue with those precautions, an airline spokesman said customers should expect a normal day Monday. \nSouthwest used backup systems around the country on Sunday to check-in travelers lacking printed or mobile boarding passes. \nAirline representatives have not said what was causing the problem, but a spokesman has said there was no indication that hackers were behind it. \nThere were about 450 delays out of 3,600 flights scheduled Sunday. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
