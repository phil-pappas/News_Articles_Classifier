Water water everywhere: These blue patches show places where water ice has formed\nNASA scientists were taken aback by the new photographs.\n“Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt?\" asked Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute.\n\"It’s gorgeous.\"\nVideo loading\nThe colour of the \"haze\" reveals important clues about the chemical make up of Pluto's surface, as well as its atmosphere.\n\"That striking blue tint tells us about the size and composition of the haze particles,” said science team researcher Carly Howett.\nRex New Horizons snapped this image of Pluto from 476,000 miles away\n\"A blue sky often results from scattering of sunlight by very small particles. On Earth, those particles are very tiny nitrogen molecules.\n\"On Pluto they appear to be larger — but still relatively small — soot-like particles we call tholins.”\nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute/PA Wire Artist's impression of the New Horizons spacecraft\nThese tholins undergo complex chemical reactions high above the surface of Pluto, falling back down to the ground where they \"add to Pluto’s red coloring\".\nAlthough the skies are the most beautiful discovery announced today, the ice could prove to be more important, as it could point to the presence of larger bodies of water.\nNASA/JHUAPL/SWRI Stunning: The Rich Color Variations of Pluto\nExperts are now examining the pictures in a bid to discover exactly where the water has come from.\n“Large expanses of Pluto don’t show exposed water ice,” said science team member Jason Cook.\nThis image shows the geology of Pluto and has been dubbed 'snakeskin' by NASA because of the shape of the rocks\n\"Understanding why water appears exactly where it does, and not in other places, is a challenge that we are digging into.”\nStargazers were hoping NASA would announce the presence of alien life today, after Alan Stern, a planetary scientist for the agency, said NASA would reveal an \"amazing\" discovery this afternoon.\nVideo loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next\nStern described Pluto as \"alive\" and said: \"It has weather, it has hazes in the atmosphere [and] active geology.”\nReuters A near-sunset view of the rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains on Pluto\nHowever, we may not find out whether the planet contains real life for quite some time, due to the difficulty of getting to Pluto, Professor Brian Cox said last month.\n\"The New Horizons probe showed you there there may well be a subsurface ocean on Pluto , which means - if our understanding of life on Earth is even slightly correct - that you could have living things there,\" he said.\nWe know the surface of Pluto is very young, which could indicate high levels of geological activity, whilst its also boasts a series of strange nitrogen glaciers.\nNASA has also suggested an underground ocean could be driving all the activity on its surface .\nVideo loading\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "http://www.nasa.gov/nh/nh-finds-blue-skies-and-water-ice-on-pluto", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://news.mit.edu/2015/new-horizons-data-hint-at-underground-ocean-0729", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33657447", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/cracks-in-plutos-moon-could-indicate-it-once-had-an-underground-ocean", "https://twitter.com/jasperhamill", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201509/2435/4221396001_4493663099001_4492548963001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201507/2371/4221396001_4356819695001_close.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:51:12.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
