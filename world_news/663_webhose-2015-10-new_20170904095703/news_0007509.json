Should she stumble during the hearing, the Benghazi episode could continue to cast a shadow on her presidential bid, undercutting her argument that she has the judgment and credentials to be commander in chief.\nIn her statement, Mrs Clinton will make no apologies for sending diplomats to hazardous posts. She will say that Mr. Stevens recognized that diplomats must not hole up in fortified outposts and refuse to engage in global hot spots.\nMrs Clinton's opening remarks suggest a muscular approach to world affairs.\nPresident Barack Obama has faced criticism for \"leading from behind,\" or avoiding entanglements in the Middle East and hesitating to commit military force. Mrs Clinton will use her testimony to sketch a role for the US that is more forward-leaning in its outlook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:57:20.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
