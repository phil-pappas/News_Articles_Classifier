Pictured, CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes Source: News Corp Australia\nNow that information is everywhere, you can’t hoard it. It’s accessible at a low price. Also, the volume and speed of information makes it very difficult for any individual manager or small group of managers to get their heads around it.\nProfessor Ian Williamson, who teaches human resources at Melbourne Business School, says the ubiquity and variety of information requires a completely different type of manager.\n“It puts a very different perspective on the leaders of the organisation and the structures they have to have in place to be more effective. In general it’s about more decentralised opportunities. The power shifts somewhat to the dependency on the employee rather than the other way around.\n“It’s a shift away from ‘my job is to sit down and figure out what we’re supposed to do’ to ‘my job is create an environment where you figure out what we’re supposed to do’.\n“We hear a lot about people empowering their workforce. I think that’s a critical component in a dynamic environment.”\nFirms are turning to tech companies for inspiration, where ‘hackathons’ gather employees to formulate solutions to various issues and problems. Google, Microsoft and Facebook are renowned for their hackathon sessions; Facebook’s chat service and ‘like’ button reportedly came out of the company’s hackathon.\nHackathons are creative problem-solving sessions, a sort of competition where developers, designers and product managers get together to create, for example, a new piece of software, product or service within a limited timeframe.\nIt’s not limited to tech companies, either. You mightn’t have the IT specialists and engineers. but you will have a group of talented people with ideas. The concept can be undertaken at any sort of company, from retailers to accounting firms.\nUnfortunately, there are no off-the-shelf tools for making it work. But there are some tried and tested techniques to turn the company into an ideas factory.\n1. Get the entire company involved: This is important because it ensures everyone is coming up with idea and plans. It is a way of ensuring that innovation spreads right through the organisation and leaves everyone empowered. That builds engagement.\n2. Do your homework: To create good process, people should formulate some ideas beforehand about what they want to achieve. That helps create realistic expectations. People needed to be told in advance about what the hackathon is trying to achieve so that they can focus their efforts.\n3. Set goals: Again, this ensures the hackathon stays on track.\n4. Power and connectivity: This is absolutely essential. Your Wi-Fi needs to be premium so that everyone can hook in and produce ideas.\n5. Keep it organised: Every group should have a leader to co-ordinate and make sure everyone is working on a particular area.\n6. Turn it into a journey: At the end of each day, the groups have to assess where they have gone to, what they’ve achieved and what has to be done. If everyone is aware of the progress, they will stay more committed.\n7. Keep a hacking journal: With everyone on the team contributing to the journal, it becomes a joint document to trace the lessons learned and what needs to be done. It focuses everyone on solving the problems.\nThis content was produced in association with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
