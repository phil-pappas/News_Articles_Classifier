Twenty-something white guy complaining about Black Economic Empowerment, how original, right? Well, fact is I’m not here to complain about BEE, nor am I going to point fingers at those who have attained more wealth than they deserve while other, black South Africans remain trapped in desolate poverty.\nNo, I want to ask a question, an earnest enquiry to the status quo (referring to political leaders, not the 70’s band), it might be slightly philosophical, but I truly believe if this question can be answered without the application of any of the rhetorical ploys politicians like to utilise, all debates around BEE can be put to bed.\nI would like to introduce my question by posing an initial one. If the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was successful, which they claim to have been, would there necessarily be a need for BEE? This as the TRC necessarily negates the need for BEE, or still, BEE contradicts the TRC. The gist of the problem of question raised above, lies at the heart of the one this article ais to have answered, being, when does BEE start to contradict itself?\nI was born in 1991, so I was born as white male in apartheid South Africa. Not that I can recollect committing any hate crime (or related atrocity) based on race as an infant, as apartheid officially fell soon after my birth. I would hold any the government in any negative esteem if a black person similar in age to myself, is given preferential treatment (i.e. academic, career or otherwise).\nHowever, if I were in the shoes of the person being empowered I would however rather not take advantage of BEE, knowing that things earned are often more valued than things simply given (especially according to something as trivial as race).\nMoving on to the question I want answered. During the past week I met white children born in the mid 2000’s, a full decade after the fall of apartheid. This means their parents were born at a time when apartheid started to unravel at the seams.\nTheir children are halfway (or more than) to completing their schooling (i.e. matric). Thereafter they would most probably hope to attain a tertiary education with the aim of providing themselves with better/more career options. Problem is they will still be subjected to the quota system which forms part of the BEE initiative.\nHow would stopping them from gaining entrance to university resolve any past inequalities caused by racial segregation, when neither their parents nor they themselves were responsible for said segregation?\nWould this not mean that by that point Black Economic Empowerment, would become White Economic Disenfranchisement? How do you like that term? Not very nice, I know but that is what it would affectively be. Disenfranchisement based purely on the color of one’s skin. What political system does that remind you of… How long can BEE be ethically upheld before it becomes exactly that which it saw to cure?\nWill you, the leaders allow BEE to be applicable until its starts to negate itself? Until it starts contradicting itself, if it hasn’t already started to? Will you allow it to continue until we have generation(-s) of white individuals, who had no part to play in apartheid, but are withheld of reaching their potential based purely on the fact that they are white, just as black individuals were during apartheid?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:11:49.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
