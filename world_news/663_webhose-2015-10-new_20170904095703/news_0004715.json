On the heels of the recently announced acquisition by Konica Minolta, Viztek will be showcasing an expanded portfolio that now includes ultrasound and added DR offerings in addition to PACS, RIS and Exa Mammo . \nExa Software Suite– Innovation for Healthcare IT \nLeading the RSNA line-up for Viztek is the Exa portfolio, completely Web-based PACS/RIS, available on any browser with Diagnostic Zero Footprint viewing and the speed of Server Side Rendering. \nExa PACS: Completely Web-based and compatible with all devices and operating systems, the Exa PACS delivers significant efficiency and productivity benefits to hospitals, imaging centers and teleradiology groups via unprecedented PACS accessibility and utility for end-users. \nExa RIS: Viztek's Exa RIS solution is also a completely Web-based software application, designed to streamline workflow while enhancing patient and referring physician accessibility with an integrated PACS database. \nExa Mammo : Debuted earlier this year, the system is the first to provide the benefits of a quality single workstation viewing and anywhere remote access for any breast imaging study including digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Radiologists benefit from the ability to read and compare breast images from any location within the department or offsite, regardless of the PACS they are using. The system is built on the Viztek Exa platform which offers two unique advantages - true Zero Footprint (ZFP) viewing and Server Side Rendering (SSR). \n\"We are ready for RSNA to show the market the great differentiators of the Viztek software suite, and now this year we have an even bigger audience thanks to our acquisition by Konica Minolta,\" said Steve Deaton , vice president, Viztek. \"Since the debut of the Exa platform last year we have established a footprint in hospital, imaging center and radiology practices, and look to grow that significantly in the coming year.\" \nExpanded DRAlso showcased at RSNA 2015 will be Viztek's complete DR portfolio including: \nViZion + Wireless DR PanelIntroduced earlier this year, Viztek's popular ViZion + Wireless DR panel produced record sales with over 300 systems sold in three months. The versatile system can be used in new imaging environments as well as retrofitted to existing rooms, allowing for an immediate improvement to workflow and productivity. Unlike most wireless panels, the Viztek ViZion + Wireless DR panel is equipped with a built-in router to enable wireless connectivity, eliminating the need for outside routers to allow Wi-Fi accessibility. \nViztek Overhead Tube Crane (OTC)The OTC combines the benefits of Viztek's existing chest and table systems into one unit for those facilities that are seeking a complete room replacement. Also beneficial to the technologists, the system's features provide significant versatility and ease-of-use to enable faster processes. Key features include a remote controlled table, upright and Overhead Tube Crane that also be adjusted manually to ensure the best possible automatic positioning. It also comes with the advanced Ultra DR acquisition software for improved efficiency. \nViztek U-ArmIntroduced last year and designed with the technologist in mind, the Viztek Ultra U-Arm enables exams to be completed quickly and with the most accuracy. Advanced features enable the overall exam time to be shortened, while simultaneously helping assure that the time with the patient is more focused and productive. \nViztek Basic U-ArmA sister to the Viztek U-Arm, the Viztek's Basic U-Arm is ideal for urgent care and orthopedic settings, among others, and providing the ability to do a broader range of exams than a standard straight arm including a true cross table lateral, standing hip and table hip exams with the system, and offered at an affordable entry point. \nIn addition to the solutions listed above, Viztek will also be offering ultrasound from Konica Minolta and a full line of DR and state-of-the-art Primary Imaging Solutions.
