They used NASA's exoplanet-hunting Kepler spacecraft to make the discovery, then followed up with ground observations.\n\"This is something no human has seen before,\" said Andrew Vanderburg of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts , the lead author.\n\"We're watching a solar system get destroyed,\" he said in a statement.\nThe data show the object in an orbit 520,000 miles (837,000 kilometers) from the white dwarf. That's the approximate distance from the Earth to the moon, and back. Vanderburg and his team also found several additional chunks of orbiting material.\nScientists believe the original object may have been a planet whose orbit became unstable, and was kicked inward. The pieces already are being vaporized by the white dwarf, located about 570 light-years from Earth, and will eventually be ripped apart.\nThe fictional Death Star of \"Star Wars\" fame was the Empire's monstrously big space arsenal capable of destroying an entire planet.\nThe findings are being published this week in the journal Nature.\n———\nOnline:\nNature: http://www.nature.com/\nKepler: http://kepler.nasa.gov/\n  Faraway Object Being Destroyed by Real-Life 'Death Star'  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:51:48.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
