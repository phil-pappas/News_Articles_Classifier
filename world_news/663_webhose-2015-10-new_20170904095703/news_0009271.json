Planet DDS, which was founded in 2004, is the company behind Denticon, the leading cloud-based dental practice management software in the United States. Planet DDS also offers outsourced business services to dental practices across the country.\nRichard Lee, the company's founder, attributed its growth to the \"accelerating shift to the cloud for practice management software in the dental vertical.\" He added: \"It's a generational shift in technology, the kind of change that only takes place every 20 years or so.\"\nPlanet DDS was very early to market more than ten years ago with Denticon, the first dental practice management software offering built from the ground up for the cloud. According to Chae Kim, VP of Technology, the company's first-mover status made for some lean years in its early history: \"Compared to other healthcare verticals, dental lagged somewhat in adopting cloud technology, but that has changed dramatically in the past few years.\"\nKim explained that dental practices have recognized \"the power of cloud-based practice management software for enhanced privacy and data security compliance, for anywhere-anytime access to information, and for the cost savings that come with the elimination of expensive in-house information technology infrastructure.\" Ultimately, legacy client-server software \"just doesn't cut it any more in today's competitive dental market.\"\nThe company received an infusion of growth capital in 2015 to take advantage of this generational market shift. According to Kim, \"we're building on the longest industry track record for practice management software in the cloud, making constant improvements to our Denticon software. The response has been terrific, from new customers and long-standing users alike. It's a very exciting time at the company.\"\nAbout Planet DDS\nPlanet DDS is the established leader in cloud-based dental software. The company's Denticon practice management software is a powerful, flexible tool trusted by thousands of dental professionals across the country.
