Bed Bath & Beyond\nIf you're a Star Wars fan and you want to prove your dedication in every room of the house, it's difficult to find just the right decor for your bathroom.\nAfter all, a Sarlacc Pit toilet doesn't suit everyone's design aesthetic.\nBut with these specialty Star Wars shower heads by Oxygenics (available from Bed Bath & Beyond), you can give your bathroom a much-needed dose of geek chic.\nIt is useless to resist the power of the wet side with the Darth Vader handheld shower head . But be warned: the three spray settings may seem slightly disturbing at first -- especially since it looks like Vader is crying explosive tears or spitting demands at you about his precious Death Star.\nWho knows, maybe staring into Vader's soulless eye sockets will wake you right up in the morning.\nEnlarge Image R2-D2 sprung a leak to keep you clean. Bed Bath & Beyond\nThe shower head has a rubber grip designed to reduce slipping, and it also comes with a comfort control lever, which you can use to adjust water pressure.\nIt's black (of course), has anti-clog nozzles and is 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter. It's attached to a hose that measures 6 feet (182 cm) in length. It costs $30, £21 or AU$43, with shipping more expensive outside the US.\nIf you'd rather represent the light and frothy side of the Force, you can choose an R2-D2 shower head . This droid also has three powerful spray settings and anti-clog nozzles. But, unlike the handheld Vader, it has a fixed-mount design.\nThe R2-D2 shower head is 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter and you can take it home for $25, £17 or AU$36, and shipping will be more expensive outside the US.\nNo matter which showerhead you choose, just remember: Wash or wash not, there is no dry.", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/90a3bf33-53da-456b-b2c3-21d85c2093a6/crop/1802x1102+0+232/resize/270xauto/c5506e65ea9bb47174f491fc27180aba/r2d22.jpg", "http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/oxygenics-reg-star-wars-trade-darth-vader-handheld-showerhead/1044433789?Keyword=oxygenics+star+wars+showerhead", "http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/oxygenics-reg-star-wars-trade-r2-d2-3-spray-showerhead/1044433369?Keyword=oxygenics+star+wars+showerhead", "http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/6054a50b-c846-4610-9464-fcd4a43bcb5b/resize/570xauto/3cd3e0ed1723d5bda5280475b2057fd0/vader2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:03:53.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
