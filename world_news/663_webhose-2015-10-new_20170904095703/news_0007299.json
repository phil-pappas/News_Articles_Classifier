Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer of SolarWinds. \n\"Becoming a private company will provide SolarWinds with optimal operating flexibility to execute on its long-term strategy of providing superior products for IT and Dev Ops Pros all over the world.\" \nSolarWinds provides powerful and affordable hybrid IT infrastructure management software to customers worldwide from Fortune 500 enterprises to small businesses, government agencies and educational institutions. \n\"SolarWinds is an exceptional franchise, empowering IT professionals to solve a broad range of challenges every day,\" said Ken Hao andMike Bingle, Managing Partners at Silver Lake. \"We have been impressed by the SolarWinds team and their strong track record of growth. We see significant potential to extend and grow the SolarWinds franchise as a private company.\" \n\"We look forward to building upon SolarWinds' existing market leadership in network performance monitoring while also accelerating its current growth initiatives in Cloud, Hybrid and MSP environments,\" said Seth Bravo, a managing partner at Thoma Bravo. \nThe transaction, which is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2016, is subject to approval by SolarWinds stockholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. \nSolarWinds shares jumped as much as 17 percent to $58.30 after the announcement. \n\"This is a 'Murphy-like home run scenario' for SolarWinds' investors that have stuck with this company through its rollercoaster ride, especially over the past year as SolarWinds has run into some execution speed bumps,\" wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in a note, reported Reuters. \n\"We see no other strategic buyers for SolarWinds as a financial buyer clearly represented the most logical path.\" \nThe acquisition of SolarWinds is in keeping with the trend of private-equity investors buying into tech companies. Dell Inc. is buying EMC Corp. for about $67 billion, while Vista Equity Partners recently announced plans to acquire Solera Holdings Inc. for $6.5 billion.
