Besides airlines, it is also being pitched at maritime companies and military and public sector organisations. \nLufthansa hopes to have the first of its airlines kitted out and tested in summer 2016, and will be trialling the European Aviation Network (EAN), a combination of Inmarsat satellites and an LTE-based ground network being provided by national telco Deutsche Telekom, in 2017. It is believed the EAN will offer cost efficiencies and more adaptability to suit changing demands in years to come. \nThe airline said it would be able to offer its European passengers the ability to browse the internet, watch videos, download files and even connect to corporate virtual private networks with a “reliable connection that matches the quality and speed that they expect when they’re on the ground”. \n“We are very pleased to conclude this strategic agreement with Lufthansa Group, which ensures that Lufthansa will be offering their continental fleet passengers the best in-flight connectivity in the airline industry today,” said Inmarsat Aviation president Leo Mondale. \n“As part of this agreement we will be working with Lufthansa Technik and Lufthansa Systems for the integration of our services on-board the aircraft, making the most of their state-of-the-art products, technology and know-how.” CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.
