Ian Millen, COO of international monitoring organisation Dryad Maritime, said: “A lot of opportunities to trade in Yemen have been denied to the commercial shipping industry because the war is ongoing. In terms of running proper maritime trade through the area that will cause problems.”\nCommercial saw the risks associated with increased military activity in early 2015 as fighting in the country escalated.\nAnd for those still willing to sail to Yemen face having their vessels boarded and inspected by the coalition.\nPeter Sand, Chief Shipping Analyst at BIMCO, said: “It seems as if the ships sailing through the Gulf of Aden, in the guarded corridor [have] not been affected by the fighting at all. It has been contained on shore — not disrupting the international shipping transits in the area.”\nTim Hart, Maritime Manager at Control Risks, said: “When we started to see the escalation in military activity within the country, there were concerns about a blockade or restriction of shipping through the Bab Al Mandab but that’s not what happened. Trade [has] very much continued to flow through this area.”\nCommercial shipping was previously at risk in the Mediterranean, after an anti-terrorist think tank seized a letter from the Islamic State stating its intent to cause chaos for commercial shipping in the Mediterranean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:57:01.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
