(http://on.wsj.com/1VNY8Eu) \nOther investors that participated in the latest funding round include French investment banks Natixis SA, Societe Generale and a group of existing investors including Silicon Valley venture firm Merus Capital. \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc led a group of 14 banks including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co in making a $66 million investment in Symphony last October, when Symphony was set up. \nSymphony said on Monday it would use the new capital to address demand and to speed up expansion of its global operations. \nThe Symphony service is a rival to financial market messaging services offered by Bloomberg LP and Thomson Reuters Corp. It is available to businesses with more than 50 users for $15 per user per month. Smaller businesses and individuals can use the tool for free. \nSymphony said last month it was working with News Corp's Dow Jones to offer news in its service and with McGraw Hill Financial Inc to integrate data and analytics from its S&P Capital IQ product. \nGoogle became Alphabet Inc earlier this month. \n(Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:29:08.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
