The bottom line is more needs to be done.\"\nTo date, both the U.S. and Ohio EPAs have declined to use all of their available tools to curb harmful algal blooms in the lake, the groups said.\nThe letter was sent today to U.S. EPA Water Division Director Tinka Hyde. It cited the EPA's failure to take remedial action despite the re-occurrence of harmful algal blooms that have poisoned drinking water, closed beaches and damaged fishing and other recreational activities.\n\"EPA has failed in its duty to protect Lake Erie and the people and wildlife which depend upon it,\" the conservation groups wrote. \"Waiting yet even longer for the designation of declaring the western basin of Lake Erie 'Impaired'... is unacceptable.\"\nThe letter was signed by officials of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, the Lake Erie Charter Boat Association, the Lake Erie Waterkeeper, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Ohio Environmental Council.\nIf the EPA agrees to the request, the lake's western basin would become eligible for restoration and protection under the Clean Water Act, and the Ohio EPA would join with the federal agency to implement a remediation plan tailored specifically for the lake, according to the program's guidelines.\nThis summer's toxic algal bloom has been one of the largest on record, falling just short of the 2011 bloom in coverage and bacterial concentration, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nAlgal blooms are the product of heavy agricultural runoff of fertilizers and manure, primarily into the Maumee River, and concentrated in the western basin of Lake Erie. In 2014, bacteria from the bloom polluted the drinking water in Toledo, and shut down its water-treatment system for three days.\nAbout 65,000 eligible waterways have been assessed and received water quality restoration and protection in the past 20 years, according to the EPA.\nUnder terms of the program, water bodies that have been designated as \"impaired\" receive priority rankings based on a measurement called a Total Maximum Daily Load. This consists of a calculation of the maximum amount of pollution a water body can receive and still safely meet water quality standards. The program has been in place for about two years.\nOhio has 267 impaired waters, according to the EPA web site. Included among the impaired waters are 289 shoreline miles of Lake Erie along the central and western basins on the Maumee and Sandusky bays, and the Lake Erie islands. Also impaired are many of the lake's tributaries, including the Cuyahoga, Maumee, Vermilion, Black, and Ashtabula rivers.\nSandy Bihn of the Lake Erie Waterkeeper said an \"impaired\" designation would help to identify the sources of nutrient pollution, devise a management plan to measure and reduce the pollution, develop an informational and educational plan, and monitor the success of the plan.\nJoel Brammeier, president and CEO of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, said he has \"no doubt Lake Erie merits this designation as impaired.\n\"Lake Erie's water is toxic at its source,\" Brammerier said. \"By calling Lake Erie what it is – impaired – will get us on a path to safe drinking water, abundant recreation and water that supports rather than sabotages local businesses.\"\nAdam Rissien of the Ohio Environmental Council, said, \"Proposed current reduction targets are not legally enforceable. We need firm limits on the amount of pollution allowed to enter the lake and an enforceable road map in order to adequately restore its water quality.\"\nToday's action came on the same day the Ohio EPA proposed rules that would require public water systems to report harmful algae blooms to the state, and to increase testing if algae toxins are found in water.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:15:10.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
