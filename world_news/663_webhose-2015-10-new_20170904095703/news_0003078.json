The site will also remind users who get this warning to enable the \"Login Approvals\" feature, which activates a more secure, two-tiered authentication process. So how can Facebook actually tell if more-nefarious forces are behind an account hack? In the true vein of a bona fide espionage operation, the site notes it can't say, strictly \"to protect the integrity of our methods and processes.\" (Hopefully they'll be keeping an especially close eye on Mark Zuckerberg's page .)
