For this new line of research, the Sen Gupta and Mitragotri team will engineer artificial platelets loaded with anti-clotting medications. The particles will be designed to home in on clots and deliver the drugs to dissolve the clot. Li will test this clot-busting technology in animal models of arterial thrombosis. \nThis new research will run in parallel to their ongoing research in which Sen Gupta developed and patented a synthetic platelet technology called SynthoPlate, supported by a $1.9 million grant from the NIH awarded in 2014. The synthetic platelets mimic the form and surface biology of natural platelets. They've been shown to stop bleeding 70 percent faster in small animal models--a step toward stabilizing patients who could otherwise die from severe bleeding. \nTo advance the original work, Sen Gupta is currently working with Keith McCrae, MD, at Cleveland Clinic; and Vikram Kashyap, MD, at University Hospitals; to optimize and test the SynthoPlate's ability to treat bleeding in large animal models. This research is supported by two additional grants from the NIH Center for Accelerated Innovations based at Cleveland Clinic and the Case-Coulter Translational Research Partnership based in the biomedical engineering department at Case Western Reserve. \nSen Gupta's laboratory focuses on platelets as a drug delivery device paradigm because platelets are key players in various cellular and molecular interactions found in multiple pathologies. To that end, the laboratory is also exploring the role of platelets in immune response and cancer metastasis. ### \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:26:52.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
