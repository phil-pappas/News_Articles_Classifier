Around 80% of Tanzanians - and more than nine in 10 under-fives - do not have birth certificates, according to the 2012 census.\nChild's rights campaigners say ensuring every child's birth is registered is key to safeguarding basic rights and access to healthcare, education and justice. Birth registration also helps protect children from exploitation including child labour, child marriage, trafficking and early recruitment into armed forces.\nLast month world leaders agreed to ensure universal birth registration under ambitious new global development goals (SDGs).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:09:27.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
