Based on current market research data by Pew Research, 64% of Americans own a smartphone. Keeping them charged and connected to their accessories (speakers, hands free devices, other cell phone accessories) was a $51 Billion market in the US alone in 2014. This industry trend led to the creation of this private label smartphone accessories business. 100% of Sales are generated through Amazon USA and Amazon UK and products are shipped directly from the factory to Amazon FBA so there is no local inventory to handle or store. Current inventory value stocked at Amazon FBA is about $150k. Operations can be successfully handled by one owner working about 20 hours per week handling customer service, factory ordering, Amazon management and finances. The majority of sales are derived through organic searches supported by their strong product page and keyword ranking. With 4.4 Stars Feedback Rating based on over 1,600 reviews for its best seller, its products are popular and accordingly the business has generated double digit year over year growth. Currently, total Sales for Jan-Aug 2015 are up about 45% with Profits up around 63% over the totals for the same period in 2014! Nov and Dec 2014 generated over $120k in profits and this year are expected to generate over $650k in sales and about $184k in profits for the same two months. Using actual figures for Jan-Aug and a forecast of Sales for the upcoming months of Sept-Dec, the company estimates over $1.5M in Sales and over $318k in Profits for the year. After over 10 years selling on Amazon, the owner has a wealth of experience and knowledge that he is willing to share with the new owner. This will greatly benefit the new owner in the marketing of the existing product line as well as any other products they may choose to sell on Amazon.
