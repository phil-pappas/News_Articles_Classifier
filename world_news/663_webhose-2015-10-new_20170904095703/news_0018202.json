Derry Township announced it would be part of a six-year comprehensive plan in 2013. Cumberland Valley approved a blended learning program budget earlier this year. Cumberland Valley, Northern York County and East Pennsboro school districts all won grants to create a blended learning plan last fall. East Pennsboro won an additional grant to help put its plan in place, starting with trial classrooms at the middle school level. \nAs part of blended learning, many schools have been allowing students to bring their own laptops and tablets into the schools for years. \nOne-to-one programs are a natural extension of that, and many schools have been approving programs in recent years. Carlisle Area School District started a 1:1 initiative in 2013 for high school students. Lower Dauphin High School is expected to launch its program this month. South Middleton's 1:1 initiative launched at Boiling Springs High School and East Pennsboro's launched at the middle and high school levels at the start of the school year. 'Blended Learning' Integrates Technology Into Cumberland County Classrooms Here's how two Cumberland County school districts are using technology in the classroom. \nJoe Mancuso, assistant superintendent of the South Middleton School District, said that one of the big parts of the new initiative is that the district is not purchasing textbooks for every student at the high school, though textbooks are available. \n\"A textbook is just a resource, as is the laptop,\" Mancuso said. \nIt's part of an overall goal to get both students and teachers to think \"outside-the-box\" when it comes to learning, said Sharonn Williams, director of technology for South Middleton School District. \n\"Sometimes kids are doing their own video for a project,\" Williams said. \"In our world languages classes, they did a tour of their home narrating the video. It's personalized learning.\" \nNot every classroom allows laptop use every day, and signs on boards indicate whether it's allowed. \nIn some classrooms, the laptops are changing how much kids can learn. \nIn Jason Jarrett's photography and graphics design classes, students are able to do more than they used to because they now have the ability to take design software home with them. \nInstead of spending five days in class on a project, Jarrett said, the project might take two or three because students are able to work outside of his classroom lab. \n\"I could assign homework now, which I don't typically, but now I might,\" he said. \nIn David Mancuso's business and technology classes at Boiling Springs, things that used to be paper assignments are now shared with kids through Google Drive. On a recent Tuesday, kids were given electronic instructions on how to create a website, and using their laptops and desktop computers to make the website. \n\"Once everybody has a laptop, it's a game changer,\" David Mancuso said. \nAt East Pennsboro Area Middle School, English teacher Tammy Herbein said students seem to be more engaged since the laptops debuted about a month ago. \nStudents are reaching out more about test and other assignment grades, and Herbein can respond to students immediately. \n\"It's really cool that they feel free to talk to teachers,\" she said. \"They love it, and I've had no discipline yet, but they're so engaged.\" \nThere's also more collaboration, with students commenting and editing each other's work using Google applications. Herbein said that not every day is a laptop day, and on a recent Tuesday class, students were using paper to diagram sentences, though they could get the laptops out once they completed the in-class assignment. \n\"I still want them to be able to write,\" Herbein said. \"I still want them to focus on writing, reading and talking to one another.\" \nAt lower levels in South Middleton schools, other technology is being integrated. \nW.G. Rice Elementary School teachers use a combination of laptops, desktops and tablets to help younger students learn. \nDebra Harris' second-grade class uses iPads to animate their own version of \"The Three Little Pigs.\" Students in groups of three first write a play, then grab one iPad per group and use the Puppet Pals app to animate it. Other classrooms have students do math problems using computer programs — which can tell them right away whether they got the answer right or wrong, and why — or are using the iPads to read books. \nAt East Pennsboro Area Middle School, one seventh-grade classroom is a pilot program for a blended learning initiative that has students learning from teachers part of the day and part of the day online classes. \n\"We promote good teaching, and if technology is an appropriate resource, than we want them to use it,\" Principal Michael Sim said. \nClasses are taught in newly designed computer labs, and classrooms with desks that can be pushed together to form tables. The idea is using new and different ways to help students learn and be prepared for the future. \n\"The future they're getting into is different than the one we had out of school,\" Sim said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:50:27.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
