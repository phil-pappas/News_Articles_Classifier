While traditionally only 3% of tech start-ups are founded by women and most employ fewer than 35% women, over 50% of ROKITT employees are women. “These numbers are not by accident,” said Mahajan. “Our culture and hiring practices are designed to ensure a balanced workforce because we know it drives better business results.”\nPart of Sokolovsky’s mission is developing and empowering women entrepreneurs, which led to the creation of WEI (Women Entrepreneurs International). WEI offers products and services for women to launch, run and expand their businesses, such as building a business plan, securing funding, company registration services, legal and accounting activities, launching a website and promoting their products. The mission of WEI similarly to the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) is to bring more diversity to the workplace and across several industries.\nWBENC’s national standard of certification implemented by the Women Presidents' Educational Organization is a meticulous process including an in-depth review of the business and site inspection. The certification process is designed to confirm the business is at least 51% owned, operated and controlled by a woman or women.\nBy including women-owned businesses among their vendors, corporations, and government agencies demonstrate their commitment to fostering diversity and the continued development of their supplier/vendor diversity programs.\nTo learn more about ROKITT, please visit ( http://www.rokittech.com ).\nAbout ROKITT\nAt ROKITT we are passionate about everything we build.
