The council outlined four main recommendations for promoting broadband, but the council’s report was also notable for what it left out – any specific mention of municipally-run broadband services.The omission was particularly stunning considering the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), led by President appointed Thomas Wheeler, voted to overturn municipal broadband laws in North Carolina and Tennessee earlier this year, a move that will allow government-owned networks (GONs) in that state to expand. President Obama also promoted municipal broadband networks in advance of his State of the Union in January.Perhaps the members of the Broadband Opportunity Council, which was established by a Presidential Memorandum signed by President Obama this past March, understand the risks associated with GONs better than the president’s White House advisers, or certain members of the FCC.The most oft-repeated myth about GONs is that they improve outcomes for consumers.This myth persists despite the fact that studies show these systems don’t offer better prices. Indeed, in 2014 Phoenix Center Chief Economist Dr. George S. Ford examined whether municipal wireline broadband service providers offered better triple play prices (the combo package of broadband, video and phone) than privately-owned broadband service providers. Dr. Ford concluded, “The evidence suggests that the government’s provision of broadband services does not lead to lower prices. While municipal entry may serve valid purposes, lower prices do not appear to be one of them.”While technology is changing so fast, government works at glacier speeds, and their operations are typically bureaucratic, inefficient and costly. That cost often translates into higher price and lower consumer demand for municipally-provided broadband services. In fact, a quick review of dozens of municipal broadband ventures shows a very long list of bankruptcies and ventures that lead to higher consumer cost and taxpayer burden. But, governments don’t go out of business, they simply push their losses to consumers and taxpayers.The myth also persists despite the fact that some GON supporters have admitted their goal isn’t really to provide another option to consumers, but is instead to push all private options out of the market. For example, in Seattle, despite the fact that an independent study found GONs would cost taxpayers up to $655 million, City Council Member Kshama Sawant said she wants to build a municipal network to demonstrate “to the rest of America that telecom giants could be beat at their own game.”By Sawant’s own admission, her policy would result in fewer choices for consumers, even when it comes to the type of mobile devices they use. In August, she said , “Does it benefit us to have an endless range of phones where, actually, we could have a few models of really well-functioning smartphones, and not have all these massive resources being devoted to having a little bit of an edge here, a little bit of an edge there?”The answer, of course, is yes, choice does benefit consumers; monopolies do not. Monopolies result in higher prices, less output and less innovation. Think about the mobile phones we used 20 years ago (if most readers were using them at all). Those phones were clunky, expensive and could be used to make a pricey phone call and nothing more. Does anyone believe we’d be using our phones to access the Internet, video chat with relatives in other countries or run household appliances if the government was the sole generator of the technology?Sawant’s position is extreme, even among the pro-GONs community, but even if most proponents don’t actually want to push private providers out of the market, that’s often the consequence anyway. Municipal broadband networks have a chilling effect on private broadband investment because they enjoy generous taxpayer subsidies and implicit backing from taxpayers. Some municipalities do not fully account for capital costs, pensions and opportunity costs (they don’t pay taxes to themselves). They also tend to cross-subsidize broadband by imposing consumer fees and higher prices on water, electric and other municipal utility services.How can private broadband providers compete with such advantages? The answer is, they won’t – private investors will avoid investing in markets where the local government has stacked the deck against them. This means less choice, less investment, fewer jobs created and fewer consumers served.Let’s take a simpler analogy: would you open a restaurant if your main competition was a government-run café whose costs and entry barriers were artificially lower than yours? I don’t think so. And consumers wouldn’t benefit from that scenario because they’d have only one option for eating out and taxpayers will ultimately pay the full costs of these failed government ventures. What happens if consumers don’t like what’s on the government menu?For policymakers looking to advance broadband in their city, county or state, the White House’s Broadband Opportunity Council offers some suggestions. Those options include streamlining the permitting process for new broadband projects and expanding federal support for broadband investments. Those options are worthy ones to consider, and ones that will truly result in better competitive options for consumers. The Council’s omission of GONs as one of the options is correct. We should avoid broadband at government speeds.", "external_links": ["http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/broadband-opportunity-council", "http://crosscut.com/2015/08/socialist-councilmember-sawant-calls-for-a-new-tech-revolution/", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/broadband_opportunity_council_report_final.pdf", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/phoenix-center-demonstrates-that-municipal-broadband-systems-do-not-offer-lower-prices-than-private-sector-counterparts-242219171.html", "http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment/view?id=6018325593", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/38265846/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:46:17.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
