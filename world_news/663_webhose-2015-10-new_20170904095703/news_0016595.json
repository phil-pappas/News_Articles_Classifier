With the addition of the FLEXpower Radian, new Nano-Carbon batteries and the launch of its Solar Power Stations (SPS), OutBack Power delivers easy-to-install equipment for electrical contractors, saving up to half a day of labor and providing a leg up in serving the growing renewable energy industry. \n“Electrical contractors are seeing a dramatic rise in interest about solar electricity from their customers, and OutBack is responding with solutions that promise longevity, simplified installation, and time and cost savings to support this surging market interest,” said Mark Cerasuolo, marketing director for OutBack Power. “Our focus on making solar a viable and practical option for contractors and their customers led to several new products designed to simplify specification and save valuable installation time, as well as new battery technology intended to make storage-based solar electric systems more practical than ever.” SmartHarvest Solar Power Stations (SPS) are five complete systems for installers to deploy reliable, long-term lower-voltage DC power anywhere needed in the field, including agriculture, remote and wireless networking, security and video surveillance, LED lighting and intelligent traffic control applications. The systems are pre-configured in outdoor-rated National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) enclosures and include the enclosure, batteries, solar panels and all mounting hardware. FLEXpower Radian systems built around OutBack’s acclaimed Grid/Hybrid inverter/charger make residential and commercial installations easier than ever. The preconfigured system includes programming, charge control, networking and other balance-of-system components essential to a solar electric design. Contractors hang the pre-wired and tested product on the wall and simply connect the solar panels, batteries and backed-up loads panel, saving installation time of up to half a day. Nano-Carbon batteries combine the advantages of reliable, absorbed glass mat/valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery chemistries with cycling and performance characteristics approaching lithium-ion and other advanced energy storage. Most important, they are more fault-tolerant, designed to thrive in partial state-of-charge applications where a full refresh charge of the battery isn’t always possible (such as when there is insufficient sunlight), and offer up to 44 percent greater cycle life versus other traditional batteries. Extending battery life for real-world residential and light commercial conditions is essential to making energy storage a cost-effective, practical mainstream technology. OutBack’s new Nano-Carbons are a significant advance in the field. \nContinued Cerasuolo, “Most important is that these solutions are from a brand leader that contractors can specify with confidence. OutBack leads the industry in UL-1741 listed systems from end-to-end as well as the latest in NEC 2014-compliant rapid shutdown products. As noted by Greentech Media and others in the industry press, OutBack Power is now a leading global inverter brand; with its products on board all-in-one energy storage and management systems from Sonnenbatterie and others, they’re designed for tomorrow’s energy storage needs. We’re determined to apply that advantage today with these and other solar solutions that are as easy for contractors to deploy as they are advanced.” \nOutBack Power’s SmartHarvest Solar Power Stations will be available this fall, while the FLEXpower Radian and Nano-Carbon batteries are both currently shipping.
