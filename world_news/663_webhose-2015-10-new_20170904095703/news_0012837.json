In this SPIE, Stratecast examines the Rackspace-AWS managed services agreement. We look at the benefits for both customers and providers, competition in the marketplace, and the likelihood of the venture's success. LONDON , Oct. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Introduction Cloud service providers are evolving. Many add new services, often at increasingly higher levels of the stack, at warp speed. And with the self-service model that many providers have adopted, customers can find it difficult to keep up with what services are available from which providers. Decisions about how to best integrate those solutions, to create the best cloud environment to meet business needs, can be an even harder task. In the face of this evolution, infrastructure services provider Rackspace has made bold strides toward a broad-scoped approach that centers on its trademark \"Fanatical Service™.\" While the company continues to support its own infrastructure offers, its focus and marketing attention have taken a marked turn away from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and toward the managed services market. Rackspace's most recent move in support of this shift has been to ink a deal with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide support to customers within the AWS cloud. In this SPIE, Stratecast examines the Rackspace–AWS managed services agreement. We look at the benefits for both customers and providers, competition in the marketplace, and the likelihood of the venture's success. The Rackspace Infrastructure: A Historical Perspective As a managed hosting provider, Rackspace has a long history of providing resilient infrastructure to enterprise and mid-market customers. At the inception of cloud computing, in the early 21st century, Rackspace jumped into cloud, offering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) in its worldwide data centers. Today, Rackspace is the third largest IaaS provider in the US, by market share.2 Across all its services (co-lo, hosting, and cloud), the company supports more than total customers in over countries, who store more than petabytes of data within its infrastructure. The company's primary differentiator has long been its commitment to \"fanatical\" customer service, which offers customers access to highly qualified engineers, around the clock, as a standard component of their infrastructure contract. The company's can-do attitude with regard to customer requests has created a reputation for being customer-friendly and highly competent in supporting customer cloud deployments. Rackspace has long strived to be recognized as one of the world's premier IT services companies.
