Police didn't provide any details about Tao Savoeun's motives, saying only that he had confessed to posting the threat. \n\"He has confessed that he wrote [the threat] by himself,\" said Siem Reap police chief Thang Sakhun, adding that police have charged Tao Savoeun with attempting to kill with a grenade. \"No one forced him to do so. His statement reflects an ill-intentioned attempt to throw a grenade to kill people.\" \nSuon Sopanha told RFA's Khmer Service on Tuesday that he was questioning Tao Savoeun about his motive for the threat, and would question him again on Wednesday. \nGovernment authorities have arrested two others this year for making comments on Facebook against government officials. \nThe Ministry of Interior, however, has failed to arrest any suspects in a case involving a death threat against Kem Sokha, vice president of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in 2013 when his party and the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) were in a political deadlock following contentious elections in July. \nPolice originally investigated a Facebook account supposedly belonging to Pheng Vannak, a senior official in the Ministry of Interior, but later said the account was a fake and declared that he was not involved in the threat. \nIn the meantime, Tao Savoeun's Facebook account remains active and indicates that he is studying tourism to be a tour guide. \nCopyright 1998-2014, RFA.
