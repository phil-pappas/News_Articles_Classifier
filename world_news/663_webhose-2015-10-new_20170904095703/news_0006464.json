(Facebook) Related Stories Does social media help or hinder political debates? \nFacebook has revamped its \"like\" feature with six new icons —and like it or not, the long-rumoured \"dislike\" button isn't one of them. \nThe social network is launching a pilot test of a feature called \"Reactions,\" a set of symbols designed to let users express a range of emotions beyond its standard \"like\" feature. \nChris Cox, chief product officer at Facebook, confirmed the news in a post on Thursday. \nThe new symbols are called \"love, haha, yay, wow, sad, and angry,\" and can be selected by pressing the \"like\" button on Android, iPhone and desktop devices — though not yet on Messenger or other Facebook products, TechCrunch reports . \nThese emojis come in response to calls for a \"dislike\" button, which company founder Mark Zuckerberg hinted might be in the works back in September . \nFor now, Facebook is testing Reactions in Ireland and Spain, where users often have large international friend networks according to Adam Mosseri , Facebook's director of product. In Spain, Facebook plans to test how the wordless characters work with non-English speakers as well. \nThe company intends to introduce Reactions to all of its users soon, but in the meantime you can check out a video of the feature here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:35:48.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
