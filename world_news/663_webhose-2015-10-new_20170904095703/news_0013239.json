The company offered free bus rides at designated stops and full service resumed before 8:30 a.m., according to updates.\n“We are sorry,” SBS said in its posts.\nSingaporeans, used to smooth commutes on the island’s trains for more than two decades, turned vocal critics on social media after operational failures in recent years. Lui Tuck Yew, who as transport minister oversaw an expansion of the public-transportation network and dealt with increased train breakdowns, didn’t seek re-election in September, two months after thousands of people were stranded across more than 50 stations on two main lines.\nThe Ministry of Transport hasn’t yet responded to requests for comment. ComfortDelGro Corp., which owns 75 percent of SBS, didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed questions.\nSBS also operates the Downtown line. SMRT Corp. is the main train operator, running the North-South, East-West and Circle lines.\nOn Monday, hours before the latest disruption, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan wrote in a Facebook post that there was a need for SBS and SMRT to test contingency plans for breakdowns.\n“We are committed to minimizing rail disruptions,” he said.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/ministerkhawboonwan\\", "https://twitter.com/sbstransit_ltd\\"], "published": "2015-10-13T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:50:46.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
