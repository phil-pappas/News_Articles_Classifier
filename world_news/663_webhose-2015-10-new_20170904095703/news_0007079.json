The advisory asks UT to frame regulatory and operational infrastructure compliance guidelines, vehicle profile, working condition for drivers and their compliance, framework for issuing license, duration and renewal among others, general condition, transparency and power to cancel or suspend licenses.\n\nWith this, taxi operators will have to register with the UT administration and follow several guidelines. Now, they fall directly under the transport department of Chandigarh administration. \"To promote and ensure compliance with the law and safety of passengers that use on demand IT based transportation aggregator platforms within a particular jurisdiction and to ensure greater integrity of process and operation of the on-demand transportation aggregator platform, all such on-demand transportation technology aggregators or their subsidiaries in India must obtain a license under Section 93 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 from the transport department that has jurisdiction over the STA area where they are operating and adhere to the laid down terms and conditions,\" says the six-page advisory, a copy of which is with TOI.\n\n\"Following the directions of the Central government, we have prepared a public notice in this regard and will release it in a few days. Through this public notice, web based taxi operators will be given a particular time frame to register themselves with the Chandigarh administration\", said Amit Talwar, joint secretary, transport department, Chandigarh.\n\nCurrently, due to non-registration of web based taxis in the city, the Chandigarh Transport Wing has no stringent means of punishing or nailing them down. A few months ago, UT administration asked web-based radio to register under the existing radio taxi scheme or face action. Web-based taxis are not registered under the radio taxi scheme. In fact, the scheme has no provision for web-based taxis. They operate under the all-India tourist permit which, according to the Motor Vehicles Act, permits cabs to ply for inter-state use only and not within a city.\n\nRules: \n\n* Applicant must be registered entity under the laws of India \n\n* Applicant must be compliant with all regulations prescribed under the Motor Vehicle Act 1988 and IT Act, 2000, including intermediary guidelines \n\n* Applicant must not own or lease any vehicle, employ any drivers or represent himself a tax service, unless also registered as a taxi operator under the applicable law \n\n* The operator must publish policy on taxi fare, registration and drivers, sharing of fares with taxi owners and drivers, safety of passengers, grievance redressal mechanism for passengers etc \n\n* Operators must have a 24X7 call centre \n\n* Operator may brand vehicles \n\n* Licensee must provide either a web or a mobile application based customer service grievance redressal centre with an operational telephone number and e-mail address of a grievance redressal officer Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:23:44.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
