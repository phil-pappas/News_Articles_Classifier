These modern, well planned, technology-enabled industrial and warehousing spaces are targeted at industry verticals such as 3PL, e-commerce, FMCG, automobile ancillaries and retail. Warehousing in India is rapidly evolving from traditional set-ups with inefficient facilities to sophisticated solutions and modern state-of- the - art facilities.
