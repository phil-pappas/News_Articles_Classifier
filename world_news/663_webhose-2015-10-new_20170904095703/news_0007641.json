The report also warned that cyber crime is becoming increasingly hostile and that cyber security is lagging behind. \n\nREAD ALSO: Cyber extortion: New crime on the block \n\n\"Instead of subterfuge and covertness, there is a growing trend of aggression in many cyber attacks, and in particular the use of extortion, whether it is through sexual extortion, ransomware or Distributed Denial of Service [DDoS] attacks,\" it said. \n\nA DDoS attack is launched from multiple sources and often uses thousands of IP addresses; it is intended to render a machine or network incapable of use. Sites targeted typically include banks or credit card payment gateways; other attacks are motivated by revenge or blackmail. \n\nIt was revealed last month that the mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse had been hit by a DDoS attack which jeopardised the personal details of 2.4 million customers. \n\nEuropol said child sexual exploitation still poses \"major concerns\", with the \"hidden web\" of the Darknet encouraging abusers to widen their net. \"The nature of these services drives the abuse of new victims because the production of fresh material is demanded for membership on child abuse forums and it reinforces the status of the contributors,\" the Europol report said.
