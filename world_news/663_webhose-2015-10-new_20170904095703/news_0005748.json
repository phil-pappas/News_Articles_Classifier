Being soft, they can apply gentle and even pressure, and adapt to varied surfaces. Foam favorable for oil extraction: Experiments visualize methods for enhanced recovery from wells August 12, 2014 \nA Rice University laboratory has provided proof that foam may be the right stuff to maximize enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Soft robot to swim through Europa's oceans May 13, 2015 \nAn amphibious robot that can swim through the oceans of distant moons and planets could be the next iteration of self-sustaining, robotic space exploration. New foam technology to lead advances in medical devices and protective equipment June 16, 2015 \nFoam. We wear it. We sit on it. We sleep on it. We even use it to protect ourselves. Syntactic foam sandwich fills hunger for lightweight yet strong materials July 16, 2015 \nA team of researchers reports success in pioneering tests of a layered material with a lightweight metal matrix syntactic foam core that holds significant potential for automobiles, trains, ships, and other applications requiring ... Recommended for you Better fluorescent lighting through physics October 8, 2015 \nGeneral Electric (GE), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) have created new kinds of fluorescent lighting phosphors that use far less rare-earth elements than current technology. Porous material holds promise for prosthetics, robots October 8, 2015 \nCornell researchers have developed a new lightweight and stretchable material with the consistency of memory foam that has potential for use in prosthetic body parts, artificial organs and soft robotics. The foam is unique ... Way cheaper catalyst may lower fuel costs for hydrogen-powered cars October 7, 2015 \nSandia National Laboratories researchers seeking to make hydrogen a less expensive fuel for cars have upgraded a catalyst nearly as cheap as dirt—molybdenum disulfide, \"molly\" for short—to stand in for platinum, a rare ... Trio wins Nobel Prize for mapping how cells fix DNA damage October 7, 2015 \nTomas Lindahl was eating his breakfast in England on Wednesday when the call came—ostensibly, from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It occurred to him that this might be a hoax, but then the caller started speaking ... Patched atoms: Energy researchers discover new structure for bimetallic catalysts October 7, 2015 \nIn the world of catalytic science and technology, the hunt is always on for catalysts that are inexpensive, highly active, and environmentally friendly. How the stick insect sticks (and unsticks) itself October 7, 2015 \nNew research shows the fluid found on insects' feet does not help them adhere to vertical and inverted surfaces, as previously thought, but may in fact help them to unstick their feet more easily to allow greater control ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:07:26.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
