Since their customers include a wide array of industries including construction and mining, trucking, locomotive, agricultural and military, universal precision is essential to the Shaw Development robust design and quality production process. “As a custom engineering specialist, robustness and product quality is essential to our design process” affirmed Bart Baker, Shaw Development’s Senior Designer. “CETOL 6 Sigma and GD&T Advisor ensure the superior value of each custom product through the analysis and modification of tolerances, and correct application of semantic GD&T annotations, reinforcing Shaw Development’s reputation as the leading provider of innovative solutions in global markets. We chose Sigmetrix because of their long history of successful mechanical engineering products. CETOL 6 Sigma and GD&T Advisor both directly integrate into the CAD environment and this is an integral part in improving our design robustness and optimizing our manufacturing goals.”\nSigmetrix’ revolutionary solutions take the complexity and frequent inaccuracy out of tolerance analyses and GD&T definition. Sigmetrix’s software solutions unite the “ideal” world of perfect product designs with the “real” world impacts of manufacturing and assembly imperfections. This understanding allows companies to manufacture high-quality products at the lowest possible costs.\n“Sigmetrix provides the dominant solutions for GD&T and tolerance analysis in many industries”, remarked Sigmetrix President and CEO, Chris Wilkes. “We are excited about the integration of a complete GD&T and tolerance analysis solution within Shaw Development’s design department, ensuring that they can continue to deliver the innovative, high-quality and reliable products they are known for.”\nFor more information on CETOL 6 Sigma visit http://www.sigmetrix.com/products/cetol-tolerance-analysis-software/\nFor more information on GD&T Advisor visit our http://www.sigmetrix.com/products/gdt-software/\nAbout Sigmetrix\nSigmetrix is a global provider of comprehensive, easy-to-use software solutions that help users achieve robust designs through tolerance analysis and the correct application of GD&T.
