Foremost among them is the extraordinary mass market demand for 3G services, which has been largely driven by the emergence of smart devices. Although 3G has become a mature technology in many developed economies, it is currently driving the mobile broadband uptake in many emerging markets. High technology maturity and decreasing costs for both operators and consumers are boosting emerging 3G markets. \n3G connectivity will be of great benefit to emerging markets, where low tele-density and internet penetration means that many potential end-users will look to mobile networks to get online. The increasing availability of low-cost smartphones and tablets will increasingly enable underserved fixed line communication areas to adopt data services such as 3G. Furthermore, improvements in telecommunication services provide a strong economic stimulus to emerging markets, thereby furthering national development. The coming 2015-2020 period will see strong growth in subscriber numbers and operator revenues as many emerging markets finalise their 3G network deployment and aim to tackle full-scale national coverage. The greater availability of 3G networks will also offer significant opportunities for the development of mobile applications and services, such as mobile commerce and health, among others.
