On average, only half of the difficulties experienced once the customer is on site can be identified, according to research launched by UserReplay . \nBusinesses have been focused on driving customers to their website and maximizing the visitor funnel but only a third describe their understanding of the customer journey and purchase process as excellent. \nThe Online Customer Experience - Counting the Cost of Not Knowing is a research study commissioned by UserReplay, the digital customer experience management experts, of over 200 heads of eCommerce in the UK and US spanning retail, travel and finance industries. \nCustomer experience has become a key differentiator for businesses. However, nearly two thirds think a lack of investment in online customer experience is impacting revenue and growth. The implications of this is being felt far and wide affecting immediate business opportunities such as conversion rates, reputation and repeat business opportunities and longer term business growth such as planning and decision-making and budget justification. \nConsumers are increasingly using mobile devices to access eCommerce sites and this is regarded as the most significant contributor to the limited visibility of the customer experience for 40% of those surveyed, followed by a lack of technology to quantify and prioritize online customer issues (33%). \nThe good news is that businesses are looking to address this lack of visibility – 76% plan to increase investment in online channels over the next 12 months. The result of this investment, if focused specifically on customer experience, could be significant as 62% feel they could increase sales if their website was running optimally and more effectively. \nAt the top of the wish list are solutions that provide quantitative data to help prioritize what to fix first (97%), qualitative data that provides details around the user experience (95%), easy to understand reports on website issues (93%) and assurances that websites are meeting compliance requirements (93%). \nJohn Thompson, CEO, UserReplay, comments: “Customer experience is rapidly becoming an area of strategic importance for eCommerce businesses. While many are now excelling in driving visitors to their online channels, this effort can prove fruitless if the business has limited visibility of the customer experience through to purchase. Any issue can have a significant impact on conversion rates. Businesses therefore need the flexibility and agility to identify these issues, however big or small, and resolve them quickly.” \nThe Online Customer Experience - Counting the Cost of Not Knowing \nThe Online Customer Experience - Counting the Cost of Not Knowing is a multi-region study. 207 interviews were conducted with those responsible for their organization’s online channel and the commercial performance of their website during May 2015. Interviews were conducted in the US and UK across retail, finance and travel sectors. The research was conducted by Loudhouse, a specialist B2B and technology market research agency. \nTo download a full copy of the research report visit here: Counting the Cost of Not Knowing \nAbout UserReplay \nUserReplay's session replay technology lets users under and analyze every visitor's journey through a website.
