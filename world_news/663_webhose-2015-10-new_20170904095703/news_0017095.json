It also has a \"factory-free\" policy for products sold on the site. \nThe move heats up competition for e-commerce site Etsy, the 10-year-old marketplace for homemade goods that went public in April and has 1.5 million sellers and 21.7 million buyers. \nSeattle-based Amazon says the site, which will carry everything from $30 walnut cufflinks from Australia to $325 handmade quilts from Wisconsin, sprang from feedback and site searches for crafty items by some of its 285 million shoppers. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
