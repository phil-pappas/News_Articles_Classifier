Galaxy S7 phones sold in other markets will be powered by Samsung’s own Exynos processors, the paper said.\nA Samsung spokeswoman said the firm does not comment on rumours or speculation. Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe South Korean firm used only its Exynos processors for the flagship Galaxy S6 smartphones this year, dealing a major blow to the U.S. chipmaker. But Samsung said earlier this year that it could opt to use Qualcomm chips in the future.\nSamsung has previously sourced mobile processors from both Qualcomm and through its own chips division for its premium devices including its Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series.\n 02, 2015 8:13 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:50:16.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
