In those areas AT&T will deliver broadband at speeds of at least 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) for downloads and 1 Mbps for uploads.\n\"Today's economy requires reliable high-speed Internet connectivity for both businesses and consumers, and AT&T's continuing commitment to deploy these vital services is essential for our continuing economic strength in the Commonwealth,\" said Hal B. Goode , President and CEO of the Kentucky Association for Economic Development. \"This past legislative session, with the leadership of Sen. Hornback and Rep. Rand, we saw how bi-partisan efforts can lead to a more investment-friendly environment in the Commonwealth, and this announcement is a great example of the public and private sectors working together to expand economic opportunities in Kentucky .\"\n\"I am glad to hear of this upcoming infusion of funds to supplement the cost of deployment of high-speed Internet in rural areas, and I am confident that it will make communities across the Commonwealth more attractive to future investment,\" said State Senator Paul Hornback .\n\"This infusion of tens of millions of dollars into broadband deployment in rural Kentucky points to an even stronger future for communities and businesses across the state,\" said State Representative Rick Rand .\nAbout AT&T\nAT&T Inc.
