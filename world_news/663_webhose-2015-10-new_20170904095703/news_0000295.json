Less often is the question asked: How much does this matter? Forrester Research has attempted to answer that question, and has published its findings in a report Does Customer Experience Really Drive Business Success? The answer, it seems, is not straightforward. Nor is it easy to determine. First of all, it’s necessary to define and measure success, and then it’s necessary to measure and compare the quality of customer experience delivered by the businesses being examined. Forrester started with its US Consumer Customer Experience Index (CX Index) complemented by third-party customer satisfaction scores to identify direct competitors with significant differences in the quality of their customer experience and then analysed their US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings to build models that compared their revenue growth. Then it had to find companies in the same industry that competed directly for the same customers. The report examines these company pairs, in several industries, in considerable detail, but the conclusions are, in retrospect, perhaps not surprising. Delivering a customer experience superior to that offered by your competitors won’t help you a great deal if you are in a business where it’s hard for customers to switch providers (eg health insurance in the US, where the choice of provider is largely determined by the consumer’s employer). Delivering a superior customer experience won’t help you much if the differentiation you can achieve is not significant (Forrester says this is the case with traditional retail in most categories, though that is perhaps arguable as retailers come up with ways of using new technologies to communicate with customers, improve the in-store experience and increase customer ‘intimacy’.) Forrester’s conclusion is that providing a superior customer experience does drive business success in every one of the five industries it examined – airlines, cable providers, investment firms, digital-only retailers, traditional retailers, health insurance – except health insurance. And even there, it noted that, in the US at least. new laws, new government policies, cultural shifts, and digital disruption are bringing about change. Digital disruption is affecting every industry, as is cultural change and to some degree, changes in law and policy – all of which could be exploited by an agile organisation to differentiate its customer experience ahead of competitors. \nPremier Technologies \nPremier Contact Point provides a hosted contact solution that meets the needs of the modern contact centre.
