She is unconscious since then. We have done the MRI. We think she has consumed some tablets,\" T P Lahane, Dean of J J Hospital, told reporters.\n\"She is unconscious, her condition is serious,\" he said.\n43-year-old Indrani, the prime accused in the sensational murder of 24-year-old Sheena, was rushed from the Arthur Road jail and admitted to the state-run J J Hospital here after she complained of \"uneasiness\", said DCP Mohan Dahikar.\n\"We have taken her gastric lavage and sent it to the forensic for investigation. There is respiratory repression. We are giving oxygen and she is admitted in CCU, said Lahane.\n\"Whatever toxic has been there, if it has been gone out of the body, then I think, it should be clear to us within the next 24 hours to check the response. It will be take at least 24 hours,\" he said.\nThere was speculation that Indrani was under depression and had attempted suicide by consuming some pills.\nIndrani was arrested on August 25 for her alleged role in the murder of Sheena, her daughter from a previous marriage, in April 2012. The two other accused in the case are Shyamvar Rai, Indrani's former driver and her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna.\nThe high-profile case was initially handled by Mumbai Police under the supervision of the then Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria and later transferred to CBI by Maharashtra government. The central agency last month filed a murder case against the three accused.\nOn September 7, Indrani was sent to judicial custody. Her husband, Peter Mukerjea, former Star India CEO, was also questioned several times by police.\nSheena was allegedly abducted by the three accused and killed inside a car after which her body was burnt and dumped into the jungles of adjoining Raigad district, police have said.\nLahane said Indrani was on epilepsy medication.\"We suspect that she got her epilepsy medicine and probably consumed all of it,\" he added.\nJail authorities said she has been on anti-epileptic pills since September 11 after she started suffering convulsions.\nPrison officials, who were tasked to monitor her medication, have been asked to explain how Indrani got hold of tablets more than her dosage.\nAnti-epileptic drugs are given to control seizures and an overdose can put the person in a comatose state, a senior doctor said.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:18:49.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
