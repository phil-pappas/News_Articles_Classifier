The three-pronged approach to security management is straightforward – find the data, secure the data and defeat the hackers.\nThe team at Vulsec works with client companies including financial institutions, power plants, hospitals, casinos, restaurants, hotels and retail chains. By assessing the risks threatening data, the security experts at Vulsec can analyze the shortcomings of a business’s Information Security Program. Vulsec then works within a partnership network to remediate present and potential information security issues.\n“We identify and evaluate a company’s infrastructure and how susceptible it is to being hacked, provide a source to “fix” the problem and then run a full-scale test to see if the fix works,” said Ostashen, noting that during the final phase his team attempts to hack into the clients’ system to ensure it is not penetrable. He added that infrastructure is only part of the challenge that most companies face, noting that what he terms “social engineering” plays a key role – that being how employees and team members are trained to detect and respond to threats. “Often times, humans in the overall infrastructure can be the weakest link,” he notes.\nOstashen brings significant experience to his new venture. Prior to launching Vulsec, as a consultant, he worked with a number of organizations to test the dependability of their infrastructure and social engineering and said that on numerous occasions, he had been able, even without proper identification, to access data centers in buildings – which he then promptly reported to the clients who had engaged him to test their systems.\nOstashen spoke about the prevalence of hacking in today’s society, citing the US government’s Office of Personnel Management where hackers broke into files and accessed fingerprints of 5.6 million federal employees as one example. He recalled that the Wall Street Journal and New York Stock Exchange were both down on the same day earlier this summer, and that another high-visibility example of hacking was on the Ashley Madison website, where names of individuals – including government officials – were made public.\n“Companies and organizations need to take the issue of their vulnerability very seriously,” he said, adding, “The hackers who are out there today are very sophisticated and shrewd, and organizations that do not protect their information do so at their own peril.”\nOstashen, a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology with a degree in Information Security and Forensics, has worked within the IT industry for nearly 10 years. Prior to launching Vulsec, he headed Ostashen Consulting, LLC, an IT business solution provider focusing on system administration and systems security.\nAbout Vulsec\nVulsec, established to provide clients with the highest methodologies in data protection, delivers versatile tactics to safeguard information technology departments from hackers.
