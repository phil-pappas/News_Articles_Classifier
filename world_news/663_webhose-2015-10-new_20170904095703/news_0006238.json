Not Sambo. Not Toby.\nBut Cayden Jace.\nThis weekend, the three-year-old was at the center of a social media firestorm that saw at least one of Cayden's mother's co-workers get fired and force a local marketing company to re-examine its hiring policies.\n\"We have to be more careful about who we hire,\" said Michael Da Graca Pinto, president of the Polaris Marketing Group.\nLast month, on Sept. 16, a PMG worker named Gerod Roth, identified as Geris Hilton on Facebook, posted what seemed like an innocuous selfie of himself and Cayden, the son of a co-worker Sydney Jade.\nWhat followed was a torrent of racist and bigoted comments from Roth's friends and followers.\nWhen he initially posted the photo, it doesn't appear that Roth actually commented.\nBut in response to someone asking, \"Dude where the hell did you get a black kid??\"\nGeris Hilton responded: \"He was feral.\"\nIn an image that appears to be a Facebook Messenger conversation, someone asks the question, \"Why is he feral though?\"\nAn avatar that appears to be Hilton/Roth's responds with: \"Because he was abandoned in the Atlanta projects, to fend for himself, he is deaf mute, ca't (cq) properly communicate and is in and out of a shelter home, that is the definition of feral.\"\n\"The comments were horrible,\" Pinto said. \"What Sidney was upset about, is that he referred to her son in slanderous ways and didn't defend him.\"\nDetroit-based blogger Ife Johari said the images started appearing in her timeline last Thursday. She reached out to the mother, blogged about it and created the hashtag, #HisNameIsCayden.\n\"Black Twitter was already doing their thing and I made a decision to find out who the child was,\" Johari said Monday. \"These people are just average people. A young mother who goes to work every day. Now the whole internet is in their life. Who asks for that?\"\nHe then went to work every day speaking to and smiling in Sydney's face while making these horrible comments behind her back.\nPinto said he fired Roth on Sept. 29, issuing a strong Facebook message, saying that he was \"disgusted.\"\nYourEDM, where he worked under the Geris Hilton moniker, also issued a statement confirming that they had fired Roth.\nOn Monday, Pinto doubled down.\n\"We have a family-oriented environment,\" Pinto said. \"Sidney is a friend and a great worker. He son comes in here all the time and I just wanted to let her know that this is not something we condone. I just wanted Sidney to know that we support her.\"\nEfforts to reach Gerod Roth/Geris Hilton were unsuccessful.\nMeanwhile, Jade has taken to social media to celebrate her son, \"The love of my life, the apple in my ey, my EVERYTHING,\" she said. \"We are above all of this nonsense that has been going on.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/a8/cf/Comments-3.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/1e/b1/Original-post.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/a7/fe/Comments-1.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/4d/20/my-cayden-post.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/1e/9f/geris7.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/28/16/Comments-2.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/52/b9/polaris-marketing-group.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/54/43/sydney-speaks.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:27:03.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
