Reuters/Kacper Pempel/Files \nRussian hackers had infiltrated Dow Jones & Co to steal information to trade on before it was made public, and the breach was \"far more serious than a lower-grade intrusion\" disclosed by the company, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, Secret Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission are leading an investigation, which began at least a year ago, Bloomberg reported. \nDow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, disclosed a breach of its systems last week that put payment card and contact information of about 3,500 individuals at risk. \n\"We are aware of the Dow Jones intrusion and looking into it,\" FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser said via email. \nThe hackers sought information including stories being prepared for publication, Bloomberg said on Friday, citing two people familiar with the investigation. \nDow Jones and the Secret Service could not be immediately reached for comment on the Bloomberg report. \nThe SEC declined to comment. \n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Joseph Menn ; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Sriraj Kalluvila) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:01:12.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
