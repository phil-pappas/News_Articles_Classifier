To use an analogy of a human social network, ... New method reveals single protein interaction key to embryonic stem cell differentiation June 5, 2014 \nProteins are responsible for the vast majority of the cellular functions that shape life, but like guests at a crowded dinner party, they interact transiently and in complex networks, making it difficult to determine which ... Study points to unexplored realm of protein biology, drug targets June 18, 2015 \nScientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have devised a powerful set of chemical methods for exploring the biology of proteins. Facebook for the proteome July 17, 2015 \nThere are approximately 20,000 human genes that encode proteins, but despite remarkable progress since the human genome was first sequenced more than a decade ago, scientists still understand in detail how only a small fraction ... Scientists create world's largest protein map to reveal which proteins work together in a cell September 7, 2015 \nA multinational team of scientists have sifted through cells of vastly different organisms, from amoebae to worms to mice to humans, to reveal how proteins fit together to build different cells and bodies. Recommended for you A social network of human proteins October 23, 2015 \nScientists at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried near Munich and at the MPI of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden have now drawn a detailed map of human protein interactions. Using a novel ... Flying ants mate close to home and produce inbred offspring October 23, 2015 \nAnt queens stay close to home in their hunt for a mate and as a result produce thousands of inbred offspring, a study led by a University of Exeter biologist has found. Plague in humans 'twice as old' but didn't begin as flea-borne, ancient DNA reveals October 22, 2015 \nNew research using ancient DNA has revealed that plague has been endemic in human populations for more than twice as long as previously thought, and that the ancestral plague would have been predominantly spread by human-to-human ... Speedy evolution affects more than one species October 22, 2015 \nThe concept that biodiversity feeds upon itself is not uncommon in the world of evolution. The problem is a lack of hard data that shows this process to be naturally occurring. Calls vs. balls: Monkeys with more impressive roars produce less sperm October 22, 2015 \nHowler monkeys are about the size of a small dog, weighing around seven kilos, yet they are among the loudest terrestrial animals on the planet, and can roar at a similar acoustic frequency to tigers. Scientists discover protein factories hidden in human jumping genes October 22, 2015 \nScientists have discovered a previously unknown wellspring of genetic diversity in humans, chimps and most other primates. This diversity arises from a new component of itinerant sections of genetic code known as jumping ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:43:36.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
