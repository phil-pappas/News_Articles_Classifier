The delegation which was made up of petrochemical and shipping experts met in Tehran with various ministries, petrochemical organisations and private companies. With this mission Antwerp Port Authority seeks to open the doors of Iran for the Antwerp port community once more.\nThe exploratory mission was mainly aimed at making contacts with official bodies. It included meetings with among others Mr. Saeednejad, head of the Ports and Maritime Organization, Dr. Saeidi, head of the Islamic Republic Shipping Line, Mr. Masoud Karbasian, head of the Iranian Customs service and Mr. Seyed Jamal Hosseini, vice-chairman of the Iranian Investment Organisation. The discussions covered Iran's ambitions in shipping and commerce, as well as the role that the port of Antwerp could play in attaining these Iranian objectives.\nThe programme which was drawn up in close collaboration with the Belgian embassy also included a meeting with a number of Iranian private companies and consultancies with expert knowledge of the Iranian shipping industry. The delegation concluded with a visit to the Shahid Rajaee port in Bandar Abbas and the Queshm free trade zone. Shahid Rajee is the largest container port in Iran, accounting for nearly half of Iranian shipping imports.\n\"Up until 2010 Antwerp was the largest European port destination for Iranian cargoes,\" said Marc Van Peel. \"In the light of the recent nuclear agreement and the raising of economic sanctions, we wanted to let the Iranians know directly that Antwerp is still the ideal hub for reaching the European hinterland. There is also great demand on the Iranian side for know-how concerning port infrastructure, among other things. Port of Antwerp International and the Antwerp Flanders Port Training Centre are ready to support the Iranian port community in these areas. In all respects the mission was certainly successful, opening up prospects both for Iran and for our port.\"\nThe mission was organised in compliance with the national and international directives in such matters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:06:17.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
