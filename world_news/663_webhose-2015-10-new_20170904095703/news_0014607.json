In 2015, there were 11 incidents reported by cinema staff, with 10 attended by the police. One incident led to two arrests, while formal cautions were given out at four incidents. Hollywood wants to prevent Spectre from being leaked Film distributors are keen to prevent Spectre from being leaked on the internet before it launches in the US and around the world Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures / Columbia Pictures \nThe UK will be the first country in the world to see the latest James Bond film Spectre when it debuts in cinemas on Monday 26 October, followed by six other European countries for the remainder of the month. \nThe film will be released in the US and many other countries from 5 November onwards, but there are concerns it will be leaked on to the internet before it is released to the rest of the world. \nTo that end, in September it was announced that UK cinema staff would be expected to wear military-grade night vision goggles during screenings of Spectre and Mockingjay Part 2 in order to detect camcorders and smartphones in the dark that might be hidden inside popcorn boxes or a sock with a hole in it. \n\"The bigger the film and the more anticipated it is, the higher risk it is. We have staff on extra alert for that. James Bond is a big risk and we will be working with cinema operators and the distributors making sure we will keep that as tight as possible. We really don't want to see that recorded,\" FACT director general Kieron Sharp said at the time. \n\"They [cinema staff] are on alert to really drill down on who is in the auditorium and who might possibly be recording. They still do the sweeps around the auditoriums with the night vision glasses regardless of the film. But sometimes extra security is put in place for things like Bond.\" More about online piracy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:04:13.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
