The ability to work on any system means customers can use the devices of their choice, even within the same organization. There is no need to standardize on one type. Additionally, patient engagement, telehealth visits and population health functions are normally separate products. 10e combines all of these within one product, one log-in with an intuitive user interface. \nThe main features of 10e include: Ability to run on every platform, including Mac, Chrome and Windows; Integrated EHR, population health and patient engagement; Health and wellness tracker data fed directly into platform; Integrated telehealth visits from within the EHR; Intuitive user interface. \n“10e is a game changer for this industry,” said Girish Navani, CEO and co-founder of eClinicalWorks. “Patient engagement and population health are necessary components to care delivery, so it is logical to have them part of a single EHR solution. 10e’s capabilities are so diverse, and so powerful, yet so simple to use, that this is the most intuitive EHR system yet. We truly believe that this is going to raise the bar in the industry.” \neClinicalWorks 10e will be available to customers by the end of 2015.
