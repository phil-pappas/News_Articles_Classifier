Revenues were up 7% in constant currency terms as we delivered gains in many of our core underwriting and risk management operations. We continued to build share in the mid and mass market while expanding and deepening relationships with our existing blue-chip client base,\" said Anand Nallathambi, President and Chief Executive Officer of CoreLogic. \"We are excited about the launch of our data-driven property valuation solutions group which we expect to provide additional future growth opportunities. We believe we possess unique data, analytics and data-enabled services that, collectively, will enable our clients to more accurately estimate the value of properties and evaluate important factors that may influence that value - now and in the future.\" \n\"Our strong third-quarter financial performance reflects the continuing shift in our business mix toward scaled platforms that provide unique data-driven insights with higher levels of subscription-based revenues. The durability of our business model allows us to continue to invest in our products and services, technology leadership and operational improvements and, at the same time, return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders and manage our debt,\" added Frank Martell, Chief Operating and Financial Officer of CoreLogic. \"Importantly, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margins above 30% in the third quarter despite significant reinvestment in the business. As we move forward, we expect these investments to contribute to higher top-line growth and margin expansion.\" \nThird-Quarter Financial Highlights Third quarter revenues totaled $386.4 million compared with $367.5 million in the same 2014 period and $386.0 million in the second quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase of 5% (7% on a constant-currency basis) was driven primarily by growth in property, insurance, international and underwriting solutions which was partially offset by adverse foreign currency translation impacts and lower project-related volumes. TPS revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $218.3 million driven primarily by increased market share in the Company's underwriting solutions units. D&A revenues aggregated $170.5 million in 2015, down 2% (plus 3% on a constant-currency basis) from the prior year as higher insurance, spatial solutions and international revenues were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation ($7.8 million) and lower core property and capital markets revenues attributable to the termination of several data supply and reseller agreements and the exit of a number of capital markets clients from the residential mortgage backed security (RMBS) market. \nOperating income from continuing operations totaled $65.9 million for the third quarter compared with $77.8 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $60.7 million for the second quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2014 operating income included $13.9 million attributable to a non-recurring gain on sale of real estate assets. Operating income increased approximately 3% excluding the impact of the 2014 gain. Improved operating income performance resulted primarily from revenue growth and the benefits of cost management programs which were partially offset by increased investment levels in technology, compliance and process enhancements and currency translation impacts. Third quarter 2015 operating income margin was 17%, up from 16% in the second quarter of 2015 and down from 21% (380 basis points attributable to the gain discussed previously) in 2014. \nThird quarter net income from continuing operations totaled $28.3 million compared with $49.7 million in 2014. The $21.4 million year-over-year decrease was driven primarily by increased tax provisions, non-recurring gains recognized in the third quarter of 2014 which had no 2015 counterpart and currency translation impacts. Diluted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.31 for the third quarter of 2015 compared with $0.54 in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.54, up 10% reflecting the positive impacts of revenue growth, cost containment and share repurchases. \nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $116.4 million in third quarter 2015 compared with $113.4 million in the same prior year period and $117.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%, in-line with 2014 levels. The 3% increase (5% on a constant-currency basis) in adjusted EBITDA was principally the result of revenue growth, operating leverage in our underwriting solutions businesses and the benefit of cost containment programs. TPS adjusted EBITDA increased 23% to $72.3 million as operating leverage and cost management benefits drove improved results. D&A adjusted EBITDA declined 13% to $53.5 million as improved results from insurance and spatial solutions businesses were more than offset by unfavorable currency translation ($2.6 million) and previously-announced investments in product and service development, technology platforms, compliance infrastructure, and data monetization initiatives. \nCost Management and Technology Excellence In line with the Company's demonstrated commitment to operational excellence and progressive growth in profit margins, during the first quarter of 2015, CoreLogic announced an expanded three-year productivity and cost management program which is expected to reduce expense, on an annual run-rate basis, by approximately $60 million by 2018. Savings are expected to be realized through the reduction of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs, outsourcing certain business process functions, consolidation of facilities and other operational improvements. This program will incorporate expected savings from the completion of Phase I of the Company's previously announced TTI. TTI Phase I, completed during the second quarter of 2015, focused principally on the transition of the Company's existing technology infrastructure to a managed service arrangement with Dell Services. The second phase of the TTI (TTI - Gen2) relates to the development of the Company's next generation technology platform which is designed to augment and eventually replace substantial portions of our legacy systems as well as support future revenue growth trends. \nThe Company expects to realize approximately $15 million in total savings from its cost productivity and management program during 2015, including $10 million in savings attributable to the completion of TTI Phase I. Additional run-rate savings of $30 million are targeted in 2016 with additional savings of $15 million expected during 2017. Cash and non-cash charges associated with this program are expected to aggregate approximately $20 million and will be incurred over the course of the three-year program. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $160.3 million compared with $104.7 million at December 31, 2014. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had available capacity on its revolving credit facility of $450.0 million. Total debt as of September 30, 2015 was approximately $1.4 billion. \nFree cash flow (FCF) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $303.6 million, which represented 73% of adjusted EBITDA. FCF is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets. Net operating cash provided by continuing operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 was $386.1 million. \nDuring the third quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 1.0 million of its common shares for a total consideration of $38.7 million. In addition, the Company expanded its data-driven property valuation solutions business through the purchase of LandSafe Appraisal Services, Inc. for approximately $122.0 million. \n2015 Financial Guidance (Continuing Operations) Based on current business conditions and trends, available market estimates of 2015 U.S. mortgage origination unit volumes and the forecasted impact of previously announced investment and cost reduction programs, the Company reaffirms its previously issued 2015 full-year guidance ranges for revenues ($1.49 to $1.51 billion), adjusted EBITDA ($410 to $420 million) and adjusted EPS ($1.75 to $1.85 per share). \nTeleconference/Webcast CoreLogic management will host a live webcast and conference call on Thursday, October 22, 2015 at 8:00 a.m. Pacific time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss reported results.

Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in this press release. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA or projected adjusted earnings per share, where provided, to expected results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of special charges or gains. \nThe Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and FCF, provides useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding CoreLogic's financial condition and results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock compensation, non-operating gains/losses and other adjustments plus pretax equity in earnings of affiliates. Adjusted net income is defined as income from continuing operations before equity earnings of affiliates, adjusted for non-cash stock compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, non-operating gains/losses, and other adjustments plus pretax equity in earnings of affiliates, tax affected at an assumed effective tax rate of 35% for 2015 and 38% for 2014. Adjusted EPS is derived by dividing adjusted net income by diluted weighted average shares. FCF is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets. Other firms may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than CoreLogic, which limits comparability between companies. \n(Additional Financial Data Follow) CORELOGIC, INC.
