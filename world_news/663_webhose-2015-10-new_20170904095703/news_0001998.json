He told police he was \"doing it for God and the end of the world to be peaceful.\"\nHe then explained his self-mutilation that included cutting off one of his forearms, gouging his right eyeball and stabbing himself in the chest: \"Then I do what I had to do to myself: My arm, my eye, my heart.\"\nWakefield also told investigators that he stabbed his wife during a fight that erupted after he decapitated one of the couple's two dogs. He later killed the second dog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:13:21.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
