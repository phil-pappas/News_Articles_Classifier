The new Google Chromecast is displayed during a Google special event at Dogpatch Studios on July 24, 2013 in San Francisco, California \nAmazon competes in the same arena with a Fire TV line that includes a USB style \"Stick\" priced at $40 and a new ultra high-definition Fire TV box set for release next week at $100. \nGoogle on Tuesday unveiled an upgraded version of its popular Chromecast device that plugs into television screens to stream content wirelessly from the internet, with smartphones or tablets serving as controls. \nThe company also introduced Chromecast Audio, a pendant sized device designed to plug into stereo speakers for streaming music, podcasts, YouTube or other audio content through home sound systems. \nBoth new Chromecast devices kept the $35 price of the earlier version. \nUpdated Apple TV hardware set for release in late this month promised to strike a blow to cable companies that have been in a power seat when it comes to delivering shows and other content. \nApple TV will have a version of the App Store that has been a hit on iPhones. \nBy letting media companies keep control of their content in apps, Apple could find new money-making models while sidestepping worries studios might have about distribution rights. \nAmazon also makes a gaming version of its Fire TV box. \nAccording to the research firm Parks Associates: Roku leads the US market with a 37 percent market share, to 19 percent for Google Chromecast and 17 percent for Apple TV. Amazon's Fire TV devices have 14 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:21:08.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
