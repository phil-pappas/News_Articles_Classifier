The figure beat expectations of 11.83 billion francs.\nThe company said third-quarter sales of its pharmaceuticals increased to 9.34 billion francs from 9.13 billion francs, while revenues at its diagnostics division were slightly down at 2.6 billion francs. Roche doesn't report earnings for the quarter.\nRoche said it now expected full-year sales growth in the mid-single digit range at constant exchange rates, which cut out the effect of currency swings. The outlook was an upgrade from the low- to mid-single-digit range Roche said it expected at the half-year stage.\nIt said it still expects core earnings-per-share to grow ahead of sales, when measured in constant currencies. It also expects to raise its 8 franc-a-share dividend paid out in fiscal 2014.\nRoche CEO Severin Schwan said: \"With sales continuing to grow strongly, we are raising our outlook for the full year. I am very pleased about the positive newsflow coming from our product pipeline.\"\nMr. Schwan said this included positive data about the company's cancer immunotherapy medicine atezolizumab used to treat bladder and lung cancer and strong data on ocrelizumab, an experimental drug used to treat multiple sclerosis. Analysts reckon ocrelizumab could generate sales of 2 billion francs by 2023 if approved for sale.\n\"These medicines have the potential to make a big difference to people living with these terrible diseases,\" Mr. Schwan said.\nRoche said its reported sales growth for the first nine months of the year to 35.53 billion francs had been reduced by the strong Swiss franc, which strengthened considerably against the euro and other currencies. In francs, this represented a 2% increase, but was a 6% rise in constant exchange rates, which cut out the effect of currency fluctuations.\n\"Overall there was a negative currency impact of four percentage points on growth,\" the company said.\nStill, the company, which owns California-based Genentech, was buoyed by the success of some of its newer products it is launching to replace drugs that are close to losing patent protection such as breast cancer drug Herceptin.\nThe drug, one of Roche's biggest sellers, chalked up sales of 4.88 billion francs in the first nine months of 2015, up 10% in constant exchange rates. Herceptin has lost patent protection in Europe and will do so in the U.S. in 2019.\nTwo drugs, Perjeta and Kadcyla, that have been launched to replace Herceptin, had combined sales of 1.59 billion francs in the reporting period. Perjeta sales rose 66% and Kadcyla sales rose 57% compared with the same period a year earlier.\nWrite to John Revill at john.revill@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:32:50.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
