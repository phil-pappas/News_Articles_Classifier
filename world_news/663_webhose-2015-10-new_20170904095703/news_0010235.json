Don’t be sad be happy for me, my pain ends. Please remember the good things I did, not my mistakes. Sorry!!” \nNews.com.au attempted to contact Mr Munday and several of his family members without success. His phone numbers appear to have been disconnected and his email addresses have been disabled.
