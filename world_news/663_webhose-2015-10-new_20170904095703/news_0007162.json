It would initially release its latest project, Prison Architect, not as a complete product, but as an unfinished “alpha” allowing early purchasers to give feedback on how the game should be developed.\nThis “early access” model of game development, popularised by the massively successful Minecraft, can be very effective, lessening the risk for the game’s publishers of producing a flop while allowing keen players to feel part of the project. But it can also lead to controversies – studios often promise much to their early community then spectacularly under deliver.\nIn the case of Prison Architect, Introversion Software has delivered. The team promised major updates every month, and they kept that promise. Within two weeks, over 2,000 copies had been sold, and by January 2015 there were one million players. After only a few hours with the now official full release of the game, it is easy to understand why.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest It’s not just about keeping the prisoners locked up, you also have to manage their physical and mental wellbeing. Maybe keeping them all locked up in tiny pitch black cells for 23 hours a day isn’t the best solution? Photograph: Introversion \nPrison Architect is a simulation in which players take on the design and running of a major US correctional facility. On first loading the game you’re tasked with taking over an existing prison. The current CEO wants you to build an execution facility for a double murderer, known simply as Edward. It is through this rather macabre tutorial that you’re shown the basics of prison architecture, creating foundations, building walls and adding power and water utilities. You’re also shown how to escort the non-playable characters around the prison.\nIt’s an introduction that makes two things clear: that the prison system is effectively a business, and that it’s a business that involves death. The studio has scrupulously researched the US prison system, talking to both wardens and prisoners and reading up on the theory of prison architecture. Designer Chris Delay came up with the idea after visiting Alcatraz, but then spent months analysing the current US system, looking into how the buildings are run, but how elements such as race, gang affinity and assault play into the process.\n\nDesigner Chris Delay came up with the idea after visiting Alcatraz, but then spent months analysing the current system\n\nAfter finishing the tutorial players are given their own plot of land and told to start building their own maximum security prison. However, many newcomers will find that when the prisoners arrive 24 hours after construction begins (24 minutes in real-time) what they’ve actually built is a minimum security facility, which leaks prisoners like a sieve. In my first three hours with the game all I managed to build were some fences and foundations. I hired a warden, who wandered around the fields, and a chef who went off to the lake and never came back. When the prisoners arrived they ran straight into the wilderness, lost forever.\nIt takes a while to start organising the range of buildings – from cells to laundries, to canteens – in a quick and secure way. Then you need an army of employees to run it properly. You need power and water. You need to protect the garbage area with barbed wire fences as this is an obvious escape point for crafty inmates.\nTo help you out, the game provides an ingenious planning tool with three elements – walls, objects and pathways – allowing you to essentially design the fundaments of your structure before laying a single slab of concrete. After planning properly, I was able to build what I thought was an impenetrable prison. I was right. I’d forgotten to add any doors. All part of the learning process.\nAs you become more competent, the experience gives way to the usual slight repetitiveness of the sim genre. You build a prison, you keep adding rooms, you hire more and more staff and you take in extra prisoners – the more you have, the greater your income. It’s the same gameplay loop that we’ve been enjoying since SimCity first arrived in 1989, and which has fed everything from Theme Hospital to Rollercoaster Tycoon.\nThere are several features that add to this cycle though. To make more money at the start of the game, players are able to take out grants, which pay you a set amount of money for carrying out specific tasks. It’s great when you’re really struggling for cash, and gives a more directed experience, but the feature is not particularly well highlighted – or at least it took me a while to find it.\nAlthough it can be switched off, the Fog of War feature is worth challenging yourself with, creating blind spots in your prison wherever the warden is unable to see. One moment everything appears to be running smoothly, but the next a full scale prison riot is taking place at the end of an unobserved corridor. More staffing is one solution, but another is taking advantage of surveillance technology. Big Warden is watching.\n\nPlayers can also choose to switch on events, which work like the disasters in SimCity, randomly hitting you with a major nightmare scenario like a fire or a riot, which can really test your facilities – both mental and architectural.\nPrison Architect has a unique style: minimalistic, but full of character. It takes a very serious subject and turns it into an impressive simulation, where players have the scope to experiment with varying incarceration theories, from relatively pleasant rehabilitation homes to hellish maximum security jails designed to beat down the population as effectively as possible. The tutorial elements could certainly be much clearer and the complexity of the systems can be daunting. But once you’re in, you will – unlike many of my own early inmates – find it very difficult to escape.\n\nIntroversion Software; PC/Mac; £20", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:34:33.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
