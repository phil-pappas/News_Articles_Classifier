I am one of these people .\nMy neighbourhood, Meyerspark, has been without water for most of the day, and I’m highly the moer in annoyed. And so is Sakkie. And so would Oom Paul be, if he was still alive.\nBokaba says the higher demand for water, as a result of the heat wave, has brought down the water levels in reservoirs. He says that because the speed at which water fills up in the reservoirs is slow, some areas of the metro experience low water pressure. ( The usual, bullshit-baffles-brains statement, nê, Sakkie? )\n“Residents are urged to use water sparingly and not water gardens until water supply is back to normal. It is important residents heed this request,” he says.\nBokaba said a spot fine in terms of the metro’s by-laws would be issued if restrictions were not adhered to. ( This, while water leaks in the street takes months to repair .)\n“The metro is pleading with all residents to use water sparingly and to not water their gardens during the day until the situation has stabilised,” he said. ( Yes, Sakkie, you and I both know the situation will never be “stabilised” again. )\nI would like to say to Bokaba (in a John Wayne tone of voice): “Somebody oughta belt you in the mouth. But I won’t, I won’t, the Hell I won’t .”\nI have spent thousands of rands and hundreds of hours in landscaping, planting, and maintaining my garden. I pay my water and electricity account, on time, every month. I have never been in arrears with payment.\nJust like Eskom’s appeal for people to switch off appliances, when the grid is under “pressure,” has fallen on my deaf ears, I will NOT cooperate with Bokaba and his incompetent cronies at the Tshwane metro. I have NEVER switched off my pool pump, my three geysers, four aircon units, or any appliance, in order to “save” electricity. I PAY for electricity.\nThe moment the water supply is restored to my house, I shall open up ALL the garden irrigation systems and use as much water as I want. Because I PAY for it. Poor planning on the metro’s part does not constitute an emergency on my part.\nBokaba is welcome to come to my house to issue his “spot fine.” As soon as he has done that, I shall insist on him accompanying me to Mamelodi, Soshanguve, Eersterust, Attridgeville, and hundreds of other townships, to issue some “spot fines” to the residents who get their (stolen) water for free.\nSo…\nHere’s my challenge to you, Selby Bokaba: Come to my house. You’ll recognise it quite easily. It is the one with ALL the sprinklers going full blast.\nPS You’ll need to bring a gum guard. (And a whole team of your bodyguards).\nPPS I still haven’t bought an e-toll either.\nSacha Coquelin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:43:44.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
