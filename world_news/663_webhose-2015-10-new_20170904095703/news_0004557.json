The service, which will run on AWS, lets business customers dive into the massive amounts of data they are storing on Amazon's servers. \nAWS boss Andy Jassy said during his keynote address at the re:Invent conference that QuickSight will cost about a tenth as much at \"old-guard\" business intelligence software. \nAt the conference, Amazon also debuted a new piece of hardware - a 47-pound chunky box called Amazon Snowball. Jassy called the box as a \"highly secure shippable storage appliance\" to help companies move data more quickly than sending it virtually. Each Snowball holds 50 terabytes in a tamper-proof secure enclosure, giving companies the ability to move massive amounts of data quickly. \nAmazon will charge $200 per job. And it will wipe and reuse the devices for the next customer. \n\"It will really help customers who want to move large amounts of data to AWS,\" Jassy said.
