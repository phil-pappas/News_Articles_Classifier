In addition, 70% have used their smartphone for shopping while they were inside a physical store, with 48% saying they would purchase items via their device if they could not find them on the racks. \nEase of use is still a factor, with 59% of the survey's respondents agreeing that it can be difficult to type so much information into their phone to make a purchase. However, 4 in 10 agree that one-click buying has made them more likely to buy items with their mobile devices. \nA separate qualitative study was conducted by BabyCenter this summer and the findings underscore these results: Mobile-Less Moms Challenge Discussion Group - in which moms who are heavy mobile users were asked to spend some time without their phone - found that participants felt stressed and uneasy going back to paper shopping lists and coupons. This indicates that mobile has become ingrained in the shopping experience and will only pick up steam as time goes on. \nFor in-store shopping, the report found that scanning items is more important than ever, with 55% of respondents saying they have purchased items in-store immediately after scanning them with their phones. These moms are often looking for deals, with 64% of those polled citing coupons as a reason for scanning items. In addition, 51% scan products so they can compare prices via apps like Amazon Price Checker, and 38% do so to read product reviews. \nThe 2015 survey also found significant upticks year-over-year in a variety of other shopping-related mobile behaviors undertaken by U.S. moms, including: -- Visiting a retailer or shopping site: 73% (up 7%) -- Using mobile coupons: 61% (up 13%) -- Using a retailer app: 58% (up 14%) -- Looking up prices online while shopping in a store: 56% (up 14%) -- Photographing something they are considering buying: 47% (up 14%) \n\"As we continue to watch the evolution of mobile shopping, particularly as mobile moms make the smartphone a more critical part of their purchasing behavior, it's important for brands to understand that these screens have tremendous pull and influence,\" said Julie Michaelson, Head of Global Sales, BabyCenter. \"By streamlining the mobile purchase process and offering special deals for those who make use of their smartphone in-store, brands can sell more products by connecting directly with moms on the go.\" \nThe complete results of the BabyCenter U.S. Mobile Mom 2015: Smart Shopping Goes Smartphone report are available for download here . \nMethodology Fielded in August 2015, the U.S. Mobile Mom 2015 survey polled 1,117 U.S. women ages 18 and up.
