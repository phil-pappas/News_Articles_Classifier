TOT has not said how many partners it will choose. \nIt currently operates its tower sites with AIS and TOT's acting president Montchai Noosong said that the two companies were in talks on seeking ways to continue doing so after AIS's second-generation (2G) mobile concession expires at the end of September. \n\"The partnership conclusion has been postponed slightly and we expected it to be by the end of this year,\" Montchai told reporters. \nPossible options for cooperation with AIS included establishing a joint venture, setting up an infrastructure fund and a long-term rental contract, he said.
