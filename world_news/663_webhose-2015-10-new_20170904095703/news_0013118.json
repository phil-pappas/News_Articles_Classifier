Using a cellphone app to track the phone's location, they found him lying in a ditch near some railroad tracks early Monday morning, about 7 miles from campus and a few blocks from a commuter rail station, she told local TV stations. \nHe was found bruised and disoriented with his clothing torn, she told the media, adding that he said he was beaten by a group of men. \nThe Twitter account for Hubert shows him in an Atlanta hospital bed with an oxygen mask, making a “thumbs up” gesture. \n“Thanks go to the students for not giving up on their friend,” Connolly said in the release. \nDue to Hubert’s injuries, investigators have not yet been able to interview him, said Atlanta police public information officer Warren Pickard, “but it remains an active investigation.” \n(Editing by Letitia Stein and Eric Walsh)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:16:48.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
