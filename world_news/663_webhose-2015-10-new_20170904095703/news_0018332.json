Chris Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith High profile venture capitalist Mark Carnegie has said proposed changes to capital gains tax rules for tech start-up investors will have minimal impact as most investors already avoid it through existing schemes.\nMr Carnegie said the government was saying the right things about the importance of innovation, but that in reality most of the necessary policy settings to encourage start-ups were already in place. However he joined others in lamenting the government's sluggish progress in changes to equity crowdfunding laws.\nThe comments came as tech start-up founders and tax specialists largely welcomed rhetoric from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Innovation Minister Christopher Pyne, who have pledged to make new crowdfunding rules a priority and to look into the introduction of capital gains tax (CGT) breaks for investors in tech start-ups younger than two years and earning less than a $1 million a year.\nTools already in place Assistant minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy announced he will be running a one-day policy hackathon in Sydney. Mr Carnegie told The Australian Financial Review investors backing tech startups through funds already avoided CGT under a vehicle known as early stage venture capital limited partnership (ESVCLP). This, combined with small business tax concessions, meant start-ups were already well assisted with tax benefits, he said.\n\"The government is already doing a lot. The question is do they need to do more, or more pertinently why are the concessions they have in place already not working more effectively or more widely understood,\" Mr Carnegie said.\n\"[CGT changes] may work with some individual investors, but the truth is that most of the guys that are doing this are already doing it through a tax advantaged vehicle at the moment. All of the big incubators and startup firms already get tax free.\nMr Carnegie said he believed existing assistance was not always well understood by those entitled to it, and that he was very optimistic about the prospects for the local industry under the existing policy settings.\nChris Ridd MD of Xero Australia said it was time to see some legislative action. LOUISE KENNERLEY \"There is a class of professional hand-wringers, but the truth is that the whole innovation area in Australia is absolutely transformed from five years ago. It looks far more professional, with a lot more capable people in it,\" he said.\nPolicy hack Regardless the new assistant minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy announced he will be running a one-day policy hackathon in Sydney on October 17 facilitated by startup accelerator BlueChilli. He said the event will bring together representatives from startups, venture capital funds, accelerators, other components of the innovation ecosystem, higher education, science, research and policy experts from key government departments to \"disrupt\" the policy making process.\n\"It's an opportunity to bring together key innovators and entrepreneurs from around our country to directly engage with the government on how we can foster innovation and entrepreneurship,\" Mr Roy said\n\"Participants will be empowered to develop and pitch solutions that will grow agile, innovative and globally-competitive industries in Australia.\"\nMeanwhile the government has been warned not to head back to the drawing board on changes to equity crowdfunding laws.\nHurry up on crowdfunding Changes to the laws, which would allow retail investors to back new ventures with smaller amounts than currently possible, were flagged by former Treasurer Joe Hockey prior to the last election. It is over a year since the government's Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee tabled a report backing new crowdfunding laws, and almost two years since Mr Turnbull pledged his support for changes as Communications Minister .\n\"It's good to see the government push forward with deregulation that will give startups greater access to capital from alternative sources like equity crowdfunding and angel investors,\" Xero Australia managing director Chris Ridd said.\n\"But we need to see some action on this and some legislation through the door before we actually get those tangible benefits.\"\nPwC partner Steve Maarbani said the considerable amount of work and industry consultation already conducted by CAMAC meant the government did not need to go back to the drawing board on crowdfunding policy. He said draft legislation needed to be through Parliament in the spring sitting.\n\"If this announcement is to be taken seriously by the technology sector, that existing work should be seen through to draft legislation,\" Mr Maarbani said.\nMr Carnegie meanwhile suggested that crowdfunding could already be an idea that's time had passed in Australia, due to the protracted process.\n\"It seems to me like it is a 'gonna' industry,\" Mr Carnegie said.\n\"It's always gonna happen, but never arrives. I can't tell if it is ever going to amount to much ... I got all enthusiastic about it 18 months ago, but it just doesn't feel like a real thing.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:23:05.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
