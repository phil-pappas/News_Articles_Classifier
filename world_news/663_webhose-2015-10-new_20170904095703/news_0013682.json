It so far had been offering developers access to only four to five Twitter-owned or operated products.Through this move, Twitter is expected to appease the third party developer community with which it had strained its ties in the last few years after the company cracked down on the use of its data by developers to push its in-house products. The announcement was made during the 'Flight' conference being hosted by Twitter in San Francisco for developers. This, along with other measures announced on Wednesday, is expected to help Twitter emulate the likes of Facebook and Google, which have strong relations with the developers, and build stronger ties with the community, especially in India.According to industry statistics, India has around 3,00,000 app developers and is the second largest Android developer community in the world after the US. The country is expected to have the largest number of software developers by 2017-18.Twitter claims that 40 per cent of the top 50 downloaded apps made in India used one or more of Twitter products on its Fabric.So far developers could use Crashlytics, which lets developers identify bugs, crashes and beta test their apps, and Twitter Kit, for them to embed tweets natively into their apps. The microblogging site had also opened up Digits, a phonebased authentication service, as part of Fabric, which was launched in October last year along with MoPub, a mobile ad server owned by Twitter, which allowed developers to drive advertising on the digital platforms.\"When we launched Fabric last October, we offered tools for mobile developers that could tackle challenges such as stability, distribution, revenue, and identity. We've been blown away by the positive response from the community to these tools, and have seen a number of other key needs within mobile development: scaling infrastructure, integrating payments, and running A/B tests, among others,\" said Prashant Sridharan, global director, developer and platform relations at Twitter in a blog post.He said the company is making the services of eight new partners available through Fabric. These include companies that provide digital, analytics and cloud tools such as Stripe, Amazon Web Services, Optimizely, Nuance, Appsee, GameAnalytics, Mapbox, and Pub-Nub. \"With these new partners, we've made it even easier for you to build the best apps with Fabric,\" said Sridharan.
