This means each authority can now take a different view: some authorities (like the UK Information Commissioner) are typically more pragmatic, while other authorities take a stricter approach (such as the French CNIL or the Data Protection Commissioners in Germany). \nDoes a case concerning the personal data of a Facebook user apply in the employment context? \nYes, the same data transfer principles apply whether transferring customer or employee data. However, the risk in practice of challenge by employees is always lower than when handling external data. \nWe don’t rely on Safe Harbour - does this case apply to other forms of transfer? \nSafe Harbour is just one of the permitted routes to transfer personal data to outside the EU. Given the US Government has a right of access over all data held in the US, there is a question over whether employees could also challenge these other transfer routes. The employee’s informed consent to the transfer. However, an employee’s consent can ever be freely given in the employment context, even at the time of recruitment before the individual becomes an employee. The transfer being necessary for the performance of relevant contractual obligations. This could include an employer’s obligations under the employment contract (for example processing salary and benefits), although there may also be an argument that the transfer to the US is not the only way in which these obligations could be carried out. \nWhat should we do now? \nThe Information Commissioners Office (“ Although employers will want to look into alternative options for transfer, none is failsafe. A better pragmatic option is likely to look at limiting transfers of the most sensitive employee personal data and wait for consistent guidance from the national Data Protection Commissioners — and for the EU and the US to finally agree a new Safe Harbour framework, which was under negotiation even before this ECJ decision. This may however not be achievable in practice. \nExtension of shared parental leave and pay to working grandparents \nThe UK Chancellor has announced that shared parental leave and pay will be extended to working grandparents. This will increase flexibility and choice in parental leave arrangements for working parents. \nNew FCA and PRA whistleblowing rules \nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have issued new policy statements on whistleblowing. The new rules aim to encourage a culture in which individuals feel able to raise concerns, for example requiring employers to establish an internal whistleblowing channel and expressly stating in settlement agreements and employmeblow the whistle. The new rules apply to deposit-takers with over £250 million in assets, PRA-designated firms and insurers subject to the Solvency II Directive among others. The rules come into force on 7 September 2016, other than the requirement to appoint a senior manager as a “whistleblowers’ champion” which comes into force on 7 March 2016. \nNew rules relating to employee representation in France \nA new law on employee representation was recently published in France (Loi Rebsamen of 17 August 2015), however many measures of the law were subject to the publication of regulations, known as implementation Decrees. The French government has now announced these Decrees will be published from this month to as far as March 2016. Further rules on the recording and drafting of minutes of meetings will be issued, and more importantly the Decrees will regulate how soon the Works Council must issue an opinion to close the consultation when there are several co-existing works councils, a thorny area of employment law in France.
