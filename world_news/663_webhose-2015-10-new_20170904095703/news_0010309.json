They subsequently assaulted two Tesla employees on their way out. They refused to share their identities when approached by a Tesla employee, both were wearing Reno Gazette Journal ID badges and turned out to be journalists. A second Tesla employee, this time a safety manager, also approached the journalists and asked them to wait as the Sheriffâ€™s Department had been called. They decided to disregard this request and headed back to the Jeep they had arrived in. The Tesla employees followed. As one was trying to note down the license plate the driver reversed into him. The second employee approached the Jeep as it started to drive away, with the driver deciding to accelerate and hit him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:28:33.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
