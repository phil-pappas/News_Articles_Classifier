The advisory council for mining is an international group of key mining organizations, represented by their CIOs. Established 15 years ago, the group meets in person once a year in a country where mining is a key industry. This is the third time that this global group has met in South Africa . Mining companies see digital technology as a key enabler in reinventing business processes that will support efficient operations and sustainable growth. They look to it to support excellence in safety, health, environment, risk and quality (SHERQ); mutually beneficial relationships with local and national communities and ultimately surpass stakeholder expectations. A wide range of digital technology is being discussed, including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data, enterprise mobility, autonomy, geo-sensing, analytics and 3D printing. The mining companies will share examples of digital transformation projects that use SAP® software and services, which are increasing productivity, increasing satisfaction of customers' end users, enabling new business models and providing more ways to drive efficiency.
