To ensure the superior performance,every monoclonal antibody is validated according to the scientific findings and the medical records of related diseases. Major applications of validation include Western Blot, Immunohistochemical staining with over 25 types of normal and cancer human tissues, Immunocytochemistry / Immunofluorescence, and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting. Some commonly used alternative diagnostic antibodies perform well in applications but cross-react with other unrelated proteins.This cross-reactivity may potentially cause unexpected side effects and generate false diagnostic reports for clinicians. By contrast, each UltraMAB is validated, and determined to have no cross reactivity with other human proteins other than the antibodyâ€™s intended target protein as determined by analysis on a 10K High Density Protein Microarray Platform. Consequently, each monoclonal antibody is quality control verified, guaranteeing superior performance for applications,where specificity-verification and the highest quality antibodies are critical for accurate detection. AMSBIO antibodies are available in affordable small trial sample packs. All antibodies are guaranteed to work, or your money back. A free trial size HA-antibody is supplied with every primary UltraMAB antibody.
