Each telehealth visit reflects an interaction between a board-certified, state-licensed physician and a patient in need of health care via video, phone or online. \n“Hitting our 1 millionth visit underscores the growing adoption and utilization of telehealth services across the country,” said Jason Gorevic, Teladoc chief executive officer. “This Teladoc milestone is evidence of the value we deliver and the confidence our employers, members, physicians and hospital systems have in our ability to provide quality health care where and when people need it most.” \nIn addition to being the first telehealth provider to conduct 1 million physician visits, Teladoc also counts among its industry “firsts” as being the first and largest telehealth platform, and the first and only telehealth company to be certified by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for its physician credentialing process. \n“As the nation continues to face growing health care challenges, employers, providers and patients are seeking innovative solutions to mounting health care costs and challenges accessing timely care,” said Krista Drobac of the Alliance for Connected Care. “Teladoc's one millionth telehealth visit represents a milestone for the growth in patient access to this important technology.” \nTeladoc helps resolve common, non-emergency issues and offers behavioral health, dermatological, tobacco cessation and sexual health services. Teladoc maintains a 92 percent medical resolution rate and a 95 percent patient satisfaction rate. \nAccording to the National Business Group on Health, 74 percent of large employers are expected to offer telemedicine in 2016 compared to 48 percent in 2015 and only 28 percent in 2014. \nHuntington Ingalls Industries (HII), America's largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of manufacturing, engineering and management services to the nuclear energy, oil and gas markets, is among the growing number of Teladoc clients and large employers who are realizing the benefits of telehealth. Seeing the value that Teladoc brings to an increasingly complex health care environment, HII rolled out the Teladoc platform in July 2014 for more than 13,000 employees in an effort to help their employees and their families get convenient, affordable medical care. \n“Our success as a company is tied to the health and safety of our employees and their families. This is why the health and welfare of our entire HII family is a primary focus for us,” said Bill Ermatinger, HII’s corporate vice president for human resources. “When it came time for us to add telemedicine as a component of our health care offerings that offers the best and most scalable solution to meet our employees’ health care needs, Teladoc was the clear choice. Not only have their telehealth services delivered exceptional care for our employees, it has proven to be a great investment in our workforce.” \nThe decision provided employees 24/7 access – including nights, weekends and holidays – to more than 2,000 physicians and behavioral health specialists. In addition to saving Huntington Ingalls Industries $483,005 in health care and productivity costs, their employees are delighted with the Teladoc program and reported a 97 percent “good” or “excellent” rating for their Teladoc physician. \nAbout Teladoc \nTeladoc, Inc.
