Unified Origin wraps the platform specific solutions available for MPEG-DASH, Apple (HTTP Live Streaming), Adobe (HTTP Dynamic Streaming) and Microsoft (Smooth Streaming) into one. \nThe big advantage of this way of working, says Unified Streaming, is that companies can be flexible, keep a short time-to-market and be cost-effective. Furthermore it is said to eliminate massive storage needs supporting new video formats and DRM flavours — such as Marlin, PlayReady, Widevine and Fairplay — and prevent companies from having to re-encode their entire catalogue when a new format or device enters the market. \n\"By using Azure, we are able to reach a wide variety of customers with our digital content delivery solution, Unified Origin. It's easy to use within Azure and accessible both technologically and financially,\" says Simon Westbroek, VP Global sales of Unified Streaming . \n\"We are happy to offer Unified Origin in Azure. It offers customers a high performance solution to stream their content efficiently in every format, to any screen,\" added Venkat Gattemneni, group product marketing manager, Microsoft Azure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:53:15.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
