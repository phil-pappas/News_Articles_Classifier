However, the current discussion often focuses on the wrong things. \n\"This is not a technology problem. The technology we need already exists, but the challenge will persist if policymakers continue to focus on minimum bar sets of variables as a way to define interoperability,\" Dr. Patterson said. \"Instead, we should demand and enforce how healthcare technologies must communicate: the specific vocabularies, document types and transport mechanisms that all vendors, especially EMR vendors, should be required to accept both inbound and outbound to access all data and rules. If we can clear that hurdle, then we will see a wave of workflow innovation that improves lives for caregivers and consumers.\" \nDr. Patterson added that events like NHIT Week can keep the dialogue going and move all parties – patients, providers, payers and vendors – toward a solution that puts improved patient care first. \n\"Ths movement needs to be driven by consumers and healthcare providers, in a way that forces siloed industry players to rethink their approach,\" Dr. Patterson added. \"There is room for all when we collectively focus on care collaboration, and patients will reap the benefits.\" \nLaunched in 2006 by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), NHIT Week positions health IT as part of the overall solution to improve healthcare as a bipartisan, federally led, market-driven initiative. In 2014, 440 organizations participated in NHIT Week. \nTweet This: #NHITweek starts today; partner @AirStripmHealth calls for focus on eliminating #interoperability barriers http://bit.ly/12a91UT \nAbout AirStrip \nAirStrip® ( www.airstrip.com ) provides a complete, vendor- and data source-agnostic enterprise-wide clinical mobility solution, which enables clinicians to improve the health of individuals and populations.
