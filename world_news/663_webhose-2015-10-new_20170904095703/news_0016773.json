It had made legal claims against VimpelCom, Altimo Holdings & Investments Ltd., and Altimo Cooperatief U.A. but will now withdraw them. \nBoard chairman Svein Aaser says the minority position \"without the possibility to fully control the company, has been challenging\" and that sale of its stake was best for its shareholders. A timeframe for the sale has not been set. \nTelenor said it will now focus on its core operations. \nVimpelCom is has its headquarters in Amsterdam, Netherlands. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
