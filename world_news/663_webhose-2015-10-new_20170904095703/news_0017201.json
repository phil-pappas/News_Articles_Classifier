Toronto is one of the company’s fastest-growing North American markets and is among its 10 biggest cities in the Americas, Ian Black, Uber’s general manager for Canada, said Wednesday.\nChanging Landscape Toronto Mayor John Tory led the call to devise new rules instead of treating Uber like a traditional taxi service. Tory argued that it’s unrealistic to use existing regulations to govern companies that use smartphone applications to connect riders and drivers.\n“An attempt to ban Uber will not put the genie back in the bottle,” he said during the debate.\nA poll by Nanos Research earlier this week said 76 percent of Toronto residents support new rules that regulate UberX while allowing it to operate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:28:20.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
