Credit: University of Wollongong \nThe ability to arrange different types of fibres with predetermined spatial organisation gives us the colour, vibrancy and comfort we encounter in traditional textiles. \nReplace conventional fibres with those that can conduct electricity and we introduce new dimensions. We introduce the ability to monitor human movement using wearable garments, and even to store the energy required to power such a function. ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science (ACES) researchers have created new fibre structures and used traditional knitting and braiding techniques to introduce both of these capabilities to wearable structures. \nA knitted textile based on the polymeric composite fibres, produced at the Australian National Fabrication Facility, is highly sensitive, stable and able to detect a wide range of human movement . \nThe team demonstrated a working device with remote sensing capabilities using a knee sleeve prototype of the fabric that 'talks' to a commercial wireless receiver.These fibres are not only stretchable but also conduct electricity. This combination of properties allows the fibres to respond to body movement. \nFor energy storage the materials that make up a battery have been braided into appropriate arrangements to deliver energy storage capabilities. \nACES Director Gordon Wallace said an interdisciplinary approach to the research was crucial to the team's success. \n\"These advances are made possible by the combination of skills that ARC Centres of Excellence bring together to tackle challenging areas,\" he said.
