It will help small-to-midsized companies improve efficiency of bringing on new hires, without any need for integration or importing/exporting. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150212/175218LOGO \nSurveys show that up to 25 percent of U.S. workers are newcomers to their positions and are engaged in some type of onboarding process. Employee performance, satisfaction and retention often depend on how quickly and effectively they have been oriented and socialized into the company's administration and culture. First tasks for new employees generally include a hand-cramping number of forms to fill out for human resources, accounting and other departments. \nNew hires, managers and human resource departments will love the efficiency, accuracy and flexibility provided by iSolved's new onboarding innovation. This addition is native to Infinisource's human capital management solution and fully optimizes the way HR departments handle employee paperwork. \nSince iSolved Onboarding is native to the system, all data is shared to other portions of the platform, including payroll, HR, and time tracking. The Onboarding module notifies the appropriate personnel and takes new hires through all of the necessary tasks and forms that are part of a proper company orientation. New employees can enter their information directly online as they are guided through necessary steps. \nEmails will also automatically generate within iSolved Onboarding to notify each person within the process to complete necessary steps. Like other iSolved components, Onboarding offers an array of flexible configuration options, including: a wizard feature, multiple templates, and approval layers. \n\"Having Onboarding functionality built within the iSolved HCM platform delivers a seamless solution for human resources departments and hiring managers, and enhances the experience for employees,\" said Todd La Fever, President of Technology at Infinisource. \"With such a high demand for an improved way to track and manage new hires, our new Onboarding module simplifies the process and eliminates the burdensome paperwork.\" \niSolved Onboarding helps avoid the bottlenecks often associated with bringing on new employees. The system's workflow automation enables easy implementation, collection, tracking and storage of all forms and documents. \n­­About iSolved \niSolved is Infinisource's comprehensive human capital management solution for payroll, time, benefits and HR that manages an employer's most important asset -- their people.
