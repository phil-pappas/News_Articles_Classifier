The theme is, \"Advancing transportation with connectivity, automation, intelligence and electrification.\" \nConnected vehicles use wireless modems and sensors to connect and communicate with things like road infrastructure and systems, the cloud and other vehicles. Current technologies include speed-control accident avoidance, automated parallel parking, lane departure warning and lane keeping assist. Future capabilities include autonomous self-driving vehicles. \nThe wide variety of learning opportunities available at ICCVE include industry forums, keynote addresses, tutorials, technical sessions, demos, exhibits, problem-solving workshops and executive summits. Discounted registrations are available through 16 October. http://www.cvent.com/d/1rqvtc \nSession titles include, among others: -- \"Emerging Technologies & Disruptive Innovations for Connected & Automated Vehicles\" -- \"Cybersecurity in Vehicles & Transportation Systems\" -- \"Connected Vehicles vs. Fully Autonomous Vehicles -- the Road Operator View\" -- \"Enabling Standards for Connected & Automated Vehicles\" -- \"Transition from Conventional Driving to Automated Driving\" -- \"Sustainable Transport in the Autonomous Vehicles Environment\" -- \"New Energy Vehicles & Infrastructure\" -- \"Policy & Government Support for Connected & Automated Vehicles\" \nFor more on the program, see http://www.iccve.org/2015/index.html?page=PROGRAM . \nMany of the top speakers in the world of connected and automated vehicles, including information and communications technology professionals, will present their findings and vision for the future.
