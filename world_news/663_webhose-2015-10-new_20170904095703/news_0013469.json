That’s why our R&D team’s recent success in developing an IF-WS2 water dispersion is truly groundbreaking.” says Rick. “This water based product’s ability to reach 800kg in EP Weld Load in 4-Ball tests, with as little as 1.5% of our fullerene like tungsten disulfide nano particle powder concentrate is incredible. This, combined with our traditional oil based metalworking product line, puts us in a unique position to spearhead the change.\n“As the industry is changing due to new environmental friendly regulations, we are confident that we will be able to provide customers with even better metalworking fluids, as chlorinated paraffin use becomes more restricted. This was very evident in the response I got when presenting this to several leading players in the recently held ILMA 5th International Conference on Metal Removal Fluids.\n“I am very happy to be part of Nanotech Industrial Solutions and the truly innovative technology that we bring to the lubricant industry,” concludes Rick.\nRick is NIS’s Director of Regional Sales and can be contacted for the test results and more details via NIS’s sales department at sales(at)nisusacorp(dot)com.\nAbout Nanotech Industrial Solutions Inc.\nNanotech Industrial Solutions is the manufacturer of NanoLub®, an innovative nano lubricant based on inorganic particles of fullerene-like tungsten disulfide. These revolutionary particles were first developed in 1992 by Prof. Reshef Tenne at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The technology is exclusively licensed to Nanotech Industrial Solutions for commercialization Worldwide. NIS has attracted the best minds in the fields of nano technology, chemistry, and various targeted industry applications like lubricating oils, greases, coatings, metal working fluids, polymers and composites. NIS's global corporate office, commercialization R&D lab, manufacturing, blending and packaging facilities are located in Avenel, NJ.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13032349.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13032349.htm"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:20:33.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
