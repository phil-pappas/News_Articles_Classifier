Don’t be sad be happy for me, my pain ends. Please remember the good things I did, not my mistakes. Sorry!!”\nNews.com.au attempted to contact Mr Munday and several of his family members without success. His phone numbers appear to have been disconnected and his email addresses have been disabled.\n There have been no death notices or obituaries and it remains unclear whether Mr Munday followed through with his tragic plan.\nPolice from Fairfield in Sydney’s south west yesterday assigned a team of officers to visit Mr Munday’s last known addresses to check on his welfare after being alerted to his suicidal posts by news.com.au.\nSoulmates: Michael Munday with his ex-wife Melissa (surname withheld) before she left him.

Don&apos;t be sad be happy for me, my pain ends. Please remember me for the good things I did, not my mistakes. Sorry!!!\n— Michael Munday RIP (@michaelmunday) October 17, 2015 I wish I could die more than once to show you how sorry I am. Sorry for my real sins, not the sins I was blamed for which I am innocent of.\n— Michael Munday RIP (@michaelmunday) October 17, 2015 I was so lucky to have met you let alone share my life with you for so long. I tried so hard I promise you, it is NOT your fault my Angel.\n— Michael Munday RIP (@michaelmunday) October 17, 2015 Mr Munday had claimed Melissa walked out on their three-year marriage in 2014 after his chronic gambling habit left the couple in financial ruin.\nHe posted endless tributes and apologies to her under the #michaellovesmelissa hashtag, calling himself a changed man and begging her to come back to him.\n“The campaign was prompted to let Melissa know that I was sorry, and that this was not simply more words, but shows action,” Mr Munday told the Huffington Post at the time.\n“She deserved more than a simple apology. I hope people can see this for what it is, an attempt at the world’s biggest apology, for mistakes I made that led to hurting the person I care about most in this world.”\nBut the campaign started to backfire early on when people started questioning the hopeless romantic tag, labelling Mr Munday’s actions “stalkerish”, “intimidating” and even “terrifying”.\nControversial feminist Clementine Ford called him “creepy” and “obsessed”.\n“Wow. Stop stalking her dude. Get over it,” she tweeted.\n@michaelmunday Wow. Stop stalking her dude. Get over it.\n— Clementine Ford (@clementine_ford) April 14, 2015 Mr Munday acknowledged the criticism in an email to Mamamia, admitting some people had called his “actions creepy, stalking, or inappropriate,” but stressed they were a minority.\n“If for one second I thought that this would have any negative effect on Melissa it would be stopped in a second. It is not and was never my intention to make Melissa uncomfortable, or feel coerced, and I know this is not the case,” he said, according to Mamamia’s article headlined Creepy or cute?\n“Melissa is aware of the campaign. I hope to speak with her in more detail when the time is right, although being away from her is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, it’s important to give her space and time to think about what she wants.\n“I have had so many people reach out to me offering support. I have had the pleasure of hearing other peoples stories, and speaking with those in similar situations.”\nIronically, Mr Munday has himself been the target of at least two online campaigns by people accusing him of defrauding dozens of former customers of his now defunct computer supplies company Yadnum.\nOne alleged victim, using the Twitter handle @EadeEarth, stepped up his demands for Mr Munday to return his cash after #Michaellovesmelissa temporarily catapulted him into the spotlight.\nIt is understood the allegations were investigated by police in 2011 but no charges were laid.\nBelow are some of Munday’s tributes to Melissa.\nDo you know Michael Munday? marnie.oneill@news.com.au\nIf you or someone you know is in need of crisis or suicide prevention support, please call Lifeline on 13 11 14 or visit www.lifeline.org.au/gethelp\nI knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I love you my Angel #MichaelLovesMelisssa #Love pic.twitter.com/yS1HrMOWsc\n— Michael Munday RIP (@michaelmunday) October 12, 2015 Goodnight my Angel sweet dreams.
