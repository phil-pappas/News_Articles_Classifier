The board of control approved the contract Thursday. \nThe properties are the former State Chevrolet, between Olive Street and Strausbaugh Avenue, and the former Barrett Cadillac, between Linden Avenue and Sycamore Street, said Abigail Beniston, the city’s code-enforcement and blight-remediation specialist. \nThe two were among a group of new-car dealerships known as the Wick Six. As the area deteriorated, the dealerships left with the last one leaving in the early 1990s. \nThe city took ownership at no cost of the State and Barrett properties, leasing them to other businesses over the years, but they are now vacant. \nThe buildings at the two properties are in poor condition, Beniston said. Testing done earlier this year found asbestos and other hazardous materials in the buildings, he added. \nThe cost of cleanup and demolition is $600,000 to $700,000 if there are no underground tanks containing hazardous materials, said Charles Shasho, deputy director of the city’s public-works department. \nDemolition is expected next year, Beniston said. \n“We want to find potential businesses interested in developing those properties,” Beniston said. \nMost of the other Wick Six buildings have been demolished by private contractors. \nAlso, the board of control agreed to give a $20,000 grant to the Sterling-McCullough Williams Funeral Home on Belmont Avenue. \nThe business is installing a decorative iron fence with pillars, adding lighting and landscaping at a cost of $53,000. \nSterling Williams told the city’s Design Review Committee in July the work was needed to help stop illegal activity in the funeral home’s parking lot and near it. The activity, he said, included drug sales and use, prostitution and public drunkenness.
