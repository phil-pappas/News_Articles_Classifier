By Jay Greene Seattle Times business reporter \nSolid financial results on Thursday pushed stocks to heights not seen in 15 years for Microsoft or ever for Amazon. \nAmazon.com shares opened at $617.68 Friday morning, the day after reporting a surprising profit on the strength of its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services. It traded above $600 for most of the day before closing at $599.03, up $35.12, or 6.2 percent. \nMicrosoft shares jumped from the opening bell as well, climbing over $50 for the first time since 2000. Shareholders bought up the stock on a higher-than-expected profit during its fiscal first quarter, buoyed by the sales of business-infrastructure tools. Microsoft shares ended the day at $52.87, up $4.84, or 10.1 percent. \nThe stock gains added more than $16 billion to Amazon’s market capitalization, to $280.16 billion, and nearly $40 billion to Microsoft’s total share value, to $423.73 billion, according to YCharts.com.
