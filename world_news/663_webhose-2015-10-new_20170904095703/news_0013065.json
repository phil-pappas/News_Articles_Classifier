Jens Drewes, President of Northern Asia with global logistics company Kuehne-Nagel  said: “That’s more than the value of (Chinese) exports in 2013” and added that to pay for the massive initiative, which builds on the government’s effort to shift manufacturing inland from the coast, China has made more than 65 loan commitments since 2013, totalling $50 billion.\nJohn Lin, deputy director of the Policy and Law Research Centre of Shanghai International Shipping, said: “The central government is trying to kill two birds with one stone.
