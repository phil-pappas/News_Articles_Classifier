But a much larger biodiversity is necessary for us to survive. \nWe have had many hints in the past about life existing in dormant conditions, waiting to burst out with the slightest prodding. Twenty five years ago, NASA suggested specialised niche ones, evaporites which are areas of crystalized brine that would be dry in nature but the water in the form of hydrated crystals would still allow the bacteria to grow. The 2003 study that found in the gypsum flats of Guerrero Negro microbial life living in stasis, just waiting to be awoken with water. \nThe above microbial life can clearly survive in brine. But, studies in the arid environments such as the Atacama Desert in Chile also proved their survival abilities in those harsh climates. Algae, fungi and microbes are all capable to inhibiting these arid conditions.

Similarly, on Mars, these species would need higher humidity and oxygen levels. This can be achieved using technology already known to exist such as the Mars In-Situ Propellant Production precursor . Cultivating these species on the South pole, which has a rich supply of oxygen would help create a thick atmosphere by increasing the oxygenation rates. \nThe above is all on the surface and we also need to concentrate below by peeling of the layers. Even as early as 1970 , researchers have known microbes can survive under the soil in a form of stasis, proven by the subsurface of the Atacama Desert. By getting down into the dirt, we may be able to find these creatures and allow them to interact with the now replenished niche zones to increase biodiversity. \nNow will this work practically? We have an experiment to prove that it just might click. A Chinese team of researchers performed the experiment in the Gurbantonggut Desert hinterlands of Eurasia, back in 1990, when they started using a combination of irrigation and fertilizer to plant winter wheat for a period of 20 years. In the end the region of plantation, and the surrounding untreated desert land were compared. As expected, there was great difference of biodiversity both the samples. What was even more surprising was how the change occurred not only at the topsoil level but also in the subsurface. \nThus there is hope of a properly functioning microbial niche environment of Mars in the foreseeable future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:26:56.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
