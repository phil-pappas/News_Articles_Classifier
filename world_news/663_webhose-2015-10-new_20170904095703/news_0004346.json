Tableau Software logo www.tableausoftware.com. <-  <- stripped tags -> SEATTLE   Today, at AWS re:Invent, Tableau, a global leader in rapid-fire, easy-to-use business analytics software, announced new integrations with Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed to provide expanded choice for customers as they adopt cloud analytics solutions. These new integrations include a connector for Amazon Aurora as well as the launch of Tableau Server listings in AWS Marketplace. The Amazon Aurora connector is Tableau's third direct connector for AWS. Tableau also includes direct connectors for Amazon Redshift and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). Additionally, Tableau connects to the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), which gives customers access to the capabilities of MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or PostgreSQL relational database management systems running in the AWS Cloud. The new Tableau connector for Amazon Aurora adds yet another option for customers to rapidly perform visual analytics for AWS database services. \"Amazon Aurora is a MySQL-compatible, relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases,\" said Anurag Gupta , Vice President, Database Services, Amazon Web Services, Inc. \"Tableau's ability to connect directly to Amazon Aurora gives customers additional options for answering analytical data questions to drive well-informed business decisions.\" Tableau also announced the availability of Tableau Server in the AWS Marketplace. The new pay-as-you-go option enables organizations to quickly deploy Tableau Server to any AWS region in minutes. Tableau's user bundles for AWS Marketplace, available in 10, 25, 50, and 100 seat configurations, can be launched to run on optimally sized Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Instance types giving users flexibility based on the scope of their analytics project. The new hourly priced option is in addition to the previously available bring-your-own-license listing for Tableau Server in AWS Marketplace. \"Our new integrations with AWS make it easier and faster than ever for businesses to deploy and manage Tableau Server,\" said Dan Jewett , Vice President of Product Management at Tableau. \"Whether an organization is looking to deploy an always-on, full-service platform, or if they want to pay only for the time they use on a project-by-project basis, companies now have more ways to explore, analyze, and collaborate with their data â€“ with the security, speed, and ease-of-use they expect from Tableau.\" Learn more about Tableau's integrations with AWS by visiting Tableau's AWS page: [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdWRHRmliR1ZoZFM1amIyMHZRVzFoZW05dUxWZGxZaTFUWlhKMmFXTmxjeTlOWVhKclpYUndiR0ZqWlZ3aUlISmxiRDFjSW01dlptOXNiRzkzWENJZ2RHRnlaMlYwUFZ3aVgySnNZVzVyWENJK2FIUjBjRG92TDNkM2R5NTBZV0pzWldGMUxtTnZiUzlCYldGNmIyNHRWMlZpTFZObGNuWnBZMlZ6TDAxaGNtdGxkSEJzWVdObFBDOWhQZz09fA==]].
