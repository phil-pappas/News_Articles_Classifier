Youmi said it was working with Apple to resolve the issue.\nResearchers with a U.S. security company, SourceDNA, said Sunday they had discovered 256 apps involved in the data collection, all of which had used software produced by Youmi. Together, the apps had been downloaded roughly one million times, SourceDNA said in a blog post. It said the apps' developers, most of whom were located in China, likely weren't aware of the problem.\nApple said in a statement the collection of personal data was a violation of the company's security and privacy guidelines, and that any new apps submitted to the App Store using Youmi's software development kit would be rejected. \"We are working closely with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in compliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly,\" it said. Apple declined to say how many apps it had taken down.\nThe breach is the second China-related App Store security vulnerability revealed in the past month. In September, Apple removed dozens of the most popular Chinese-language iOS apps after security researchers discovered they had been infected by malicious software, dubbed XcodeGhost, that was embedded in a version of Apple's developer tool kit. In both cases, the infected apps appear to have slipped past Apple's security review process.\nIn the most recent breach, compromised apps collected user data by using a software communication system called a private application-programming interface, or private API, according to SourceDNA. The use of private APIs in iOS apps is banned by Apple.\nYoumi developers appear to have begun experimenting with extracting data through this method almost two years ago, according to the security company. \"Given how simple this obfuscation is and how long the apps have been available that have it, we're concerned other published apps may be using different but related approaches to hide their malicious behavior,\" SourceDNA said in its blog post.\nIn a longer statement released later Tuesday, Youmi said it respected privacy rules and had never collected users' personally identifiable information. The aim of the software in question was to protect advertisers and developers against fraud. \"It's not a 'security breach' as some one-sided media have reported,\" the statement said.\nYoumi lists on its website a number of China's biggest Internet companies as its clients, including Taobao, an online marketplace run by New York-listed e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. A Taobao spokeswoman said the service's iOS app doesn't use Youmi's software.\nYoumi's website appeared to go offline on Tuesday afternoon in what Youmi spokeswoman Ping Jie called a malicious attack. The company didn't know who was behind the attack and was attempting to restore its website, Ms. Ping said.\nThe advertising company said it would compensate owners of apps that were taken down by Apple.\nYang Jie contributed to this article.\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nOctober 20, 2015 07:03 ET (11:03 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:06:14.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
