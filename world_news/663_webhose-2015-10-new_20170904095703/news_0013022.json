After she learns a new skill, the astronauts can give her a “to-do” list for her to complete in order. \nAILA is attached to a six-wheeled platform to increase mobility and efficiency. Just like humans, she has two arms with fingers so she can interact with items on the space station (since it was built for humans to use). AILA will be able to perform small tasks such as activating or deactivating switches in a certain order and rotating the handwheel. \nSO WHAT DO YOU THINK? \nWill this new technology prove beneficial to astronauts? Should there be concerns about safety and accuracy? \nEmail us or leave your comments below. \nTune in every weekday for your next Manufacturing Minute.
