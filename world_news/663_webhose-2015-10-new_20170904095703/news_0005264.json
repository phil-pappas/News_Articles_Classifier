This comes as research by IDC, commissioned by Actifio, has found many enterprises are still struggling to control their critical data, with two-thirds of enterprises failing to meet best practice standards for data control. \nActifio’s Virtual Data Pipeline ™ technology provides a holistic approach to data management that enables large organizations to capture data directly from production applications, manage a single “golden master” copy of that data in their most secure environment, and then use virtual copies to maintain both accessibility and control. \nThe use of a copy data virtualization platform severely limits the proliferation and availability of physical data copies, when data is both at rest and being moved or migrated between production and non-production environments, generations of hardware, data centers or cloud infrastructure. Most importantly, copy data virtualization decreases the number of targets available to those with harmful intent. \nKeeping enterprise data both safe and accessible is a complex balancing act made all the more difficult by the geometric growth rate of production data. When coupled with conventional data protection programs and a siloed approach to copy data creation, the result is an unintended and uncontrolled proliferation of “rogue copies” of sensitive data. This data is difficult to keep track of, let alone protect. Organizations and individual users dissatisfied with the responsiveness of infrastructure and operations can often lead to ‘shadow IT’ operations that contain such rogue copies. Each added physical copy increases the “surface area of attack” for this data, creating additional opportunities for the wrong people to get access to confidential or personally identifiable information of clients. \nThe problem still persists throughout the vast majority of enterprises, despite well publicized high-profile security breaches or data leaks. This is illustrated by the results of a recent survey conducted by leading analyst firm IDC, summarized in a new white paper commissioned by Actifio. The white paper, entitled “ Common Gaps in Data Control: Identifying, Quantifying, and Solving Them Using Best Practices ” found: Two-thirds of enterprises fail to meet best practice standards for data control and few are likely to be consistent across the full spectrum of data security policies 77 percent of surveyed organizations fail to mask sensitive data during the test/development phase, which significantly increases the threat of a data breach Government performs best overall at implementing data control policies; the Education sector is the weakest The CIO is central to the implementation of data control/security policies – policies are only applied on an ad-hoc basis 34 percent of the time A typical organization holds 375 data copies, with each copy carrying sensitive information and therefore an increased risk of attack \nThe Actifio-commissioned white paper contains insights from a survey of senior executives at 429 mid-to-large scale enterprises across five industry sectors – Government, Financial, Education, Healthcare and Retail, and focuses on current trends related to data access, management, masking, copy proliferation and tracking.

Organizations need solutions that can automate copy data management and subsequently reduce risk and cost in the enterprise and public sector environments; manual efforts are simply insufficient.” \nThe enterprise copy data access problem is simply too large and broad for IT organizations to handle manually. By 2018, IDC estimates copy data will cost IT organizations $50.63 billion and currently consumes up to 60 percent of the IT storage hardware and infrastructure budget. \n“The truth is most companies have no idea how many copies of a given data set are floating around in their infrastructure or in the cloud,” said Ash Ashutosh, CEO of Actifio. “If you don’t know how many copies you have you don’t know where they are, and if you don’t know where they are you can’t tell who has access to them. Actifio gives customers a single system of record to take control of their secondary data, and more and more CIOs are taking a proactive approach to reduce the threat of exposure.” \nActifio can help business obtain the outcomes they seek in relation to data management control: Secure and stable operations Auditability & smart threat alerts Business risk, disruption and recovery protection \nFor more information on Actifio’s capabilities for data control as part of a copy data solution, download this Data Control Solution Brief , which details best practices as well as security features incorporated into Actifio’s solutions. \nAbout Actifio \nActifio virtualizes the data that’s the lifeblood of businesses in more than 30 countries around the world.
