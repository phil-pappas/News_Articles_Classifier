Ordinary mortals prepare to hang up the boots at 60. Arpana sprang a surprise for art lovers in her recent show “Crossing 60” by showcasing works that offered a different visual experience. The usual large canvases she has come to be associated with were missing. Instead, 105 works, mostly on paper made over the last few decades, and a few etchings filled the studio walls. She prefers her maturing world to be viewed in smaller frames. But the world of her art remains as large and encompassing as ever. The conflict between the two world views continues to grow. The cruelty of man towards man and nature; communal and gender violence, the twisted lives of Vrindavan widows along with the trees twisted in waiting, contrast the realm of her more esoteric works. These frames deal with the deeper quests in life; eternal love and compassion. Only, the scale is reduced which lends the works a touch of femininity and intimacy. Material like lace, embroidered panels, sequins, etc. enclose the larger world of violence, conflict, blood and destruction in a womanly embrace. In the world of Arpana’s myths, flowers fill the tools of violence like gun, instead of cartridges, and though broken, Sohini’s pot gives an impression of strength, carved with her power of love. And, the weight carried over the head of a woman turns into a crescent moon! Time is a recurrent motif in her works, and she uses not only time but also space with great economy. At 61, she says, “It feels great with all the freedom aging brings”, which is evident through the exhibits. The spectrum of her art springs from the perpetual conflict that goes on between the world we are doomed to live in and the world of her dreams. While she longs for a more compassionate world and love that grows beyond measure, such a world she realises is found only in legends and myths. But it is here that she dwells with her heart and soul. The outer world — of injustices, communal violence, destruction and broken relationships co-exits with the world of myths. But it is in the quest and yearning of the mystic that her most lyrical figurations take place. In awe of the immeasurable love of legends like Sohini Mahiwal, the love and compassion of the Sufis, of the Buddha, Nanak and Kabir enchant her. A mysterious thread she holds on to traverses through her world of creativity, connecting the unfathomable to the apparent, the source from where the colours and motifs claim her canvas. In both kinds of works; the response to her outer environment as well the experiences of her inner world, Arpana never lets go of her aesthetic economy. And though the dualities and opposites are juxtaposed, these never seem to lose their rhythm. There is a constant play between the two, what we call leela, which compels the viewer to participate and experience the rasa. Humans can see a reality but artists imagine it afresh to offer an alternative to the reality experienced by humanity. Therein lies the power of art in a social context, it makes society hold its pulse, especially in a society that loves to annihilate itself. In this context, her works acquire greater significance. Arpana Caur held her first solo show in 1975, and one of her very early works was bought by none other than the legendary M F Husain. Those familiar with her early works know, the conflict between the two world views was present in her works from the very beginning, only the expression used to be very direct in her early works. Works like “Sheltered Woman”, and “Missing Audience”, which shows a musician playing to empty chairs reflects the plight of the artists of the time, it also had a sense of irony. In her long artistic journey, she has improved upon her style by taking elements from the folk art forms and incorporated the element of architecture in her works from the miniature art. The result is evident in the success of her works, celebrated across globe. Now showing at the Academy of Fine Arts and Literature, Siri Fort in New Delhi “Beyond 60” will be shown at Kolkata and Mumbai later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:54:46.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
