The Rockstar Tucson will be joined at the upcoming SEMA Show by an even more equipped Tucson: the Adventuremobile. This Tucson not only rides over any terrain in its path (or at least more terrain than the average Tucson), but it stays the night and does it all again the next day. \nWe can't say we were surprised not seeing a lot of Tucsons mixed in with the land-conquering expedition vehicles of Overland Expo West 2015 . But maybe if Southern California tuner John Pangilinan had completed his Adventuremobile before the show's May start date, the Tucson would have stormed Arizona and held its own in the mud. \nGiven that Hyundai's press release mentions the \"occasional off-road excursion,\" the Adventuremobile will probably be more comfortable at SEMA than out in the mud. The crossover's upgrades start on the ground, where a new set of Toyo Open Country A/T II tires hug the RAYS Gram Lights 57DR wheels. A 1.5-in custom suspension lift gives the Tucson better capabilities in rolling over rocks, roots and other chassis-tearing hazards of off-road driving. The engine has extra power thanks to an AEM intake and charge pipe kit and Magnaflow exhaust system. \nThe most obvious upgrade stands tall on the high end of the build. The Treeline Tamarack Constellation Gen2 fold-out roof tent packs sleeping space for two so there's no need to race the vanishing rays in getting back to the pavement. One of Treeline's latest designs, the Tamarack Constellation Gen2 features a honeycomb aluminum base, oversized hinges able to accommodate stored bedding in the tent when folded, dual skylights, gear bags and even a \"unisex emergency urinal.\" Treeline Outdoors is among the outdoor manufacturers that have teamed up with Goal Zero on Solar Ready products , and the Adventuremobile's tent benefits from a Goal Zero Nomad 20 solar panel, Yeti 400 battery pack, Venture 30 charger and lighting. \nOther Adventuremobile upgrades include an Aries bull bar and side steps, Rigid Industries LED lights, and a TruckVault storage system with Trekpak dividers. The army green calipers on the Wilwood custom fabricated brake kit match the BASF paint applied by Strasse Sport , as do the seat belts inside. The audio system overhaul boasts an outdoor component in the included Scosche Boombottle+ . \nThe Tucson Adventuremobile will make its debut at the 2015 SEMA Show, which gets started on November 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:35:27.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
