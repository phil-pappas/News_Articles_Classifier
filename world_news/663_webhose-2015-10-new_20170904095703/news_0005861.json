Unlike Twitter, Facebook has been making money for years and its stock has more than doubled from its IPO price.\nIn contrast, Twitter's stock is barely above its IPO price of 26 US dollars nearly two years after its market debut.\nMr Dorsey should be highly motivated, given he owns a 3% stake in Twitter currently worth about 600 million dollars (£395 million).\nMr Dorsey might attempt to draw more traffic to Twitter and engage more people by lifting the 140-character limit that he originally imposed on tweets so they would fit under the restrictions imposed at that time on phone texting.\nSince Mr Dorsey became interim chief executive, Twitter has already tossed out the 140-character limit for private messages sent through Twitter.\nIncreasing the length of tweets, though, might alienate some of Twitter's most loyal and active users, who have embraced the 140-character limit as an exercise in eloquence.\nMr Dorsey must ensure that Twitter's steadily rising revenue begins to produce profits relatively soon.\nAlthough the company generated 938 million dollars (£617 million) in revenue during the first half of this year, Twitter still lost 299 million dollars (£196 million). That raised Twitter's total losses since its inception to 1.9 billion dollars (£1.25 billion).\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:16:49.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
