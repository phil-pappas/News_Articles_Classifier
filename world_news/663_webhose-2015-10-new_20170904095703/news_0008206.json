By sending money directly to a bank account, families can ensure loved ones affected by the storm still have access to their funds even if stores and agents are closed due to damage. \n\"Right now, our top priority is enabling family and friends the opportunity to provide monetary assistance to those who have been affected,\" said Pete Ohser, MoneyGram's executive vice president, U.S. and Mexico. \"We hope these efforts will make it a little easier for family members living in the U.S. to quickly provide their loved ones in Mexico with the funds they may need immediately, as well as aid in recovery efforts.\" \nMoneyGram is also making a $25,000 donation to AmeriCares to support immediate relief efforts. AmeriCares is providing supplies in affected areas to curb the spread of infectious disease due to poor sanitary conditions and unsafe water, and offering aid to families displaced by the storm. \nIn addition to the donation, MoneyGram is also offering zero-fee transactions for customers in the U.S. who want to make a financial gift to American Red Cross Disaster Relief through Nov. 30, 2015.
