( www.hbm.com ), a leading manufacturer of data acquisition systems, analysis and calibration software, strain gauges, transducers and sensors, introduces the DMP41 digital precision measuring instrument. With an accuracy class 0.0005 (or 5 ppm), it is the world's most precise amplifier for strain gauge-based sensor measurements. The new HBM unit provides such accuracy and excellent long-term stability that several national metrology institutes use the DMP41 as a reliable reference instrument for high-precision comparative measurements. \nNormally, high-precision instruments with this level of performance are limited for use only in controlled laboratory conditions. Now, however, the DMP41 is available in a 19\" rack-mount enclosure that is meticulously constructed to enable the instrument's use in environments with demanding EMC conditions, such as the production floor. Manufacturers of strain gauge-based sensors, such as force, torque and pressure transducers, load cells and flow rate sensors can now use the DMP41 to more precisely calibrate and adjust their sensors during production. Like its predecessor, the DMP41 can be ordered with either two or six measurement channels. \nThe DMP41 is the result of more than 30 years of innovation as part of the company’s DMP Series family of products. The units are known for outstanding stability and user-friendly functionality, such as touch screen interfaces. \nIn addition to the more rugged packaging, several other new features have been added to make it more useful in manufacturing. The patented background calibration feature, for example, allows the instrument to make measurements even while internal calibration of internal measurement channels is in progress. This increases test system throughput. \nThe user interface has also been improved. In addition to manual control via the integrated keyboard, users can now control the instrument via a touchscreen or PC. To connect the DMP41 to a PC, users can choose an Ethernet, USB or RS-232 interface. \nMore information can be found at http://www.hbm.com/en/menu/products/measurement-electronics-software/precision-measuring-instruments/dmp41/ or by contacting HBM at: \nHBM, Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:28:11.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
