PLYMOUTH, Mich. , Oct. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Burroughs, Inc ., As the industry leader in network check scanning technology, Burroughs, Inc. is pleased to announce the release of the SmartSource Expert Elite intelligent network check scanner. The SmartSource Expert Elite is the latest network scanner from the company that pioneered Ethernet connectivity with the SourceNDP scanner released in 1997 and the SmartSource Expert scanner released in 2007. Since then, Burroughs has deployed over 60,000 network scanners around the globe. The SmartSource Expert Elite scanner adds an Ethernet connection and built-in intelligence to the popular SmartSource Elite series platform and incorporates all of the features that make the Elite series an ideal check scanner for teller and remote deposit capture applications. In addition to an Ethernet connection, built-in intelligence enables the Expert Elite to perform all required image and MICR processing while maintaining rated throughput. \"The Expert Elite is another clear example of Burroughs' superior technology and on-going commitment to the global scanner market. Burroughs was the first to deliver a network check scanner nearly two decades ago and we are excited that the Expert Elite will enable more banks to deploy this technology as a key element of their future check deposit strategy,\" said Larry McCarter , Chief Executive Officer, Burroughs, Inc. Network scanners with built-in intelligence have an incredible advantage over USB scanners and network scanners lacking embedded processing, such as image processing, clean-up and compression, which greatly reduces network bandwidth requirements. Unlike a USB scanner, the Expert Elite is not tethered to a single computer and can be shared by multiple users. In addition, the Expert Elite can be easily deployed in a virtual desktop environment. Scanner installation is greatly simplified by eliminating the need to install a USB driver and API software. Simply connect the Expert Elite scanner to the client network and it is ready to go making it an ideal scanner for deployment in teller and remote deposit capture environments.
