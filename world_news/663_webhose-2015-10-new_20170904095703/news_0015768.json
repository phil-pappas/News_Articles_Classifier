( http://www.MachNation.com ), the only dedicated insight services and application development firm covering the future of the Internet of things (IoT) and connected device ecosystems, announces availability of a first-of-its-kind research publication. “MachNation has been providing our customers with industry-leading analysis and strategic support for their IoT initiatives,” said Steve Hilton, co-founder and President, MachNation. “Today, we are thrilled to announce a new publication that provides a list of 5 recommended IoT security vendors and 10 requirements to help public and private sector organizations craft a holistically secure IoT solution. We recommend the IoT security solutions of ARM, Bayshore Networks, Cisco, Intel and Wipro.”\nMachNation’s \"IoT Security Landscape and Vendor Recommendations 2015\" ( https://wp.me/p67qfr-xR ) is the industry’s first comprehensive publication providing in-depth analysis of the current state of IoT cyber security and physical security. Enterprises will rely on this publication when looking to deploy a secure IoT solution. IoT technology vendors will leverage this publication to better understand security challenges and attack vectors.\n“Building and deploying a multi-vendor IoT solution with end-to-end security is difficult,” said Dima Tokar, co-founder and CTO of MachNation. “And almost all IoT solutions sold to public and private sector organizations today are multi-vendor. We’ve examined 20 vendors and closely reviewed the security of participating companies to deliver expert analysis and critique. The findings will be valuable to both buyers of IoT solutions as well as technology companies that want to understand how to build a secure IoT solution using a technology stack comprised of the best vendors in the ecosystem.”\nIn this IoT Security Landscape and Vendor Recommendations report, MachNation presents the IoT security approaches of 5 recommended vendors in detail. The report also classifies the IoT security offerings of an additional 13 vendors that chose not to participate in MachNation's full methodological process.\nFor more information, please visit https://www.machnation.com\nAbout MachNation\nMachNation is the only dedicated insight services and application development firm covering the future of the Internet of things (IoT), Internet of everything (IoE), connected device and machine-to-machine (M2M) ecosystems.
