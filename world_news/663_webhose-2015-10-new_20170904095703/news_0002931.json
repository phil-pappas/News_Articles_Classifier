For example more than half the time those surveyed spent online was on mobile devices – often involving the quick checking of accessible sites.\nNews of ever-increasing internet usage is not necessarily surprising but has big implications for business. The need for businesses to be online responsive across devices and well-hosted is now necessary rather than an option. Businesses which do not stand-out online are most likely set to lose revenue quickly and getting into a good position online is constructed through having strong basic foundations – especially in the form of hosting.\nUKHost4U is a key example of a website hosting company providing a variety of services allowing organizations as well as individuals to make their sites accessible through The World Wide Web. They uphold the importance of having quality hosting in the apparent ‘internet age’ and frequently comment on industry news. A spokesperson had this to say:\n“British internet usage seems to be accelerating all the time so if you have a website it is essential that you know how to get it into a position that will get noticed across devices. The first place to start and yet which many people overlook is the hosting package.  As web hosts we provide valuable server space which allows sites to be in a highly visible position – and this matters.”\nPR Contact\nCompany name: UKHost4U\nTel: 0131 5100 261\nEmail: \nWeb: \n \n\n\nAbout PRBuzz.com \nPRBuzz.com is a press release distribution service that distributes press releases to online news sites and blogs to help customers with search engine optimization and create buzz about their web site, news or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:33:07.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
