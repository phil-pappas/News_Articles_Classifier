A typical cable TV bill has more than 100 channels and can cost several times as much as Sling's offer.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:14:42.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
