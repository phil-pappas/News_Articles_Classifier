As a result, the power storage system can be efficiently charged by using solar power and inexpensive nighttime power, potentially improving economic efficiency, NEC said. \nFurthermore, the system can measure power consumption for each breaker (for a living room, kitchen, etc) and receive accurate power consumption data of an entire house from a smart meter (compatible with B route). Measured data can be sorted by momentary value, day, month, year, etc and visualized as graphs, leading to energy-conscious behaviors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:05:31.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
