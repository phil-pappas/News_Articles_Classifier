Getty \nTroy Paredes, who worked as an SEC commissioner from 2008 to 2013 and runs a financial consulting firm, has joined Electronifie’s five-member board along with investor Max Kamhi. Kamhi was an early adviser to the firm and is a former chief executive of hedge fund Jamison Capital Partners. \nBoth new board members were early investors in Electronifie, which to date, has raised $12.8 million. The firm aims to become a venue for large-scale corporate bond trades. \nElectronifie will not take investments from companies that trade on the platform as some others have, and has instead turned to venture capital funds, family offices and individuals. Tradeweb, another electronic platform that offers corporate bond trading, is co-owned by 10 banks and Thomson Reuters, while MarketAxess is publicly traded. \n“We want to be Switzerland and perceived as having no conflicts,” chief executive Amar Kuchinad said. \nKuchinad previously served as a senior policy advisor in the SEC’s division of trading and markets. He met Paredes during his tenure at the agency. Prior to his work at the SEC, Kuchinad was a trader at Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. \nThere are currently about 50 firms using the platform with an average daily trading volume of about $5 million, he said. \nElectronifie is one of more than a dozen fintech start-ups attempting to better connect buyers and sellers in the corporate bond market. Liquidnet, which previously specialised in equity trading, launched a new fixed-income dark pool in late September.
