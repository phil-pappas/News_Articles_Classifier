With major outages a relatively regular occurrence in the market, Ms Roberts said that while the move to the new facility and the infrastructure-on-demand model adds significant reliability there’s no guarantee that outages will become a thing of the past.\nThe real challenge, according to Ms Roberts, is that while the myriad systems in the back-end tend to run well most of the time they often don’t react well to change\n“When you leave these systems alone they tend to run fine but what tends to happen is when you change things sometimes they don’t like it,” she said.\nNAB has instituted strict change procedures to mitigate the problem of a system shutdown but Ms Roberts said that outages can still happen.\n“The technology is complex but customers must not feel the pain of the complexity,” she said.\n“I don’t think we have nailed that just yet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:40:31.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
