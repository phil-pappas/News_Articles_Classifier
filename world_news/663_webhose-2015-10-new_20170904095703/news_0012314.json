BONUS CHECKLIST: Business vs. home computer models. \nBy Randolph P. Johnston, Leslie Garrett, and Brian F. Tankersley The Accounting Firm Operations and Technology Survey \nComputer hardware and operating systems provide the foundation from which firms and their staff members manage their work tasks every day. While some practitioners focus more on the brand of the system rather than the quality of the components it contains, we believe that all of the major hardware manufacturers make some excellent, business-grade hardware, and they all also make some low-cost, low-quality items targeted at home users that are not appropriate for use in a business environment. \nWe see the results of many poor decisions when we consult with firms who are having problems with their technology, typically resulting from someone making decisions based solely on short-term factors such as how much money was “saved” on the hardware purchase or buying technology that the partner considers stylish. There is often a very good reason why some hardware is so inexpensive – cheap hardware is almost always made out of cheap parts. These parts may be underpowered processors, products that are obsolete and/or limited in their useful life by components on the hardware, proprietary drivers with limited upgrade support or components like power supplies that are not manufactured to the high standards required of the more expensive business-grade hardware. \nA listing of major hardware manufacturer laptop/desktop product lines classified into either “business grade” or “home grade” as of June 2015 is provided here. \nWe were disappointed, but not surprised that around two-thirds of solo practitioners (68 percent) and small firms (65 percent) replace their server hardware on an “as needed” basis, and some use critical servers as long as six years. It was also not surprising that a significant portion of small firms and solo practices also replace their laptops and desktops only as needed. \nAs all of the components in a piece of hardware age, they are more likely to fail, and replacement parts are much harder to locate in an emergency. Small hardware issues can create errors and slow a system down due to the ability of Windows and other software to work around some detected hardware problems. These age-related issues can slow the performance of an otherwise productive laptop or desktop, causing significant inefficiencies until the issue is identified and fixed. We believe most firms should replace their laptops and desktops every three to four years (depending on initial quality purchased and operating performance) as a preventive measure so that a number of the better retired computers can be installed and deployed as backup units if a primary device has a hardware or software problem or moved to homes to have separate business-grade machines in use there as well to prevent using business applications on family home computers. \nAnecdotal evidence indicates that many solo practitioners and small firms have licensing problems, especially surrounding Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat. Larger firms are reporting significant increases in software license audit requests from publishers, and we have seen many firms using home/academic licenses instead of products purchased under business/enterprise licensing programs. Firms should have some kind of licensing audit when new computers are purchased so that the partners can be confident that they have the legal right to use all of the software that they have deployed to servers and workstations. \nWhile this topic could be the subject of an entire standalone book that is updated multiple times annually due to its complexity and the frequent changes to programs, we believe that most solo and small firms have licensing issues that could cost the partners thousands of dollars in fines if not corrected before a publisher license audit is initiated. \nSolo and small firm practitioners seem to be somewhat behind larger firms in the adoption of multiple monitors for every user in the firm. When asked how many monitors connected to a single workstation were on the respondent’s primary desktop, 41 percent of solo practitioners and 22 percent of small firm respondents indicated that they only had one monitor on their desk. While this could be adequate if one had the corner-docking and multiple desktop features in Windows 10, along with a large, 4K or higher resolution display, we believe that most of these users are simply working with a suboptimal display configuration. In the future, larger monitors from 27-34” in size should be selected. \nThe percentages for the number of users throughout the firm who work on more than one monitor were consistent with these results, with 45 percent of solo practitioners and 28 percent of small firm respondents reporting that everyone in the firm works on a single monitor or less than 25 percent of users in the firm work on more than one monitor. Given the move of most firms to scanning client documents and how most are maintaining primary documentation for engagements in electronic format rather than on paper, working on a single, small monitor in a digital office is akin to using a small TV tray as a desk in a paper office – the arrangement doesn’t have enough real estate to allow the user to work with more than one thing at a time efficiently. We are currently recommending at least two if not three 24” monitors per professional who works almost exclusively in the office, and recommend that laptop users who work out of the office for two days or more at a time should have a portable external monitor they can use while away from their office. \nSolo practitioners (46 percent) and small firms (28 percent) were more likely to use multifunction devices as their primary scanner, and the groups were also more likely to use personal scanners (38 percent and 33 percent of solos and small firms, respectively). Most experts in CPA firm technology agree with our maxim “life is too short for cheap hardware,” and do not recommend the use of multifunction devices (e.g. personal grade scanner/copier/fax/printer devices) as the primary scanning devices for a firm. We have found one home-grade multifunction device that served as a decent copier/printer/scanner, and Xerox stopped making this model over 10 years ago. We think firms are better served when scanning to use a Fujitsu or Canon workgroup or production-quality scanner with excess duty cycle rating so that the firm can have enough capacity to meet its needs during peak use times. \nWe still see a small number of firms using unsupported operating systems like Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. While this software may still work for some firms (especially those who have shrunk in the recent past), the lack of patches for known security vulnerabilities going forward and discontinuation of software support by Microsoft as well as the major CPA firm publishers makes staying on the old operating systems a poor decision. While we would postpone adoption of Windows 10 until after the next tax season (ending April 2016) at the earliest in most firms, we have used and recommended Windows 8.1 for some time, and have been pleased with how well it performs with all of the accounting firm applications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:51:37.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
