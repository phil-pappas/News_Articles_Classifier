This is the fifth model introduced within our Tier 4 Final lineup and is capable of a 46-48 kW standby rating and 42-43 kW prime and continuous rating.\" The 55REOZT4 is EPA emission certified for non-road use and comes equipped with a rugged DOT-certified trailer and durable enclosure. Like all Kohler gaseous and diesel mobile generators, the new model is compatible with the company’s recently launched Mobile Paralleling Box, which delivers cutting-edge flexibility by allowing users to parallel different sized generators with different fuel types to optimize power for the specific task at hand. The 55REOZT4 integrates a number of user-friendly features to deliver straightforward operation and dependable performance in the field, including: • A heavy-duty air cleaner with restriction indicator • Fuel tanks sized for 24-hour runtime • External emergency stop • Stainless steel door latches and hinges • Two-way fuel valve to easily switch from onboard to external fuel sources • Three position selector switch • A cold weather package that includes block and battery heaters • A convenient single point lifting eye • Durable steel sound-attenuating housing with quiet operation of 69 dB(A) at 7 m (23ft.) at full load • A patented housing that lifts off without removing external hardware or wiring The 55REOZT4 features Kohler’s powerful KDI 3404 engine, which achieves Tier 4 Final emission compliance without a diesel particulate filter (DPF) due to a number of innovative design features, including Kohler’s direct injection system, cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and diesel oxygenated catalyst (DOC). A high-pressure common rail system (CSR) is also integrated, which utilizes pressures at 2000 bar (29,000 psi) to deliver better atomization of fuel, improved fuel consumption and a reduction in emission particulates.
