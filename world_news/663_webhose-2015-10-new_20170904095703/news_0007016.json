The proposed development is a half mile off the I-15 freeway to the east here and is the first master-planned community to go through the new county general plan process. \nThe development will feature a village-style approach whereby every home will be within a 10-minute walk to the grocery store hotel , senior center, water-reclamation plant and other amenities and is slated to go before the Board of Supervisors on October 28. Its been approved by county staff and the planning commission, and Accretive plans to start development in about a year. We spoke exclusively with Rilling about the proposed driverless technology and how it will impact community development. \nGlobeSt.com: Please explain how driverless technology is coming to this community. \nWeve collaborated with , a local technology firm in Carlsbad, CA, to introduce in concept autonomous or driverless vehicles in the Lilac Hills Ranch community that would provide services to establish a more pedestrian-oriented community and more interconnected neighborhoods. Its widely accepted that people will walk more if there are alternative modes of travel available to them. This technology would allow somebody to pull up an app on their smartphone and order a driverless electric vehicle to pick them up and take them to another point in the community. It could also be used to deliver groceries or household goods. Technology like this can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by reducing the number of car trips that a household would need to take in a given day. \nThe goal is to use 21 st ed on introducing the technology and allowing the use to be adapted and used as necessary. It works on a localized virtual rail networknot a GPS systemthat keeps the vehicles on a defined pathway. If someone summons a car, it will be preprogrammed to follow a certain route, and the resident can take it anywhere within the community. The car can come in a lot of different shapes and forms; its platform adaptable. \nLast week, during the approval of the SANDAG infrastructure being focused on driverless technology. This will be the first community in the state that will implement that technology. \nGlobeSt.com: How quickly will this type of technology spread to other communities? \nAs long as somebody sees that it works and that its popular and has a market, it will be copied rather quickly. We see it being mainstream in a short time after we introduce it. Its already being used on private campuses like and Tesla , but no one has done it on a community-wide basis yet. Well be the leader in this technology. \nNext: OTHER NEW TECHNOLOGY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:58:46.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
