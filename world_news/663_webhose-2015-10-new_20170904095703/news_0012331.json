The state has been draining about $250 million per month from its substantial reserves to support its fiscal 2016 budget.\n\"The state will continue to experience large deficits in the coming years if oil prices remain low ... and will again need to use reserve money to fill these gaps,\" Moody's said.\nAlaska's credit rating is AAA-negative.\n(Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Jonathan Oatis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:36:29.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
