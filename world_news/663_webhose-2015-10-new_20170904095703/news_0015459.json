Among a collective range of devices known as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), these new semiconductors offer greater energy efficiencies and increased electron conduction speed than other semiconductor materials, such as silicon. \nAnd, unlike that other much-vaunted semiconductor material, graphene, TMDCs have superior electrical conductance for rapid \"on/off\" switching, making single-molecule layer tungsten disulfide a promising TMDC for photonic and optoelectronic applications. Prior to the Berkely Lab research, however, laser capabilities essential for use in such things as \" Lab-on-a-chip \" devices, had not been realized using this material. \n\"TMDCs have shown exceptionally strong light-matter interactions that result in extraordinary excitonic properties,\" said Zhang. \"These properties arise from the quantum confinement and crystal symmetry effect on the electronic band structure as the material is thinned down to a monolayer. However, for 2D lasing, the design and fabrication of microcavities that provide a high optical mode confinement factor and high quality, or Q, factor is required.\" \nAccording to the researchers, 2D excitonic laser technology also has potential for applications in valleytronics. This is where the energy of electrons is plotted relative to their momentum on a graph, the resultant curve shows two valleys and, by manipulating these valleys to have unequal depth, electrons will take a preference to populate one of the two valleys. The two different charge states then created can be used to represent zeroes and ones. In this way, valleytronics is proffered as an alternative to spintronics (which uses the intrinsic spin of the electron and its associated magnetic moment to emulate binary encoding) for quantum computing. \n\"TMDCs such as tungsten disulfide provide unique access to spin and valley degrees of freedom,\" said Berkeley Lab researcher Jing Wong. \"Selective excitation of the carrier population in one set of two distinct valleys can further lead to lasing in the confined valley, paving the way for easily-tunable circularly polarized lasers. The demand for circularly polarized coherent light sources is high, ranging from three-dimensional displays to effective spin sources in spintronics, and information carriers in quantum computation.\" \nThe details of this research were recently published in the journal Nature Photonics .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:27:24.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
