Picturated is the ultimate friend game to be played in groups with pictures on your phone. \nIn Picturated , players create a game with a picture they take from their iPhone or borrow from their photo library. Once the picture has been created, cropped and captioned, it can be shared to a group who compete against the clock to solve the word puzzle. Players can strategize by using tactical weapons that impose penalties on other friends. The players who are quick to solve the word puzzle - but avoid attacks by utilizing their resources and their brains will WIN. \nAbout Radium2 \nRadium2 is a game creator who reimagined two very popular hobbies by adding strategy and tactical maneuvers to picture taking and word puzzles. Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Radium2 was designed and developed by entrepreneurs who wanted to create a fun game utilizing the phone camera.
