In this new role, Jim is responsible for Accion’s global communications and brand strategy.\n“Digital-first approaches to communication are increasingly important, and we expect that Jim’s experience and insights will help Accion realize our true potential,” said Accion CEO and President Michael Schlein. “Jim will help Accion deepen its engagement and reach with existing audiences, as well as introduce our work to many more people who should know about the need for global financial inclusion and Accion’s leadership in this sector. This in turn will help draw more attention to the impact that financial inclusion can make, and ultimately help more people at the base of the pyramid use, access, and benefit from financial services.”\nPrior to joining Accion, Jim was UNICEF's Chief of Digital Strategy, where he had overall responsibility for video, photo, social media, and multi-platform/mobile worldwide. Under Jim’s leadership, UNICEF won a prestigious Webby Award for use of video in public advocacy in 2015 and launched a global renewal of its digital strategy. In 2014 Jim was named by the Guardian as a global development tweeter to watch.\nJim has nearly 20 years of media and communications experience, with more than half of that in global development. As the World Bank's Head of Online & Social Media, Jim played a key role to create a coherent, global approach to digital communications, integrating social media into all facets of the Bank's outreach. For four years he managed outreach for CGAP's mobile phone banking/microfinance program, working closely with key players from the fields of retail finance, mobile telecom, and regulatory agencies.\nJim was an award-winning business reporter for WAMU-FM, \"Marketplace,\" and a producer for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and XM Satellite Radio. He holds a master's from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, where he serves as Vice-Chair of the Alumni Board.\nAbout Accion\nAccion is a global nonprofit dedicated to building a financially inclusive world with economic opportunity for all, by giving people the financial tools they need to improve their lives.
