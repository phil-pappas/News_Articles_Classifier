Oracle Engineered Systems are software and hardware engineered together that provide the highest-performing and most-available platform for running Oracle Database and customer applications. Since the launch of Oracle Exadata -- purpose built to optimize the performance and cost of running Oracle -- thousands of customers have moved their Oracle Databases to Oracle Engineered Systems running on Intel architecture. \nData is the lifeblood of any organization, relied upon for day-to-day and minute-by-minute operations. It is critical to both business operations and understanding how an enterprise is supporting its customers. Many enterprises also have business, legal and regulatory requirements to have immediate access to complete and accurate data, making it hard to migrate data from one platform to another without taking on risk and cost. \nThe Exa Your Power program is a free database migration Proof of Concept (PoC) for qualified customers. Oracle will assess the customer's environment, deliver a customized database migration results report, and show how they may be able to significantly reduce the time and cost required to run critical database workloads. \n\"CSC has successfully migrated dozens of customers' enterprise workloads to Oracle Engineered Systems as a part of our Digital Transformation Services. We recently migrated an Oracle Database for a major insurance provider from IBM Power 7 to an Exadata X5 engineered system as a Proof of Concept,\" said Ashish Mahadwar, Executive Vice President & General Manager, Emerging Business Group. \"Our test results showed their Siebel Application running four-to-ten times faster and their ETL Processes running up to 12-times faster on the Exadata. The customer was very impressed by the scale of the benefits and the ease of migration and is now working with CSC on a major Exadata deployment.\" \n\"Working together with Intel and our partners, we have helped thousands of enterprises quickly and easily move their Oracle database from their legacy systems to Oracle Engineered Systems,\" said, Karen Sigman, vice president, Oracle Platform Business. \"This is an extension of our partnership focused on helping our customers achieve better performance, lower costs and better security.\" \n\"Transformation of the enterprise is already underway with the continuous improvements in capabilities, performance per dollar, energy efficiency, and a vast software ecosystem that Intel and Oracle deliver together,\" said Raj Hazra, vice president, Data Center Group, general manager, Enterprise and High Performance Computing Platform Group. \"Our companies understand demanding enterprise workloads and have long collaborated to optimize the performance and reliability of Oracle Database on Intel® Xeon® processors. The Exa Your Power program will make it easier for customers to realize the benefits of moving to Intel architecture.\" \nThe Exa Your Power Program is jointly funded by Oracle and Intel. Specifically, the program offers qualified customers: A free Proof of Concept migration of one or more sample databases A customized report documenting the migration process and test results A comprehensive roadmap for modernizing their database environment to Oracle Engineered Systems optimized for Oracle Database \nLearn more about the IBM Power migration program at Exa Your Power . \nAbout Oracle Engineered Systems Oracle Engineered Systems are integrated systems architected, integrated, tested, and optimized to work together -- cutting complexity and eliminating costs .
