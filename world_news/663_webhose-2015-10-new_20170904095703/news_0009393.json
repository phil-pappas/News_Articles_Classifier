This release forwards CD-adapco’s mission to help their customers discover better designs faster with improved usability, increased accuracy and automation for ICE simulation. Committed to maintaining leadership of In-Cylinder Engine analysis, CD-adapco continues to enhance capabilities and add functionality to STAR-CD/es-ice that will be critical to its automotive customers in the future.\n“CD-adapco is an ideal partner because of their unwavering commitment to the IC engines development and ability to produce the right solutions to meet our strict engine project deadlines,” said Ralf Speetzen, Senior Manager Combustion Simulation at MTU Friedrichshafen AG. “Their engine simulation technology and dedicated support enable us to deliver a product to our end user in which we have great confidence. We look forward to continuing our partnership with CD-adapco well into the future.”\nIn addition to refinements of existing combustion models, v4.24 delivers further improvements to the es-ice automated meshing processes and es-ice post-processing capabilities. This version also includes a pre-release of a new fully automatic meshing technology for full cycle calculations of 4-stroke gasoline and diesel engines.\n“This version demonstrates CD-adapco’s continued commitment to the IC Engine sector with the pre-release of a significant automated meshing technology and refinements to the existing ICE combustion models in STAR-CD,” said Richard Johns, CD-adapco Vice President of IC Engines. “Users can now experience the new mesh motion approaches demonstrating CD-adapco’s commitment to continue to lead this field of simulation.”\nThe new meshing technology, which is accessible using es-ice, enables the user to generate accurate meshes automatically for full geometry, complete cycle calculations of 4-stroke gasoline and diesel engines. The mesh structure consists of prism layers at the boundary to capture near-wall gradients, an aligned mesh within the valve gap and a hexahedral mesh within the core of the model. A sequence of meshes is generated at distinct crank-angle positions during the engine cycle as a pre-processing step. These are subsequently morphed over a crank-angle range selected automatically to give optimum mesh quality. A fully automated process is used to minimize mesh generation time and allow the user easy control over mesh size. Results using this new technology indicate similar solutions to existing es-ice trimmed cell meshing, thereby providing users with alternative automatic meshing that is easy, fast and accurate.\nSeveral combustion models have been enhanced in v4.24 including the addition of a new fuel chemistry library to accurately simulate dual-fuel engines that require the combined chemistry of both fuels and improved capabilities for modeling early flame development. In addition, equilibrium and auto-ignition tables generated by DARS can now be used for dual-fuel combustion and recent advancements in DARS v2.10 (link to press release) now enable users to perform library-based combustion calculations using their own fuel chemistry.\nAbout CD-adapco\nCD-adapco (http://www.cd-adapco.com) is the world's largest, privately owned CFD-focused CAE provider.
