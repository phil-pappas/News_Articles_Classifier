Many say it doesn’t make sense , that it’s not consistent across customers because people have different conceptions of how to do it correctly, that it’s a bizarre tradition, and research indicates that it’s can be discriminatory against African Americans. On the other hand, tipping is incentive for a server to do a good job. (Which prompts the usual counterargument: Research has found that people often tip even when their servers do a bad job .)\nCalls to abolish tipping abound, and at least a few restaurants in the U.S. have opted out of the tradition. On Wednesday, the movement got a bigger push: The New York restauranteur Danny Meyer announced that he will be eliminating tipping at the 13 restaurants in the Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG)—which does not include the burger joint Shake Shack which spun off from USHG in 2014. In a letter posted online , Meyer writes that while the cost of dining will be similar for customers, the zero-gratuity rule will benefit cooks, who often miss out on tips, and affect his staff of 1,800 significantly:\nThere are countless laws and regulations that determine which positions in a restaurant may, and may not share in gratuities …Unfortunately, many of our colleagues—our cooks, reservationists, and dishwashers to name a few—aren’t able to share in our guests’ generosity, even though their contributions are just as vital to the outcome of your experience at one of our restaurants.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/dining/danny-meyer-restaurants-no-tips.html", "http://www.ushgnyc.com/news/archives/announcements/a-letter-from-danny-meyer/", "http://freakonomics.com/2014/08/07/should-tipping-be-banned-a-freakonomics-radio-rebroadcast/"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:46:02.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
