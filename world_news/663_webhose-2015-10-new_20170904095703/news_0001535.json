For the plant, \"Aozasa Solar Power Plant,\" the company obtained about 1.9ha of privately-owned land and installed 840kW of solar panels manufactured by Toshiba Corp. From the plant, 750kW of power is transmitted to a power grid, and all of the electricity generated is sold to Tohoku-Electric Power Co Inc. \nThe plant site was originally agricultural land outside an agricultural developing area. So, the solar power generation facilities were installed after applying for conversion of agricultural land. \nToshiba Plant Systems & Services Corp provided engineering and construction services. The solar panel and PV inverter employed for the plant are products of Toshiba and Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corp (TMEIC), respectively. \nThe plant is expected to generate about 880,000kWh of electricity, which is equivalent to the amount consumed by 300 households, per year. Even though Tono City is not located in a heavy-snow region, solar panels were set up at an angle of 30Â° and a height of 1.3m so that they can prevent snow cover to some extent. As a result, maintenance work required in winter was reduced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:03:49.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
