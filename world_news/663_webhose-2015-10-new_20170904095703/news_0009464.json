ArcSoft confirms the app is still chart topping and available in the Apple App Store. \nAs a number of news outlets recently reported, Apple has removed more than 250 apps from the App Store after it was discovered they were accessing users’ private data through a third-party advertising tool developed by Youmi. \nMany sites have incorrectly listed digital makeover app Perfect365 as being affected by this issue. \nPerfect365 does not and has never used this Youmi advertising tool, and has not been removed from the App Store. Perfect365 remains at the top of the App store charts and is the number one digital makeover app for selfies. The list of affected apps being published by many news organizations is not related to this story. \nFor correct information about the Youmi advertising tool and its affects, please visit the report published by SourceDNA on Sunday, October 18. \nReportedly loved by celebrities, Perfect365 uses ArcSoft's Face Detection technology to achieve the most accurate digital makeup placement on cell phone portraits, allowing users to try dozens of on-trend makeup styles with just one tap.
