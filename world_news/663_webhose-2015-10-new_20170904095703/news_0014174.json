Well, thanks to the creativity of two inventors from Staten Island, N.J., there is now a much stronger and more reliable case with additional bonus features.\nThey developed a prototype for EZ CASE to prevent cracking and breaking of the case when phone is removed and replaced or dropped. In other words, it is durable for years of effective use. It, therefore, saves the time, effort and expense of having to replace a broken case. Their unique design also allows the user to remove a cell phone quickly and easily from the case. Furthermore, the compact size of the case makes it easier to conceal and keep valuables safe. It is also space-saving, lightweight and portable. In addition, it is easy to use, convenient and affordably priced.\nThe inventors were inspired by their personal experience. “We had a series of bad experiences with cell phone cases,” one of them said. “It seemed that no matter what type of case we bought, sooner or later, it would break with normal use while taking the phone out or putting it back inside.”\nThe original design was submitted to the New Jersey office of Invent Help. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
