An ever increasing number of charities are turning to online fundraising to enhance fundraising efforts.\nIn fact, according to Blackbauds’ 2014 Charitable Giving Annual Report, online donations grew 8.9% in 2014 over 2013 levels and represented 6.7% of the $358.38 billion received from nonprofit organizations.\ndonasity differs from others in this market – which include GoFundMe, Causes, and Give Forward – foremost in its fee structure. donasity donors incur a flat 4.95% transaction fee, with no processing fees or transaction fees passed on to the charity. Other competing platforms charge between 5% - 9.25% per transaction, plus processing fees along with monthly fees and/or annual contracts.\nOther differentiating features with donasity include aggregating all IRS approved 501 (c) non-profit organizations onto one search engine portal, enabling donors to give to multiple charities/fundraisers in one single transaction, and the ability to track annual charitable giving through a “consolidated giving statement”.\nAdditionally, the founders created a bilingual English/Spanish website with a bilingual Coachable Counselor Customer Support team. \"The hispanic community is one of the fastest growing markets that is underserved in online offerings,” said Brown.\nBoth Mr. Brown and his founding partner James Healy are dedicated to making the process of donating to charities easier for everyone. “We want non-profits and individuals to create fundraisers for specific causes, and to make giving back easier,” said Mr. Healy, who met Mr. Brown when they both worked lengthy careers within the Financial banking industries. “Every single dollar makes a difference and we created donasity to embrace that grassroots mentality. Whether you have $20 to give or $2,000, you are making a difference and your charity of choice doesn’t have to absorb any processing fees.”\nBoth Healy and Brown were moved to create the new venture that combined their entrepreneurial ambition with their philanthropic beliefs. Part of that commitment includes donasity’s “Giveback Program” that rewards donasity charities that meet their fundraising goals by donating back to them -- on top of proceeds earned online.\ndonasity’s initial launch begins in Jacksonville and then extends to Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Puerto Rico. Rollouts will continue in early 2016 in the Northeastern and Southeastern U.S and then moves to the Mid-West, South-West and West Coast regions in mid-2016.\ndonasity employs eight full-time staff members.
