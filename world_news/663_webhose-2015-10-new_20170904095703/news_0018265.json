And how does Stan perform now that it's out in the open and away from its preview phase?\nThen comes the big question: does Stan have what it takes to keep Australians coming back for more now that Netflix is here?\nSetting up Stan Getting Stan up and running is a fairly straightforward process, though you will require a few things in order to view the service on your television at home.\nAt launch, a compatible iOS or Android smartphone or tablet was needed in order to browse Stan's content library, in addition to an Apple TV or Chromecast media streaming device so that you could AirPlay or Cast the content over to your television.\nThankfully, a Stan app has made its way to the Apple TV , PS3 and PS4 , allowing users to browse the streaming service's content library on their TV screens.\nAlternatively, you can use your PC or Mac to view Stan's content on most browsers and stream it to your Chromecast from there.\nStan is compatible with iPads running iOS7 and above from the second generation onwards, as well as all iPad minis and iPhones from the fourth generation onwards.\nMost Android phones from 4.2 onwards are supported, including recently added support for Sony's Xperia Z1, Z2, Z3 phones and tablets, HTC One M7, M8, M9 and Desire and LG's G2, LG Optimus L7II smartphones.\nIn terms of tablets, most Android units running 4.2 and above will work, aside from the HP 8 G2.\nOnce you've selected something to watch, you can start playing it on your phone or tablet, or tap the AirPlay/Cast icon to throw it to your Apple TV or Chromecast, at which point you can put your smart device to sleep.\nIt's fantastic to see that Stan has addressed initial criticisms of its service by releasing app for the Apple TV platform and for PlayStation consoles, and we imagine StreamCo will eventually bring out some apps for smart TVs, the Xbox One and various media players.\nGet that interface up in yo' face Anyone who's seen Netflix's interface should know what to expect with Stan in terms of functionality. That said, Stan might just have the visual edge.\nMovie and TV show publicity art is all over Stan, and it looks incredibly slick – Its carousel in particular is clean and image-driven, with over half of our iPad's screen displaying some of Stan's most exciting content, like its exclusive shows Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle as well as other premium dramas like Hannibal and Fargo.\nFlicking up on the screen will show you a range of genres and collections below, such as Comedy Classics, Best of Australia and World Movies, with titles and poster art laid out horizontally for you to swipe across and browse.\nTapping on a show will let you choose the season and episode you want, while tapping on a movie will give you some information screen where you can press play and jump straight in.\nOptions can be revealed on the left side of the screen by tapping the icon in the upper left hand corner, allowing you to switch profiles, browse TV and movie genres, kids content, your watch history or your list of saved shows (just like on Netflix), and the upper right hand contains a search bar and access to your profile (again, just like on Netflix).\nStan's Apple TV app is slightly different to the tablet and smartphone version, in that it lists its sections along the top of the screen, with genres and content laid out in a style that's more consistent with Apple TV's other apps.\nThat Stan sure has some nice features Unlike its competitors, Stan gives you the option to choose the image quality of your stream on smartphones and tablets via a cog icon at the bottom of your player window.\nYou can opt to use Stan's automatic setting for an adaptive bit rate that's tailored to the quality of your connection, or choose the SD or HD constant bit rate encode, depending on whether or not you have bandwidth to spare.\nCuriously missing from Stan are options to change language or apply closed captions to the content you're watching – the lack of these options in Stan could be make or break for people who are hearing impaired or have a language barrier, so their omission seems odd.\nAt present, Stan doesn't have the ability to recommend movies and shows to you based on your movie habits, which is one of Netflix's best features.\nHopefully, a 'recommended shows' feature is somewhere in StreamCo's future pipeline.", "external_links": ["http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/chromecast-1171126/review", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Stan/Hands%20on/Stan%20hands%20on%203-320-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/netflix-1065801/review", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Stan/Hands%20on/Stan%20hands%20on%202-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Stan/Hands%20on/Stan%20hands%20on%204-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Stan/Hands%20on/Stan%20hands%20on%202-650-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/xbox-one-1153153/review", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/sony-ps4-1131803/review", "http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/television/stan-confirms-australia-day-launch-1281634", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/sony-ps3-1099856/review", "http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Stan/Hands%20on/Stan%20hands%20on%204-320-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/apple-tv-900409/review", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Stan/Hands%20on/Stan%20hands%20on%203-650-80.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:09:52.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
