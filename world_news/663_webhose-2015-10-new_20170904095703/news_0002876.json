I would expect, given this year’s financial gyrations in China, that the government is also asking itself whether the canal is a viable proposition.” \nBill Wild, HKND’s chief project adviser for the canal, said: “I have no doubt that appropriate financial arrangements will be in place before construction commences.” \nMr Jing said: “We can demonstrate to the world that we are builders, not destroyers [and that] what we bring is wealth and dignity. I am confident that we will succeed, and that victory will belong to us.” \nIf the canal continues as planned, it is anticipated to be completed by 2020, despite concerns that the Nicaragua Canal is an environmental threat to the people of Nicaragua and the marine life that dwell in its waters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:23:35.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
