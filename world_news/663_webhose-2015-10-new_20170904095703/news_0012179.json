Analytics, which is enjoying rapidly increasing use, provides comprehensive ways to find, gather, package and use data for strategy and sales, but the essential software has been monopolized by Fortune 500 corporations because of cost and complexity. \nInformation Builders (IBI), one of the software world’s most successful privately owned companies, has been a consistent leader in providing all the giant firms with an expensive but remarkably effective product called Web FOCUS. Simply stated, it is the Rolls Royce of business intelligence software. \nNow, Information Builders (IBI) has thrown out the rule book on size and price and introduced a totally affordable, user friendly version of that same product for growing companies. It was unveiled at a series of California small business demonstrations earlier this month. \n“Web FOCUS Express is a game changer for emerging companies. It gives them power and reach and the ability to review their past, plan their future and package themselves in the best way to deal with customers,” said Tom Villani, the VP of IBI and an industry veteran who has crafted opportunities for growing firms for many years. \n“It never made sense that the biggest companies that can afford any price pay the lowest for whatever they buy, while small companies with limited resources end up paying top dollar. With Web Focus Express, growing firms can be more efficient making more sales and creating new jobs,” said Don Gonneville, a disabled vet owner of a California equipment distribution firm. \nAmerica’s 25 million smaller companies, at least with Analytics, have found one way to reach the all too often elusive level playing field. \nBy Robert J. Wagman \nBusiness Matchmaking is a Los Angeles based 501 © 3 Foundation that produces events nationally at which small businesses meet with buyers from government agencies and major corporations. They periodically report on technology developments that help emerging entrepreneurial companies.
