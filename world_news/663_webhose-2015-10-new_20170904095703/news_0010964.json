This Princess Zelda cake will whisk you away to the land of Hyrule from the Legend of Zelda video game series.\nThe creation comes from Emerald Stewart, an Australian cake artist who makes geeky concoctions for friends and family in her spare time. For her 28th birthday, Stewart decided to make herself a bust of Princess Zelda, and it looks both real and delicious. It's certainly not the first geeky cake we've seen , nor is it even the first Legend of Zelda-themed cake , but it stands out due to its size and stunning attention to detail, down to Zelda's carefully sculpted slender nose and defined clavicle.\nRelated Links Beautiful makeover for a Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time location This huge Lego Legend of Zelda Hyrule Castle took 2.5 years to build Geeky cake pan will turn you into a Mother of Dragons Stewart's Zelda cake is an approximately life-size bust of the princess of Hyrule, measuring about 50 centimeters (20 inches) tall. To bake the five cakes needed to piece the whole thing together, Stewart used almost 3 kilograms (about 6.6 pounds) of sugar, a kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) of vanilla buttercream and over 1.2 kilograms (about 2.65 pounds) of dark chocolate.\nFine details like the necklace, ears and tiara are made out of fondant. Stewart 3D-printed a mold for the Majora's Mask found on Zelda's necklace, and hand-painted the gold finish on the cake in painstaking detail. Making the cake took about a week in total.\nStewart got started making cakes when her daughter turned 1. To mark the occasion, Stewart made a Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker-themed cake, and a hobby was born. Now, Stewart bakes tons of geeky cakes and features them on her A Song of Fire and Icing Facebook page, a play on her favorite fantasy series -- George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" which inspired the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\"\nWith this masterpiece and her birthday celebration under her belt, Stewart can get to work on some of the other cakes she's been wanting to whip up. In particular, she plans to make creations based on Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and a Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series.
