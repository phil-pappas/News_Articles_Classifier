Hidden and concealed camera technology has advanced rapidly to the point where anyone in public or private areas may be followed in real-time by invisible spy cameras. Wireless capabilities of these devices can record and transmit such video-recordings to anywhere in the world.The media these days are full of images and videos of people whose activities were captured by cameras, often without their knowledge or consent. This E-Guide is designed to describe the many video systems and typical locations where average persons are exposed almost anytime, day or night, whether they like it or not.The media increasingly report confrontations between various authorities and innocent public based on cameras used by one or both sides. Most public institutions and businesses are equipped with so-called \"security\" cameras. It is high time that individuals also incorporate such devices when they are outside their homes or travel abroad.Miniature cameras can be concealed on a person in form of eyeglasses, hearing aids, tie clips, watches, badges, buttons, and jewelry. In households cameras may be hidden in clocks, TVs, radios, mirrors, picture frames, and other common objects. Both hidden and visible surveillance cameras are installed in many shopping malls, supermarkets, meeting halls, schools, churches, government offices, hospitals, airports, bus and railway stations, highways, toll gates, truck stops, cruise ships, casinos, theaters, cinemas, libraries and museums. The E-Guide also describes spy camera detectors that can be used to identify the existence and operation of hidden cameras. Some can also be used to counteract their operation making them ineffective. It shows the reader how to discover, avoid, or exploit, spy cameras that are following all of us around wherever we move, day or night. Whether or not you operate a mobile camera, secret or overt currently, this E-Guide is designed as an App to provide anyone with basic information about how spy cameras are watching us and what we can do about it.Concealed spy camera detectors are also being offered on the market. These are devices which give you an opportunity to find out if you are under camera surveillance. They can be particularly useful in public places and hotels and motels for \"debugging\" the facilities.Within each chapter there are links to various web sites that describe the use of spy cameras in specific operations and where to look for them. Other links provide a means of reaching vendors of spy cameras and detection devices. These are useful in providing examples of what to look for as well as an orientation about prices and availability of various spy camera products.The E-Guide is truly an invaluable App in any mobile device always ready to advise any person who is active in public areas. Synopsis: Hidden and secret spy cameras are here to stay and their use multiplies exponentially throughout the world. Anyone moving in public places or unfamiliar meeting halls or even households, should be aware that his movements may be video recorded and sent to third parties without their consent. The E-Guide also alerts you to the existence of spy camera detectors that can alert you to where they are in operation. What Readers Are Saying: It's shocking. A must read for everybody Fascinating, interesting and a must-read if you can stomach it. This short booklet contains more information than I wanted to know, yet - absolutely fascinating. While I was aware of much of the content (I tend to be overcautious) I was absolutely shocked to find out that people get spied on in their hotel rooms. Naturally, casinos, stores with expensive merchandise, etc are being taped all day long, same as intersections, public transport systems etc. But hotel rooms? Am I not paying for my privacy ? Previously I thought that only celebrities are being videotaped but the author Bohdan O. Szuprowicz provides enough links to Google and YouTube to convince me that everybody is being spied on, constantly. I am too overwhelmed to really state what I am going to do with this information, but I can say for certain that this book should be read by everybody. Of course Mr. Orwell guessed all of this a long time ago. A short but incredibly important book. Biography: Bohdan O.
