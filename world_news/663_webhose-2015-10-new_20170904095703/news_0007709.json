The instrument offering will be tied together with the ARGUS /Dissolution PC software which is said to be robust, scalable, user-friendly and 21 CFR Part 11 compliant, the latter being a critical requirement of dissolution users today. \nSolvias AG, a privately held analytical and chemical development company based in Switzerland , developed ARGUS /Dissolution as an all-in-one software solution covering the entire dissolution workflow from data acquisition to the release of the spectrophotometric results. \nAccording to Hanson Research President, Keith Hamman , Hanson chose ARGUS software not only because of the software's ability to utilize the advanced capabilities of the Vision tester and autosampler but because of its audit-proof compliance. \"Dissolution analysts require system flexibility and ease of use,\" said Hamman. \"Some pharmaceutical products only require simple, straightforward testing while other products have quite complex methods. Our instruments are designed to accommodate both ends of the spectrum. The challenge was to provide a software product that takes advantage of our instrument's great features and capabilities which users rely on. ARGUS /Dissolution hit that target perfectly. And because the software was developed by dissolution industry users, the security compliance is probably the best in the business\". \nSays CEO of Solvias, Karen Huebscher , \"We at Solvias are excited about the cooperation with Hanson Research - a company that is contributing high quality equipment to the dissolution market for so many years.\" \nHanson's on-line UV system, with the Shimadzu UV-1800 and ARGUS /Dissolution software, will be launched at the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) annual meeting and expo in Orlando, FL on October 25, 2015.
