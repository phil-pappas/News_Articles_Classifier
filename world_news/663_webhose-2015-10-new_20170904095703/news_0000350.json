While the majority of existing camera cages feature generic, boxy and bulky designs, the Sharkcage is a handsome and compact solution that opens up myriad creative opportunities for photographers and videographers using the Panasonic GH4, the Samsung NX1, the Sony a7, a7R and a7S, and the Sony a7II and a7RII.\n“It’s not enough to simply create a protective frame for a camera,” said Bohus Blahut, product consultant and marketing director for Fotodiox. “Similar to our Sharkcage model for the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera, these new models come equipped with tons of accessory mounts, an integrated cable pinch system and a complete rod mounting system - everything you need to transform your camera into a powerful, portable video production powerhouse. What’s more, because our camera-specific designs mirror the silhouette of each camera, all of the flexibility of a much larger rig system fits into a more efficient and compact footprint.”\nSharkcages are now available for the Panasonic GH4, the Samsung NX1, the Sony a7 (model is compatible with the a7, a7R and a7S), and the Sony a7II (model is compatible with the a7II and a7RII). They’re crafted entirely from aluminum, are available in Samurai Silver and Pitch Black, and are custom-tailored to retain the profile of their respective cameras, all without adding bulk. Filmmakers will find a multitude of 1/4-20\" mounting points for accessories, as well as a genuine rosewood grip that adds two-handed stability for steady shooting. Additional features of the new complete kits include:\nIntegrated cable pinch system for securing cables Removable 15mm rod system and a pair of 12” rods included with the kit – perfect for filmmakers mounting longer lenses Repositionable Arca-Swiss compatible quick-release plate Multiple 1/4-20\" mounts on the bottom of the cage and a rod mount system Configurable top handle that can mount in many different positions and angles Cold shoe mount for additional accessories Short micro HDMI(m) to HDMI(f) cable Leather wrist strap that locks around the wrist for comfort, stability and safety during shooting\nPurchase & Availability\nThe complete Sharkcage camera cage kits are available now on http://www.FotodioxPro.com for $329.95 (US).
