Therefore, in light of recent developments, we believe the only right thing to do is to return this important recognition of environmental stewardship.\" \nVolkswagen has been under fire since US environmental regulators announced on September 18 that the company had violated air-quality rules by installing software on nearly 500,000 diesel cars intended to evade US emissions limits for nitrogen oxide and other dangerous pollutants. \nVolkswagen, the world's biggest carmaker by sales, has admitted that up to 11 million diesel cars worldwide are fitted with so-called \"cheat devices\" that can switch on pollution controls when they detect the car is undergoing testing. \nVW faces up to $18 billion in fines from the US Environmental Protection Agency over the fraud, and a growing number of lawsuits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:26:45.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
