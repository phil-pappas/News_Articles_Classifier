These new combiners are commonly deployed in systems using components such as power amplifiers, antenna feeds, attenuators and switches, often for combining individual power amplifiers together into a large power block in an amplifier system. RF power combiners are devices that combine RF input signals into a common output, while maintaining the characteristic impedance of the inputs, in this case, 50 Ohms. As systems become more complex, choosing how best to combine two or more RF signals has become a far more difficult question to answer, especially when high power and wide bandwidth are involved. Fairview’s RF combiners offer low loss and low VSWR while providing excellent port-to-port isolation through the use of high power resistive components. These combiners are also designed to be screw-down mounted to a heatsink if necessary.\nThe new RF power combiners from Fairview come in popular 2-way and 4-way configurations and deliver high power up to 800 Watts over a broad temperature range between 55°C to 85°C. Fairview’s broadband RF combiners operate over broad frequencies from 20 MHz to 6 GHz and also boast low insertion loss from 0.35 dB to 1 dB and VSWR as low as 1.25:1. Additional benefits include excellent amplitude and phase balance, high power handling, good isolation levels and rugged packaging.\n“As systems continue to grow in complexity with more and more components required, it is important to have a single source for all your urgent RF system requirements. Our customers have that with Fairview,” says Brian McCutcheon, VP and General Manager at Fairview.\nThe new RF power combiners are in-stock and available to ship today from Fairview.
