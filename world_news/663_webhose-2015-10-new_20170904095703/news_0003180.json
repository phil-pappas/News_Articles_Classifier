There are no financing conditions for the closing of the deal, Dell said. Dell recently reported that it had about $12 billion of debt.\nDell said the combined company \"will focus on rapidly de-levering\" in the first 18 to 24 months after the deal closes, which it expects to happen between May and October of 2016.\nChip maker Avago Technologies Ltd.'s pending $37 billion agreement to buy Broadcom Corp. is the next-biggest pure-tech takeover ever struck.\nEMC shares rose 5.3% to $29.27 in premarket trading.\nJoe Tucci, EMC's long-time Chief Executive, will be chairman and CEO of EMC until the transaction closes. Upon completion, Mr. Dell will lead the combined company as chairman and CEO. Mr. Tucci, 68 years old, has considered giving up his CEO spot for several years and had previously said he and fellow directors might settle the succession question by February 2015.\nVMware, in which EMC owns about 80%, will remain a publicly traded company. EMC holders will receive $24.05 a share in cash in addition to tracking stock linked to a portion of EMC's interest in the VMware business. VMware has a market value of about $33 billion. Dell said EMC shareholders are expected to receive about 0.111 shares of new tracking stock for each EMC share. Shares of VMware closed at $78.65 Friday and have declined 4.7% so far this year. They were down 2.4% premarket.\nThe value of the tracking stock may vary from the market price of VMware given the different characteristics and rights of the two stocks, Dell said.\nEMC said late last year that it was exploring strategic options. The company has been under pressure to boost its stock price since last year, when activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. took a roughly 2% stake in the company and urged it to spin off VMware, which has a market value of $34 billion. An arrangement struck in January between Elliott and EMC that had barred the fund from publicly pressuring EMC expired last month.\nIn a statement Monday, Jesse Cohn, Senior Portfolio Manager at Elliott, said Elliott \"strongly supports\" the deal.\n\"This is a landmark deal that will have wide-reaching ramifications across the tech landscape for years to come,\" said Daniel Ives, analyst at FBR & Co, in a note to clients. He suggested that Dell could sell some its stake in VMware in order to help fund the \"massive price tag\" of the deal. A Dell spokesperson wasn't immediately available to comment on the stake.\nThe tie up comes about two years after Dell went private in a roughly $25 billion buyout by its founder, Mr. Dell, and Silver Lake. Dell has since pivoted from personal computers, pinched by demand for tablets and smartphones, toward more-profitable areas like storage and security. The EMC acquisition helps cement Dell's transition from a consumer-facing company to one focused on technology for large companies, and it gives it the breadth to compete more effectively with larger companies such as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp.\nEMC had earlier been in talks with Dell, The Wall Street Journal reported last September. The Hopkinton, Mass., company also had been in discussions about a merger with Hewlett-Packard Co., which ended before H-P announced plans to split itself in two in October 2014.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n 12, 2015 08:33 ET (12:33 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:55:06.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
