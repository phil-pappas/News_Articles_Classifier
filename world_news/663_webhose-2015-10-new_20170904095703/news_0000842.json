Benefits of such shaving includes: No scratches No painful waxing or messy depilatory creams Incredibly close & smooth shave Little to no water usage Environmentally friendly \nPrototypes are created from 6061 aluminum: \nWavelengths of light had already been discovered that could cut through dark hair, but finding a way to cut light hair was proving incredibly difficult. After years of research it was discovered a chromophore in the hair that would be cut when hit with a particular light wavelength. Chromophores are particles that absorb certain wavelengths of light. This chromophore is shared by every human, regardless of age, gender or race. \n  backers can get one with a pledge of $159.
