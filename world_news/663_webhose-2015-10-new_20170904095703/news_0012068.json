Bike Horn merges the conveniences of mobile phones to the bicycle as a whole new functional and entertaining unit. With Bike Horn, users can perfectly mount their iPhone 6S or 6S Plus onto their bike handlebar or baby stroller with ease. Allowing them to use their phone in whichever way they please. For instance, they can listen to their music or a podcast. This patented design uses the principle of a reflex chamber to enhance the volume without any electricity, and now users can do hands-free voice or video calls while they are cruising on the path and enjoying a healthy lifestyle.\nThe Bike Horn offers incredible sound with easy installation. This portable amplifier doesn’t need any external power. It simply provides a hands-free option for philharmonic riders who like to enjoy the good sound, up to ten decibels, on the go. However, before everyone can enjoy the Bike Horn, Bone Collection needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $10,000 by Dec 7, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production and manufacturing.\nTo help bring this innovative, portable amplifier to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between December 2015 and January 2015.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Bone Collection reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Alan Tai\nTitle: Industrial Designer\nPhone: 646-580-9189\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
