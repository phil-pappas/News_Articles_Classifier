Photo: Bloomberg\nTwitter has announced that Jack Dorsey, one of the company's co-founders and the first person to run the social media company, has been named its fourth chief executive.\nDorsey, who is 38, will remain chief executive and chairman of Square, a mobile payments company that is preparing for an initial public offering of stock later this year. He will not take a salary for his new role at Twitter, according to a company securities filing [ pdf ].\n\"I am honoured by the trust the board has put in me to continue to run the company,\" Dorsey said during a conference call with Twitter investors. He said he would focus on three things: disciplined execution, simplifying the service and communicating Twitter's value to users.\nDespite initial concerns, big investors in both companies have grown comfortable in recent months with the idea of Dorsey juggling both jobs.\nAdvertisement Dorsey has pushed a faster pace of product improvement while serving as interim chief since Dick Costolo, the company's chief executive for about five years, stepped down July 1.\nPeter Currie, the director who headed the board's CEO search committee, said Dorsey's performance in the job persuaded the board to reverse its previous insistence that the next Twitter chief could run only one company.\n\"Over time, it became clear to us that Jack was not only meeting but surpassing our expectations of him as interim CEO while running Square,\" Currie said during the call.\nIn an interview, Currie said Dorsey showed he was an effective team leader, had a product vision and could recruit top talent. \"He's a bit of a Pied Piper,\" Currie said.\nAdam Bain, the company's president of global revenue and partnerships, who was widely considered to be in the running for the chief executive job, will become chief operating officer.\nThe appointment of Bain as chief operating officer made the board more comfortable that Dorsey could \"load balance,\" Currie said.\nCostolo also left Twitter's board of directors on Monday, the company announced, and Twitter is in the midst of finding a new, outside candidate for the role of chairman to serve on the board. Previously, Dorsey served as Twitter's chairman.\nThis week, Dorsey and other executives are also expected to preview for advertisers a new video product and a feature that will show top tweets by subject, code-named Project Lightning.\nTwitter has become a household name, with political leaders and celebrities around the world using the network to broadcast text messages and images to millions of followers. When news happens, word often spreads first on Twitter.\nBut the company has struggled to convey to ordinary people why they should regularly use the service, which carries roughly half a billion messages a day. Twitter has long lacked a product visionary, although Dorsey has tried to play that role while serving as Twitter's interim chief.\nTwitter is caught in the classic chicken-and-egg dilemma: The service is difficult to use unless you take time to choose relevant accounts to follow, but without obvious uses for it, no one will invest the time to set it up properly.\nThe company has tried to break out of the trap by offering casual visitors a taste of the \"best of Twitter\" on its home page before requiring that they create an account, and by setting up \"instant timelines\" of tweets based on who is on a person's cellphone contact list. Similarly, it has begun exploring the possibility of selling ads that would be shown to more casual visitors.\nSo far, it is too early for those nascent efforts to show results.", "external_links": ["http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2F526X/2923105498x7546672x853108/06CD5BC6-E0D1-491A-8690-E34CB72022A3/Twitter_Form_8-K_-_October_5_2015.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:12:49.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
