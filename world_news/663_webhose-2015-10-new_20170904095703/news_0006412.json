The company claimed the title of “Start-Up of the Year 2015” in France at a national gala held October 13 at the Opéra Garnier in Paris. This award follows Scality’s regional win in September, where the company was named “Start-Up of the Year 2015” for the Ile-de-France region. \nFor over 20 years, EY’s Entrepreneur Of The Year awards have honored individuals who make up the entrepreneurial ecosystem in France. In addition, the awards recognize disruptive young companies showing “high-potential” in the program’s Start-Up of the Year category. Scality wins the 2015 national award following 12 months of tremendous growth, notably a triple digit increase in global revenue and $45 million in funding , a round that included capital from returning French investors Idinvest Partners, Le Fonds Ambition Numérique, Iris Capital, and Omnes Capital and Galileo Partners. \n“This award is a true honor for me to accept on behalf of Scality, which is forever rooted in the French Tech culture that has been such a large contributor to our growth as a global company,” said Jerome Lecat, CEO of Scality. “Now with global headquarters in Silicon Valley and offices as far reaching as Tokyo and Boston, we have developed a customer base of more than 500 million users around the world and a network of partners that includes Dell and HP. This has given us the leverage to hire more employees here in France, where technology and innovation have an important role in fostering economic growth throughout our country.” \nLecat, a Board Member of France Digitale, is a longtime advocate for building a metaphorical bridge to Silicon Valley as a way to create new jobs in France. By relocating his own global headquarters to Silicon Valley in 2011, Lecat unlocked access to new and expanding global talent pools and enabled Scality to remain increasingly competitive in the software-based storage market. Today, Scality’s primary research and development center is based in Paris, in a brand new facility opened in October of 2015. Here, the company’s highly-scalable business model continues to create new opportunities for engineering professionals throughout Europe. \nCompeting at the national level against a number of exceptional and disruptive start-ups from seven major regions – East, Ile-de-France, Mediterranean, Northern France, West, Rhone-Alpes and Southwest – Scality, which was founded in Paris in 2009 by Lecat, Giorgio Regni, Daniel Binsfeld, Serge Dugas, and Brad King, was awarded the national “Start-Up of the Year” title by EY (Ernst & Young) and the French magazine L'Express . This year’s national results are revealed as 2014 national winner, French e-retailer Showroomprive.com, is expected to announce an IPO before the end of 2015. \nAbout Scality: \nScality is the leader in software-based storage for the Information Age.
