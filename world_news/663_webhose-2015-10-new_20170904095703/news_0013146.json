All you need to do is simply attach the electric wheel to the rear wheel of your bike and you are set to go. The attachment is completely plug & play and uses its own set of rechargeable batteries.\nWheezy is an electric auxiliary wheel that turns your regular bike into an e-bike. It attaches and detaches in a snap, saving you the money and space an e-bike costs. It incorporates a built-in charger, a battery pack, wheel adapters and a pedal assistance sensor. The attachment is compact, light weight and can be carried around like a simple suitcase. You can attach the wheel in a few seconds and you are set to go.\nThe only work that needs to be done on your bicycle is to attach the necessary sensors when you purchase it. Once done, the wheel can be plugged to the sensor cords when attached to the bike. The two sensors have to be mounted (only once, initially) at the pedal wheel and the handle for the throttle control.\nWheezy is an electric auxiliary all-terrain wheel. It operates on a brushless wheel hub motor that is entirely enclosed, protected from erosion. This means high efficiency, reliability, no noise, no maintenance and a long lifetime. Wheezy runs on a small lightweight NiMH battery pack used for hybrid vehicles. NiMH is much safer and lasts longer than the lithium (Li-ion) batteries used for standard e-bikes. It comes with a smart microcontroller, creating for smooth operation and utmost battery efficiency. Wheezy is encased in a lightweight steel chassis, a frame and running gear, making it much stronger and durable than its aluminum counterparts. Its zinc coating even prevents rusting.\nWheezy is scheduled to be launched in May 2016 and will ship all around the world. Prices are expected to be around Rs 49,000.\n latest gadgets e-bike Also Read Google pays tribute to APJ Abdul Kalam with 'Black Ribbon' Drug stores plan to protest against e-pharmacies Study break with a USB mini fridge NVIDIA's GRID ushers in era of Graphics Accelerated Virtualization", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ebike.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1246144376/wheezy", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Wheezy%20e-bike.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Wheezy%20e-bike.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ebikew.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ebike.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151017/technology-science-and-trends/article/convert-your-regular-bicycle-e-bike", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/e-bike.jpg", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1246144376/wheezy/widget/video.html", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:54:12.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
