(Nasdaq: UTEK), a leading supplier of lithography, laser -processing and inspection systems used to manufacture semiconductor devices and high-brightness LEDs (HBLEDs), as well as atomic layer deposition (ALD) systems, today announced that it has received a large multiple-system order from a leading semiconductor manufacturer for its advanced packaging AP300 lithography systems. The AP300 systems will be utilized for high-volume, fan-out wafer-level packaging (WLP) applications used to manufacture leading-edge chips. Ultratech will begin shipping the systems in Q4FY15 to the customer's facility in Taiwan. \nThe strong demand for thin mobile communication devices such as smartphones and tablets continues to drive growth in WLP. Due to the costs associated with 3D through-silicon via (TSV) architectures, industry analysts regard fan-out WLP as an effective solution for the highly demanding mobile and wireless market where the focus is on delivering high performance coupled with a small form factor. \nUltratech's General Manager and Vice President of Lithography Products Rezwan Lateef stated, \"Fan-out technologies provide a cost-effective packaging solution that enables smaller form factors, increased I/O density and excellent electrical and thermal performance. By working closely with our customers and continuing to invest in product R&D, Ultratech successfully addresses challenging fan-out issues, such as chip-to-mold non-planarity, die shift misalignment and wafer warpage, while providing outstanding cost-of-ownership. This major order clearly validates our technology leadership and the value proposition of our AP300 systems. We look forward to building on our relationship with this valued customer and supporting their aggressive technology roadmap for the next generation of mobile devices.\" \nThe Ultratech AP300 Family of Lithography Steppers The AP300 family of lithography systems is built on Ultratech's customizable Unity Platform(TM), delivering superior overlay, resolution and side wall profile performance and enabling highly-automated and cost-effective manufacturing. These systems are particularly well suited for Cu pillar, fan-out, through-silicon via (TSV) and silicon interposer applications. In addition, the platform has numerous application-specific product features to enable next-generation packaging techniques, such as Ultratech's award winning dual-side alignment (DSA) system, utilized around the world in volume production. \nSafe Harbor This release includes forward- looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
