Utilizing this innovative technology inmates have new ways to connect with friends and family, access content, occupy their time and manage their account. At the same time, the facility gains operational efficiencies and economical advantages through the systems’ automation of facility processes like inmate grievances and requests, as well as through the systems’ Telmate Investigator Tools, which turn data into actionable, crime-solving intelligence.\nThe ultra-secure Telmate Tablet solution features corrections-grade, locked-down devices, hotspots, and security servers and the device requires inmates to have a unique PIN for access.\nLocated in Muncie, Indiana, the Delaware County Sheriff’s Office is dedicated to serving the law enforcement needs of the county and surrounding communities. According to Jail Commander Rick Richman, “The addition of the new technology will push the jail to the forefront of corrections with the most advanced jail technology and communications available.”\n“We are very excited about bringing Telmate’s innovative technology to our jail,” Richman added. “Not only are we investing in cutting-edge technology for inmates to connect with loved ones, we are also introducing an effective behavior modification tool.”\nFacility staff have 24/7/365 web access and control of the Telmate Tablets and software services through a web-based admin interface called Telmate Command. Jail staff can log into the Telmate system using any web-enabled device including personal computers, tablets and smartphones.\nThe Telmate Tablets and suite of software services are currently deployed in over 35 facilities nationwide, generating over 3 million minutes of monthly usage.
