In addition to Walmart.com and Amazon, Target has added 22 more online competitors to their list. This also marks the first time that membership-only competitors like Costco and Sam’s Club have been included in the price matching offers. \nThe full list includes: Amazon.com, Babiesrus.com, BedBathBeyond.com, Bestbuy.com, BN.com, Buybuybaby.com, Costco.com, CVS.com, Diapers.com, DicksSportingGoods.com, Drugstore.com, Gamestop.com, JCPenney.com, Kmart.com, Kohls.com, Macys.com, Newegg.com, Officedepot.com, Petco.com, Petsmart.com, Samsclub.com, Sears.com, SportsAuthority.com, Staples.com, Target.com, Toysrus.com, Ulta.com. Walgreens.com, Walmart.com and Wayfair.com. \nTarget has also extended the price adjustment period to 14 days, both in stores and at Target.com. \nThe expansion of the price matching program highlights Target’s plan to ramp up its e-commerce business, which saw a 30 percent increase in Q3 2015. CEO Brian Cornwell, who took the helm in August 2014, also is proactively working to win market shares from its rivals. \nCompetitors Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Staples already have programs to match their online prices with online rivals. But Target's adjustment puts it ahead of other retailers like Toys R Us, which matches prices for in-store purchases with online rivals but only match their online prices with its own stores. \nLate last year, Wal-Mart formalized its policy of matching its store purchases with online prices found on sites like Amazon.com. It also matches its online prices with select online rivals. Walmart has also introduced its “Savings Catcher” app that allows shoppers to scan their receipts to find price matching deals from competitors. Like what you are reading?
