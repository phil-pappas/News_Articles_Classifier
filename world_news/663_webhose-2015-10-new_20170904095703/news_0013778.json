Why is it not covered by the OOTB application? What is the impact to the business (if not implemented)? What is the expected business benefit if implemented (which will include, but not limited to the above)? What are the impacted use cases? Will education / training be required or impacted (if already performed)? Can the process be adjusted using only configuration? Is there coding involved to alter the way the application works or behave? Has the vendor declared a plan to improve or include this in a future release and, if yes, when is it due? Who will perform the configuration / customization? How much will it cost to implement, support and de-customization (should it be required)? What is the impact of existing and future data quality, integrity and consistency (e.g. data to be migrated)? Is there an integration or data model impact? Who will be testing the configuration / customization? How will these changes affect future vendor upgrades? What kind of support will be needed? Is it part of the organization’s Intellectual Property? \nWhat are your thoughts?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:24:51.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
