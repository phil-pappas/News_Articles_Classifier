Distinguishable names are essential for tracking, reporting and discussion of specific product indications, contraindications or any potential adverse responses. To protect the hope these new agents offer in terms of better care and lower costs, clearly associating use and results accurately with each source, requires precise product identification.\" \nRegarding the labeling of biosimilars, the ASBM survey reveals that pharmacists want greater transparency than the FDA currently requires. When asked to rate from 1-5 the importance of certain information being included on a biosimilar's label, high percentages rated the following as a \"4\" or a \"5\", indicating high importance for inclusion: 81%: Identifying the product as a biosimilar 88%: Whether or not the biosimilar is interchangeable with (safely substitutable for) its reference product 76% In which approved indications the biosimilar was studied, and for which approval was based on extrapolation from studies in other indications 69% Distinguishing the source of data provided (originator product or biosimilar) \nNone of this information is currently present on the label of the only approved U.S. biosimilar, Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz). \n\"Pharmacists depend on the product label to advise patients and others on safe use, said Jordan. We hope these survey results positively inform the FDA as it drafts its upcoming labeling guidance.\" Dean Jordan , who has served as a member of the ASBM Advisory Board since 2012, presented some of the data at the WHO's 61 st Consultation on International Nonproprietary Names (INN) today in Geneva . \nThe full pharmacist survey, along with previous ASBM surveys, is available at www.safebiologics.org . \nAbout the Alliance for Safe Biologic MedicinesThe Alliance for Safe Biologic Medicines (ASBM) is an organization composed of diverse healthcare groups and individuals from patients to physicians, biotechnology companies that develop innovative and biosimilar medicines and others who are working together to ensure patient safety is at the forefront of the biosimilars policy discussion. \nFor more information, please contact: \nMichael Reilly Alliance for Safe Biologic MedicinesPhone: 202-222-8326", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:29:55.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
