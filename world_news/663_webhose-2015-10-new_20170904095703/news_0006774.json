The Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts announced the winners on September 23 after scoring entries on a 100-point scale.The awards, now in their tenth year, received over 5,000 entries from around the world. The W3 Awards is very prestigious. Most entries receive no recognition at all as the The Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts' judges are very selective. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151016/277932 \nCustom Legal Marketing faced a unique challenge when their long-time client, Littman Krooks , approached them about redesigning their website. The law firm practices corporate and securities law, estate planning, elder law, special needs planning and special education advocacy. With their diverse services comes a multi-demographic user base and the new website had to clearly communicate with all of the visitors that would be using the website. \nThe website redesign prioritizes easy navigation between the various practice areas. Each division has its own color scheme that complements the blue Littman Krooks logo, allowing the firm to keep the branding they had already established. The ease of navigation is consistent across the custom designed website. For example, on the Special Needs Planning page, visitors can switch between viewing the latest news on the topic, information about Littman Krooks' services and updates about upcoming events. \nA clean layout with drop-down menus at the top of the website provides prospective clients with access to the firm's large library of multimedia content and legal topics of interest. The new website showcases a broad range of supplementary resources that include videos, webinars, podcasts and blogs to help prospective clients better understand their legal options. \nLittman Krooks has been representing businesses and assisting families with planning for the future for 25 years. The website's organized attorney profiles introduce visitors to the firm's staff and founding partners -- Mitchell C. Littman and Bernard A. Krooks. \nThe Custom Legal Marketing team behind Littman Krook's award-winning website included Project Leader and Art Director Kristen Friend, Writers Brendan Conley and Alisha Corbitt, Editors Cara Tucker and Cristina Fries, Account Manager Jason Bland, and their team of supporting staff members. \n\"We are delighted to be recognized for this award. Custom Legal Marketing clearly understood our communication priorities,\" says Managing Partner Bernard A. Krooks. \nTo see the award-winning website, visit http://www.littmankrooks.com/ \nTo learn more about Custom Legal Marketing, visit http://www.customlegalmarketing.com/design/custom-website-design/ \nMedia Contact: Jason Bland, Custom Legal Marketing, 8007896451, jasonbland@customlegalmarketing.com \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:38:25.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
