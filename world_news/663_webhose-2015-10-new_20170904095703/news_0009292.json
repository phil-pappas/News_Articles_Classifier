We effectively turned a pharmaceutical problem into a physics problem.\"\nProfessor Reilly's team turned its attention to hyperpolarizing nano-diamonds, a process of aligning atoms inside a diamond so they create a signal detectable by an MRI scanner.\n\"By attaching hyperpolarized diamonds to molecules targeting cancers the technique can allow tracking of the molecules' movement in the body,\" says Ewa Rej, the paper's lead author.\n\"This is a great example of how quantum physics research tackles real-world problems, in this case opening the way for us to image and target cancers long before they become life-threatening,\" says Professor Reilly.\nThe next stage of the team's work involves working with medical researchers to test the new technology on animals. Also on the horizon is research using scorpion venom to target brain tumors with MRI scanning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:04:57.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
