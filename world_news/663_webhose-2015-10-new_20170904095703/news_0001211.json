Curation, reader behavior and social data together with Flipboard's powerful Topic Engine, which understands the content of articles, are the key elements of the social magazine's new Interest Graph Targeting. This launch signifies a next phase in Flipboard's advertising business as advertisers can now increase the relevancy of their full-page adds, Promoted Stories or Videos and Brand Magazines by placing them near related stories and by reaching people who are interested in this content. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20110630/SF28686LOGO-b \n\"Flipboard is well known for beauty and design, which is reflected in the presentation of content as well as advertising. We combine this beauty with 'brains': our deep understanding of the intricate connections between people, content and interests through our Interest Graph,\" said Mike McCue, Flipboard's co-founder and CEO. \"The Interest Graph powers content discovery on Flipboard and now, we're opening it up to our brand partners who want to get their messages in front of their audience in the right context as well as in the right mindset.\" \nInterest Graph Targeting combines the best of two worlds: contextual advertising and behavioral targeting, without their downsides. Instead of targeting individuals based on cookies and tracking them across the Internet, which is not a viable option on mobile devices, Flipboard's Interest Graph lets brands reach people based on billions of stories per month across thousands of publishers including the top premium publishers that users are reading, sharing, curating, liking, and discussing. \nContext Matters Interest Graph Targeting also ensures that ads appear in proximity to and in related content, making them interesting and relevant to the topic a person is reading about on Flipboard. Flipboard's ad data has historically shown strong performance when brand ads and branded content were aligned with relevant interest channels. Interest Graph Targeting further enhances this contextual targeting by giving advertisers access to all 34,000 Flipboard topics and using the billions of user data points. High-end brands, that place a premium on the placement of ads, can use Interest Graph targeting to ensure their ads appear in the appropriate context. \nFor instance, a retirement fund can target financial topics, and an airline can target different travel destinations; Flipboard's Interest Graph automatically knows all the related relevant topics omitting hours of research into keywords. \"We can go beyond the keyword to find like-minded people in broader contexts that will resonate with an advertiser's brand narrative,\" said Dave Huynh, head of ad product at Flipboard. \nAs Flipboard's audience grows--recently reaching 80 million monthly active users--advertisers increasingly seek out the platform to reach their audiences. To meet the growing interest from brands, the company has made advertising a key focus this year, expanding its ad formats and targeting capabilities. \nAbout Flipboard Flipboard gives people a single place to follow all of their interests. People use Flipboard to enjoy their favorite sources from around the world and then save stories, images, and videos into their own Flipboard magazines--sharing items that reflect their interests, express their perspectives, or are simply things they want to read later.
