This reading proves helpful when trying to troubleshoot lighter weight electrical issues in a fleet environment. The multimeter has the ability to read up to just 10 amps and anything more will blow the internal fuses. \nPurkeys Sales and Service Engineer Larry Rambeaux says that he is frequently asked about the practical uses for the different functions of a multimeter. \"Technicians would use the ammeter to check for a parasitic load,\" he says. \"This is a very easy way to check your batteries.\" If a load is staying on and pulling your batteries down then it is important to figure out what it might be. If not, it has to be a battery issue causing the problem. \nRunning the test is simple. First, the meter needs to be set up properly. The black lead stays connected to the common socket on the meter, while the red lead should be moved to the 10 amp socket. Turn the multimeter dial to the 10 amp range. \nTo learn more about using a multimeter to troubleshoot electrical issues, please visit our website .
