AT&T also has enhanced 18 West Lafayette and Lafayette cell sites this year by adding new layers of frequency or \"carriers,\" which is like adding more lanes to a highway carrying traffic from a customer's device to the cell tower, resulting in faster speeds and more reliable service. \n\"As the telecommunications sponsor for Purdue, we want to make sure our customers heading to the stadium to cheer on the Boilermakers have a great network experience throughout the game no matter what they're doing - making a call, sharing pictures on social media, or surfing the Internet,\" said Brian Ducharme, AT&T vice president and general manager Great Lakes Region, which includes Indiana. \"This continued investment in our wireless network helps customers at Ross-Ade Stadium and throughout the Lafayette and West Lafayette areas stay connected.\" \nThe stadium network upgrade consists of strategically placed antennas that distribute AT&T's wireless network coverage throughout Ross-Ade Stadium. It can provide stronger, more consistent wireless coverage to customers, so they don't have to worry about their service getting stuck in a traffic jam of other people's calls, texts and posts. \n\"Fans increasingly want to share memories with friends and family through social media, check stats and stay in touch during the game,\" said Purdue senior associate athletics director Tom Schott. \"We're thrilled to add to the fan experience with this investment by AT&T.\" \nAT&T invested nearly $2 billion in its wireless and wired networks in Indiana from 2012 to 2014, driving a wide range of upgrades to reliability, coverage, speed and performance for residents and business customers. \nAT&T constantly invests in its network to give customers the high-quality services they need to stay connected. AT&T is also adding the latest network technology, such as small cells, to ensure customers have wireless service where they need it most. \nDAS technology helps improve customers' wireless service by shortening the distance a request must travel. It's also expected to help improve call reliability and mobile Internet access to help customers make the most of their AT&T devices . \nThese investments help to ensure that Indiana residents get the best possible experience over the AT&T network, whether at home, at work or on the go. AT&T's network has the nation's strongest LTE signal,** and AT&T also has the nation's most reliable LTE network.*** \nOver the past six years (2009-2014), AT&T invested more than $140 billion including investments in its wireless and wireline networks, acquisitions of wireless spectrum and operations. Since 2009, AT&T has invested more in the United States than any other public company. In a September 2014 report, the Progressive Policy Institute ranked AT&T No. 1 on its list of U.S. \"Investment Heroes.\" \nFor more information about AT&T's coverage in Indiana or anywhere in the U.S., visit the AT&T Coverage Viewer .
