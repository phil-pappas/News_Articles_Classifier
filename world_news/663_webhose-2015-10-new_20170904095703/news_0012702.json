However, the Report reveals that DSR productivity continues to be a major management challenge. Technomic sees this as an issue that could be addressed by integrating online ordering technology with training targeted at helping DSRs assist their operator customers more strategically. \n\"Encouraging operators to utilize online ordering should allow more time for business strategy and problem solving,\" explains Bob Goldin, Technomic executive vice president. \"However, it has been clear over the years that operators value the fact that DSRs help with ordering and that this has become part of maintaining strong relationships.\" \nComparing recent survey responses from distributor executives and managers to those of five years ago, the 2015 Technomic DSR Benchmarking Report provides foodservice industry stakeholders insights for business planning. In addition to the profile of an \"average\" DSR, the report also explores: -- Time management obstacles among DSRs; -- The evolution of DSR responsibilities; -- DSR compensation, including incentives, recruitment and retention; -- Training tactics effective for both new and experienced DSRs; and -- Future expectations of DSRs. \nThe 2015 Technomic DSR Benchmarking Report is a service of Technomic's Distributor Intelligence Program.
