I figured I should search for some sort of lost and found keychain. At the time, I imagined this keychain to be accompanied by a remote that (if she didn’t misplace that too) could signal the keychain to sound off, in synchronized beeps, the location of the lost keys. I searched throughout the entire local mall, and found that this technology did not exist. Yet now, in 2015, it has been over a decade of technological innovation. This type of lost and found technology is widely available for the public to purchase, and works beyond keychains. \nKeychains to clip onto your precious “I-can-never-lose” items: \nHoney, from PebbleBee , is a Bluetooth enabled tracking device.
