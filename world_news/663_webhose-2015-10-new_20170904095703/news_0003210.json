Read this release for additional details.\nAUSTIN, TX (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nOnRamp, a leading high security and hybrid hosting provider, announced the publication of a new customer case study featuring Advanced Solutions International (ASI). The case study details the reasons why ASI chose to partner with OnRamp for secure colocation services .\nAdvanced Solutions International provides software solutions to associations and not-for-profits to help increase operational and financial performance. With corporate offices housed in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, ASI serves nearly 4,000 clients and millions of users worldwide. Faced with the need to support the power density of their growing IT environment, ASI began to evaluate hosting providers to move their on-premise development and software quality assurance resources to a secure colocation site. Evaluating several hosting providers in the Austin market, ASI chose OnRamp for the company's state-of-the-art facilities and ability to assist their customers with 24/7 hands-on support.\n\"To enable adequate power, cooling, physical and logical protection and connectivity from multiple Tier I Internet backbone providers over a fully meshed network, would be both costly and difficult to replicate in-house; by working with OnRamp, we are afforded all this and more,\" said Ben Gray, Network Operations Manager with ASI.\nIn addition to providing the highest levels of security, reliability and uptime to support their customers’ mission-critical operations, OnRamp’s experience delivering hybrid hosting solutions offers added benefit to colocation customers to both seamlessly integrate OnRamp’s private cloud and cloud delivered services into their existing environment and utilize the support of OnRamp’s experienced Full7Layer Support team.\n\"Of the six global colocation sites our business operates, OnRamp is among the top when it comes to the technical competency of their NOC staff,\" said Gray. \"Not only can they take specific instructions from me or the other members of my team, but they can troubleshoot and remediate issues just as well.\"\nFor more information about Advanced Solutions International's use of OnRamp’s secure colocation services, download the case study at: http://www.onr.com/free-colocation-resources/case-study-advanced-solutions-international/\nAbout OnRamp\nOnRamp provides computing infrastructure for companies that require high levels of security and availability.
