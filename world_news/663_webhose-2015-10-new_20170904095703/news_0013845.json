Instead, Amazon displays MTM Special Ops in the search field and immediately below the search field, but lists only similar watches manufactured by MTM's competitors for sale.\nLos Angeles-based MTM alleged this could cause customers to buy a competitor's watch, rather than encouraging them to look for MTM watches elsewhere.\nMTM sued in 2011, and a federal judge in Los Angeles resolved the trademark claims in favor of Amazon.com before trial. In July, the 9th Circuit ruled that MTM's lawsuit should be allowed to proceed.\nBut after Amazon.com asked for a rehearing, the panel withdrew the previous decision and on Wednesday said MTM's case fails.\n\"Because Amazon's search results page clearly labels the name and manufacturer of each product offered for sale and even includes photographs of the items, no reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would likely be confused as to the source of the products,\" the panel majority said in a 2-1 opinion.\nRepresentatives for Amazon.com and MTM could not immediately be reached.\nCircuit Judge Carlos Bea, however, dissented, saying that he believed an Amazon.com shopper looking for an MTM watch might initially think the watches on offer are affiliated with MTM.\nThe case in the 9th Circuit is Multi Time Machine Inc vs. Amazon.com Inc and Amazon Services LLC, 13-55575.
