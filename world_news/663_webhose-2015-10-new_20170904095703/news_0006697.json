Yahoo's email users can still continue to type in a password if they prefer. \nAlthough Yahoo email remains among the world's most popular, it has been eclipsed in recent years by Google's Gmail. Yahoo's email had 190 million user in August, a 16 percent decline from the same time last year, according to the research firm comScore. Gmail boasted 411 million, a five percent increase. \nThe updated app also will make it possible to connect Yahoo email with competing services from Outlook.com, Hotmail and AOL. The Sunnyvale, California, company hopes to make the app work with Gmail eventually, though it isn't giving a timetable for making it happen. \nAn update to the Gmail app earlier this year allowed its users to connect with Yahoo email and Microsoft's Outlook.com. \nThe app update is important to Yahoo because more than half of its email users primarily check their messages on mobile devices. Email users also are an important source of traffic at Yahoo's other major services, including sports, entertainment and finance that help sell the advertising that generates most of the company's revenue. \nYahoo's revenue has been declining or barely growing for years as advertisers pour more of their money into Google and Facebook.
