It will provide critical insights on CX budgets, strategies, technologies and processes that brands currently have in place, as well as plans for the future.\nThe 2014 CX Landscape report revealed that customer experience as a discipline was still in a nascent phase. Findings showed that, as a whole, a clear definition for what customer experience is and how it should be structured within organizations was lacking. Nearly one in five companies surveyed in 2014 said customer experience was not clearly defined within their organization or a definition was in progress. The 2015 study will show if brands have come to more clearly define customer experience and are aligning internally and externally to meet consumers’ expectations for it.\nThe 2015 CX Landscape report will also delve into customer experience performance, as measured by the brands and marketers. In 2014, just over half (51%) of marketers surveyed said their customer experience strategies were falling short of their goals.\n“Last year, it was evident that brands were struggling to define customer experience in an exhaustive, yet simple enough way that would unify their entire organization around the customer,” says Mark Johnson, CEO of Loyalty360. “With the explosion of marketing technology providers over the last year, many of them promising to activate customer data for more effective customer experiences and engagements, we are excited to see how marketers’ perspectives of CX have changed since 2014.”\nLoyalty360 is currently conducting survey research of marketers and customer experience practitioners to gather information about their customer experience strategies for the 2015 report.
