This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151020006261/en/ \nThis EPIC award highlights a real-world example of how Chief Financial Officers can gain a competitive edge by unlocking value from data. \nOne of Europe’s top banks had an ambitious vision. \nThe bank’s vision was to establish a single source of all business information that linked financial and non-financial data in a common enterprise data warehouse. \nThe bank’s goals were to: Establish a single source of detailed, granular finance data Enable best-in-class financial, management and regulatory reporting Empower finance and business teams to achieve transparency, control and consistency - serving a wide range of current and future information needs. \nThe bank evaluated multiple enterprise software providers’ technologies, but the joint solution from Aptitude Software and Teradata was a clear winner. \nUniquely, the joint solution was able to link a massive volume of detailed business data (e.g., trades, retail transactions, mortgage payments, etc.) directly with the firm’s financial books of record, thus greatly improving the validity and value of their data and the accuracy of reporting. \nData challenges and opportunities for CFOs \nInnovative companies understand that being truly data-driven is no longer optional. Unfortunately, many big data or analytical initiatives don’t help executives to drive profitability and improve financial results. \nCFOs at leading enterprises want to transform Finance to be forward-looking, strategic advisors to their businesses. \nUnfortunately, too many Finance teams get stuck delivering today’s reporting and don’t have the time or the tools to deliver forward-looking insights to business teams. \nAptitude Software’s EPIC award-winning project highlights how Finance teams can approach the challenge of establishing a data foundation to increase financial control and unlock insights. \nAbout the Teradata EPIC Awards \nThe Teradata EPIC awards are given for outstanding achievement in the use of data analytics to create business value and their contributions to business and technology. \nThe Enterprise Intelligence category (won by Aptitude Software) recognizes a partner who has worked with a customer to build a company-wide solution leveraging a Teradata enterprise data warehouse to drive value. The judges look for customers that achieve strategic data analysis that is accessed by different departments and a broad user base. The winning submission must be in production and producing positive results/ROI for the customer. \nExecutive perspective \n“By making it possible for enterprise finance teams to gain a holistic view of their data and generate value from it, Teradata and Aptitude Software are giving its customers a competitive edge” says Sean Slack, VP of Global Alliances at Teradata. \n“We’re proud to have been awarded the 2015 Teradata EPIC Award for Enterprise Intelligence for our work with a major European bank” states Tom Crawford, President of Aptitude Software. “The project highlights the potential of Finance teams to lead their organizations using warehouse-centric accounting hubs and sub-ledgers to deliver highly detailed, unquestionably-accurate, data-driven reporting and insights.” \nAdditional information on the Teradata EPIC Awards are available here \nAbout Aptitude Software \nAptitude Software is a finance software specialist, providing solutions for CFOs in many of the world’s largest companies.
