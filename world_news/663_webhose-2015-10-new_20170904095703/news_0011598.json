The demand and margins have weakened further in the Project Personnel business area. In addition, the earlier than expected completion of a major project in Canada will have a negative impact on Project Personnel’s net sales and EBITDA in the remaining months of the year. We continue to win market share and new Clients, but not enough to fully offset the above mentioned negative impact. \nNew guidance for 2015: Net sales are expected to be EUR 115-120 million and the EBITDA excluding non-recurring items EUR 1.0-1.5 million. \nPrevious guidance, released on May 28, 2015: Net sales are expected to be EUR 120-130 million and the EBITDA excluding non-recurring items EUR 1.5-2.5 million. \nDovre Group announced its merger with NPC in May 2015. NPC’s financials are reported as part of Dovre Group as of May 28, 2015. \n\nFor additional information, please contact: DOVRE GROUP PLC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:41:28.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
