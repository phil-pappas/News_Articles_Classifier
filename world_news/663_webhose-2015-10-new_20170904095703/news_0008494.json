Representing a Muslim boy, Ali, and a Christan Georgian princess, Nino, characters from Ali and Nino, a novel by Azerbaijani author Kurban Said, the figures draw closer, kissing, before continuing on their route and passing through one another, eventually parting and facing in opposite directions, representative of the characters’ separation by the invasion of Soviet Russia. The statues spring into life everyday at 7 pm in the seaside town of Batumi, Georgia, their journey happening slowly over 10 minutes. ‘Man and Woman’, re-christened “Ali and Nino”, was designed in 2007 but not installed until 2010 — it’s been delighting passers-by ever since. — The Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:02:25.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
