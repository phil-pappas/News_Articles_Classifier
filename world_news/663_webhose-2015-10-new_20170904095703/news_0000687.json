October 18, 2015 SANTA FE SPRINGS, Calif. — More than 100 golfers turned out for Agri-Turf Distributing’s inaugural Malcolm Stack Charity Golf Tournament hosted at Tustin Ranch Golf Club on Sept. 17, 2015. Participants represented suppliers and applicators in the specialty ag chemicals industry. This year’s tournament was generously supported by Bell Laboratories, Brandt, UC Irvine Health, Wilbur Ellis, Cool Terra and Zoecon. The tournament is named after the late Malcolm Stack, a leader in the pest control industry and founder of Bell Laboratories Inc. This year’s tournament was also dedicated to the memory of the late Tom Meany, founder of Orange County Pest Control, and leader in California’s pest control industry. Golfers enjoyed a shot gun best ball start. After play, participants returned to the club house for an evening hospitality, silent auction, and barbecue dinner. In total, the event raised over 40,000 for the American Cancer Society. Kristen Thompson, Senior Director of Community Engagement for the Orange County American Cancer Society said, “This event far exceeded our expectations. We are so appreciative of Lon Records, and the Agri-Turf team, for organizing a turn-key tournament. The funds raised will support cancer research and patient support programs.” (Pictured, from left to right, Lon Records, Agri-Turf Distributing; Tadd Heitmann, American Cancer Society; Rich Records, Agri-Turf Distributing, Bob Zollars, Frazier Health Care, and Kristen Thompson, American Cancer Society.)
