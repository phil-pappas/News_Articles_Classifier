Between the turn of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first, they wrote, annual waste production increased by a factor of ten. It is projected to double again by 2025, at which point we will be creating enough trash every year to fill a line of trucks that stretches from Seattle to Boston.\nThe photographer Stephen Wilkes has been documenting some of the side effects of the crisis for years, including in the aftermath of natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy. “Remnants,” an exhibition of his work, will be on view at Monroe Gallery , in Santa Fe, New Mexico, through November 22nd.\nWatch: A radioactive site in Queens that may become New York City’s next Superfund site.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.monroegallery.com/", "http://www.stephenwilkes.com/", "http://www.nature.com/news/environment-waste-production-must-peak-this-century-1.14032"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:47:32.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
