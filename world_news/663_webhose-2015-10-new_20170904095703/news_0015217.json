For parents who feel like their children get a little too much candy on Halloween, here is the perfect fix. This year, Mommy Nearest has partnered with The Switch Witch to help families celebrate the season without all that added sugar. The Switch Witch and the Magic of Switchcraft is a children’s story of a witch whose broom is fueled by Halloween candy. Post trick-or-treating, The Switch Witch comes to trade kids’ candy in exchange for toys, making families’ holidays a bit healthier.\n“The Switch Witch's job of \"Switchcrafting\"—aka trading—candy for books or toys will allow parents to further instill good behavior. We are not anti-candy, but we are all about teaching and modeling good choices!” says Audrey R. Kinsman, creator of The Switch Witch.\nThe Switch Witch encourages parents to send the candy to Operation Shoebox, an organization that sends care packages to US Troops overseas. And this year, Mommy Nearest is going to help make that a whole lot easier! To celebrate the holiday and as a way to give thanks, there will be free playdates at top children's venues in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and the Bay Area for families that want to participate in this new Halloween tradition. Click here to RSVP.\nKids can bring their Halloween candy to these playdates and exchange it for toys from Cra-z-art . In addition, all attendees will get healthy snacks from Love Child Organics. The first 30 families at each event will also receive a gift bag stuffed with their very own Switch Witch and giveaways from UrbanSitter, Babyganics, Cra-z-art, Kidsland and Gum Chucks.\n“Halloween is a great time of year for all families to get out and do fun activities together. That’s why we’re thrilled to partner with The Switch Witch to help put a healthy twist on such a fun holiday.” says Josh Milstein, CEO and founder of Mommy Nearest.\nMommy Nearest will also have drop-off locations in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and the Bay Area for families who can’t make it to a playdate. Regardless, kids can still bring their candy and will receive a toy.\nInformation on the events and drop off locations in each city can be found here .\nAbout Mommy Nearest\nThe mobile app provides busy parents and caregivers with unique content and geography-based, word-of-mouth recommendations, helping them to easily make informed decisions of where to take the kids while on-the-go.
