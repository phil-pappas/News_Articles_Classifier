By bringing devices on to the shop floor, retailers can also convert potential 'window shoppers' into loyal customers, with recent research from Deloitte also proving that consumers who interact with a device during their shopping journey convert at a 40% higher rate. There are no longer any excuses for retailers when customers leave without making a purchase as a result of being left frustrated by poor customer experience.\" \nThe survey also revealed further irritations experienced by shoppers when queuing. More than a quarter (27%) said they are annoyed by fellow shoppers as they wait for the queue to move, with barging in, saving places and public displays of affection among the most common complaints. \nNearly one in five shoppers (19%) has an argument with a partner or friend while queuing. \n\"In today's customer-centred world, retailers must have the right customer engagement technology in place to free staff from the till and allow them to give shoppers a stress-free and pleasurable experience that will boost sales,\" added Parmar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:31:51.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
