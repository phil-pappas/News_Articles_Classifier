Marcy Kaptur, D-Toledo.\nAn overview of the 24-acre area of former steel mill dumping grounds targeted for clean up on the Black River. James F. McCarty/The Plain Dealer The news was delivered at a morning press conference at Black River Landing park, with a gathering of politicians and environmental officials, and a backdrop of chattering kingfishers, diving gulls and cruising fishing boats.\nKaptur said she is looking forward to \"cleaning up the messes of the past and turning over a restored Black River to future generations that's in much better shape than it's in now.\"\nThe $15 million grant money will be spent over the next two years to remove 24 acres of contaminated sediment from the Black River floodplain, and to create in-stream habitat for native fish and other aquatic species, said Kathryn Hoffmann, storm water manager for the city of Lorain.\nKathryn Hoffmann, Lorain's storm water manager, said the ultimate goal of the clean-up project is to see the Black River delisted as a national toxic hot spot. James F. McCarty/The Plain Dealer The project also involves the removal of more than 500,000 cubic yards of steel mill byproducts from the river floodplain, she said. The site targeted for cleanup contains waste brick and drum disposal areas, an old sludge pond, and a field of wet slag. Much of the material is contaminated, but not hazardous, and will be either recycled or disposed of in a new, on-site landfill, Hoffman said.\nThe target area is contained within about 300 acres of steelyard dumping grounds turned over to the city in the early 2000s.\nThe new Great Lakes grant comes in addition to $23 million already invested in the Black River cleanup and restoration efforts, said Jennifer Kurko, assistant chief of the Ohio EPA's Northeast District Office.\nThe Great Lakes Restoration Initiative was launched in 2010 to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the largest system of fresh surface water in the world — the Great Lakes.\nThe grant money is used to target the largest threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem and to accelerate progress toward long-term goals for this ecosystem.\nOther GLRI grants have been used to help clean up the Ashtabula River, the Maumee River and the Mentor Marsh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:45:37.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
