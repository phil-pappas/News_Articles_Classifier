Now users can immediately access the unlimited closet sitting in their pockets from the comfort of their own home, all while saving time and money spent. Not to mention avoiding overcrowded shopping malls and sifting through endless racks of product. The LE TOTE app is now the easiest, most convenient way to completely upgrade your wardrobe in a stylish and budget friendly way. \nAs LE TOTE continues to grow, it has seen over 60 percent of its traffic come from the mobile web. Coupled with feedback from users, the company recognized that an essential element of the customer experience was the ability to customize tote selections on-the-go. LE TOTE used these insights to create one of the most personalized ecommerce apps on the market that completely changes the way iPhone users interact with LE TOTE. \nWith the LE TOTE mobile app, users can: Access exclusive mobile collections from their favorite fashionistas and stylish influencers Conveniently customize and confirm the three garments and two accessories included in their next shipment while on-the-go Utilize the fit feedback bar which advises customers on size and fit while outlining specific reasons a garment or size may or may not be suitable for the individual View the 7-day weather forecast based on the estimated day they will receive their tote, to help inform product selection See products and styles trending around them based on their current location Find their fashion love match via an engaging “Tinder-esque” feature by swiping through new arrivals during onboarding – makes shopping quicker, easier and more fun! Quickly explore style recommendations based on different life events – office, happy hour, date night, etc. Provide more specific feedback on the items they receive through an optimized ratings process \nOn the heels of iOS 9, LE TOTE’s app is also one of the first retail fashion apps to incorporate updated capabilities with features including: App Spotlight Search - Search for clothing and accessories using Spotlight on your iPhone and tap search results to view products directly in the LE TOTE app. Universal Links – Over time, support will be added for using normal web URLs to deep link into the app rather than opening in Safari. \n“As we focus on more on-demand offerings and customizable experiences, mobile is becoming increasingly important,” said Brett Northart, President and Co-founder of LE TOTE. “Now there’s no longer a need to wait until you get home to your computer or have spare time at work to update your closet and next tote. Our app creates a fast, seamless experience providing our customers with the personalized closet at their fingertips that they’ve been looking for.” \nProviding a customized mobile solution also gives users and brands more immediate access to data and revolutionizes the way LE TOTE communicates and interacts with its customers. This individually-tailored mobile experience is based on thousands of data points including customer style profiles, measurements, and customer closets that inform the company’s proprietary algorithms. LE TOTE is also able to provide participating brands with real-time insight on how women are responding to products while customizing the LE TOTE experience more than any other subscription box on the market. \nThe LE TOTE app, designed and developed in collaboration with Prolific Interactive, is available for free in the Apple iTunes Store at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/le-tote/id998774685?ls=1&mt=8 . \nAbout LE TOTE \nSan Francisco-based LE TOTE was founded in 2012 by Brett Northart and Rakesh Tondon, who aimed to replicate the offline behavior of swapping and sharing clothes via a national, online service.
