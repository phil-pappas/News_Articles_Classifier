The market-leading companies are integrating their applications and services on mobile devices, desktop, and the web for faster and more seamless access to all of the mission-critical content stored as PDF files. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151012006175/en/ \nWith this partnership, customers of Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Acrobat Reader —used on over one billion mobile devices and desktop computers worldwide—can access and take common actions on over 18 billion PDF files stored in Dropbox directly from within the Adobe apps. Dropbox users can open, edit, and save changes to PDF documents in the Adobe apps directly from the Dropbox website, iOS app, or Android app. The integration addresses a strong need, as PDF is the most common business file type in Dropbox. \n“As the inventor of PDF, Adobe brings over 20 years of experience with secure digital documents,” said Kevin M. Lynch, senior vice president and general manager of Adobe Document Cloud at Adobe. “The requirements of our customers have constantly evolved over time; today, mobile has become the rule and people expect to complete work quickly and simply wherever and whenever they need. Our work with Dropbox, as our first file sync and share partner, will help Adobe Document Cloud customers and people around the world be more productive with the documents at the center of their daily lives.” \n“At Dropbox, our goal is to simplify the way people work together,” said Dennis Woodside, Chief Operating Officer at Dropbox. “We provide the world’s simplest, most powerful collaboration platform for the creative and entrepreneurial lives of our 400 million users. They want to edit PDF files on-the-go, gather feedback from their team—even collect signatures for a contract—on any device. Partnering with Adobe helps our users work better together.” \nThe new integration will help users of Adobe and Dropbox products to: Access and share files quickly . With a few simple taps or clicks in the free Acrobat Reader mobile app or Acrobat DC on desktop, users can view and take additional actions on PDF files stored in their Dropbox Basic, Pro and Dropbox for Business accounts. Any changes are automatically saved back to Dropbox. Once completed, it’s simple to share the updated file using a Dropbox link or shared folder. Edit and collaborate more simply . Users can open a PDF file from the Dropbox website, iPhone or iPad app, and edit with Acrobat DC on desktop or Acrobat Reader mobile while on-the-go. With the Adobe apps, anyone can highlight, annotate or add comments to the document. Acrobat DC users can also complete a full range of tasks on the PDF files, including editing text, organizing pages, or converting the documents to their original format. The new version of the file can then be shared with colleagues or friends directly from Dropbox to collaborate further. These capabilities build on existing integration between Adobe eSign services and Dropbox, which enables users to access, track and sign PDF files stored in Dropbox. Sync documents everywhere . Ensure PDF files, and the changes you make to them in Adobe apps, are always synced in Dropbox, whether you’re on a mobile device, the web, or in front of a computer. \nAvailability \nStarting today, users worldwide can add their Dropbox account in Acrobat DC or Acrobat Reader on desktop. The iOS integrations between Acrobat Reader and Dropbox will be available in the coming months, with Android and web integrations to follow in 2016. \nHelpful Links:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:03:23.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
