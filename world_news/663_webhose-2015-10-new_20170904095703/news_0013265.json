Now, as they grow, YC Continuity may choose to participate in later funding rounds. \nSam Altman, president of Y Combinator and a former participant in the programme, said YC would start by using its new funds to invest pro rata in every YC company in every round with a valuation lower than $300m. \n“YC will fund its 1,000th company this year, and many of these companies are now scaling their organisations, revenue, and operations,” he said . “Though years removed from our program, these founders continue to come to YC for advice and support, and we would like to do more to help them.” \nThe YC Continuity round will operate more like a conventional VC firm, competing for investments when a company is more established and sometimes taking seats on start-ups’ boards. \nThe launch comes as more and more funds are being invested in late-stage private technology companies in the Bay Area, with many putting off going public. \nCompanies such as Uber, last valued at $50bn, and Airbnb , with a valuation of at least $24bn, are receiving investments from companies far beyond traditional VC firms, including fund managers such as Fidelity and Wellington Management, as well as other technology companies including Google and Baidu. \nSupport for start-ups: Y Combinator’s non-profit mission \nFour start-ups outline how the prestigious San Francisco incubator helped raise their sights \nRead more \nBill Gurley, a venture capitalist with Benchmark Capital, who has warned of a bubble in the technology industry, said last week that the difference between now and the dotcom boom, is that funding in 2015 is more concentrated in a handful of companies. \nBut a new fund from a group of Chinese private equity investors his week set aside $400m for very early investments in new businesses in the US, through AngelList , an online service for organising seed investments. \nMr Rowghani said that YC would not be competing with the early stage VCs who often fund its companies seed or series A rounds. \n“As we all know, good companies are staying private longer, and the market for private growth capital has grown considerably. These later stage rounds tend to be larger, shared rounds rather than winner-take-all,” he wrote in a blog post . Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
