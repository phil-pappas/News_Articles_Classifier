Electronic citations, or e-citations, allow code, parking and traffic enforcement officers to print legible tickets on the spot while seamlessly transmitting digital information about the incident to municipal, police and court records management systems. \n“The benefits of electronic citation are exceptional,” said Steve Rauschenberger, executive director of the eCitation Coalition. “Local governments are able to both better maximize their operations and drive gains in revenue collection at a time when municipalities are being asked to do more with less.” \nRauschenberger noted that municipal code, parking and law enforcement officers issue millions of citations every year. With electronic citation technology, a citation is generated using a handheld computer, tablet or scanner in combination with a mobile printer. This enables employees to be significantly more efficient as costly errors are reduced and revenue lost to data entry and legibility problems is recaptured. For ticket writing agencies, the means that officers spend more time on performing “core mission” work and less time on paperwork. \nSeparate from code enforcement, eCitation is of great benefit to law enforcement as the officer is able to stop a traffic offender and issue a ticket in a safer, more efficient way. In a law enforcement context, this means less officer time standing on dangerous roadsides in traffic and it means tickets that are legible, accurate and more likely to stand up in court. For those receiving the ticket, it means quicker turnaround time as well as less time sitting parked on a potentially hazardous roadside. \n“This technology has completely revolutionized the ticketing process,” stated panelist Mitch Urbanczyk of Zebra Technologies. “By eliminating paperwork and reducing the need for manual data entry, eCitation creates significant savings that can be realized in way that makes the overall citation procedure safer and more efficient for code, parking and law enforcement professionals. Additionally, eCitation technology also puts previously lost revenue back into municipal and county coffers.” \nBeyond the law enforcement and citizen benefits, court systems linked to municipal and county e-citation systems gain efficiencies as citations are transmitted within minutes, instead of the days. Being able to handle traffic and parking citations quickly and efficiently enables both court personnel and law enforcement officers to focus on higher value work that benefits citizens and taxpayers, including more time focused on assisting and protecting citizens. \nThe eCitation Coalition has been working with various state governments, counties and municipalities in advancing polices which support the adoption of this important technology. Several states, including Illinois, Tennessee, Virginia and Wyoming, have passed laws which provide a small offender-based subsidy that assist local governments and court systems in procuring e-citation technology. \nAbout the eCitation Coalition \nThe eCitation Coalition represents the full spectrum of companies involved in providing innovative electronic citation systems to state and local law enforcement and court systems. Members include value-added resellers and independent software vendors as well hardware manufacturers and distributors. The mission of the eCitation Coalition is to educate policymakers, law enforcement and judicial officials, the public and the media on the multiple benefits of this exciting technology.
