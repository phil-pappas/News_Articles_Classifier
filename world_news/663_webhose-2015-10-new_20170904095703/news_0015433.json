RURO is one of the very few LIMS providers with this status, demonstrating its strong commitment to quality. The certification comes amid a wave of enhanced procedures and service offerings that demonstrate the provider’s commitment to better end-results for its laboratory business customers. Few LIMS Provider organizations have achieved ISO 9001 Certification RURO’s ISO 9001 Certified Quality Management System (QMS) demonstrates the company’s strong commitment to optimized service and systems for its customers RURO offers a variety of Quality and Compliance services that allow customers to centralize LIMS design, deployment and validation Building on a new QMS informally adopted in early 2014, the process of receiving ISO 9001:2008 certification took RURO roughly two years and engaged more than half of its US-based staff as active participants. RURO is happy to have spent the effort, as it has seen a steady progression in measured performance since the early adoption of key procedures and tracking methods. Performance improvements include decreased Support Department response and issue resolution times, among others measured as a part of RURO’s ISO 9001 certification that have a direct impact on customer experience. “RURO was founded in 2006 with great software engineering as the goal. It has always achieved this objective, propelled by its engineer-leadership,” says Tom Dolan, RURO’s Chief Operating Officer. “ISO 9001 is especially important because of that background. Today, we are certified to be offering great everything.” Since 2014, select customers have received validation and other quality related services from RURO. In announcing its ISO 9001 certification, RURO is now offering these services to all customers, who can leverage RURO’s expertise in developing system requirements, installation and operational qualification, configuration specifications and other documentation to fulfill quality needs associated with their LIMS, or other sample management deployment, all from a single provider. “We want to be the most valuable strategic partner that our customers have,” says Vlad Lebedev, RURO’s CEO and Systems Architect. “ISO 9001 certification shows our dedication to this ideal.” About ISO 9001 Certification ISO 9001:2008 specifies requirements for a quality management system whereby an organization demonstrates its ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, while enhancing customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for continual improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
