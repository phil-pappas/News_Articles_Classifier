Did the government think about all the things it will touch on? I don’t know.”\nPeter Bradd said that it was great news that Minister Pyne has been tasked with creating a national ­innovation agenda, and that so far the signs were positive that the government would follow through on its mantra of having “everything on the table”, including 457 visas, entrepreneur visas, and amending ASIC legislation.\nLike Bradd, Hallam called on the government to adopt best-practice strategies from other economies, namely Britain, which offers R&D corporation tax relief as part of a host of innovation ­incentives.\n“A couple of years ago Pollenizer witnessed an increase in early stage start-up investment but those investors have now backed off, due to receiving very little ­support,” she said.\n“These investors now prefer to invest at a later, safer stage. If there had been better tax breaks those investors may have continued to back early-stage ideas.”\nThe government is set to tackle innovation policy head on with its one-day policy hackathon, to be held at start-up accelerator BlueChilli this Saturday.\nMr Bradd said he was hopeful the event, to be hosted by Assistant Minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy, would be the first step in delivering tangible technology policy outcomes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:32:13.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
