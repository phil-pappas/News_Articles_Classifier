Most agree that an asteroid collision 65 million years ago brought ... Plants survive better through mass extinctions than animals February 17, 2015 \nAt least 5 mass extinction events have profoundly changed the history of life on Earth. But a new study led by researchers at the University of Gothenburg shows that plants have been very resilient to those events. Does dark matter cause mass extinctions and geologic upheavals? February 19, 2015 \nResearch by New York University Biology Professor Michael Rampino concludes that Earth's infrequent but predictable path around and through our Galaxy's disc may have a direct and significant effect on geological and biological ... How can dark matter cause chaos on Earth every 30 million years? April 1, 2015 \nIn 1980, Walter Alvarez and his group at the University of California, Berkeley, discovered a thin layer of clay in the geologic record, which contained an unexpected amount of the rare element iridium. Mass extinction survival is more than just a numbers game August 11, 2015 \nWidespread species are at just as high risk of being wiped out as rare ones after global mass extinction events, says new research by UK scientists. Asteroid impact, volcanism were one-two punch for dinosaurs October 1, 2015 \nBerkeley geologists have uncovered compelling evidence that an asteroid impact on Earth 66 million years ago accelerated the eruptions of volcanoes in India for hundreds of thousands of years, and that together these planet-wide ... Recommended for you New 'geospeedometer' confirms super-eruptions have short fuses October 20, 2015 \nRepeatedly throughout Earth's history, giant pools of magma greater than 100 cubic miles in volume have formed a few miles below the surface. Scientists find link between comet and asteroid showers and mass extinctions October 20, 2015 \nMass extinctions occurring over the past 260 million years were likely caused by comet and asteroid showers, scientists conclude in a new study published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Formation of coastal sea ice in North Pacific drives ocean circulation and climate October 20, 2015 \nAn unprecedented analysis of North Pacific ocean circulation over the past 1.2 million years has found that sea ice formation in coastal regions is a key driver of deep ocean circulation, influencing climate on regional and ... Sunscreen is proven toxic to coral reefs October 20, 2015 \nLathering up with sunscreen may prevent sunburn and protect against cancer, but it is also killing coral reefs around the world. Methane from fracking sites can flow to abandoned wells, new study shows October 20, 2015 \nAs debate roils over EPA regulations proposed this month limiting the release of the potent greenhouse gas methane during fracking operations, a new University of Vermont study funded by the National Science Foundation shows ... Life on Earth likely started 4.1 billion years ago—much earlier than scientists thought October 19, 2015 \nUCLA geochemists have found evidence that life likely existed on Earth at least 4.1 billion years ago—300 million years earlier than previous research suggested. The discovery indicates that life may have begun shortly ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:37:05.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
