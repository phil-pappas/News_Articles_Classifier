Time for cyberattack conversation on automated cars November 13, 2014 \nJonathan Petit and Steven E. Shladover have written a paper for the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems that sends a message about the potential of cyberattacks in automated vehicles. Self-driving cars vulnerable to cyberattack, experts warn June 1, 2015 \nHackers pose a real danger to self-driving vehicles, US experts are warning, and carmakers and insurers are starting to factor in the risk. Data exchange between vehicles and the road network increases traffic safety July 2, 2015 \nThe just-completed international Celtic Plus CoMoSeF project involved the development of data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure. The resulting communication system provides drivers with real time information on ... We're only just starting to understand the side-effects of driverless cars August 4, 2015 \nThe dawn of driverless cars is almost upon us. Governments around the world are rapidly legalising the use of driverless vehicles on their roads and are working towards overcoming regulatory difficulties associated with their ... Apple explores rules of the road for self-driving cars September 19, 2015 \nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) on Friday said that it met with Apple to discuss rules of the road regarding testing self-driving cars. Recommended for you System that replaces human intuition with algorithms outperforms human teams October 16, 2015 \nBig-data analysis consists of searching for buried patterns that have some kind of predictive power. But choosing which \"features\" of the data to analyze usually requires some human intuition. In a database containing, say, ... Engineers create artificial skin that can send pressure sensation to brain cell October 15, 2015 \nStanford engineers have created a plastic \"skin\" that can detect how hard it is being pressed and generate an electric signal to deliver this sensory input directly to a living brain cell. Affordable camera reveals hidden details invisible to the naked eye October 15, 2015 \nPeering into a grocery store bin, it's hard to tell if a peach or tomato or avocado is starting to go bad underneath its skin. Artificial whisker reveals source of harbor seal's uncanny prey-sensing ability October 15, 2015 \nHarbor seals have an amazingly fine-tuned sense for detecting prey, as marine biologists have noted for years. Even when blindfolded, trained seals are able to chase the precise path of an object that swam by 30 seconds earlier. ... 3-D-printed 'soft' robotic tentacle displays new level of agility (w/ Video) October 15, 2015 \nCornell University engineers have developed a method to re-create the arrangement of muscles of an octopus tentacle, using an elastomer and 3D printer. Rear-ending drivers add up in DMV self-driving accident reports October 11, 2015 \nThe first thoughts expressed when the world learned that Google was experimenting with driverless cars included a fair share of OMGs.
