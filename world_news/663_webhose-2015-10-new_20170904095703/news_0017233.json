This comprehensive, cloud-based, geospatial platform seamlessly integrates the functions of situational awareness, risk management, force protection and internal communications; includes 24/7/365 global incident monitoring by trained analysts; and consolidates information to provide the operational insight needed to identify, assess and mitigate risk.\nThis week iMapData is showcasing AIMS at MILCOM 2015, the annual international conference for military communications. At MILCOM, leaders from around the world will address the critical role communications plays in military readiness and operations. iMapData has been working with the Department of Defense for decades, providing the tools and datasets to help solve these complex challenges. AIMS integrates targeted real-time information with the data most needed to identify, respond to and track critical issues. The military community uses AIMS to identify suspicious patterns, track assets and respond to terrorist and natural threats – as well as strategize and plan initiatives. AIMS provides the right information at the right time for an effective and safe response that ultimately protects assets and saves lives.\niMapData will also present its recently unveiled AIMS Mobile Threat Dashboard at MILCOM. This Mobile Dashboard delivers threat awareness right to a smartphone, providing instant notification of incidents both globally and around the user’s current location. Whether at home or on the road, users easily access nearby incidents as well as a variety of both current and historical reports via the mobile app. Both the AIMS web-based and mobile platforms provide an instant visualization of situational awareness driven by an agency’s configured business rules.\nThe iMapData Advanced Intelligence Management System has been deployed to customers across state and federal agencies and Fortune 500 organizations. AIMS fuses and transforms vast amounts of complex data from multiple sources into actionable intelligence, providing accurate real-time situational awareness to support coordinated response, continuity of operations and public safety.
