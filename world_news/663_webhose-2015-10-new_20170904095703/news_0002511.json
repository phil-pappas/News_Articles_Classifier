Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Business has evolved to provide a centrally deployed, administered and monitored layer of threat protection and malware remediation that can be seamlessly added to existing security infrastructures. \nIt is engineered to work alongside existing antivirus solutions, using its unique zero-day and polymorphic protection platform to deliver a new generation of real-time security for companies of all sizes. \n“We’re honored to be recognized by Silicon Valley Business Journal as one of the fastest growing private companies in this exciting market,” said Marcin Kleczynski, co-founder and CEO of Malwarebytes. “The worldwide threat of cyber criminality has never been greater. We’re focused on giving our customers a malware-free existence, and every one of our offerings brings us closer to that reality. We’re privileged to join the other companies on this elite list, and we thank Silicon Valley Business Journal for this honor.” \nThe recognition from Silicon Valley Business Journal adds to the list of honors Malwarebytes has been granted in the last few months. Earlier this year, the company was named a finalist in the SC Magazine Awards for outstanding leadership and achievement in information security. Specifically, Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit was recognized in the Best Vulnerability Management Category. \nThe company is in the #1546 spot in the Inc. 5000 listing of the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. The Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth over a four-year period. To qualify, companies must have been founded and have generated revenue by the first week of the starting calendar year, and therefore able to show four full calendar years of sales. Additionally, they had to be U.S.-based, privately held, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31 of the last year measured. Revenue in the initial year must have been at least $200,000, and revenue in the most recent year must have been at least $2 million. \nMalwarebytes has been specifically designed to offer the advanced layer of defense to prevent and remediate attacks that firewalls and antivirus solutions miss. Cybercriminals are also increasingly using zero-day vulnerabilities developed by well-resourced criminal teams to breach large organizations, a problem addressed by Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit. \nMore information on Malwarebytes enterprise products can be found on the company website . \nAbout Malwarebytes \nMalwarebytes provides software designed to protect consumers and businesses against malicious threats that consistently escape detection by other antivirus solutions.
