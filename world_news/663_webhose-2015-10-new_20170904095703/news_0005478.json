Besides Singapore, it has units in Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Kenya, Vietnam, Cambodia and Dubai. \nThe development was first reported by The Economic Times . The report said, citing Attune CEO Arvind Kumar, that the funding will help the company extend its services to 25,000 labs and hospitals in the next three years. \nKumar did not respond to a Techcircle.in query till the time of filing this report. \nThis is Qualcomm’s first investment from its $150-million strategic fund meant for Indian startups. The fund was announced after a meeting between Qualcomm’s executive chairman Paul E Jacobs and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the latter’s visit to the US last month. \nAttune was founded IIM Calcutta alumnus Kumar along with Ramakrishnan and Mohanaraj P. in 2009. Kumar had earlier worked with iSOFT, Philips Innovation Campus and DSQ Software. \nAttune provides HealthKernel, a web-based platform for hospitals that integrates all departments and branches which are geographically separated.

Attune has presence in 200 hospitals and has connected 10,000 diagnostic devices. It holds data for 10 million patient records. \nIn 2012, it had raised $6 million (Rs 32.6 crore) from multi-stage investment firm NVP. \nQualcomm Ventures said it will back more companies like Attune. “Given the opportunity in India, we will do more. We will lead more rounds, write more cheques,” said Karthee Madasamy, vice president at Qualcomm Ventures India. \nMadasamy also said that the new fund would invest in sectors such as robotics, drones, healthcare, education, retail, payments and mobile platforms over the next five years. \nQualcomm has been investing in Indian startups since 2007 and more than 20 Indian companies including Housing.com, Portea, AppsDaily and Capillary Technologies are part of its global portfolio.
