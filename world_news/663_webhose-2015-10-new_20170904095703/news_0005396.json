On the ninth business day of each month it provides a flash estimate of the gross aggregate performance of funds for which SS&C GlobeOp provides monthly administration services on the SS&C GlobeOp platform. Interim and final values, both gross and net, are provided in each of the two following months, respectively. Online data can be segmented by gross and net performance, and by time periods.

Its inception date is January 1, 2006 .\nThe SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Performance Index offers a unique reflection of the return on capital invested in funds. It does not overstate exposure to, or the contribution of, any single strategy to aggregate hedge fund performance. Since its inception, the correlation of the SS&C GlobeOp Performance Index to many popular equity market indices has been approximately 25% to 30%. This is substantially lower than the equivalent correlation of other widely followed hedge fund performance indices.\nSS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index\nThe SS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index represents the monthly net of hedge fund subscriptions and redemptions administered by SS&C GlobeOp on the SS&C GlobeOp platform. This monthly net is divided by the total assets under administration (AuA) for fund administration clients on the SS&C GlobeOp platform.\nCumulatively, the SS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index for September 2015 stands at 145.86 points, an increase of 0.64 point over August 2015 . The Index has declined 3.73 points over the past 12 months. The next publication date is October 13, 2015 .\nPublished on the ninth business day of each month, the SS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index presents a timely and accurate view of investments in hedge funds on the SS&C GlobeOp administration platform. Data is based on actual subscriptions and redemptions independently calculated and confirmed from real capital movements, and published only a few business days after they occur. Following the month of its release, the Index may be updated for capital movements that occurred after the fifth business day.\nSS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Performance Index\nBase\n100 points on 31 December 2005\nFlash estimate (current month)\n-1.02%*\nYear-to-date (YTD)\n6.22%*\nLast 12 month (LTM)\n7.28%*\nLife to date (LTD)\n121.58%*\n*All numbers reported above are gross\nSS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index\nBase\n100 points on 31 December 2005\nAll time high\n150.77 in September 2013\nAll time low\n99.67 in January 2006\n12-month high\n149.53 in December 2014\n12-month low\n144.51 in July 2015\nLargest monthly change\n- 15.21 in January 2009\nSS&C GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator\nAll time high\n19.27% in November 2008\nAll time low\n1.85% in January 2012\n12-month high\n5.87% in December 2014\n12-month low\n2.08% in July 2015\nLargest monthly change\n9.60% in November 2008\nAbout the SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Index Â®\nThe SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Index (the Index) is a family of indices published by SS&C GlobeOp.
