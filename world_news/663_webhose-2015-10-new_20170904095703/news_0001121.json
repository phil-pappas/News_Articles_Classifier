We are aware of buses that have been paid for by Numsa and comrade [Zwelinzima] Vavi. We don’t want a situation where we have this genuine protest by students hijacked by people fighting their own,\" he said.\n\"All that the student organisations want to do is to express their concerns with management and government. Once we hear of ulterior interests, we get worried of student leaders that would want to advocate for a protest that is funded by a third force.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:41:35.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
