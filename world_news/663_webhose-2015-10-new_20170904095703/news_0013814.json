The supply/demand imbalance will be exacerbated by container shipping companies continuing to order mega-vessels.” \nHowever, Maersk has previously stated that world trade is anticipated to surge by 5-8% each year, and on the back of this, it has demonstrated that it believes in this statement with its order for eleven 19,000 TEU ships. \nSoren Toft, COO of Maersk Line, said: “I am very happy with this order. These vessels will help us stay competitive in the Asia-Europe trade and will be key in our strategy to grow with the market.” \nThe stance from Maersk signifies a differing economic forecast from Fitch, potentially signifying an increasing dissonance in how liners and analysts view the market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:25:32.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
