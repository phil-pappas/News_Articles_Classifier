It is designed to enable more rapid and complete arterial healing, and to thereby reduce the risk of complications associated with long-term polymer exposure compared to currently-used drug-eluting stents (DES) with permanent polymers.\nExisting DES devices reduce coronary restenosis, but the polymer remains on the stent after the drug is delivered. Long-term exposure to the polymer may cause inflammation, which delays healing and has been associated with complications, including neoatherosclerosis and stent thrombosis. The SYNERGY Stent is designed for faster and sustained healing by eliminating long term polymer exposure.\nThe SYNERGY Bioabsorbable Polymer Stent System has CE Mark and FDA approval. “Data from the EVOLVE II trial, which included the most complex patient population studied in a U.S. regulatory approval stent trial, demonstrated exceptional performance and safety of the SYNERGY Stent,” said Dean Kereiakes, M.D., principal investigator of the EVOLVE II trial and medical director at The Christ Hospital Heart & Vascular Center/The Lindner Research Center, Cincinnati. “The U.S. cardiology community will have access to a bioabsorbable polymer DES which will provide excellent clinical outcomes and should optimize vessel healing.”\nResults previously reported from EVOLVE II, a global, multi-center, randomized, single-blind, non-inferiority pivotal trial demonstrated 0% definite stent thrombosis (ST) after 24 hours. Four-year EVOLVE trial data demonstrated a continued 0% stent thrombosis rate and a very low target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate of 1.1%.\nBoston Scientific will continue to advance the robust clinical program supporting the SYNERGY Stent with the initiation of the EVOLVE Short Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy (DAPT) Study, expected during the first quarter of 2016. The company has received an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for this prospective study designed to assess the safety of three-month use of DAPT in patients at high risk for bleeding undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the SYNERGY Stent.\n“The introduction of the first bioabsorbable polymer stent in the U.S. is a tremendous milestone in the evolution of stent technology,” said Kevin Ballinger, president, Interventional Cardiology, Boston Scientific. “The SYNERGY Stent is a next generation therapy designed to improve patient outcomes and ultimately reduce health care costs associated with the treatment of coronary artery disease.”", "external_links": ["http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7223456-boston-scientific-fda-approval-synergy/embed_videos.html?video=ff4d5f98-c886-4e6c-b728-da6a8fd1b018&embed=true"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:44:35.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
