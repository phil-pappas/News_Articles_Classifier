Could not subscribe, try again later Getty Facebook kills your phone battery \nFacebook has owned up to the fact that its mobile app is likely responsible for draining your iPhone 's battery life. \nThe social network was put in the crosshairs after experts pointed the finger at the app's background practices . They claimed it pilfered battery power without the user knowing. \n\"The fact that a company the size of Facebook can't optimize energy consumption of their iOS app is simply ridiculous,\" raged Federico Viticci, editor of the blog Mac Stories. \nNow Facebook's engineering manager, Ari Grant, has acknowledged it with a post apologising for the issue. \n\"We found a few key issues and have identified additional improvements, some of which are in the version of the app that was released today,\" he wrote. \nAccording to Grant, the problem stems from two issues. Firstly, what he calls a \"CPU spin\" where the app is continually pinging the phone for information only to receive nothing back. \nThe second problem is to do with audio playback. Leaving the app after watching a video sometimes leaves the audio playing silently. \n\"This is similar to when you close a music app and want to keep listening to the music while you do other things, except in this case it was unintentional and nothing kept playing,\" explained Grant. \nFacebook says it's sorry for draining your battery \n\"The app isn't actually doing anything while awake in the background, but it does use more battery simply by being awake.\" \nFacebook has said it is \"committed to continuing to improve the battery usage of our app\" and will address the issue in future updates.
