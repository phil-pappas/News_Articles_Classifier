Scottrade spokeswoman Shea Leordeanu said the FBI told the company that other companies were also hacked, but did not name them. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nScottrade said that Social Security numbers, email addresses and other sensitive information was in the system that was hacked, but hackers focused on stealing customer names and addresses. \nThe St. Louis-based company, which runs an online stock trading platform and bank, said customer's funds were not stolen and no account passwords were taken. Scottrade said it has strengthened its network to prevent other hacks. \nThe data breach comes a day after credit ratings agency Experian said hackers broke into its system and stole the personal information of about 15 million that have applied for T-Mobile wireless service. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:39:18.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
