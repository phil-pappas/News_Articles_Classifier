These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by communication difficulties, social and behavioral challenges, and repetitive behaviors. An estimated 1 in 68 children in the U.S. and 1 in 48 boys are on the autism spectrum. \nABOUT AUTISM SPEAKS Autism Speaks is the world's leading autism science and advocacy organization.
