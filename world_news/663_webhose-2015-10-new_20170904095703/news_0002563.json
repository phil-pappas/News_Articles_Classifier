Heller, chief executive officer of Missouri River Energy Services, has been appointed to the Board of Directors for the Electric Power Research Institute . Heller will serve as interim director until April 2016 and also will serve on the governance and nominating committee. \nHeller oversees the operation of Sioux Falls, S.D.-based MRES, which supplies electricity, natural gas and related services to 61 communities in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. He has been with MRES since 1992. \nHe has a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering fand a master’s degree in business administration. \nEPRI conducts research and development relating to the generation, delivery and use of electricity for the public benefit. Studying salmon survival through new turbines at Ice Harbor \nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to hire a company to characterize fish passage environment and to perform acoustic telemetry evaluation of juvenile salmon survival through new-design turbine runners at the 603-MW Ice Harbor Dam project. \nVoith Hydro has completed design and model testing of a fixed-blade propeller and an adjustable-blade turbine runner designed to be safer for fish passage. \nThe Corps’ Walla Walla District now plans to hire a company to perform studies to provide information for validating the design process, quantifying design improvements in terms of reduced barotrauma and strike potential, and estimating turbine passage survival through risk assessment of barotrauma and blade strike injury and mortality that juvenile salmonids might experience. Kozdras: HRF graduating researcher \nEditor’s Note: This profile highlights a potential future member of the hydroelectric industry. \nKelly Kozdras graduated this summer from the University of Washington with a masters degree in electrical engineering. Her research focused on modeling small hydropower plants connected as a microgrid.
