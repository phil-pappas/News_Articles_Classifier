Naturally the backers of NPS are fulsome in their praise. The website of the Net Promoter Community says: \"The Net Promoter Score is based on the fundamental perspective that every company’s customers can be divided into three categories: Promoters, Passives, and Detractors. By asking one simple question — How likely is it that you would recommend [your company] to a friend or colleague? — you can track these groups and get a clear measure of your company’s performance through your customers’ eyes.\" However, NPS has plenty of detractors, and some real shortcomings. They can be found in the NPS article on Wikipedia , which contains the damning quote: \"The NPS is found to be a very poor predictor of both customer loyalty and customer satisfaction. The measure is very sensitive to changes in the underlying distribution, and finally the precision of the NPS was found to be low compared to other measures of loyalty.\" So it's perhaps not surprising alternatives that seem to offer greater accuracy are being seized upon eagerly. Topping the list of such candidates is big data, aka data analytics. At first glance the potential would seem to be there: data analytics achieves insights by analysing very large amounts of real data — structured and unstructured. So if the right data can be accessed in sufficient volume and the right analysis undertaken those insights should be extremely accurate. That's the argument presented by this blog How Big Data Analytics Will Displace Net Promoter Score in Information Management . It points out that errors in coverage, sampling and measurement can all compromise the accuracy of NPS and notes \"Big data can address these error vulnerabilities because it uses a census approach to data collection. Today companies can capture data about nearly every customer interaction with the brand, including customer service calls, website experiences, social media posts and transactions. Because the data is collected across the entire population and includes more revealed behaviour than attitudinal and stated behaviour, the error problems associated with NPS can be largely overcome.\" In addition to enabling better understanding of real customer behaviour, data analytics also enables companies to engender customer loyalty in real time, rather than analysing the attitude retrospectively and taking actions in response to that analysis. Another blog from a Forrester analyst How to Ignore Data, Remain Clueless and Anger Your Customers , argues: \"Firms are blowing opportunities to engender their customers’ lifelong loyalty.\" It gives an interesting example. An airline, knowing that bad weather would likely disrupt a particular flight could have notified a passenger booked on the flight and rebooked him on another flight. Having failed to do so, and having stranded the unfortunate flyer at the airport, the airline compounded its error with what sounds like fairly chaotic management of the flow- on problems. His advice: \"Don’t let your firm blow it because they don’t use all the available data to find the insights that create action that makes a difference to your best customers. Understand how systems of insight will get you beyond just data and analytics so you can automatically spot high-value customer trouble spots and act to save the relationship.\" \nPremier Technologies \nPremier Contact Point provides a hosted contact solution that meets the needs of the modern contact centre.
