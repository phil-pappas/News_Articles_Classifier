Indian Cardinal Oswald Gracias, who heads the Asian bishops' conference, suggested the omission was a compromise designed to ensure all bishops could sign onto the appeal, which is the first of its kind for the episcopal conferences from each of the five continents.\n\"It's not just the pope, it's the whole church throughout the world, and that is powerful,\" said Monsignor John Ribat, president of the bishops' conference of Oceania and archbishop of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, one of the front-line Pacific island nations most threatened by climate-induced rising sea levels.\nIn his landmark encyclical \"Praise Be,\" Francis denounced what he called the \"structurally perverse\" fossil fuel-based world economy that he says exploits the poor and destroys the Earth.\nThe bishops from Africa, Asia, America, Europe and Oceania backed his assessment, albeit in less dire terms, recognizing that \"accelerated climate change\" is the result of \"unrestrained human activity ... and that excessive reliance on fossil fuels is primarily responsible.\"\n___\nFollow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:44:17.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
