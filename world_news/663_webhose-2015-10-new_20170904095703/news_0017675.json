The device is an unnamed smartphone from OnePlus and only carries a model number ‘E1005’.\nAccording to previous information, the company CEO had voiced out that they will be introducing another smartphone destined to be unveiled by end of 2015. Media speculations claimed that the phone could be the OnePlus ‘Mini’, but nothing is confirmed as yet.\nNew leaks in the media stated that the OnePlus has been getting the new device, the E1005, tested by the FCC for all possible certifications. The product under test was listed on the FCC website with the test results and the photograph of the same.\nAs for the photographed smartphone, it seems like the new OnePlus will be thicker than the present existing models—the One and 2. The rear panel is a glossy back and the camera resides on the top left corner, similar to an iPhone. The bottom sports a stereo speaker with a micro USB connector in the center. The device does look smaller than the OnePlus 2, probably making it a possibility of the OnePlus Mini to be a true speculation. However, OnePlus hasn’t spilled anything on this topic.\nAs for the information from the FCC website is concerned, the OnePlus smartphone will feature LTE, a 2450mAh battery. Other specifications that are speculated include a 1.9GHz quad core processor.\nAs for the new device, we assume that OnePlus will make an announcement for it in an upcoming event scheduled around next week.\nAlso read: Contest: OnePlus 2 invites giveaway!\nAlso read: Finally!
