Post navigation 2 thoughts on “To Mars Via The Moon” gbaikie says: \nI didn’t listen to whole thing. But generally I think it’s good. Maybe I will listen to rest later. But I don’t think NASA should do a lunar base- even with commercial partnership. Instead NASA should focus on Lunar exploration, and lunar exploration should focused on finding minable lunar water. \nAnd the a major part of lunar exploration is related to minable lunar water in sense that NASA exploration uses orbital depots. Once orbital depots reach operational status [by using it for Lunar exploration] this technology would also be useful for Mars exploration and commercial water mining. And also related to commercial satellite operations, and asteroid mining. \nAnd NASA does not wait or is dependent on commercial Lunar water mining. And it’s possible other countries might focus on lunar bases, once NASA has explored the moon to determine where and if lunar water is minable. And if like commerical lunar mining, if other countries have lunar bases, this also provides political support for the decades of exploration needed to determine if and where human settlements could be on Mars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:37:35.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
