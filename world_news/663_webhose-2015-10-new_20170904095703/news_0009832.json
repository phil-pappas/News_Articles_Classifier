In the heat of the moment, the agencies showing up can't talk to the ones already on scene.\"As technology improves we need to invest in infrastructure,\" said State Senator George Amedore.Amedore helped secure a grant that will provide some of the digital radios departments will need to use the new system. The radios cost $3,000 each. After launching the system within Albany County, the sheriff says the county will link up with surrounding counties beginning with Saratoga County.
