The first displayed a a timer counting down from 60 minutes giving users options to start the upgrade process or reschedule it (but not disable it). \nIt's almost time for your upgrade \nSave your work and leave your PC plugged in and turned on. Your PC might restart several times during the upgrade and it might take a while. We'll let you know when it's done. \nStarting the upgrade in \nThe second displayed only the option to start the Windows 10 upgrade process after searching for updates using Windows Update (again with no option to stop the process). \nYour upgrade to Windows 10 is ready. \nYou need to restart your Pc to being the installation. This might take a while, but we'll let you know when it's done. \nBoth are reported by the creator of GWX Control Panel , a free program for Windows to block the upgrade to Windows 10 on user systems. \nAccording to the authors information, there is currently no option to fix the issue on affected systems. \nIf you are seeing either of the above two screens, exactly as they appear here, GWX Control Panel is not yet able to help you, although I am looking into whether it's possible to fix these things through software. I do not have any recommendations at the moment, though, unfortunately. \nWorkarounds \nThere is a couple of things that affected users can do to prevent the upgrade from happening in first place. Stop the Windows Update Service. While this blocks the upgrade for the time being, it is not the best solution as it blocks you from receiving updates for your operating system. Use System Restore to revert back to a previous system state. This is one of the better options provided that a System Restore point is available. To run System Restore, tap on the Windows-key, type cmd and hit enter. Type rstrui.exe and hit enter again to open the System Restore interface on the system. System Restore is not turned on by default on newer versions of Windows . Restore a backup or system snapshot that you have created with third-party programs . \nSo why is this happening? \nIt is unclear right now how widespread the enforcement of the upgrade is and whether it is a bug, test or on-purpose turning of the screws by the company in an effort to get more systems upgraded to Windows 10. \nTo give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt, it is possible that this is a bug that is affecting only some systems. While that is not really reassuring to affected users, I find it unlikely that Microsoft enforces upgrades to a new version of Windows without user consent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:12:40.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
