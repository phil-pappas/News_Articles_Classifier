He will present on the undervalued importance of log data and how Praesidio’s state-of-the-art technology corrects this dangerous mistake.\n“Praesidio is the only Cybersecurity Management company focused exclusively on Financial Institutions. Cybersecurity Management is an emerging need that has stemmed from the vast proliferation of point solutions that IT Security teams must monitor. They face tough challenges, like: inability to monitor the entire network because of cost, no real-time analytics, and lack of qualified security candidates. FinDEVr is excited to have Sean Cassidy, Praesidio’s CTO, present at this year’s conference as the increasing scrutiny on BOD accountability for cybersecurity attacks is going to drive demand for real-time analytics that can prove how secure a Financial Institution really is,” said Eric Mattson, CEO of Finovate.\nCassidy's exceptional ability to make complex subjects understood by all levels of technical aptitude helps him explain the current landscape of security efforts and detail the necessity for proper defense through log analysis. With Cassidy's strategic vision, his engineering team has built a cybersecurity management solution for Financial Institutions that is unrivaled in the marketplace.\n“Getting a chance to talk about something I am so passionate about, cybersecurity, is a huge honor. I will be talking about the valuable insights that can be gained from log analysis, including Praesidio’s advanced threat detection features,” said Cassidy. “FinDEVr is a trend-making financial tech conference that Praesidio is proud to be a part of.”\nFinDEVr is a respected Financial Technical (Fin Tech) conference, being held in San Francisco this year and will showcase new technologies for builders.
