Instead of using software, like other portable speakers, Astro uses hardware to control volume distortion so that users can enjoy their favorite music in its purest form. The Astro speaker beats all of the biggest brands in terms of audio quality and lack of distortion while producing the best sounds with a beautiful, minimalist approach.\nIn terms of a minimalist design, Astro only comes equipped with an “On/Off” button because everything else, from volume to song selection, is controlled with any Bluetooth compatible device including Android and iOS devices, tablets and computers. Astro’s number one differentiating factor isn’t its beautiful design, but the fact that it uses hardware to keep music in its current, rich form. Other big brand, portable speakers use software, which makes music smaller, removing layers from the music as well as the richness that makes music so enjoyable.\nWith Astro, music lovers can connect it to their Bluetooth compatible device and easily stream Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, YouTube, iHeartRadio and much more. A fully charged Astro speaker provides up to 16 hours of playtime and only takes 2.5 hours to fully charge. Astro’s carrying loop also lets listeners bring their favorite beats with them wherever they go, whether it’s to the beach, park, pool or just around the house.\n“Astro wasn’t just created for the audiophile, but for the everyday music lover as well,” said Astro founder Alexis Corval. “With Astro’s awesome sound and beautiful design, we hope to bring people a portable speaker that will top all others that diminish music’s pure sounds with software.”\nThe creators of Astro have also paired up with Tattoo Temple, one of the most exclusive tattoo studios in the world, to create a line of designs specifically for Kickstarter. Each speaker will have the work of a different artist on the front and back, displaying beautiful artwork to accompany Astro’s beautiful sounds. Although there might be a three-year wait list to work with the exclusive artists at Tattoo Temple, their artwork will be available on Kickstarter with the Astro Tattoo Temple designs.\nThe earliest of backers will soon be able to purchase an Astro speaker for $119, which also comes with a free M.R.K.T. protection case, which is all valued at a retail price of over $228. For those who wish to sport their love for Tattoo Temple, canvas tote bags will also be available for $29.
