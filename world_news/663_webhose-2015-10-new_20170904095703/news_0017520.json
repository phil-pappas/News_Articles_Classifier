Additionally, strong steel exports out of China have contributed to higher Supramax fleet use.” \nThe dry bulk fleet has seen marginal growth during the first nine months. # \n39.7 million deadweight tonnage (DWT) has been offset by the demolition of 23.8 million DWT, resulting in a fleet growth of just 2.1%. \nPeter Sand concluded: \"Continuance of low fleet growth is vital to achieving an eventual recovery and a return of sustainable earnings for the industry.” \nDrewry Shipping Consultants previously said that the dry bulk sector is anticipated to grow in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:17:42.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
