Documents leaked by hackers who broke into Sony Entertainment’s computers last year revealed that executives at the company had discussed such a sale.\nA sale would bring Sony cash and reap a payday for a business it merged with Jackson’s in 1995 to establish Sony/ATV. Jackson, who had earlier purchased rights to The Beatles song library, died in 2009. In 2012, Sony, the executors of Jackson’s estate and other investors purchased the larger EMI song catalog, to form the world’s biggest music-publishing business.\nMusic publishers collect songwriting royalties from album sales, use on TV and other performances. Sony/ATV also has rights to songs from several Motown artists, and administers the catalog for EMI.\nSony/ATV has a value of around $2 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported on Wednesday that Sony had triggered the clause. It wasn’t clear whether Sony would include its share of EMI in a sale, the newspaper said.\nSony Entertainment Chief Executive Officer Michael Lynton told Bloomberg News in January that the company had no plans to sell the music publishing business. Sony/ATV Chairman and CEO Martin Bandier said the same in a memo to staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:08:20.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
