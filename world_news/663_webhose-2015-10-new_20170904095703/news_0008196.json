The announcement was made at the 2015 HR Technology Conference and Expo in Las Vegas, NV. \nTraitify's personality assessments are based on a unique visual format, which contributes to a 90% completion rate. When measured using Cronbach's Alpha, a commonly used estimate of the reliability of psychometric tests, internal consistency was very high for all personality types (averaging a score of .938), exceeding many other mainstream personality assessments. \n\"The results cater to clients seeking further predictive insight to complement their hiring process and obtain a unique perspective into team and culture fit. The experience also engages candidates and provides them a greater understanding of their professional personality,\" said Tom Boyle, Montage's Vice President of Product. \"These assessments -- delivered through such an engaging, mobile-friendly medium -- are a natural evolution of our candidate-centric voice and video interviewing product suite,\" he added. \nThrough the partnership, Montage clients will be able to seamlessly incorporate scientifically-proven, visual personality assessments into their hiring workflow.

At the conclusion of each assessment, Montage will generate a full spectrum of personality data for clients and provide candidates greater insight into their own personality, enriching their hiring experience by providing a valuable takeaway. \n\"Montage is committed to transforming how companies hire, making their solution an ideal delivery platform for our visual personality assessment,\" stated Derek Mercer, CEO of Traitify. \"As the world becomes more sophisticated in its application of data, it is important to consider personality traits as we make our most important decisions, such as those impacting job fit and the workplace,\" he added. \nAbout Traitify Founded in 2011, Traitify is a Baltimore-based technology company working to make personality a core element of social engagement and electronic commerce.
