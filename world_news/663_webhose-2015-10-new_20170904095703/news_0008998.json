HTC One ® A9 will be available Nov. 6 as Sprint’s first smartphone to launch with the newest version of the Android operating system. \nThrough Jan. 7, qualifying customers pay $20 per month for a 24-month lease of HTC One A9 1 with Sprint Lease. Also, for a limited time, customers activating a new HTC One A9 will receive two monthly service credits of $20 each after activation. This $40 savings is available when activating the device through Sprint Lease at Sprint retail stores, sprint.com or 1-800-Sprint1.

Sprint will even pay two months of your lease payments – it’s a great deal on a great device.” \nStriking Design with Robust Features \nMelding the best of HTC’s acclaimed design and innovation with the latest from Google’s Android, HTC One A9 is a stunning smartphone that stands out from the crowd. As the first non-Nexus smartphone powered by Android 6.0 Marshmallow, HTC One A9 offers Google’s latest innovations right out of the box including: A multi-directional fingerprint scanner, which when combined with Android Pay makes purchasing items as secure and as easy as “tap, pay, done.” Google’s Now on Tap feature also provides contextual information about whatever is on your screen – look up reviews for a movie from a text, hear a song mentioned in a blog post, or book seats at a restaurant from an email, all at the press of the home button. All new power-saving capabilities to maximize battery life. Doze automatically turns off power hungry applications when your phone is left idle, such as when charging overnight, while App Standby knows when an app open in the background isn’t being used and shuts it down until you need it again. \nHTC One A9’s fun and useful features include a 13MP rear camera featuring Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) to minimize hand shake and correct vibrations for a crystal-clear picture. The Hyperlapse editing tool lets users speed up videos to 12 times as fast for a dramatic time-lapse effect. Vibrant 24-bit high definition sound quality comes from the combination of a high-output amp integrated into the headset combined with Dolby Audio™ Surround technology. It is also one of the few smartphones available today with an expandable microSD™ memory slot (card sold separately). \nAn evolution of the iconic HTC One family design, HTC One A9 boasts a stunning design with a fusion of metal and glass with a 5-inch, edge-to-edge, full HD AMOLED screen, offering brighter and more vivid colors for brilliant graphics and gaming, even in direct sunlight. Sprint will offer HTC One A9 in two color options – Carbon Gray and Opal Silver. \nHTC One A9 will launch with carrier aggregation capability, a feature of LTE advanced. Carrier Aggregation-capable devices have the ability to take full advantage of Sprint’s deep 2.5GHz spectrum position and experience significantly faster speeds. Cell sites with two-channel 2.5GHz carrier aggregation deployed have the ability to deliver peak speeds of 100Mbps or more to capable devices. \nSprint’s network continues to win accolades for getting better every day.
