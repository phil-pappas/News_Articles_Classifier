This report also forecasts the growth numbers till 2018 (on a YoY basis) and hence suggests the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the estimated period.\nGrowing Penetration of Mobile Wireless Devices in Manufacturing Processes driving the market\nThe use of mobile devices for processes and operations is increasing in the manufacturing businesses across the globe. The need for fast and effective execution of production processes are now being enabled by the use of wireless devices. Manufacturing companies are involved in continuous production processes and any small glitch could hamper the production flow. To avoid this, most of these businesses are adopting mobile device management solutions which take of the computer aided devices used and thus avoid any costly mistakes in the process. Acceptance level of Mobile Device Management solutions is rising in the manufacturing industry and the forecasted adoption rate among this industry stands highest of all the other verticals. The increased need for digitization among the manufacturing companies is expected to play a vital role in increasing the demand for mobile devices and in-turn would result in demand for MDM solutions.\nDue to different processes involved in production processes in manufacturing industry, most of the companies are bound to use various wireless mobile devices. As the usage of these devices is high, effective management of them becomes a daunting task. To overcome this, many of the manufacturing units across the world are investing in MDM solutions which take care of end-to-end management of their mobile devices. Generally, traditional MDM solutions are termed to be costly and most of its adoption happens among large manufacturing businesses. To facilitate further adoption, MDM providers have come up with cloud based versions which are comparably cost effective. As a result, many of the small manufacturing firms are also expected to start adopting these solutions. Hence, the rate of adoption is expected to be high among the manufacturing verticals.\nMost of the digitization, use of mobile devices for automation of processes in manufacturing happens in countries like the USA, Canada, Japan, Germany and France. Thus, these regions see increased adoption compared to other countries of the world. Other countries fall behind in terms of adoption and introduction of cloud solutions is expected to improve the pace of adoption.\nMarket Segments and Forecasts Covered in the Report\nThe Manufacturing Mobile Device Management market is segmented by:\n- Deployment Model (On-premise, Cloud, Managed Service)\n- End users (Enterprise, Mid-market, Small Business)\n- Region (Americas, EMEA, APJ)\n- Platform Type (iOS, Android, Windows, BlackBerry, Others)\n- Solution (Device, Application, Security and Network Management)\nCompanies discussed in the Global Mobile Device Management research report include AirWatch, MobileIron, Citrix, Good Technology, IBM Fiberlinks, Sybase (SAP), Absolute Software, BlackBerry, Landesk Software, Sophos, Soti Inc., Symantec, Tangoe, Trend Micro, Amtel, BMC Software, Kaseya, MFormation Technology, OpenPeak Inc., Silverback.\nTo purchase the full report, please call +1-408-469-4380 or mail us at This email address is being protected from spambots.
