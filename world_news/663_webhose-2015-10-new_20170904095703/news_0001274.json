This has been set to be the next benchmark in supercomputing to match the processing capability of a supercomputer to that of a human brain. Although still in research phase, Exascale computing is speculated to be achieved by 2023.-Significant funding initiatives and research projects have been initiated globally to achieve exascale computing capabilities. USA is leading the developments, followed by Europe and Asia. Initiatives from the US Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE) and the European Commission are focused toward achieving exascale capabilities before 2020.-The path toward exascale computing consists of addressing notable challenges pertinent to power consumption, memory, concurrency, and resilience to the next-gen supercomputing benchmark. High energy consumption is the most significant challenge hindering exascale achievements. Considerable research has been going on in this area to develop innovative processing capabilities in multi-core processors to consume lesser energy and enhance computing functionalities.-Exascale computing is expected to have considerable applications across various sectors such as Healthcare, Aerospace & Defense, Energy and so on. The technology is expected to solve numerous critical sector-specific computational problems that cannot be solved by 4 fastest supercomputers available at present, which have petascale processing capabilities-The most significant application of exascale computing is human brain simulation and modeling. In addition, complex problems such as climate modeling, whole genome sequencing, scientific research, and so on will be facilitated by exascale computing to take humanity to 5 the next paradigm of technological advancement.
