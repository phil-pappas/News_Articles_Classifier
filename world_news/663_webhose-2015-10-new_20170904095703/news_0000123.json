Picture: Yoo.com Source: Supplied\nThe Barnhouse sits in a secluded one-acre plot of private woodlands and its interiors were inspired by the traditional English country home.\nThe property has five large bedrooms, a spacious outdoor entertaining deck and private pool.\n“I’m branching out,” the mother-of-two told The Sunday Times .\nMoss enlisted the help of her friend Katie Grove of Grove Interiors, who has consulted on all her properties. “I won’t do anything without her. She knows my taste exactly,” Moss said.\nThe mirrored four-poster bed is a focal point in the bedroom. Picture: Yoo.com Source: Supplied\nThe walls feature three colours — earth, stone and moon grey — inspired by the Barn’s connection to its forest surrounds.\nArtworks by Allen Jones, Chris Levine, Damien Hirst, Mit Senoj and Kate’s own collaborations with Jake and Dinos Chapman and Chris Allen, are featured through the home.\nKate Moss isn’t into homes that are ‘just beige and black and white’. Picture: Yoo.com Source: Supplied\n“I like it to be eclectic,” said Moss. “There’s 1970s, there’s 1920s, there’s 1960s — the best bits of everything. It’s not completely retro. I don’t want to walk into a time warp.” “I love that it’s not too matchy-matchy. I hate those homes that are just beige and black and white.”\nThe $5.4 million home has a great outdoor pool. Picture: Yoo.com Source: Supplied\nThe 41-year-old says she may do more interior projects in the future.\n“I hope so. We’ve had a really good time doing it. And if it’s enjoyable and it’s successful, then why not?”\nKate Moss likes stripes, it seems.
