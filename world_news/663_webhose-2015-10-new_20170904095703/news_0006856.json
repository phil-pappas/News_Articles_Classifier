Proximal devices are used to aid in completing an anastomosis between the aorta and a saphenous vein. Distal devices are used to complete an anastomosis between a coronary artery and a bypass graft. The abundance of treatment options available for angina patients has caused a modest decline in transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) procedures in recent years. Each TMR procedure uses one disposable hand piece. \nThe direct relationship between TMR procedures and the unit sales of disposables is expected to cause the U.S. market for TMR disposables to contract over the forecast period. CABG procedures bypass a damaged blood vessel with healthy blood vessel. The healthy blood vessel can be harvested using the endoscopic vessel harvesting technique or the open vessel harvesting (OVH) technique. In the EVH technique, the surgeon makes a small incision in the patient's leg and uses a specialized EVH device to extract the required vessel. \nThe OVH technique requires the surgeon to make a large incision, or series of incisions, down the patient's leg. The popularity of the EVH technique has increased strongly in recent years, as it lessens patient discomfort and recovery times, relative to the OVH technique. \nThe increasing penetration rate of the EVH technique will mitigate the decline in EVH procedures caused by the declining total number of CABG procedures over the forecast period. The U.S. market for proximal devices has historically been much larger than the market for distal devices and is expected to increase its share in the total market over the forecast period. Growth in the penetration rate of proximal anastomosis devices will be propelled by the reduced procedure times and reduction of neurocognitive events associated with AADs. \nThe abundance of treatment options available for angina patients has caused a modest decline in transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) procedures in recent years. Each TMR procedure uses one disposable hand piece. The direct relationship between TMR procedures and the unit sales of disposables is expected to cause the U.S. market for TMR disposables to contract over the forecast period. \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:35:40.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
