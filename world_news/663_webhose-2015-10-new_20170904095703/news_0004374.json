(\"PMCS\" or the \"Company\") by Skyworks Solutions Inc. is the subject of an investigation by WeissLaw LLP, a national class action, shareholder rights law firm. The investigation focuses on possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of PMCS for agreeing to sell the Company to Skyworks. On October 5, 2015 , the Company announced it had reached a definitive agreement for Skyworks to acquire all outstanding shares of PMCS in a transaction valued at approximately $2 billion . Under the terms of the agreement, PMCS shareholders will receive $10.50 in cash for each PMCS share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether PMCS's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $14.00 per PMCS share, or $3.50 above the offer price. Additionally, PMCS shares traded at $9.80 as recently as March 23, 2015 . Further the offer price represents a mere 7% premium over the Company's March 23 trading price.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether PMCS's Board acted in the best interests of PMCS's public shareholders by actively shopping the Company to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement with Skyworks. If you own PMCS shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin or Kelly Keenan by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at [email protected] .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.
