Mobile Punch 4.0 provides Blueforce time and attendance system users with new capabilities that prevent employee time theft, making it easier for employers to track and manage remote employees, scattered work crews and on-the-go field managers. New Mobile Time Tracking Features\nGeo-fencing\nIn addition to capturing an employee’s GPS location at clock-in/out, the Mobile Punch app now includes geo-fencing to help companies improve employee accountability while they are on the job. Using GPS to designate specific geographical boundaries for worksites, this feature first sends a warning message to workers, and then automatically clocks them out when they leave a designated worksite radius.\nGeo-tracking\nGeo-tracking helps companies prevent time theft by recording an employee’s geo-coordinates at defined intervals between a clock-in and out period.\nFace Capture\nThe new Face Capture feature reduces time theft by providing added verification to the clock in and out process. Employers can configure it to require workers to capture a photo of themselves on their smartphone when they clock in and/or out.\nCheck Points\nCheck Point capabilities can be enabled to help boost productivity and keep employees on track throughout the work day. Employers can set up check points throughout worksites—i.e., posted bar codes—that employees must scan when passing through or completing an activity.\nThe latest version of Mobile Punch by EPAY Systems is available for use on iPhone® and Android® smartphones as well as iPad® and Android tablets.\nAbout Mobile Punch\nEPAY’s native-developed Mobile Punch app with GPS provides an easy and affordable solution for tracking and managing time and attendance for scattered and remote workforces. Mobile Punch lets workers clock in and out for their work day right from their smartphone or tablet and captures clock-in/out date and time as well as GPS location so employers know their employees are exactly where they should be. Any punch made outside an authorized worksite is immediately flagged for manager review.\nMobile Punch can be configured for use by single employees, work crews, and/or managers. Additionally, managers can use Mobile Punch to classify workers by location, task, or work ticket. They can also take advantage of the one-click group clock-in/out option.\nMobile Punch can be used in combination with any of EPAY’s data collection devices including biometric time clocks, telephone time tracking system and web punch option.\nAbout EPAY Systems\nEPAY Systems provides a robust time and labor management system that keeps employers in control and in compliance with labor laws and union rules, while reducing labor costs by up to 5% or more.
