Instead of the \"dislike\" button many Facebook users have been clamoring for, the Menlo Park, California-based social network is testing out buttons that represent the emotions of love, yay, ha ha, wow, angry and sad.\nChris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, says in a post that the new buttons address the spirit of the request for a \"dislike\" button, but in a broader way.\nFacebook is testing Reactions in Ireland and Spain starting Thursday, with the hope of eventually rolling them out globally soon.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:43:11.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
