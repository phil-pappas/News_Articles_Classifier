Only, starting at $499, Google is coming in at a lower price than other premium phones. \nUnlike its predecessor, the Nexus 6, this is an all glass and metal phone. The front is made mostly of Gorilla Glass 4, which is more break resistant and smudge proof than the Gorilla Glass 3 used on most premium phones. The back is aluminum. Still, despite the premium ingredients, the 6P isn't a particularly pretty phone. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and Samsung's Galaxy Edge series of phones are a lot more impressive to look at. But I'm more interested in how a phone works and feels in your hand than what it looks like, especially since I almost always protect my phone in a case, which pretty much hides its back, no matter how pretty it is. Advertisement \nAs far as what matters to me, the 6P is second to none. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 v2.1 processor gives it all the pep it needs as does its 3 GB of RAM. Unlike the iPhone 6S Plus, which starts at $749 for only 16 GB of storage, the $499 Nexus 6P comes with 32 GB but you can pay more and get 64 GB or 128 GB. To give you an \"apples to apples\" (or should I say Apples to Googles) comparison, a 64 GB iPhone 6S Plus costs $849 compared to $549 for Nexus 6P with the same amount of storage. \nThe 6P also has a really big (3,450 milliamp hour) battery and, all other things being equal, a larger battery means more time between charges. The phone also runs the brand new Marshmallow version of Android that has a \"Doze\" feature that puts apps into a sleep state when not in use, to further improve battery life. My experience is that I actually can get through a day without a charge. And if I need a charge, it's not a time consuming process. Google says you can get up to 7 hours use on a 10-minute charge. \nThe camera on Google's Nexus 6 was not that great, but they've changed that with the 6P. For one thing, you can activate it by pressing the power button twice, instead of having to hunt around for the camera icon. The main camera has a 12.3 MP sensor and, according to Google, larger pixels that let in more light. The front facing \"selfie\" camera is 8 MP which is quite good for a front camera. \nAnother big change with the 6P as well as the Nexus 5X is that Google has abandoned the old micro-USB connector in favor of the larger USB-C, the same charger and data connector used in Apple's new MacBook. The advantage of USB-C is that you can insert it either way and it can carry more data and more power. The disadvantage is that all my old cables are now obsolete. \nIn addition to loaning reviewers phones, Google also provided a SIM card to access its new Project Fi cellular service. The service uses both the Sprint and T-Mobile networks as well as whatever Wi-Fi signal you can connect to, and routes calls, data and text over whatever service is faster and more reliable. Where I live there is no T-Mobile service, moderately OK Sprint and really fast WiFi which means when I'm home, the phone is connecting through WiFi to give me great call quality and fast data. When I leave the house — so far — I've gotten pretty good service. Neither T- Mobile nor Sprint has as extensive coverage as AT&T or Verizon, but between them they are quite good. \nWhat I really like about Project Fi is the simple and fair pricing. Basic service is $20 per month with unlimited domestic talk and text and unlimited international texts. \nAnother $10 buys you a gigabyte of data per month and each additional gigabyte is $10. But if you go over your allotment you pay only for what you use at the same rate of $10 per gigabyte and if you use less than you pay for, they credit you for what you didn't use. \nThe international roaming plan is also good. It covers 120 countries and in many countries talk is only 20 cents a minute with data charged at the same $10 per GB rate as in the U.S., although at slower 3G speeds. \nGoogle's new Nexus 5X, which starts at $379, is a less ambitious but still a good phone for its reasonable price tag. Being smaller also means it's lighter and fits easily into the hand, which has its advantages. Google didn't skimp on the camera, it's quite good for a phone at this price. \nGoogle's strategy with its Nexus phones is to set a standard for other companies to match and beat so — stay tuned — we should be seeing a whole bunch of new and high-powered Android phones over the next few months.
