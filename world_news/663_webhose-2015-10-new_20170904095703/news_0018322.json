James Woolsey, former director of the CIA, and Peter Vincent Pry, who served on the CIA's EMP Commission.\nKeanu Reeves Matrix small teaser\nThis note also said an EMP attack would kill nine out of ten people due to \"starvation, disease and societal breakdown\".\nThe countries who already have the capability of delivering one of these weapons include North Korea and Russia, who are not exactly friends of the West, as well as China.\n\"Designs for variants of such weapons may have been illicitly trafficked for a quarter-century,\" they wrote.\nReuters\n\"During the Cold War, Russia designed an orbiting nuclear warhead resembling a satellite and peaceful space-launch vehicle called a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System,\" the pair added.\n\"It would use a trajectory that does not approach the U.S. from the north, where our sensors and few modest ballistic-missile defenses are located, but rather from the south.\n\"The nuclear weapon would be detonated in orbit, perhaps during its first orbit, destroying much of the U.S. electric grid with a single explosion high above North America.\"\nPoll loading â€¦\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/john-mcafee-forget-gun-control-emp-attack-would-wipe-out-90-us-population-within-2-years-1522445", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/jasperhamill", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/james-woolsey-and-peter-vincent-pry-the-growing-threat-from-an-emp-attack-1407885281", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:43:04.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
