The Twitter integration enables sales teams to engage in social listening, as well as amplify messages on social media.\nWith Trapit’s Android application, employees are empowered to take social selling mobile with the ability to browse and read content curated for their teams, and share and schedule content to be distributed across social networks. Salespeople and other employees will have access to in-app analytics so that they can see how their content is performing on social. Collectively, these features allow sales teams to stay active on social media and engage with prospects and customers around timely, relevant content.\n“The best sales teams thrive on mobile, and so does Trapit,” said Hank Nothhaft Jr., Trapit CEO and founder. “We’ve worked closely with customers to develop features and apps that connect the dots between social networks and ROI. Trapit is the most complete solution for businesses that want to turn social into revenue. We plan to keep it that way.”\nTrapit’s unique Twitter integration allows users to discover influential tweets and share them with sales teams and marketers to spark conversation and engagement with prospects and customers. Curators can browse Twitter within their Trapit dashboard and select tweets to be displayed to salespeople and other employees. In turn, salespeople and other employees using Trapit can retweet, reply to, and favorite the tweets they see without leaving their content dashboard. This new capability makes life easier for users, as they no longer have to switch applications to conduct their work on Twitter.\nTop performing sales teams are nearly five times more likely to rate their mobile capabilities as outstanding or very good according to the Salesforce 2015 State of Sales Report . Conversely, only nine percent of under-performing sales teams reported using mobile apps in their sales efforts. It’s no surprise that sales teams that are active on mobile and social consistently outperform their peers.\nTrapit’s platform brings together end-to-end sales functionality -- from content curation to engagement and analytics -- and does it all with integrations to the networks and tools that sales teams use the most. The company recently added integration with Salesforce’s leading CRM solution, and continues to work with customers to identify features and integrations that work seamlessly with their sales processes.\nTrapit customers can download the Android application here . Support for Twitter will be rolled out to all current Trapit platform customers.\nFor more information and to find out more about specific solutions for your organization, please visit http://trap.it .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037537.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.salesforce.com/form/pdf/2015-state-of-sales.jsp", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trapit.supernova&hl=en", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037537.htm", "http://trap.it/"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:24:14.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
