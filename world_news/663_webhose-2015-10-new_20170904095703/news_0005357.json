Since 2000, the foundation has filed 33 lawsuits against 31 different defendants, according to a Reuters analysis of federal court data maintained by RPX Corp, a patent risk management firm. \nIn the current case, WARF is claiming $400 million in damages from Apple. As the dispute over how much the iPhone maker owes is hashed out, critics are questioning whether schools receiving public money for research should be engaged in hostile patent litigation. \nWARF, however, has argued that such lawsuits are key to monetising inventions created at research universities, and that protecting patents encourages innovation. The Apple trial is now in the damages phase, and if WARF gets anywhere close to what it is asking, it would be one of the largest patent payouts ever to a university. \nAttorney Michael Ng, who has represented Australia's national science agency in US courts, said that universities are feeling forced into litigation. “In recent years there has been a greater reluctance, for example in high-tech, to do voluntary licensing deals, and that sometimes leaves holders of intellectual property with no other recourse.” \nIn its current lawsuit, WARF hired one of the country's top patent litigators, Morgan Chu, to go head-to-head with Apple attorney William Lee. And last month WARF sued Apple again over the same patent, this time targeting the company's newest products, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, and iPad Pro. WARF also sued Intel in 2008, but the case was settled the following year on the eve of trial. \nWARF, housed on the university's Madison campus, has been around for 90 years and helps patent and commercialise the university's inventions. In 2014-15 alone, it provided more than $100 million in direct and in-kind support to the university, it said. \nWARF declined to provide any of its staff to be interviewed for this article, citing the ongoing trial. Apple also declined to comment. \nThe patent at issue in the Apple suit was granted in 1998 and covered a “predictor circuit” to boost microchip performance developed by a computer science professor, Gurindar Sohi, and three of his students. Sohi declined to comment. \nIn the years leading up to the invention, Sohi's research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research, which provided about $200 000 annually, according to court documents. In 1995, he and another professor also received a $2.3 million grant over three years from the NSF and the Advanced Research Projects Agency. \nAll three of those agencies are credited in the patent itself, which notes: “The United States has certain rights in this invention.” \nSome legal experts have criticised lawsuits over patents developed with public funding. “Government funding is being used to go after some of our most innovative companies,” said Robin Feldman, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law. “Do we want taxpayer money to fund this behaviour?” \nThough universities are legally able to obtain patents, considered a private right, on research funded by public dollars, “This policy is being turned on its head,” she said. \nBut WARF has argued in the past, as it did to the Federal Trade Commission in 2009, that companies that infringe on university patents should have to pay monetary damages. Such penalties, the foundation says, encourage companies to license patents, providing revenues on which universities depend on to create startups and commercialise their inventions. \n“In short, strong patents and a high cost for infringement stimulate innovation,” its managing director, Carl Gulbrandsen wrote in a letter to the FTC. \nWARF brought in nearly $152 million in income from royalties and investments last year, according to its website. \nREUTERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:25:23.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
