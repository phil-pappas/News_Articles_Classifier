Pretty much her style has defined this growing fusion of fashion and technology. But now, she’s upped the anti on her own design, by creating a suit of fashionable armor with animatronic limbs that react to the world around it. \nThe suit uses 3D printed proximity sensors and a respiration sensor to detect the wearer’s emotional state. If you feel threatened, the limbs will go up in a defensive position. If the person approaching you is deemed acceptable, the suit will maintain a non-threatening look. This is great for the highly sociable introvert who wants to cultivate that mysterious aura of “if looks could kill, in fact, come near me and I just might.” All New, All Different Marvel Couples \nMarvel really is going in an all new and different direction with their post Secret Wars books. The cover above is courtesy of legendary artist Alex Ross and will grace issue #4 of All New, All Different Avengers in January. Now keep in mind, covers don’t always paint the whole picture of what happens inside a book, but it would be an interesting shakeup to the status quo. \nAnd of course, this isn’t the Thor as we know him and Steve Rogers, no. This would be the new lady who is worthy of the mighty Mjlonir, one Jane Foster. And Sam Wilson is now the official Captain America, as Old Man Steve Rogers has taken on a very Nick Fury-esque role these days since he lost his super soldier powers. As for Earth’s Mightiest Kiss, we’ll just have to wait and see what happens in the funny pages as to how this story will play out. Until then, enjoy seeing your favorite fan fiction come to life. Take Down Drones with Radio Wave Rifle \nThose pesky drones, flying into your personal airspace, spying on you while you’re trying to tan in your back yard. And of course, shooting them down with a regular round of buckshot might get you locked up in some counties, so what are you supposed to do to keep them from invading your personal space? Well, this one guy has come up with the ultimate drone take down gun that at least keeps you from willfully shooting bullets into the air. \nThe Drone Defender is styled as a “ anti-drone counter-weapon ” which can take down a drone some 400 meters away. It’s got a 0.1 second start time, and up to 5 hours continuous operating time. And it works just using radio waves that disrupt the drones ability to connect with the piloting device, effectively stopping it in its tracks. This is good news for the Secret Service, as this may be a better way to shoot down the next idiot who flies a drone at the White House. Holy Crossovers, Batman! \nDaredevil’s own Night Nurse (sorry, I mean Clair Temple) will be taking on a new superhero in Lego’s Batman movie. Rosario Dawson has been cast as Batgirl in the upcoming animated brick flick by director Chris McKay, who is best known for his work on Robot Chicken . Now Dawson is no stranger to superhero work. Aside from playing Daredevil’s go-to doctor (and expected to appear in the upcoming Jessica Jones and Luke Cage series on Netflix), she also voiced Wonder Woman in Justice League: Throne of Atlantis . \nShe’s even admitted to being a bit of a geek herself, when I spoke with her at the premier of Daredevil last year, Rosario was very enthusiastic about the comics she had just picked up earlier that day! So hooray, only good things can come from more Rosario Dawson in comic book movies! The Lego Batman Movie is slated to come out February 10, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:59:06.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
