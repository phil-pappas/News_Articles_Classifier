The application is also compatible with a wide array of third-party plugins.\nGetting started with AutoBacktrack is easy. Just connect your guitar to your PC through the mic input or by using a USB converter. Configure your audio settings. Select your effects and connect those using virtual cables. Select your output options such as headphones, speakers and recorder. Select any instruments to play through your guitar and you’re ready to record your backing tracks as simple or complex as you like.\nAccording to Van Sickle, “I always dreamed of having a complete studio with all of the effects and recording equipment that comes with it. But what I really wanted was an all in one system that would give me everything, and not cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. I also added one more ambitious goal, and that was to allow me to play any instrument with my guitar.”\nKickstarter backers pledging $75 or more will have the opportunity to access the early beta testing phase, and give valuable feedback to help improve the product, and receive the final release of Autobacktrack Studio Session Full Release for free.\nMore information is available at\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1657696187/autobacktrack-studio-session-guitar-to-any-instrum.\nContact\nBrad Van Sickle\nautobacktrack@gmail.com", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1657696187/autobacktrack-studio-session-guitar-to-any-instrum."], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:55:45.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
