(What's your response?)\" the weekly publication tweeted . \nAn infographic (in the shape of a baby rattle) was attached to the post with a breakdown of the results. \nA little more than 40% of people answered yes, while 30% said they would not kill the future dictator and author of the Holocaust. The remainder, 28%, said they weren't sure. \nJake Silverstein, the magazine's editor-in-chief, was surprised by the results. \n\"I thought more people would say they would,\" Silverstein told CNNMoney on Friday. \n\"Baby Hitler\" became one of the most mentioned topics on Twitter Friday afternoon. \nThe question was part of a recent survey of 3,000 subscribers, conducted by the publication's research and analytics department. \nTypically, that group is tasked with asking people about things like their household income and age, but Silverstein said he wanted to use them to ask questions that are \"a little more offbeat, and peculiar and personal.\" \n\"It's a fun way to get a little more sense of who our readers are,\" he said. \nEvery week, the magazine publishes one \"Dear Reader\" question from the survey and the results. \nPrevious ones include: Is it appropriate for parents to spank children? How much of the Bible have you read? Do you smoke marijuana? How many times have you been in love? \nThe Hitler question prompted the magazine's biggest response, Silverstein said. \n\"I think that in recalling the slate of questions, that this is definitely the most ethically provocative of them,\" he said. \nThe reactions on Twitter ranged from the ridiculous to the intense. . @NYTmag h...how many baby Hitlers are there", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:36:00.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
