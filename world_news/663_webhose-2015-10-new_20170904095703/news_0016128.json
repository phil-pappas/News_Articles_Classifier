More than 2,000 candidates from 14 parties were vying for 120 seats in parliament. \nThe party linked to pro-Russian President Almazbek Atambayev, the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan, is expected to do well in the voting, as are three other parties loyal to Moscow. \nAtambayev has forged close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with Moscow maintaining an air base in Kyrgyzstan and forgiving loans it has made to the government in Bishkek. \nThe United States last year closed an air base it had in Kyrgyzstan that had served as a launching ground for U.S. operations in Afghanistan since 2001. \nAfter voting, Atambayev praised the country's democratic elections, saying, \"I remember previous years, when conducting genuinely honest elections was just a dream.\" \nAtambayev was elected as Kyrgyzstan's head of state in 2011 after political volatility led to the ouster of two presidents in popular uprisings in 2005 and 2010.
