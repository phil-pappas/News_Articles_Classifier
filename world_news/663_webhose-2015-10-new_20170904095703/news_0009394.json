International Business Machines Corp. said its third-quarter revenue fell 14%, hurt by declines in hardware sales and the stronger dollar, as the technology giant posted its 14th straight quarter of year-to-year revenue declines.\nShares fell 3.2% to $144.40 in recent after-hours trading as revenue missed expectations and the company cut its 2015 guidance. The Armonk, N.Y., company said revenue declined to $19.28 billion in the latest quarter from $22.4 billion a year earlier. Excluding currency fluctuations and divested businesses, revenue fell 1%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of $19.62 billion.\nFor the year, and excluding certain items, the company lowered its per-share earnings estimate to $14.75 to $15.75 and relatively flat cash flow, compared with its previous estimate for per-share profit of $15.75 to $16.50 and positive cash flow.\nBig Blue IBM, -0.78% has been shedding unprofitable hardware businesses as it reorganizes itself around a set of emerging cloud, security and data analytics businesses that Chief Executive Virginia Rometty has dubbed the company’s “strategic imperatives.”\nFor the latest quarter, revenue from its strategic imperatives increased 17%, and grew 27% excluding currency impacts and divestitures. That marked a decline from the 20% growth, and 30% increase, excluding currency fluctuations and divestitures, reported for the second quarter.\nOverall, IBM reported a profit of $2.95 billion, or $3.01 a share, up from $18 million, or two cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included pretax charges of $4.7 billion related to IBM’s former chip operations, which were taken over by Globalfoundries Inc.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-reports-another-quarter-of-declining-revenue-1445285709?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:54:19.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
