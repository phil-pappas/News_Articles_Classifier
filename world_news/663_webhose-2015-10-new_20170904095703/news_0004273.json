The awards will be presented during a special luncheon at the 5th annual Engagement & Experience Expo set for Nov. 9 – 11 in Dallas.\nThe 2015 Loyalty360 CX Awards come at a time when brands are increasing their focus on customer experience as a critical strategy for overall growth and profitability. According to preliminary results of the 2015 CX Landscape Report, most brands have increased their CX budgets from 2014 to 2015 and are reframing customer experience as a way to build long-term customer loyalty, not just incremental customer satisfaction. The finalists are investing in new technologies and processes that help create lasting relationships with customers, such as mobile, predictive analytics and Voice of the Customer, while emphasizing core company values that put the customer at the center of business decisions, both large and small.\n“With the promise of new technology and tools, the notion of CX is no longer relegated solely to customer service or customer care. We are seeing that it’s a directive given from leadership to all parts of the organization,” commented Mark Johnson, CEO of Loyalty360 . “The challenge is to break down silos in order to truly work toward a common goal of satisfying the customer and building a long-term relationship. One common theme among the finalists is that the companies draw on the customer as a reason for being. It creates a rallying cry that unites all parts of the business.”\nThe finalists will present their cases during a series of breakout sessions during the Engagement & Experience, where a jury will analyze the presentations and come to a conclusion on winners in each category. Attendees to Engagement & Experience Expo will be in the audience during the presentations, giving fellow marketers and customer experience professionals a chance to hear and learn from the finalists. The winner of the highest honor given - the 360-Degree CX Award - will also be determined, drawing on performance across multiple categories.\n“It is invaluable to attendees at Engagement & Experience Expo to get to hear directly from the finalists about details of their successful customer strategies,” continued Johnson. “We expect the presentations to be concise, but full of actionable information that can be applied to customer experience and engagement programs across all industries. It will be a high-energy and high-value event.”\nA jury consisting of 10 experienced industry professionals reviewed and scored each entry to identify the top-performing brands. To make the awards truly objective and unbiased, judges scored each entry based on strict scoring guidelines, with emphasis on measurable results.\nCongratulations to the finalists in each category. Platinum, gold, silver, and bronze winners will be named at the Engagement & Experience Expo.
