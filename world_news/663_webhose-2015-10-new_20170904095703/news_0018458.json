Microsoft’s guidance and support has aided Redback significantly in the process of delivering innovation to market,” he said.\n\"The future of energy intranet, the future of Internet of Things, the future of energy storage and of distributed generation - is a marriage of all of these technologies into one.\"\nThe device has an adjustable b attery capacity of 100 to 10,000 Amp-Hours, and boasts a maximum efficiency (to utility grid) of 97.6 per cent.\nMr Livinsgstone said the Smart Hybrid System would be available at Sonepar (L&H Group)’s 180 wholesale locations around Australia and solar panel installers can pre order today with devices available next month.\nHe said pricing of the devices and installation will depend the individual’s roof size and aspect so pricing will vary.\nAs reported in The Australian last month Microsoft has just released its Azure Internet of Things suite to the general public, allowing customers to use preconfigured data and machine learning solutions to better run their businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:41:06.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
