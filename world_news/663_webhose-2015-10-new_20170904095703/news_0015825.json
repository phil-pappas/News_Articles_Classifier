The new prototype is a DeLorean DMC-12 with a power steering motor that can drift with, well, let's call it \"robotic precision.\" (Strangely, this isn't the first self-drifting car, but it's definitely the first self-drifting DeLorean.) And, in keeping with the tradition of giving their autonomous vehicle projects human names, the Stanford Revs team named the car Marty, which technically stands for \"Multiple Actuator Research Test bed for Yaw control.\" In reality, it's an obvious nod to Marty McFly from Back to the Future.
