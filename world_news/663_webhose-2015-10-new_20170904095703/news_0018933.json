(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)\n1 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Early reactions to the return of Jack Dorsey as permanent CEO of Twitter appear to be positive as the company's co-founder pushes to attract a wider audience.\nAccording to filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Twitter's board of directors appointed Dorsey to the CEO role he had held on an interim basis since July, when Dick Costolo announced he would step down.\nSeveral top names in tech expressed their congratulations to Dorsey via Twitter.\nCongrats @jack @adambain excited to see the next stage for Twitter!\n— sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) October 5, 2015 Congrats @jack !\n— Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) October 5, 2015 Congrats @Jack ! Or should we call you, Mr. CEO? ;) http://t.co/QsKCAXkP9B\n— John Legere (@JohnLegere) October 5, 2015 Whether investors will be happy remains to be seen. Dorsey must prove he can grow Twitter's audience, as well as manage two companies, since he will also stay on as CEO of online payments service Square.\nEven Twitter co-founders Biz Stone and Ev Williams chimed in on Dorsey's selection.\nYes! Very happy that @jack is Twitter’s permanent CEO. Right man for the job. Plus COO @adambain ? Fuggehdaboutit! http://t.co/5LeSJ8QC4P\n— Biz Stone (@biz) October 5, 2015 Williams -- who worked on the search committee for Twitter's next CEO -- used the publishing platform Medium to explain why he's glad Dorsey is back at Twitter. \"We looked at many (many, many) other options,\" writes Williams. \"We weighed them seriously. We also discussed ad nauseam the challenges of Jack doing both his CEO jobs at once. I honestly didn’t think we’d land on Jack when we started unless he could step away from Square. But ultimately, we decided it was worth it.\"\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n1 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LeqDJZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jack", "https://twitter.com/adambain", "https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/651053196920516608", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796299351336147-XXX-IMG-DORSEY-4-1-IVC3I54N.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1LeqDJZ", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LeqDJZ&text=Here%20are%20reactions%20to%20Dorsey%27s%20return%20as%20Twitter%20CEO&via=usatoday", "http://t.co/5LeSJ8QC4P", "http://t.co/QsKCAXkP9B", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f5b7a33b2da2435d026a74d62f5aae7eb14ce6c7/r=269x400/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796299351336147-XXX-IMG-DORSEY-4-1-IVC3I54N.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12dd82347afb973c1c6aca8e06ca1bf6cab4856a/c=0-51-691-972&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796299351336147-XXX-IMG-DORSEY-4-1-IVC3I54N.JPG", "https://twitter.com/biz/status/651084099742859264", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LeqDJZ&mini=true", "https://medium.com/@ev/why-i-m-glad-jack-is-back-at-twitter-9bbda2ae5dca", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/651052188236537856", "https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/651038132339478528"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:47:14.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
