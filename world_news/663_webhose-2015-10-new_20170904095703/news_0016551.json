Getty Images Illustration: Yuliya Kim The fifth annual iHeartRadio Music Festival drew tens of thousands of music fans Sept. 18 and 19 in Paradise, Nev., near Las Vegas, and featured a rich assortment of pop music, including Kanye West, Demi Lovato, Kenny Chesney and The Weeknd, among many others. It also drew a whole lotta love from Snapchat users, who generated about 340 million impressions on the mobile app during the two-day event, according to an industry source. The festival's parent, iHeartMedia, didn't offer specifics when asked about the data. To generate the buzz, the San Antonio, Texas-based company utilized the prime Snapchat Discover real estate on the app that iHeartRadio has only had since the end of July. Snapchat and iHeartMedia seemed to have an increasingly important partnership. Evan Spiegel, Snapchat CEO, attended the music-industry giant's Upfront last April , and the two companies held a party together on Wednesday evening during Advertising Week that featured an intimate performance by Alicia Keys. The festival's marketers seemed to place a premium on social media this year while also getting roughly 6.5 billion impressions across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, Flickr and YouTube.
