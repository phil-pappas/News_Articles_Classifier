(NYSE: GDDY), the world's largest technology provider dedicated to small business, and its spokesperson NASCAR star Danica Patrick are joining forces with the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) to help fight breast cancer. For a fourth consecutive year, Danica is swapping the iconic \"GoDaddy green\" to drive a pink GoDaddy No. 10 Chevrolet in NASCAR this October, starting at Dover International Raceway this weekend.\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women, according to NBCF. The goal of 'going pink' is to raise awareness and money. To help support the cause, GoDaddy is donating $50,000 to NBCF, inviting customers to \"Round Up\" purchases to the nearest dollar for the charity and matching individual employee contributions up to $500 each.\nThis year, as part of the \"Put the Brakes on Breast Cancer\" campaign, Danica will also wear pink gloves. Her steering wheel is pink, as well. She revealed the campaign paint scheme via her personal Twitter page last week.\n\"The pink car really looks great this year and I think fans will definitely notice it on the track,\" Danica said. \"I think we all want to make a statement – I bet there are very few people out there who don't know someone impacted by breast cancer. If we all work together, we can help make a difference. Whether it's starting a conversation or inspiring donations of a few cents in the GoDaddy Round Up program, every little bit helps.\"\nPennies do add up. Over the years, GoDaddy customers have 'rounded up' to the tune of more than $1.2 million for various philanthropic organizations. All customers need to do is select the Round Up button when checking out with their GoDaddy purchases.\nNBCF is recognized as one of the leading breast cancer organizations in the world. Its mission is to help women now by providing help and inspiring hope to those affected by breast cancer through early detection, education and support services.\nAccording the organization, one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. GoDaddy has promoted breast cancer awareness widely since 2010.\nMany employees and their family members have been impacted by the disease, including CEO Blake Irving . His mother, Patty Irving , holds the distinction as the longest-surviving breast cancer patient in New Mexico . \"She's a testament to why awareness and early detection are so important. My mom is a woman who not only survived, but is thriving as an active member of her community, due in large part to early detection and an amazing attitude. It's inspiring,\" Irving said.\nThe hope is millions of fans watching NASCAR, one of America's most-watched TV sports, will be inspired to donate and get regular check-ups. \"For four years now GoDaddy and Danica Patrick have had a tremendous impact on our mission to help women and inspire hope to those affected by breast cancer,\" said NBCF Co-Founder and CEO, Janelle Hail . \"It's so important to spread the message of early detection and help raise funds that allow us to provide free screenings.\"\nNBCF offers the Early Detection Plan app, which is a personalized reminder system for monthly and yearly breast exams based on age and health history. It's available in both English and Spanish at iTunes, Google Play, or www.EarlyDetectionPlan.org .\nTo donate, visit www.Go.Me/Donate .\nFor more about GoDaddy's \"Put the Brakes on Breast Cancer\" campaign, as well as its corporate and social responsibility history, visit: www.GoDaddyCares.com.\nFor photos of the GoDaddy pink No. 10 Chevrolet & Danica in her pink firesuit, visit:\n2015 Pink Car – High Res\n2015 Danica Pink Firesuit – High Res\n2015 Pink Car All Angles – High Res\n2015 Pink Steering Wheel – High Res\nConnect with GoDaddy on Facebook , Twitter & LinkedIn\nAbout GoDaddy\nGoDaddy's mission is to radically shift the global economy toward small businesses by empowering people to easily start, confidently grow and successfully run their own ventures.
