The WF-6590DWF and WF-6090DW excel at this, all the while saving costs and time for businesses. \nThey belong to the same family of WorkForce Pro printers that have been highly recommended by BLI in independent tests [1] . \nBoasting up to 80% lower energy consumption than competitive colour laser printers, the WF-6590DWF and WF-6090DW rely on clean technology, producing no heat or ozone gas, and there's no fan noise during or after printing. Not only will this help reduce energy bills, but it can also help meet environmental targets. With a 50% lower cost per page and a lower total cost of ownership compared to competitive colour laser printers2, both printers can save businesses money. \nKevin Dobson, product manager, Epson UK, says: \"Reduced intervention is ensured thanks to a maximum paper capacity of up to 1581 pages, meaning less time is spent restocking, and increased printer reliability is ensured with Epson's PrecisionCore permanent printhead and fewer components to replace compared to a colour laser. And not only can users save even more money with Epson's XXL ink cartridges that can print up to 10,000 pages in black and 7,000 pages in colour, it also means even less intervention [2] .\" \nThe WF-6590DWF and WF-6090DW are all about saving money, time and energy for businesses that want to print in high volumes in colour. They can massively boost business productivity thanks to automatic double-sided printing, and the ability to use different media in different trays also increases their versatility.\" \nBoth printers underline their business productivity features by allowing users to print (and scan on WF-6590DWF) wirelessly from smart devices using Wi-Fi direct and NFC technology [3] . NFC makes it easy to connect, print and scan with just one touch. It's also possible to email documents from remote locations for instant printing, complete with PIN access and a secure print mode for security and peace of mind[4]. The WF-6590DWF also offers a large LCD colour touchscreen, making it easy to control the printer and perform tasks such as scanning or printing directly from a USB. \nEpson's document capture suite saves time by automating the manual steps of a traditional document process. Optimised workflows with pre-defined jobs make it simple to integrate documents into company processes. Document Capture Pro is also available as a server version for greater profile control and device management. Furthermore, the new Epson Device Admin solution makes it easy to manage a fleet of devices remotely for increased productivity. \nThe WF-6590DWF and WF-6090DW are available from November 2015. \nKey features: Fast colour printing at up to 34ppm (24ppm ISO) [5] No warm up time delivers a 7-second first page out time [6] Print, copy, scan & fax (WF-6590DWF only) Print and scan (WF-6590DWF only) wirelessly from smart devices, and connect devices easily thanks to NFC connectivity Maximum paper capacity is 1,581 pages with optional paper cassettes Document CapturePro and ProServer software compatibility for scan-to-cloud and DMS [7] Easy to use displays (10.9cm colour touchscreen on WF-6590DWF & 5.6cm mono LCD on WF-6090DW) ENERGY STAR-qualified \n[1] As tested by BLI, over two months to April 2015 [2] Approx. page yield based on ISO/IEC 24711 tests in default mode and single sided continuous printing methodology, using the monochrome test pattern provided in ISO/IEC 19752.
