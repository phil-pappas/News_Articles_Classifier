It expects an operating income or loss of between a $480 million loss and $70 million of income, compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.\nIn July, Amazon reported second-quarter earnings of 19 cents a share on revenue of $23.2 billion.\nMust Read: Amazon Gets Serious About Its Reviews With a New Lawsuit\n\"I think revenue will be in line,\" said ChannelAdvisor Executive Chairman Scot Wingo. \"The question mark is the profitability.\"\nAmazon's same-store sales grew 24.7% year-over-year in the third quarter, according to ChannelAdvisor, which tracks the year-over-year growth in revenue for third-party sellers on individual marketplaces such as Amazon. This quarter's growth on Amazon significantly beat the industry average of 15% growth according to comScore. Amazon also saw nice growth in traffic, with a year-over-year jump of 35% in the third quarter, according to comScore.\nWhile traffic and sales seem to be doing fine, though, analysts are still expecting profit to fall short as it continues to invest heavily in new businesses. But Wingo has hope that analysts may be surprised.\nAmazon's third-party marketplace and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services , are both incredibly profitable, said Wingo. So if we see more growth in those areas especially, positive earnings may actually be in store.\nBut even if Amazon doesn't report a profit this quarter, analysts likely won't be too concerned, since many view Amazon as more of a long-term bet.\n\"We do not see Amazon as a stand-out performer for the remainder of 2015,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster wrote in a research note on Monday. He does however \"remain positive regarding Amazon's long-term potential,\" despite the possible short-term risks. Munster holds an overweight rating for Amazon with a price target of $650.\nAmazon's breadth in its business give Munster faith in the company's ability to sustain growth and reach profitability. He looks to Prime Now , Prime in general, and AWS as key signals of future potential.\nAnd he anticipates future expansion into categories such as advertising, private-label products, and local services will provide additional growth. \"We view Amazon's relentless focus on diversification, growth, and structurally changing how the world works as intangible and difficult to value, but also as reason for long-term optimism.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13332878/1/what-to-expect-from-amazon-s-third-quarter-earnings.html", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13332878/1/what-to-expect-from-amazon-s-third-quarter-earnings.html", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13332878/1/what-to-expect-from-amazon-s-third-quarter-earnings.html", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13332878/1/what-to-expect-from-amazon-s-third-quarter-earnings.html&title=What", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13332878/1/what-to-expect-from-amazon-s-third-quarter-earnings.html&text=What"], "published": "2015-10-22T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:56:01.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
