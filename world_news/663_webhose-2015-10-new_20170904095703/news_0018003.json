SteadXP is the first none motorized video stabilization device which uses a smart and effective combination of software and hardware to take the tremor out of your video from almost any video camera. After years experiencing the limitations with current video stabilization technologies, the SteadXP team has decided to take a drastically new approach to develop our own solution. SteadXP device records accurate motion data in synchronization to video recording. Then when the shot is finished, just connect SteadXP to a computer and watch the result. The SteadXP software is designed to stabilize and reduces of the unwanted artifacts in the footage. It will suggest you to choose between different trajectories already optimized for the shot, resulting in different typical looks (including world first features like Hyperlapses, VR 360 and 3D cameras stabilization). For the most demanding users, some optional features will let them take a complete control of the framing if it's what they are looking for.\nSteadXP devices release users of steadycam or gimbal: without any mechanical part, these devices deliver 3 axis stabilization in a tiny plug and play, easy to use package. Our both products are compatible with nearly all digital cameras, including GoPro, Mirrorless, DSLRs and cinema cameras.\nWith SteadXP technology, professional looking cinematic moves are now accessible to everyone!\nSteadXP is on Kickstarter right now seeking a bit over $167,000 and has raised over $438,000 so far. A pledge of around $157 will get you a SteadXP with delivery estimated for March 2016\n.\nKickstarter campaign link - http://kck.st/1ih2PKN\nPictures are available here: http://bit.ly/1N27KMz", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1N27KMz", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2JpdC5seS8xTjI3S016", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2tjay5zdC8xaWgyUEtO", "http://kck.st/1ih2PKN"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:13:57.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
