Whatever happened to negotiations? Is it necessary to go on the rampage and destroy property, behaving like rabble that they all are?\nI was also in their position, wanting to go to university and not having the money to do so. My father told me the woman's place was in the home not in a tertiary education institution, so I decided to prove him wrong. I worked my butt off and acquired a government grant, which had to be paid back and a scholarship which did not. Neither was sufficient to pay for all fees and books, accommodation etc but together I just made it.\nLet me say this required bloody hard work, and should I have failed a year I would have been in trouble because both grant and scholarship were valid for only 4 years.\nLet me also say I had no time to run around displaying as these people did yesterday. I was working solidly 24/7. Exam time was not a time to run around being an idiot as most serious minded students knew.\nSo my question is this: HOW do you students have the time to do this? And more importantly, what happened to the other silent majority of students who were NOT demonstrating? Any one ask them?\nJust how many of the so called students parading yesterday were actually students is debatable, as I suspect the large majority to be EFF members.\nIn no country in the world is it a \"right\" to go to university. You have to earn it with your grades, your hard work, not your ability to toi toi.\nIF there are deserving students out there, then let them apply for scholarships, grants and student loans all well within reach of all DESERVING students. Why should government sponsor people who are averaging 30% at school and clearly do not deserve to be at university? It is a privilege to be able to study at university, not a right.\nThis is not so much a cry for help from embattled students as a well planned political movement thought out no doubt by the EFF and maybe ANC youth league.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:46:10.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
