WHO spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris said Friday the U.N. health agency had expected to see more cases despite the recent lull in the epidemic. She added the cases were in areas where scientists knew Ebola was spreading.\nIn an update this week, WHO said there was a \"near-term risk of further cases among both registered and untraced contacts.\"\nTo date, Ebola has killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/13/8790782/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/13/8790782/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:09:30.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
