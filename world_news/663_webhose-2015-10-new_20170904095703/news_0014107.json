Smart companies are using tools and technology to keep in touch with customers, find out what they want and create new sources of growth. At the end of the day, however, business will always be about relationships.\nThe key is to network with customers and pick up what they want. That provides new opportunities for growth.\nA good way to start is with customer surveys. Smart companies will use surveys to create new products, improve customer service and provide staff bonuses and pay rises. Major companies do this all the time. Amazon, for instance, constantly monitors customer preferences and acts on them. It doesn’t really matter if the customer isn’t chasing a particular product that Amazon has reminded them about. What’s important here is that the customer is left feeling connected to Amazon. Amazon has shown us that good customer surveys and regular interaction with customers can be highly effective tools for building sales and turning prospects and one-time buyers into loyal, repeat customers.\nLego’s Idea Portal encourages customers to suggest new products, seeding ideas and building loyalty. Source: Lego Source: Supplied\nLego picked up on the explosion in crowdfunding by creating its Idea Portal , an interactive platform where customers can submit their suggestions for new Lego products, but also vote for other’s projects. More than 10 thousand positive votes gets a product nominated to become a new toy.\nCompanies like Qantas, Dominos, Telstra, Optus, and Virgin Australia use Twitter regularly to keep in touch with customers and get their feedback. Monitoring social media sites like Twitter, Facebook and various blogs is easy and inexpensive. That said, the company needs to be prepared to take all sorts of feedback and handle it with good grace and humour. Basically, these are tools that allow the company to respond to issues in a proactive way. It’s about building connections with customers and showing them that you really care. Just one tip: don’t get too defensive.\nHow should B2B businesses, or those who supply major clients think about their collaborative opportunities?\nIn Deloitte’s “ Business ecosystems come of age ” report (PDF) the consulting firm suggests that companies should rethink traditional B2B relationships. They suggest;\nReimagining existing supply chains as “value webs” that enjoy greater autonomy and trust, learn and innovate together, and forge the sustainable models for success that benefit all those involved.\nDeloitte cites the success of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, who acts as a facilitator to help small businesses to create their own supply chains, and IBM’s Supplier Connection, which acts as a platform to help large firms manage their connection to smaller suppliers.\nDeloitte supply chain leadership survey.

GE’s head of innovation, Beth Comstock, says “We’ve created a mechanism to not just invest with startups but also partner with them. You do experiments, small scale, so that you can learn your way through them. You go to customers talk about how to change together. With a startup, you say ‘let’s scale together.’”\nUnderstanding how your business fits into the ‘value web’ might be a win-win for your customers, your suppliers and ultimately you.\nThis content was produced in association with Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
