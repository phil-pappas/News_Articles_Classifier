Featured in the new SureColor(®) P7000 and SureColor P9000 printers, data accumulated to date indicates that - depending upon the type of paper - the new inks can provide print permanence ratings of up to 200 years for color prints, and likely in excess of 400 years for black and white prints when printed with Epson's \"Advanced Black and White Print Mode.\" According to comprehensive tests conducted by Wilhelm Imaging Research, Inc. (WIR), the world's leading independent permanence testing laboratory, Epson UltraChrome HDX pigment inks can provide up to twice the Display Permanence Ratings of earlier generations of Epson UltraChrome inks with most Epson photo and fine art papers, including the new line of Epson Legacy Fine Art Papers . \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20121130/LA21891LOGO \nThese new permanence test results also apply to the previously announced eight-color Epson UltraChrome HD inks featured in the Epson SureColor P600 13-inch and SureColor P800 17-inch printers, as well as the new Epson SureColor P6000 24-inch and SureColor P8000 44-inch printers. \nThe permanence of displayed prints created with new UltraChrome HDX and HD inks far exceeds that of the very best silver-halide color (chromogenic) papers - including silver-halide color papers that are face-mounted to UV-filtering acrylic sheet. The result is a new level of color print permanence for the fine art, museum, documentary, portrait/wedding, and commercial photography markets that have been relying on silver-halide color papers for their customers. The enhanced display permanence ratings of the new Epson UltraChrome HDX pigment inks set a new benchmark that the comparatively low-stability chromogenic dye images of traditional silver-halide color papers simply cannot deliver. \nWIR's multi-factor print permanence test procedure extends beyond the effects of accelerated light exposure to evaluate the display and storage factors that can affect the life of a print over time. Prints made on Epson fine art photo papers and canvas with the new UltraChrome HDX pigment inks are expected to have WIR Album and Dark Storage Permanence Ratings in excess of 200 years, with many of the papers expected to achieve a rating of greater than 400 years in dark storage; the prints exhibit high resistance to atmospheric ozone; have very good water-resistance properties; and the pigment images are extremely resistant to damage caused by storage or display in high-humidity environments. In addition, preliminary data from ongoing tests indicate that, depending on the specific paper, WIR Display Permanence Ratings for black and white prints made with both the UltraChrome HDX and HD inks using Epson's \"Advanced Black and White Print Mode\" will likely exceed 400 years. \n\"We strive to produce the most advanced photographic printing and ink technologies that will inspire photographers to print their art,\" said Mark Radogna, group manager, Epson Professional Imaging. \"Utilizing ten newly developed high-stability pigment inks - cyan, light cyan, magenta, light magenta, yellow, orange, green, black, light black, and light light black - our latest Epson UltraChrome HDX ink set used within the new Epson SureColor P7000 and P9000 printers offers professionals an incredible tool to produce collectible works of art capable of lasting for many generations. It's the ultimate way to preserve the legacy of any artist.\" \nThe following papers are currently in testing at Wilhelm Imaging Research; additional papers and canvas materials will be added in the future: -- Epson Legacy Papers: Legacy Fibre, Legacy Platine, Legacy Baryta, and Legacy Etching -- Epson Signature Worthy Papers: Hot Press Bright, Hot Press Natural, Cold Press Bright, Cold Press Natural, Exhibition Fiber Paper, Premium Luster Photo Paper (260) \n\"The increased Dmax, wider color gamut, and reduced metamerism provided by the new Epson UltraChrome HDX pigment inks serve to significantly enhance the visual brilliance of both color and black and white images,\" said Henry Wilhelm, founder and director of research at Wilhelm Imaging Research. \"The increased overall permanence of the prints represents a significant contribution to photography.\" \nAdditional print permanence test results for the new UltraChrome HDX and HD inks on a wide variety of media will be posted as additional testing is available.

Wilhelm Imaging Research, Inc. has for over 35 years conducted research on the stability and preservation of traditional and digitally-printed color and black-and-white photographs and motion pictures. As an independent testing laboratory, WIR publishes on its website brand-name-specific, comparative permanence data for desktop and large-format inkjet printers and other digital printing devices. The comprehensive multi-factor test methods developed by WIR have become the de facto standard worldwide for evaluating the permanence of color and black and white photographs. A major research activity of WIR has been the development of improved accelerated image permanence tests and advanced, full tonal scale, colorimetric analysis methods for the fading and staining that occurs with color and black-and-white photographic images over time. Wilhelm Imaging Research also provides consulting services to museums, archives, and commercial collections on refrigerated and sub-zero freezer storage for the very long-term preservation of still photographs and motion pictures.
