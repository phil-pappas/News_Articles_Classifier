Chandrasekaran, though the company did not report its share a year before.\n\"(It's) fair for you to expect that all out employees will be engaged in digital over the next few years,\" Chandrasekaran told a news conference. \"We are very seriously investing in digital.\"\nOutsourcing project wins in the quarter included developing a digital banking platform for a European bank and developing a social media roadmap for a leading Middle East bank, the company said.\nBetting on demand for IT services, Tata Consultancy said it planned to add 75,000 staff this fiscal year through March, on top of its existing 335,620 employees, mostly located at its facilities in India.\nTata Consultancy's results came a day after Infosys, India's second-largest software services exporter, trimmed its full-year dollar revenue forecast to account for strength in the U.S. currency against the rupee.\nInfosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said the company would face come \"headwinds\" in coming months, as IT services firms compete with each other to offer low priced solutions.\nBengaluru-based Infosys' sales growth in the latest quarter in constant currency terms, at 6.9 percent over the preceding quarter was, however, higher than Tata Consultancy's 3.9 percent growth. Tata Consultancy did not give any forecast.\nThe National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) expects India's nearly $150 billion IT services outsourcing sector to see export revenue growing by between 12 and 14 percent in the current financial year.\n($1 = 65.1825 Indian rupees) (Writing by Sumeet Chatterjee ; Editing by David Holmes )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:46:00.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
