It took three years and 15 000 people to build.\nMore than 100 000 people attended its launch in 1911. On 12 April 1912, it embarked on its maiden voyage, setting sail from Southampton to New York, and sank after hitting an iceberg. For the first time ever, authentic artifacts recovered from the shipwreck of the Titanic are being displayed in South Africa.\nI went along with my family to visit the exhibition. On arrival we were handed replicas of original boarding passes belonging to actual passengers - by a man who looked like he could have been the captain's grandson. The boarding pass contained details of the passenger, including their age, the class they were traveling in and the reason for their journey. We were to assume their roles for the exhibition. My son was pleased to discover that he was a well-traveled major sailing in 1 st class while my daughter was a young lady traveling in 2 nd class to get married. My husband and I were both in 3 rd class, him, a Norwegian businessman and me, a domestic servant of Finnish origin.\nAt the end of the exhibit, we were meant to check on the Memorial board whether the holders of our boarding passes had survived or not.\nWe picked up our audio guides and stepped back in time as we were taken through the events from the time the ship was constructed till the modern day efforts to recover its remains. The exhibition has been designed with a focus on its compelling human stories. We read the touching stories and learnt about the South Africans that were on board. We marveled at the recovered artifacts – real items belonging to real people – and were amazed at the recreated bedrooms. We touched an “iceberg” and saw videos about the scientific efforts surrounding the recovery of the ships remains. My kids, having been on a cruise ship recently, were just as fascinated as we were. On the way out, a room containing authentic board games as played on the Titanic was set up to keep the adults and older kids further entertained and a Kiddies Activation Zone with a PlayStation Zone, Lego building tables, sand pits and ocean tanks, was set up to keep the younger kids busy. There is also a gift shop where you can buy special Titanic merchandise.\nUnfortunately, photos of the actual artefacts were not allowed so I didn’t take any.\nThe exhibition appeals to kids of all ages. I had to drag my kids out of there. Guided tours are available and school excursions are welcomed. There are also innovative dining experiences where 1 st and 3 rd class dinners based on the original Titanic menus are served, depending on your choice.\nThe exhibition will be at The Zone in Rosebank from 18 September to 8 November and at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town from 22 November right up to 14 February 2016.\nI am giving away tickets to the exhibition on my blog.
