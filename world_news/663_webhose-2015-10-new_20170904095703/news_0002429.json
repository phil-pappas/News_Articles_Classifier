October 9, 2015 WARREN, N.J. — Viking Pest Services , a Copesan Partner headquartered in Warren N.J., has partnered with Forshaw Distribution to support Breast Cancer Month during October 2015. Throughout the year, Viking Branch personnel wear blue ShuBee booties during their service to residential clients as well as when servicing sensitive accounts that require protective footwear. CEO and Owner Ed Bradbury started this years ago to show Viking customers that “We Care”. President Ryan Bradbury took the opportunity to partner with Forshaw Distribution in 2014 when they announced their Pink ShuBee campaign for Breast Cancer Awareness in 2014 and again in 2015. We receive many compliments from our customers on our footwear policy and even more during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, states Ryan Bradbury. Pictured below are several of our branches, ready to support Breast Cancer Month. We wear the Pink ShuBees during the entire month of October in support of this great cause.
