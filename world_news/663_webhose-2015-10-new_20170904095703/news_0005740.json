The dollar has risen about 6 percent against a basket of major currencies this year.\nAnn Arbor, Michigan-based Domino's did not disclose how much the strong dollar weighed on its quarterly results.\nDomino's U.S. sales at established company-owned restaurants were up 11.5 percent for the quarter, as pre-announced, and international same-store sales rose 7.7 percent, excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates.\nBoth were in line with the average estimate of analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.\nYum Brands on Tuesday said Pizza Hut same-restaurant sales were flat in the United States in the latest quarter.\nDomino's, the second-largest U.S. pizza chain by store count, has been outperforming rivals such as Pizza Hut in the United States, helped by its digital investments, which make it easier for customers to order pizzas using methods such as smart watches and digital wallets.
