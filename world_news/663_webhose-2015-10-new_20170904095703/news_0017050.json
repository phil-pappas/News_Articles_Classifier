The IEEE P802.19.1a Task Group is addressing the need for efficient spectrum sharing in TV White Space bands, the 5 GHz license-exempt bands and the 3.5 GHz general authorized access bands. The amendment will specify coexistence methods operating over an IP-based network, and enable the family of IEEE 802 Â® wireless standards to most effectively utilize these bands in tandem with non-IEEE 802 systems. \nWith a growing demand to mitigate co-channel interference among wireless networks and devices, including both IEEE 802 and non-IEEE 802 systems operating under general authorization, the IEEE P802.19.1a Task Group aims to define the network-based coexistence information exchange among devices in order to enable comprehensive network-based coexistence management. The proposed standard specifies the following: Procedures and protocols for collection and exchanging coexistence information between heterogeneous networks Spectrum resource measurements and network performance metrics, such as packet error ratio, delay, etc. Information elements and data structures to capture coexistence information \nFor more information on the IEEE 802.19 Wireless Coexistence Working Group, please visit http://standards.ieee.org/develop/wg/WG802.19.html. \nTo learn more about IEEE-SA, visit us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/ieeesa , follow us on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/ieeesa , connect with us on LinkedIn at h ttps://www.linkedin.com/company/ieee-sa-ieee-standards-association or on the Standards Insight Blog at http://www.standardsinsight.com . \nAbout the IEEE Standards Association \nThe IEEE Standards Association, a globally recognized standards-setting body within IEEE, develops consensus standards through an open process that engages industry and brings together a broad stakeholder community.
