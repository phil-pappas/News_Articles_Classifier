It is through these evolving technologies that leading organizations are driving substantial growth, increasing patient engagement and creating the next generation of clinical trials. Tehseen Salimi, Vice President of Global Medical Affairs at AstraZeneca, will deliver a keynote presentation entitled “A Chance to Refocus on Science, Evidence and Value”. She will analyze the role of insights and gaps in data to generate an integrated and effective strategy as well as how to leverage relative medial value. Larry Pickett, Vice President & Chief Information Officer at Purdue Pharma, also joins the agenda as a keynote speaker. He will deliver an in-depth case study into how he is driving data strategy forward, addressing both the commercial and clinical aspects of his role and divulging the successes and challenges of recent projects. In addition to AstraZeneca and Purdue Pharma, speakers from Genentech, Pfizer, Berg and many more will share their expertise on driving business profitability and innovation through developing new analytical capabilities as part of their growing predictive modelling and data science initiatives. “The pharma industry is one which is being radically transformed by the uptake of data technology in all spheres, spanning R&D productivity to regulatory affairs to drug commercialization,” said Laura Denham, International Events Director at the Innovation Enterprise. “We have crafted a summit agenda which dives deeper into some of these areas through industry case studies from a diverse speaker line-up.” Limited passes remain.
