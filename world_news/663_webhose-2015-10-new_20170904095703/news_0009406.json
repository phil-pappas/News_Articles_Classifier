The EA288 engines replaced EA189 engines - which are at the heart of the pollution cheating storm that has engulfed Volkswagen.\nThe company headquartered in Wolfsburg in north Germany last month admitted to fitting 11 million vehicles worldwide with the rogue devices, plunging the world's biggest automaker by sales into an unprecedented crisis.\nThe software turns on pollution controls when the vehicle is undergoing tests, and switches them off on when the car is back on the road, allowing it to spew out harmful levels of dangerous gases.\nInvestigations over the cheating are under way in several countries, and the scandal has wiped off about half of the company's market capitalisation.\nVolkswagen is preparing for a massive recall of affected vehicles, which it has to repair to meet environmental standards.\nThe VW spokesman on Thursday revealed that around three million of these are 1.6 litre diesel engine vehicles, which would need significant repairs.\nOthers with 1.2 litre and 2.0 litre engines would only require a software update.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:29:12.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
