All such providers exercise independent clinical judgment when providing patient care. Team Health Holdings, Inc. does not have any employees, does not contract with providers and does not practice medicine. \nForward Looking StatementStatements and information contained herein that are not historical facts and that reflect the current view of Team Health Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\") about future events and financial performance are hereby identified as \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Some of these statements can be identified by terms and phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"predict\" and similar expressions. The Company cautions that such \"forward looking statements,\" including without limitation, those relating to the pending IPC Healthcare acquisition, the Company's future business prospects, revenue, working capital, professional liability expense, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, wherever they occur in this or in other statements attributable to the Company, are necessarily estimates reflecting the judgment of the Company's senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the \"forward looking statements.\" Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the occurrence of any event that could give rise to a termination of the IPC Healthcare merger agreement, the risks that the proposed IPC Healthcare acquisition disrupts current plans and operations, current or future government regulation of the healthcare industry, exposure to professional liability lawsuits and governmental agency investigations, the adequacy of insurance coverage and insurance reserves, as well as those factors detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update \"forward looking statements\" herein to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events, or changes to future operating results over time. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures ReconciliationsIn this release we refer to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted Earnings per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\") which are financial measures that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to Team Health Holdings, Inc. before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude the non-cash items and the other adjustments shown in the table under \"Adjusted EBITDA\" in the release. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share attributable to Team Health Holdings, Inc. excluding non-cash and other adjustments, including the impact of contingent purchase and other acquisition compensation expense and amortization expense relating to purchase accounting for historical acquisitions and the other adjustments shown in the table under \"Adjusted Earnings Per Share\" in the release. For a reconciliation of each of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we refer you to the tables under \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and \"Adjusted Earnings Per Share,\" respectively, contained in the release. \nAdjusted EBITDAWe present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. \nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles. In evaluating our performance as measured by Adjusted EBITDA, management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measure. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make, and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, operating income, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \nAdjusted Earnings Per ShareWe present adjusted earnings per share attributable to Team Health Holdings, Inc. (\"Adjusted EPS\") as a supplemental measure of our performance. We present Adjusted EPS because we believe that it assists investors in understanding the impact of acquisition-related costs on our earnings per share and comparing our performance across operating periods on a consistent basis and provides additional insight into our core earnings performance. Adjusted EPS is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles. In evaluating our performance as measured by Adjusted EPS, management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measure. Adjusted EPS does not reflect certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make, and although contingent purchase and other acquisition compensation expense and amortization expense are non-cash charges in the period reported, such charges reflect historical or future cash payments in conjunction with our acquisition transactions. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, operating income, basic and diluted earnings per share, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:08:24.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
