He added that communities requiring buyers to be at least 21 have seen youth smoking rates drop. \nAnother policy recommendation aimed at reducing adolescents' attraction to smoking, using hookah pipes or \"vaping\" (the term for using e-cigarettes), would outlaw all flavors used in tobacco or nicotine products, including menthol in cigarettes and the various flavors in e-cigarettes. \n\"With flavors like peach, grape, cotton candy, gummy bear and so on, what you have is essentially highly addictive candy,\" Farber said. \"Other flavors, such as menthol, decrease the natural harshness of tobacco smoke, and flavored products introduce youth to a lifetime of tobacco dependence.\" \nMore youths used e-cigarettes than any other tobacco product in 2014, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nIn addition to calling for FDA control of e-cigarettes, the AAP recommended that smoke-free laws expand to include e-cigarettes. The group recommends that use of any tobacco or nicotine products, including e-cigarettes, be banned in all workplaces, schools, dormitories, bars, restaurants, health care facilities, sidewalks, parks, recreational and sports facilities, entertainment venues and multi-unit housing. \n\"The jury on e-cigarettes remains out, but it is clear that carcinogens and potentially harmful substances are nonetheless present in this alternate nicotine delivery system,\" said Dr. Jack Jacoub, director of thoracic oncology at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center's MemorialCare Cancer Institute in Fountain Valley, Calif. \nJacoub, who was not involved with the policy recommendations, said that these bans \"would highlight that using e-cigarettes is a potentially harmful thing to do and hopefully will emphasize to teens, young adults and parents that one should not be reassured that it is safe.\" \nOther policy recommendations include a ban on Internet sales of e-cigarettes, a tax on e-cigarettes at the same rate as traditional cigarettes and a requirement for adult ratings on any entertainment depicting e-cigarette use. \nThe AAP also recommended banning advertising of tobacco products and e-cigarettes in all media, including television, radio, print, billboards, signs and online, and in stores where children and teens might see them. \nAnother major recommendation called for child-resistant packaging for liquid nicotine. Poison control centers receive more than 200 calls per month for accidental ingestion of nicotine for e-cigarettes , the AAP noted, and one toddler died last year from swallowing some. \n\"Toddlers and young children love to explore new things and to put things in their mouths, so it is imperative that packaging and childproofing be done to enhance the safety of their environments,\" Fisher said. \"This is analogous to having childproof caps on pill bottles.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:50:23.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
