And now that great experience is set to revolutionize mobile industry as we know it. What’s great about it, you might ask. \nApps, games, and music are now stored in one place. Then we have the brand new Windows Store and your personal assistant Cortana that helps to send reminders to all your Windows 10 devices. Office apps are easy to use on any screen size, and Outlook Mail has the same rich editing tools as Microsoft Word. From Excel to entertainment, Windows 10 keeps your digital life in sync across devices. \nThere were two devices that debut with Windows 10, the first being Lumia 950 with a 5.2-inch screen that we had earlier taken a look. With the Lumia 950 XL, the specs are almost similar but with a much larger 5.7-inch screen. \nIt packs a similar polycarbonate body that comes with a body that measures 151.9 x 78.4 x 8.1 mm (5.98 x 3.09 x 0.32 in) and weighs 165 g (5.82 oz) which is slim and light for a smartphone of this size. \nThe Lumia 950 XL will be sporting a 5.7-inch Quad HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~518 ppi pixel density. This pretty much ensures that you get only the best in terms of display. It is further enhanced with the ClearBlack display technology and to top it all off; there’s the Gorilla Glass 4 to protect your precious. - Advertisement - \nWith excellent display, you would want an excellent workhorse as well right? That is absolutely correct with the Lumia 950 XL having the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset, an Octa-core processor made up of Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 430 graphics and 3GB RAM. It has a better chipset, two more cores and slightly faster processor, better graphics but the same amount of memory. Don’t think you would notice any difference when it comes to performance, simply because the additional power is required to power up the additional screen space. \nIn terms of camera, the Lumia 950 XL has the exact setup with its smaller sibling which is 20MP-5MP. You can find the 20 Megapixel primary camera comes with Carl Zeiss optics and lets you take incredible pictures without having to adjust your settings. The moments you want to remember happen so fast. That’s why the 20 MP sensor automatically reduces motion blur for producing much sharper and more detailed photos. And with unique features like triple LED natural flash and Rich Capture auto mode, challenging lighting conditions won’t stop you from turning magic moments into precious memories. \nWith more detail, better fast-action capture, and virtually seamless auto focus, 4K video is an exciting new way to record your life's magic moments. You can even pull high resolution still photos from your videos. And with the most advanced Optical Image Stabilization module yet, the effect of shaky hand movements while filming is dramatically reduced. \nStorage-wise, the Lumia 950 XL has the exact specs with 32GB of internal storage that can be further expanded up to a whopping 200GB. \nWhen it comes to battery, this phablet is being powered by a Li-Ion 3340 mAh battery that can easily power up the device for at least a day in between charging. And when you do plug in, get ready to get up to 50% capacity with just 30 minutes of charging. Then there’s the wireless charging that is a convenient way for users. \nDon’t forget that the Lumia 950 XL will be sporting the latest Windows 10 right out of the box. What this means is that it will be getting Windows Continuum which means that you can connect the phablet to a Microsoft Display Dock and Windows apps like Word, Excel, and Microsoft Edge scale up for a PC-like experience on an external monitor. It is a quick and easy way to get the productivity benefits of a mouse and keyboard. \nFinally, there’s Windows Hello Beta which is an incredibly personal and secure way to unlock your Lumia 950 XL – simply wake up your device, look directly at the screen, and the built-in infrared camera technology automatically authenticates you. - Advertisement - \nWith a stunning 5.7” Quad HD display and a powerful octa-core processor, it’s the Lumia you’ve been waiting for. Get the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL that works just like your PC and push the limits of what is possible. Windows 10 and the 20 Megapixel Carl Zeiss camera makes for an excellent combination that will provide an unforgettable experience. The $100 extra that you will pay over the Lumia 950 really does makes a difference. \nThe Microsoft Lumia 950 XL is set to be released in November 2015 for $649 USD. It will be available in Black and White, not quite the vibrant Lumia that we used to know.
