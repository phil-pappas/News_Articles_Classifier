Cherwell Service Management software is an award-winning IT service management (ITSM) and business enablement platform that enables IT organizations to automate key IT and business processes that support the delivery of services across the enterprise. Widely renowned for its flexibility and rapid time to value, Cherwell Service Management software can be easily customized and configured by IT organizations without requiring costly application development or consulting resources. \nThe most notable aspect of the new release is functionality enabling Service Integration and Management (SIAM) and Multi-Sourcing Service Integration (MSI). The vast majority of large enterprises rely on multiple IT service providers to drive down costs and leverage specialized expertise. While this approach has allowed organizations to reap the benefits in terms of cost control, its advantages are often overshadowed by the complexity of managing multiple suppliers. This challenge has given rise to SIAM and MSI business practices intended to manage and provide governance for disparate service providers. The new dashboards and processes in Cherwell Service Management software give customers a single point of supplier visibility, resulting in improved accountability, monitoring and control, governance, and IT cost efficiency. \nTweet This : Cherwell Service Management software now supports the #SIAM framework \n\"We developed support for SIAM in direct response to our customers' needs to better understand the end-to-end lifecycle of their IT services,\" said Josh Caid, VP of Product Management at Cherwell Software. \"IT organizations continue to leverage both internal and external suppliers in order to provide the IT services that meet business needs in a cost effective manner. The SIAM functionality enables IT to better understand and manage supplier cost vs. performance and also mitigate risk. By doing this, we help position IT as trusted partners to their businesses.\" \nIn addition to SIAM support, features were added to Cherwell Service Management software in accordance with Cherwell's product roadmap, including: enhancements to the product user interface (UI), improved scalability and additional third-party software integrations. Other new features include: -- Persona-based dashboards: Provide tactical and strategic views of the IT organization based on role such as IT executive, IT service desk manager, IT technician, IT change manager and change advisory board overviews. -- Performance health check feature: Identify the root cause of security, performance, and configuration problems that impact critical operations. -- Trusted agent server integration: Enable your cloud-or SaaS-based Cherwell installations to authenticate via LDAP directories, and avoid complex, expensive firewalls and VPN tunnel configuration. -- IDP-initiated SAML: Enable user authentication within firewalls so that single sign-on (SSO) functionality is supported and the need for users to enter multiple application passwords for identity-provider initiated requests is eliminated. \nThe release schedule for Cherwell Service Management software has been updated to align with Cherwell's new agile development cycle. The company will now launch one major feature release per quarter and scheduled maintenance releases as needed. \nConnect with Cherwell", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:58:57.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
