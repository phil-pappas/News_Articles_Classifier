The first CONCOA Pacific center, which opened in 2002 in Kuala Lampur, continues to support business in countries and cities in the southern part of the region. \nIt is the company’s fifth facility joining a network of locations in the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia. \nCONCOA President Sande Dukas, says, “CONCOA has been a key player in the Asia-Pacific region for many years.” \n“When it comes to rare and special-gases, laser gases, medical gases, and gas-blending technology today, we see the importance of localised support in both regions to better provide customers with what they need when they need it.” \nSeveral factors influenced the company’s decision to double up on facilities in the Pacific region. Many countries there are on a technology curve that is calling for use of cryogens and higher grade gases. \nLocating the new center in Taipei, an economic hub, is based on leveraging focus in important markets. Central to surrounding countries in the North Pacific region, the global city is politically stable and ideal because of its prime location. Technical expertise is plentiful, and a well-developed infrastructure facilitates future growth. \nHeading CONCOA North Pacific is Sales Manager Antony Li, a resident of Taiwan. Li comes from the semiconductor industry with a strong technical sales and marketing background along with excellent organisational and communications skills. \n“Antony brings valuable systems and engineering experience to the CONCOA team, in addition to his tremendous knowledge of the local Pacific market. He is remarkable in his ability to establish rapport with customers at all levels and in diverse cultures,” says Dukas. \nThe market, Li says, has already responded well to CONCOA North Pacific , poised strategically to respond to customers looking for added service and support in the electronics, laser, offshore fabrication and petrochemical sectors. \n“With an extensive range of gas equipment at our disposal, CONCOA North Pacific can provide the expertise and quality service the market requires,” Li concludes. “We are set to make a significant impact in the region with quality solutions. Technical support is just a phone call away, and customers can easily acquire equipment that meets their exact regional and technical specifications.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:57:13.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
