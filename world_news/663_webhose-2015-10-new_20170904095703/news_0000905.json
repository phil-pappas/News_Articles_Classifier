That's the worrying part,\" Mr O'Donnell said. \nThe group is collecting health data from about 300 sailors and \"quite a number of families we are still talking to\" to compare with those who did not go to Mururoa. \nThey want to present it to the Government early next year. \nIt shows high rates of mortality with radiation-related illnesses among the sailors, Mr O'Donnell said. \nThere is also a high rate of birth defects in children and grandchildren, as well as a very high rate of female infertility and a high rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:35:26.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
