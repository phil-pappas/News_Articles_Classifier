Cologix â„¢, a network neutral interconnection and data center company, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Net Access, LLC , a colocation and workspace recovery provider with over 200K gross SQF across three enterprise-grade facilities in Northern New Jersey. The Net Access data centers are each roughly 30 miles outside New York City , over 250ft above sea level and connected via a dark fiber network that extends to key carrier hotels for access to robust connectivity options. This will be Cologix's tenth acquisition, adding a new market and significant scale to its rapidly growing network neutral North American data center platform. The acquisition will enable Cologix to address the vibrant New Jersey market and provide a compelling alternative to colocation options in New York City. \"Acquiring Net Access will expand Cologix's service offerings to address new demand and will allow us to introduce our unique footprint elsewhere to 700+ new customers,\" says Grant van Rooyen , president and chief executive officer, Cologix. \"We have been very impressed with the team and operations Net Access has built and look forward to harnessing the strength of the combined company.\"\nNet Access's 700+ customers range from small businesses to Fortune 1000 brands, spanning Healthcare, Financial, Enterprise, IT/Hosting and Telecom verticals. Among the reasons customers choose Net Access are: their robust infrastructure, accessible but separate location from New York , elevation to mitigate risk of natural disaster and superior customer service. The pending addition of facilities in Northern New Jersey to the Cologix platform follows Cologix's approach of focusing on unique, growing markets that offer alternatives to legacy data center hubs like New York or Chicago .\n\"Our focus has been on expanding our reach because our customers and partners are increasingly asking to grow with us into new markets and for multi-market back-up solutions that we simply could not address as a standalone company,\" explains Raul Martynek , chief executive officer, Net Access. \"As we evaluated options to join a broader platform, Net Access was especially sensitive to finding a platform that shared its customer-centric philosophy. We are excited to join Cologix's North American platform and are confident that the combined company will present new geographic benefits while upholding the highest standards for our customers.\"\nWhen this transaction closes, Cologix will support over 1,600 customers across its North American data center platform, which will include 700K SQF across 24 data centers in 9 markets. Post close, Cologix will operate network neutral data centers in Columbus , Dallas , Jacksonville , Lakeland , Minneapolis , Montreal , Northern New Jersey , Toronto and Vancouver.\nNet Access is a portfolio company of private equity firm Seaport Capital.
