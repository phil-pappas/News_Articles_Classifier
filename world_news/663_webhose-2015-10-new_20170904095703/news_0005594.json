It promotes playtime and the use of imagination. This ensures that children are not bored. The lunchbox also provides a great way to transport food, beverages and snacks, and it prevents items inside from spilling out of the container. Additionally, the unit offers hours of excitement.\nThe original design was submitted to the Los Angeles office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
