They are at the center of a recent superbug outbreak in the United States.\nThe FDA in August asked health care facilities using these and other reusable medical devices to meticulously follow the cleaning instructions to avoid the spread of superbugs.\nThe FDA on Monday gave Olympus Corp, Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Pentax Medical, a unit of Hoya Corp , 30 days to study the effectiveness of the instructions. ( 1.usa.gov/1LdYQcG )\nThe agency said the studies would help it formulate new labeling for the devices to include instructions or other actions to prevent the spread of infections.\nThe three Japanese companies sell duodenoscopes in the United States. Olympus is the biggest maker of the device.\nThe FDA gave the trio warning letters in August after finding multiple violations during inspections of their facilities in the United States and abroad.
