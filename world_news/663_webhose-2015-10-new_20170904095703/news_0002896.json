Susana Martinez at a news conference at W.D. Carroll Elementary in Bernalillo on Thursday. (Susan Montoya Bryan/The Associated Press)\nThe current Internet capacity for the whole of Algodones Elementary School in Sandoval County is about the same as a single 4G smartphone’s.\nAnd about 30 percent of school districts in the state are in the same technological ice age, often preventing teachers from showing Internet videos and using websites in class or during computer lab time.\nBut that would change by 2018 under a plan unveiled Thursday by Gov. Susana Martinez and the national nonprofit EducationSuperHighway school technology improvement group.\nUsing $49 million set aside by a 2014 state appropriation for school Internet improvements and using federal funds set aside for subsidizing school Internet bills, Martinez said every public school in the state will have high-speed Internet access by the start of the school year in 2018.\n“We cannot expect our kids to learn the skills of tomorrow by using the dial-up of yesterday,” Martinez said.\nAlthough no schools are using dial-up, many are served by data plans run through copper phone wires. In fact, some schools, including Algodones, run their Internet on their phone lines, making calls difficult while watching videos on the Internet.\n“We think it (high-speed Internet) is everywhere,” Martinez said. “But it’s not.”\nThe state Public Education Department says 31 percent of the districts in the state have poor Internet access.\nAnd no schools in the state meet the goal set for the 2018 plan.\nThe $49 million set aside through the Broadband Deficiencies Correction Program, approved in March 2014, will be used to install fiber optic systems in schools that don’t have them and upgrade capacity for schools that already have fiber optics.\nIn addition to upgrading the physical capacity, the planners at the San Fancisco-based EducationSuperHighway say they also can help schools save money on their monthly Internet bill.\nLorenzo Barraza, technology coordinator for Bernalillo Public Schools, which includes Algodones Elementary School, said the district’s schools spend more than $500 a month each on Internet service that doesn’t provide what the schools need.\nThe problem is “seriously important,” he said.\nMost schools in the state and nation, including Barraza’s, use federal E-Rate funds to pay their Internet bills. The fund is a portion of the money collected from the Federal Communications Commission’s tax, or fee, on telecommunication companies. The tax is often passed on to customers, appearing on landline and sometimes cellphone bills as a Universal Service Fund fee.\nEvan Marwell, the CEO of EducationSuperHighway, said Thursday that his group often sees schools spending too much on Internet service because of the lack of competition of providers and lack of knowledge of options in procurement of provider contracts.\nWith improvements in fiber optics in a school, the school can spend the same amount of money on its bill but receive more and faster access. His group also is offering to help New Mexico schools look at their provider options and figure out how to get better deals.\n“It’s starting to change,” he said, noting his group’s effort to increase broadband, high-speed Internet access in schools around the nation.\nIn 2012, he said, only 30 percent of the schools surveyed nationally had enough Internet access.\n“A lot of progress has been made,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_16oct_internet-400x291.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:03:14.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
