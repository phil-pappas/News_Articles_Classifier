Which mobile devices and applications are used for various functions? Is LTE or Wi-Fi more often used and why? What quality of experience do employees report? And how would an improved quality of experience impact their mobile usage? \nTo answer these questions and fully understand the mobile experience of employees of U.S. businesses, in August of 2015 iG R, a market research consultancy focused on the wireless and mobile industry, fielded a web-based survey of full time employees of U.S. businesses who worked in a corporate campus or office environment. Survey respondents were required to work in a building and in specific industries. \nThe resulting study, which was sponsored by Ericsson and Fujitsu Network Communications, provides an analysis of the mobile experience of U.S. workers and importantly, quantifies how their mobile data usage would be impacted by improved mobile service. \nSome of the major findings of the study include: Over half of respondents would likely increase their mobile data usage if their in-building mobile data connection got significantly faster -- 53 percent if the price stayed the same and 55 percent if they also got unlimited mobile data usage. Approximately half of respondents would likely increase their mobile device usage if they could use their device in all of the places in their workplace that they could not before -- 47 percent if their rate plan did not change and 53 percent if they also got unlimited data. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they would be very likely or somewhat likely to switch mobile operators if their colleague's mobile operator improved his/her voice and data coverage inside their building. Some of the actions that would likely be taken if a mobile operator were to improve the mobile voice and data coverage inside an office or building include: Forty-three percent of respondents said they would likely use their mobile device more while inside their building (possibly causing the need for an increased 'bucket' in their data plan) Twenty-seven percent would likely upgrade their mobile data plan to include more data each month Thirty-nine percent said they would likely upgrade to a better smartphone Twenty-two percent would likely upgrade their laptop and 19 percent would likely upgrade their tablet Eighteen percent would likely buy a tablet, and if that tablet were added to a mobile data share plan, that might cause the need for a larger monthly data allowance. \n\"Our new study found that improved mobile service while inside buildings would have significant impact on U.S. employees' mobile data usage and would also lead to increased spending with their mobile service provider,\" said Iain Gillott, president and founder of iG R. \"And in-building wireless solutions can provide an improved mobile experience.\" \niG R's new sponsored market study, Demand and Opportunities for In-building Wireless Solutions in the U.S. , provides an analysis of the usage of and demand for in-building wireless solutions. The study also details the current mobile experience of U.S. employees and highlights the opportunities that exist for mobile operators and device manufacturers due to improved mobile coverage that can be provided by in-building wireless solution. \nThe following key questions are addressed in the new research study: What mobile devices are being used by U.S. employees at work? Where are mobile devices used in the workplace and in which types of buildings? How are Wi-Fi and mobile data (LTE) used in buildings? Which mobile services and apps do U.S. employees use on the mobile devices while inside buildings? What is the perceived mobile voice and mobile data experience for U.S. employees? How would improved mobile data speed impact employees' mobile data usage? How would improved mobile data coverage impact employees' likelihood to upgrade their device, increase their usage of LTE and possibly churn? \nThe information in this market study will be valuable for: Mobile operators", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:02:49.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
