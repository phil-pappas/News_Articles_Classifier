Eric Charbonneau Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason Netflix and the art of burying bad news Watch Netflix's trailer for Beast of No Nation US streaming giant Netflix is looking to create its own news program over the next two years as it prepares for the premiere of its first original feature film this week and the launch of its first talk show in 2016, with US comedian Chelsea Handler .\nNetflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said the company was exploring new types of content, including news programming.\n\"On the news side, we're definitely being more adventurous in terms of the genres we're going into,\" Mr Sarandos said during the company's third-quarter financial results briefing.\n\"We're getting ready to launch Chelsea Handler's talk show next year, that's our first move into talk....most of our things have been very long-shelf-life TV shows or movies, so I think [news is] a very similar migration, or certainly exploration.\"\nTo clear away any confusion, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings turned to his colleague and asked \"what's the likelihood that we compete directly with Vice in the next two years?\"\n\"Probably high,\" Mr Sarandos responded. The executives did not expand on that point during the briefing.\nMillennial media group Vice has partnered with HBO to produce a daily 30-minute news program . Vice has already produced a number of series for the network and has won an Emmy award for outstanding information series last year.\n When asked about the streaming company's interest in sport, Mr Sarandos quashed any ideas that Netflix would join the bidding wars for broadcasting rights.\n\"There's a lot of irrational bidders for sports, we're not anxious to become another one,\" he said. \"In sports, sports on-demand is not as exciting as sports live.\"\nBeasts of No Nation , Netflix's first feature film production about a boy soldier in an unnamed West African country, will launch on the service on Friday (US time) and in selected theatres in the United States.\nNetflix this morning reported its third-quarter earnings , predicting it would break through the 70 million paid subscriber mark by the end of the year and tap financial markets next year for more cash to push its content and global expansion.\nIn the September quarter, the company made a profit of $US29.4 million ($40.2 million) on sales of $US1.7 billion. It had 66 million paid subscribers, up from 62.7 million in the three months through June. The US streaming giant expects to reach 70.4 million by the end of 2015, even though it missed growth expectations in its home market.\nInternationally, the California-based company grew its paying subscriber base by 2.7 million to 26 million in the third quarter, beating expectations, and forecast to boost them to 29.5 million by year's end. Netflix does not break out subscriber figures by individual countries. Netflix launched in Australia and New Zealand earlier this year.\nThe international arm of the business, which has long been unprofitable, is planned to break even through 2016 and deliver profits after that, Mr Reed said. It plans launches in Spain, Italy and Portugal next week, and expanding its reach to South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore in early 2016. Netflix launched in Australia and New Zealand earlier in 2015.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts", "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beasts_of_no_nation/", "https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://www.facebook.com/chelseahandler", "http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/chelsea-handler-netflix-talk-show-documentaries-1201549717/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRsaclO0VbU", "http://www.hbo.com/vice/about/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:18:45.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
