(IT) again cut its 2015 guidance for global semiconductor-equipment sales, citing sluggish electronics demand.\nThe data tracker now expects worldwide semiconductor-capital equipment spending will decline 1% to $63.9 billion this year. Gartner also affirmed its expectations for sector sales to drop 3.3% next year as the result of weaker spending for memory products.\nThe company also noted that since its previous forecast, capital-spending reductions have been announced by major chip makers including Intel Corp. (INTC), as well as outsourcing firms and integrated-device manufacturers.\nOn Tuesday, Intel reported that its third-quarter profit fell 6.3% on a small revenue decline. The results revealed more pain from the shrinking personal-computer business, though higher chip prices and demand for larger computers helped soften the blow.\nGartner also had lowered its outlook for chip-making gear sales during July, at the time projecting semiconductor-capital equipment spending growth of 2.5% to $66.1 billion for this year, compared with an earlier estimate for an increase of 4.1%.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 11:48 ET (15:48 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:43:06.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
