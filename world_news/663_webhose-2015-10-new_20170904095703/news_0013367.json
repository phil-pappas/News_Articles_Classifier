The company has announced the availability of higher lumen packages to fill out the portfolio, a 9mm LES option in addition to the current 19mm LES option, and a true and verifiable 50,000 hour warranty.\nThe XIM module delivers smooth, deep dimming to 0.1% and meets IEEE 1789 standards, eliminating negative health effects related to flicker. Good dimming consists of many important elements, including smoothness, predictable response to input, a broad adjustable range and consistency between all sources. “By integrating the dimming engine into the LED module, we have been able to set new standards. XIM modules dim harmoniously and gracefully, adding a well-executed choreographic element to the lighting design,” says Willem Sillevis Smitt, Vice President of Marketing at Xicato. “An integrated approach also eliminates the need for an LED driver, which results in an attractive cost proposition.”\nXicato is the first to equip its Intelligent Modules with sensors that register vital operating parameters that get stored in the on-board microprocessor. This allows for temperature feedback control to prevent overheating in the case of unforeseen conditions or erroneous installation. By also registering operating time, warranty can now be tied to true operating hours, removing the need to guess based on operating days and hours per day. Xicato warrants its XIM products for 50,000 hours (or 7 years, whichever comes first), covering light output and color consistency as well as the integrated electronics at zero failures. Xicato’s approach to warranty provides substantial improvements to fixture dependability and sustainability, lowering total cost of ownership at the same time.\nDriven off a 48V DC external power supply, Xicato Intelligent Modules enable a simpler light fixture design that is easier to scale and is future proof to ongoing LED improvements and module enhancements. Fixtures can now be qualified to UL2108, significantly easing fixture design and shortening development time and cost in relevant markets. Because the LED driver is no longer necessary inside the fixture, smaller and more elegant designs are possible.\n“Xicato Intelligent Modules deliver improved control performance and are easy and cost effective to implement at the same time. We see customers implementing better designed fixtures, delighting end-users in retail, museums and restaurants with less obtrusive lighting systems,” says Rob Verbeelen, CEO of Luxendi, Xicato distributor in Belgium, The Netherlands and France. “These benefits, coupled with Xicato’s unmatched color consistency and reliability, ensure beautiful spaces for years to come.”\nAbout Xicato:\nXicato designs and develops light sources and electronics that enable architects, designers and building managers to create beautiful, smart spaces in which people love to live and work. With thousands of installations around the globe, Xicato continues to be a leading supplier of high quality lighting solutions. Xicato is defining the future of intelligent light sources by integrating electronics, software and connectivity.\nFounded in 2007, Xicato’s headquarters is based in Silicon Valley and the company has offices in China, Japan, Europe and the US.\nFor further information visit http://www.xicato.com .\nFor additional information, contact:\nShaina Pinell\nMarketing Manager\nXicato, Inc.\n+1 720.331.5625\nshaina(dot)pinell(at)xicato(dot)com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037257.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037257.htm"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:25:52.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
