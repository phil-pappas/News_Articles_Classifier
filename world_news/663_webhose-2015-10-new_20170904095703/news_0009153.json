Einstein focuses on perimeter defense, while CDM is a broad threat-detection program designed to give network operators a clearer view of vulnerabilities. \nChris Cummiskey, former acting undersecretary for management at DHS, has told FCW that CDM stands a better chance than Einstein of mitigating sophisticated breaches because CDM \"seems to give us the additional ability to see these bad actors on the networks, once they're already through the perimeter.\" \nBoth programs draw on big coffers. CDM's acquisition vehicle has a $6 billion ceiling, and DHS has requested $479.8 million for \"network security deployment\" in fiscal 2016, including the latest iteration of Einstein, known as Einstein 3A. \nDHS Secretary Jeh Johnson told the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21 that he has directed DHS to make at least some of Einstein 3A's features available to all federal civilian agencies by year's end, and agencies are on track to adopt the system. The program has blocked more than 650,000 requests to access potentially malicious websites, Johnson said in his prepared testimony. Nonetheless, he also stated that \"our federal .gov cybersecurity, in particular, is not where it needs to be.\" \nEisensmith advised putting money toward the weakest link in an organization's cybersecurity. \n\"If you're going to make an investment, you look and you say, 'Where [am I] not really at a maturity level that I want to be?' That's where the next dollar goes,\" he said. \"The only caveat to that would be if a new threat pops up tomorrow that changes the maturity level. Then you have to react.\" About the Author \nSean Lyngaas is an FCW staff writer covering defense, cybersecurity and intelligence issues.
