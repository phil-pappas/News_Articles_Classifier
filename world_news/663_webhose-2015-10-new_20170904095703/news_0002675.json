Founded in 2013, under the leadership of Tony Coles, Una Ryan, and Matthew Hudes, BAB has worked with industry, universities, investors, medical centers, health insurers and payors, high-tech companies and government to advance several key strategic imperatives to support the Bay Area life sciences industry. As a result, BAB has emerged as a new model for cross-disciplinary collaborations.\nCLSI maintains a complementary mission to support the foundations of innovation that have made the Bay Area and California home to the world’s most prominent life sciences ecosystem. Founded in 2015, CLSI was previously known as the BayBio Institute, which was established in 1990.\n“By bringing our synergistic activities under one umbrella, we will be able to carry on BAB’s legacy of supporting the innovation that will continue to bolster our vibrant Bay Area BioEconomy,” said Una Ryan, Chair of the BAB Board of Directors.\n“The Bay Area ecosystem will benefit from our joined forces,” added Lori Lindburg, Executive Director of CLSI. “Together, as a single organization with statewide reach, support and influence, we will continue our work to ensure that the economic and intellectual power of California’s life sciences sector and its employees remains strong.”\nThe combination will allow for a common mission under the umbrella of CLSI. A major focus of the combination will be a dedicated effort to measure the strength of the Bay Area entrepreneurial ecosystem. The data and metrics generated by this effort will be highlighted at the 2016 BIO International Convention.\nAbout California Life Sciences Institute (CLSI)\nCalifornia Life Sciences Institute (CLSI) supports the foundations of innovation that have made California home to the world’s most prominent life sciences ecosystem.
