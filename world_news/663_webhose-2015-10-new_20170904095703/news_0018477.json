His work at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory demonstrated that neutrinos from the Sun don't disappear on their way to Earth, but change form instead.\nTogether their work overturned the prevailing theory that neutrinos have no mass, and has forced physicists to reconsider the fundamental make-up of the universe.\n\"This is a really big discovery,\" says Barbro Asman of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nAsman says it could help explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe, a riddle that has eluded scientists for years.\n\"When matter is created, it's created with equal amount of matter and antimatter,\" she says. \"So the problem we have then is why are we here containing only matter?\"\nSpeaking by telephone to a news conference in Stockholm, McDonald said his discoveries not only gave scientists a more complete understanding of the world at a fundamental level, but could also shed light on the science behind fusion power, which drives the Sun and could one day be tapped as a source of electricity on Earth.\nThe scientists will share the $960,000 prize.\nSource: Al Jazeera and agencies", "external_links": ["http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2015/press.html", "http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/", "http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/index-e.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:28:14.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
