The first part, made for all of Rs. 9 crore, according to film website Bollywood Hungama, struck a chord with audiences. But the plot of PKP2 does not pick up from where it left off in the first. Besides, the star cast is quite different and the film has an entirely new setting.\n“ PKP2 is not a true sequel in the sense that it doesn’t take the same story forward,” said Ranjan. “But it’s a sequel in spirit because we’re dealing with the same issue of the mess men’s love lives can be. So, while at the end of Pyaar Ka Punchnama , the three guys resolved their problems, the idea was to go out and find more fools in love,” he added.\nPKP2 is not the first sequel to deviate from the original movie’s plot and context. While films like Tanu Weds Manu Returns , Welcome Back , the Krrish and Dhoom series pick up threads from their previous instalments, recent hits such as Aashiqui 2 , Ragini MMS 2 , the Raaz , Murder and Jism sequels had nothing to do with their earlier parts.\n“Working only with the title and bearing no similarity with the original film is all about cashing in on the brand,” said Sanjay Gadhvi , director of Dhoom and Dhoom 2 . “It doesn’t make sense to me but somewhere down the line, it is the prerogative of the producer if he simply wants to work in the same space and genre. After all, sequels are made only of successful films and that means 20% of the marketing of your new film is already done,” he added.\nTo be sure, Viacom18 Motion Pictures, the production house behind PKP2 , has not skimped—from posting warning signs of ‘Love Is Injurious to Health’ at popular hangouts across 10 Indian cities for fans to take selfies with, to organizing ‘bar raids’ for the male leads where they drop in at bars in Mumbai, to a radio contest called ‘Pyaar Mein Pareshaan’ that asks men to ‘vent’ on air and, finally, a ‘Mohabbat Ka Morcha’ where the cast will take to the streets to protest against obstacles to relationships in Delhi. One was organized in Mumbai last week.\nGadhvi, whose blockbuster sequel followed many of the original characters and their journey, said he belongs to the old school and believes a sequel should inhabit the same world as the first film, the hurdles and forces at play in it. “Such sequels also have the advantage of loyalty towards familiar and loved characters. Like frequent flyers on airlines or regular customers at hotels,” he said, citing the example of classic Hollywood series like Indiana Jones , James Bond and The Fast and the Furious .\nRanjan, on the other hand, believes that the lack of continuity is actually the best part about his film. “When people watched the first part, they were surprised and excited. I was new, so was the cast. There was no visibility. The film caught on and people are looking forward to the second part, thanks to the concept and relatable vibe. But the same story would lack excitement now.”\nClearly, successful films trigger sequels. But does a hit sequel owe its success partly to the original film? Director Mohit Suri ’s romantic musical Aashiqui 2 (2013) earned nearly Rs. 80 crore at the box office, far outdoing (even if inflation is taken into account) the immensely popular original that in 1990 earned Rs. 2.5 crore. This year’s Tanu Weds Manu Returns , with a collection exceeding Rs. 150 crore, is one of the most successful sequels ever.\n“A sequel’s success is definitely a credit to the earlier part that had already established that loyalty,” said Gadhvi. “That said, a successful film cannot guarantee a successful sequel. “\nBollywood’s first sequel Nigahen: Nagina Part II (1989), a fantasy film starring Sridevi , managed less than Rs. 2.5 crore at the box office. It followed Nagina (1986), that had earned around Rs. 6 crore. Ram Gopal Varma ’s path-breaking gangster flick Satya (1998), that crossed Rs. 11 crore, was followed by Satya 2 (2013) that brought in less than Rs. 2 crore.\n“It is important for the makers to be aware of the added pressure and focus on the film’s strengths. This translates probably into bigger stars and better styling for the sequel,” said Gadhvi.\nAs Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 readies itself for audiences four years after the original hit theatres, the makers are aware of the changed times.\n“The characters, their lifestyles and aspirations have evolved to reflect the youth of today even though the core issues and themes remain the same,” said Rudrarup Datta, head of marketing and operations, Viacom18 Motion Pictures. “But PKP 2 works because this is a universal theme and will connect irrespective of age. If you’ve watched part one, you will definitely want to watch the second. And if you watch the second, you will surely go back to the first.”\nPyaar Ka Punchnama 2 releases on 16 October. It stars Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha, Sunny Singh Nijjar, Sonalli Sehgal, Omkar Kapoor and Ishita Sharma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:27:07.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
