At one point, she said had a flat tire, according to Fox13.com. \nThanks to numerous 911 calls, officers were able to track down her Toyota Corolla. \nAlthough Lakeland Police officers are not authorized to use Periscope, one of the officers added the app to his own phone in order to track the suspect, according to WTSP.com. \nWhen the officers initiated a traffic stop, Beall hit a curb, according to WFTV.com \n\"I really hope I don't get a DUI,\" she allegedly said seconds before hitting a sign in the median, a moment captured on video. \nWhen Beall was finally apprehended, officers said she smelled of booze, spoke slowly and had bloodshot, glossy eyes, according to TBO.com. \nPolice said Beall failed a sobriety test and refused a breath test to determine her blood-alcohol level. The suspect was booked into the Polk County Jail on DUI charges. \nBeall told WFLA on Monday that she \"made a big mistake .” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:18:20.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
