We look at the various manifestations of Platform as a Service—public and private, open and proprietary, domain-specific and general. We examine the value of PaaS to developers, and what shapes their choices across PaaS providers, including pricing, functionality, and deployment options. Finally, we consider the future of PaaS. \n\nIntroduction \nIn 2012, Stratecast named Platform as a Service (PaaS) the hottest new cloud service, predicting it would eclipse IaaS and SaaS in strategic importance.2 The prediction is closer to reality, as cloud service providers and software vendors invest in platform services as a means to attract a share of the highly active and growing developer market. PaaS is a cloud service on which developers can build, deploy, run, scale, and manage their cloud applications. Stratecast believes that, more so than its better understood cloud brethren Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), PaaS is the cloud layer that truly facilitates innovation, and fuels the technology magic that will shape the future.\n\nPaaS is the bridge between application development and cloud deployment. With PaaS, developers can focus on their unique code, trusting the platform to automatically and efficiently handle the logistics of deployment and runtime. Freed from even thinking about infrastructure, developers can simply do what they love: solve problems with their choice of code. It's as if any tinkerer could ship off his plans to a facility that not only builds a prototype but supports a complete factory production run—at little to no charge.\n\nToo much hyperbole? Not at all. PaaS has been known to inspire poetic outpourings; most notably, this Haiku penned by Pivotal's Onsi Fakhouri .\n\nhere is my source code\nrun it on the cloud for me\ni do not care how\n\nAlthough PaaS holds the promise of the technology future, the market is still immature. The term PaaS is used to describe a variety of software offerings, some of which (strangely enough) do not even touch the cloud. Furthermore, PaaS adoption continues to lag behind other cloud services. \nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3336744/ \n\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com \nFor more information: \nSarah Smith \nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com \nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com  \nTel: +44 208 816 85 48 \nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com \n\nSOURCE ReportBuyer\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:21:49.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
