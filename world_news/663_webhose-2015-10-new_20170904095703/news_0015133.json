Third quarter net income was $61.5 million, $0.20 per diluted share, compared with net income of $70.3 million, $0.23 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015 and $118.0 million, $0.38 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2014. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20101012/SF78952LOGO \nYear-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $392.9 million. Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, to be paid on December 1, 2015 to shareholders of record on November 10, 2015. \n\"Market conditions globally were quite varied this quarter as some vertical markets produced good growth while others were weak. In spite of these headwinds we saw double-digit new product growth plus continued strength in data center demand,\" said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. \nThird Quarter Business Summary \nThe quarter's sequential sales decline reflects choppy conditions across the company's vertical markets. Telecom and Wireless sales grew as wireless equipment demand rebounded from the prior quarter. Industrial market weakness was the major contributor to a decline in sales in the Industrial Automation, Military & Auto vertical market. Networking, Computer & Storage sales grew, led by gains in computer and storage, as data center customers increasingly leverage the performance and low power benefits of Altera FPGAs. Gross margin was 66.5 percent, down from the second quarter, due to unfavorable changes in vertical market mix. Reduced merger-related expenses led to a sequential decline in the quarter's operating expenses. The company's tax rate was 21.4 percent, up from the prior quarter, largely the result of continuing adverse geographic mix and reduced acquisition-related costs in the quarter.

(2) We define operating margin as gross margin less research and development expense, selling, general and administrative expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and merger expenses, as presented above. This presentation differs from income from operations as defined by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), as it excludes the effect of compensation associated with the deferred compensation plan obligations. Since the effect of compensation associated with our deferred compensation plan obligations is offset by losses/(gains) from related securities, we believe this presentation provides a more meaningful representation of our ongoing operating performance.
