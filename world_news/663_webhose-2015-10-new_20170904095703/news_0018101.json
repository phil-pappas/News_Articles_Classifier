Rasul Bailay & Sagar Malviya | 08 October 2015, 2:33 PM IST Share Myntra, the country's top online fashion retailer that was acquired by Flipkart last year, hopes that the Big Billion Day sale starting on October 13 will help attract thousands of new customers. The Bengaluru-based company that went app only last year has already more than made up for the customers it lost when the website was shut down, with a user base of 12 million, Myntra chief executive officer Ananth Narayanan told ET in an interview. Edited excerpts: It has been six months since Myntra went app only. What has been the overall response? We have almost lost no revenue; in fact, we have growth coming from the app only transition. The level of personalisation that you can do in an app is higher and better than what you can do with the desktop. Hence, the amount of time our users are spending on the app is 10-12 minutes on an average. We believe this is a big indicator of engagement. The lifetime value of a customer on an app is almost 2x out of somebody who would shop at a desktop. But you did lose customers, didn't you? Yes, we did lose customers. But the rate at which the mobile is growing, we got a lot of new customers. When you say lost, it is all by the way temporary. What we are doing is we are continuing to try and get them back on the app in a very systematic manner. Over the next six months, we are hoping that a lot of them will convert. Do you expect the upcoming sale period to help you get more customers? My sense is yes, it will be a big bump. We have a lot of fresh season styles at a great value. So terrific selection and terrific pricing, I am hoping, is going to make consumers come to our app. Have you set any target for the Big Billion Day (BBD) sale period? We now have about 12 million users. We are looking for roughly 8-10x in traffic and about 3-4x in revenue on those five days. On a normal day, we ship two lakh packages in five days, but for this sale we are estimating six lakh packages to be shipped. How are you sprucing up your back-end infrastructure to support the orders? The team is working hard on three things tech, supply chain, and consumer experience. Load testing is being done to make sure that nothing breaks during the experience. Likewise, on supply chain, we have done a fair amount of prep both in terms of our warehouse and providers to make sure that we can handle the increase in revenue. We are adding server capacity so that it can handle more number of transactions on an hourly basis. We have also tied up with Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra for cashbacks. Which categories you think will have the highest traction? Ethnic, because we are getting into the festive season. Are you adding any new brands during BBD sales? We have a curated selection of bestselling brands, with fresh styles at great value aimed at creating an exceptional shopping experience for our 12 million users. Last year we were not officially associated with BBD. But in that time we saw a 3x jump. I am hoping that with this we will get a bigger jump. Some big brands such as Puma, Lee, Vera Moda, and Vans are also participating. Their fresh season will be at a great value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:14:54.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
