Our results pretty strongly suggest that they can, even among this group in which peer influences are starting to take over and have a stronger impact.” \nFor the purpose of the study, three dimensions of parental styles were examined — warm, restrictive and anxious-emotional. \nAccording to the researchers, warm parents show approval through affection and generally refrain from physical discipline. \nRestrictive parents are known for setting and enforcing strict rules for the household, while anxious-emotional parents are overprotective and known for showing elevated emotions during interactions with their kids. Dad’s heaps emotional. We should play Call of Duty. \nAfter examining these dimensions of parental styles, it was discovered the children of emotional and anxious parents were more likely to play violent video games. \n“It is not surprising that warmer and more restrictive parents, or what we call authoritative, are most effective at reducing the amount of violent video games played by their children,” he said. \n“If parents are more anxious, their message is not as well received by their children and it inhibits what they are trying to do. It is pretty clear from our study that is what is happening with kids playing violent video games.” \nMr Laczniak said these findings should encourage parents to think about how they are communicating with the children. \n“If parents want to reduce the amount of violent video games that their kids play, be warm when dealing with them, but somewhat restrictive at the same time, and set rules and those rules will work,” he said.

For example, how does depression or delinquency interact with violent video game use?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:15:59.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
