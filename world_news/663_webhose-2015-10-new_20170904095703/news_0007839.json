The sensor, along with a proprietary DIGIC 6 Image processor, creates Canon’s HS System to provide photographers with vivid and detailed still images and video, even in difficult low-light shooting scenarios. \nProviding quality still images and video for social sharing, the stunning 1080p Full HD video (at 24p, 30p, and 60p in MP4 format) and still images captured on these cameras can be transferred after capture to compatible smartphones, tablets, or the new Canon Connect Station CS100 photo and video hub device, via built-in Wi-Fi** and NFC*** capability.

The “Star Trails” mode is now enhanced to improve the breaks in light between star trails turning star movement into a luminous still image, while the “Star Time-Lapse Movie” mode makes beautiful video clips that show the movement of the stars against a static background of dark space. \n“We continue to strive to provide photographers with a range of imaging equipment options to support each individual shooting style while still providing the features, usability, and performance they expect from a Canon camera,” said Yuichi Ishizuka, president and COO of Canon U.S.A., Inc. “Our PowerShot G-series cameras offer a range of options designed to satisfy professionals looking for a convenient back-up camera to their DSLR as well as photography enthusiasts looking for maximum image quality in conveniently compact cameras they can take with them anywhere.” \nThe PowerShot G5 X \nIncorporating a bright, built-in high-resolution EVF that allows photographers to more easily compose and take pictures as well as track moving subjects, the high-performance PowerShot G5 X camera also features a bright f/1.8 - f/2.8 4.2x Canon Optical Zoom Lens (focal length range equivalent to 24-100mm). With the combination of a nine-blade iris diaphragm for beautiful background blur effects and an Intelligent Image Stabilization (IS) system that provides virtually shake-free images in a wide variety of shooting conditions, this camera’s optical system enables users to capture the shot as they envisioned it and is ideal for shooting in low-light conditions or when a shallow depth-of-field is preferred for more dramatic, soft backgrounds and beautiful portraits. \nThe PowerShot G5 X camera’s 2.36-million-dot high-definition OLED electronic viewfinder provides high-quality viewing from edge-to-edge, especially useful when composing an image or shooting in bright sunlight. Additionally, a three-inch, 1.04 million dot touch panel LCD screen provides a bright, clear display that enables one-touch control of many camera settings and features a Vari-Angle design that enables easy viewing from various shooting angles while protecting the screen from inadvertent scratching when the camera is stored. \nHoused in a classic black body, the enhanced controls include top-mounted mode and exposure compensation dials, front and rear control dials, and a control ring around the lens, which can all be customized to best suit different shooting styles. The PowerShot G5 X camera also features a built-in flash plus a dedicated hot shoe providing full compatibility with Canon’s powerful range of EX-series Speedlites and related accessories. There is also a 3.5mm mini-jack for compatibility with Canon’s Remote Switch RS-60E3. \nThe PowerShot G9 X \nSlim and lightweight, the PowerShot G9 X is the camera photographers will want to show off to their friends as much as they shoot with it. The camera features a bright f/2.0 - f/4.9, 3x Canon Optical Zoom Lens (focal length range equivalent to 28-84mm) along with Canon’s Intelligent Image Stabilization (IS) system for virtually shake-free images in a wide variety of shooting conditions. \nThe camera’s intuitive three-inch LCD touch panel with a new user interface allows for quick and easy changes to camera settings even while taking pictures. In addition to the touch panel, a lens-mounted control ring can be utilized to adjust several functions, including customizable manual focus. For shooting fast-moving subjects from kids at birthday parties to athletic events, the PowerShot G9 X camera has continuous shooting speeds up to six frames per second (fps) so none of the action is missed. It is available in classic black, or in a retro-style, silver-gray body with brown stitched leather accents. \nShared Features \nThe PowerShot G5 X and PowerShot G9 X models both feature three convenient ways to charge the NB-13L lithium-ion battery pack: (1) via an optional USB cable connected to a powered USB socket to charge the battery while it is still in the camera body, (2) via an optional USB-connected AC Adapter to charge the battery while it is still in the camera body, and (3) via the standalone external battery charger that is supplied with both cameras as standard equipment. \nBoth new PowerShot models incorporate a broad range of exposure modes from fully automatic to full manual, and both offer users the choice of RAW as well as JPEG recording modes for still photos. Additionally, both new models incorporate a built-in ND filter for enhanced exposure control in bright shooting conditions. \nPrice and Availability \nThe PowerShot G5 X and PowerShot G9 X camera kits are scheduled to begin shipping in November 2015 at suggested retail prices of $799.99 and $529.99, respectively. \nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc. \nCanon U.S.A., Inc., is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States and to Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico) markets.
