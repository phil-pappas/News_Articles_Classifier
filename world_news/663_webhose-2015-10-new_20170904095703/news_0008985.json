Drewry argues in its latest Maritime Equity Research that there has been a deceleration in major emerging markets across the globe and that, along with falling commodity prices, will likely affect global trade levels until late 2016.\nHowever, container shipping could be affected for even longer, feeling the negative impact until 2018.\nThis news comes as portentous for an industry which has been continuously adding to the big ship order book, with several orders received well over the 20,000 TEU mark, and OOCL set to snatch the biggest containership record from MSC after making a 21,000 TEU ship order earlier in 2015. \nWith ports already struggling to handle the impacts of ever larger vessel calls, with the combined effect of vessel cascading affecting ports of all sizes, a global slowdown in trade with a ballooning order book could well complicate an already intricate logistical jigsaw, leading to massive peaks and prolonged downtime periods.\nCEO of the Port of Long Beach Jon Slangerup recently stated that it was vast cargo surges coming off ships and the “extraordinary randomness” of container discharges that are the deepest problems for ports and terminals, according to the JOC , and the synergy of a slowing global economy with a growing order book looks set to compound Slangerup’s warning.   \nAs the interplay between the shipping and port industries becomes increasingly erratic, calls for tighter collaboration have become commonplace, although with liners, freight forwarders and ports all seeking to satisfy their immediate duties, a coherent analysis of the bigger picture becomes harder to grasp.\nThis is further complicated by the fact that markets and industries are always liable to rapid change.\nHowever, the roots of a future synthesis between ports and shipping have begun to emerge, with Dr Oscar Pernia and Manuel Perez writing a very popular paper with PTI recently on ‘The Port of the Future’ , opening up potential solutions for tomorrow's industry.\nAs the situation becomes more complex, it also presents opportunity for a dialogue to begin between the shipping industry and ports, creating mutually beneficial opportunities that can also protect both industries against market volatility.\nFor all the latest shipping news, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:28:36.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
