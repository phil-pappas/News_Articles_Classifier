Effective October 1, 2015, NPD’s Video businesses, which are part of its Entertainment practice, will be combined with Connected Intelligence. Connected Intelligence will continue focusing on the mobility, wearable and home automation business areas, looking at the ownership and usage of connected consumers. Given the growing interest in the new forms of content consumption and the devices that content is consumed on, the combined businesses are better poised to address the changing needs within the industry.\nConnected Intelligence president, Eddie Hold, has been appointed as head of the combined Connected Intelligence practice. In this new role, Eddie will lead the Entertainment video businesses, as well as retain oversight of the Connected Intelligence business, building additional synergies between the two previous practice areas to create a cohesive digital distribution strategy that addresses the needs of the Studios, TV Networks and other related businesses.\n“Digital viewing is rapidly moving from a PC-based early adopter experience to one that now reaches nearly 50 million households directly on their TV, not to mention their array of mobile devices,” said Hold. “Only by understanding the fusion of content consumption and device usage can a true view of this landscape be understood. Combining NPD's Entertainment research with the Connected Intelligence Advisory service positions NPD and its clients at the forefront of this emerging new world.\"\nIn conjunction with this restructure, NPD will be launching a new practice area for its BrandLink product, which was formerly part of the company’s Entertainment practice. BrandLink provides consumer insights on the celebrities and music artists they like, brands they wear, use, and consume on a regular basis, the stores and websites they visit, and the devices they use. With this information, BrandLink is able to provide a fact-based rationale for creating highly targeted marketing programs around sponsorships and endorsements.\n“BrandLink is now uniquely positioned to help optimize the significant investment that brands make when they choose a celebrity sponsor,” said Don Unser, group president, The NPD Group. “Brands are increasingly demanding that their sponsorship decisions be informed by the same type of data that informs their other media planning decisions, rather than by instinct.”\nBarbara Zack, vice president at The NPD Group, will lead the company’s launch of Brandlink, assisting the company as it transforms BrandLink into the provider-of-choice for those who are making brand-talent investment decisions.\nAbout The NPD Group, Inc.\nThe NPD Group provides global information and advisory services to drive better business decisions. By combining unique data assets with unmatched industry expertise, we help our clients track their markets, understand consumers, and drive profitable growth.
