As mobile becomes an integral part of everyday life for students, Helix Education's world class digital marketing campaigns put institutions in front of prospective students, connecting with prospects exactly where and how they want to engage.\nEducational search volume is increasingly going mobile. In fact, Helix Education is seeing a significant part of its partners’ paid search traffic becoming majority-mobile. Mobile educational search has shown a 29 percent year-over-year increase, says the Google Education Search Analysis Q2 2015 report.\n\"I couldn't be more proud of our team for bringing this global recognition home to Helix — they have worked tirelessly to help our partner institutions deliver mobile campaigns that drive results,\" said Pete Thornfield, Vice President of Marketing Services at Helix Education. \"Leveraging mobile as part of an institution’s marketing mix gives students more opportunities to engage with colleges and universities. Our mobile campaigns combine the creative rigor and data insights that increase conversion rates and reduce cost per click, enabling our clients to create an interactive digital presence that produces better results at a lower cost.\"\nAs an integrated agency of record , Helix Education helps institutions leverage multi-channel campaigns, including digital marketing and mobile strategies, to strengthen brand identity through compelling creative. Coupled with powerful data attribution models, Helix continually optimizes the media mix for each institution, maximizing results and ROI.\n\"When you consider that 86 percent of undergraduates own a smartphone, and 47 percent own a tablet, it just makes sense that institutions embrace the power of mobile search and advertising as part of their mix. Students are on the go and want easy, convenient access to information. Helping our clients evolve their marketing programs to meet the needs of today's students reinforces their relevancy and student-centric focus,\" noted Thornfield.\nAs part of its Gold award, Helix Education also qualified to send three of its Search team members to the Googleplex, Google's corporate headquarters in Mountain View, CA. For two days, the Helix team had the opportunity to learn about innovation in digital marketing from a group of experts who know the space and strategy intimately.\nAbout Helix Education\nEducators today are challenged to achieve multi-layer visibility, actionable analytics and measurable results, yet the legacy partnership approach that spans the industry simply can't support these outcomes.
