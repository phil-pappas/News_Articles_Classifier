During this rebuild, they also updated information regarding their dumpster rental service as well as adding information about the company so that customers can become more educated on their business.\nThey designed this website to be more user friendly by making it more interactive and easier to access when navigating. They believe these alterations will help current and prospective customers find information such as holiday and recycling schedules and any other important information they may need.\nTo capitalize on their new user friendly site, they've also added areas for customers to pay their bills online or even request paperless billing altogether. With customers completing transactions remotely from home, they will be spending much more time on the company's website.\nLikely their most significant update was creating a mobile friendly platform. By adding social media links on their site that direct users straight to the corresponding social media page, they hope to encourage customers to follow their company more closely.\nTo give potential customers a better idea of their services and how they operate, they've also added client testimonials to show the satisfaction that past users have experienced with their products and services.\n“We’re very proud of our new and improved website. We believe it will serve as a great tool of communication between our company and our customers,\" said Russell Boersma, General Manager at Arrowaste.\nWith a completely new look, theme, and feel, Arrowaste is confident that their updated website will bring more traffic to their page, eventually leading to a substantial increase in their business in the future.\nAbout Arrowaste\nArrowaste is a full service, independent company servicing residential, industrial, and commercial services throughout southwest Michigan; they also offer temporary dumpsters.
