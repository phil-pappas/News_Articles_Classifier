The healthcare industry is trying to swiftly capitalize on additive manufacturing technologies, also referred to as 3D printing. Whether developers are creating prosthetic limbs or using living cells to bioprint human tissues and organs, experiments in this industry are progressing at a remarkable pace. RoosterBio’s 50 million cell RTP format is an unprecedented stem cell product configuration that provides significant quantities of high quality human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) in a uniquely designed format to simplify and standardize the most complex and labor intensive aspects of bioprinting. The most significant challenge in the advancement of 3D bioprinting is the scarce availability of living cellular biomaterials for printing. RoosterBio’s RTP product allows bioprinters and tissue engineers to thaw and use stem cells for same day experiments, avoiding time-, labor- and cost-intensive cell expansion processes. By simply thawing and using hMSCs, scientists can minimize time between experiments for rapid experimental turn-around and publication. Furthermore, the highly standardized starting cellular materials will minimize experimental variability. This innovative product format allows users to take advantage of RoosterBio’s economies of scale to obtain hMSCs at a fraction of the cost of any other cell systems on the market. This new product reinforces RoosterBio’s commitment to engineering solutions which remove complexity from adult stem cell research and accelerate customers’ product development efforts. RoosterRTP-hBM-50M was unveiled at the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society (TERMIS) World Congress in Boston, MA from September 8-11, 2015, where the rapid development of the bioprinting industry was on full display. Erik Gatenholm, CEO of CELLINK stated: “The 3D Bioprinting field is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing scientific areas today. 3D Bioprinting can be explained through the utilization of three components, namely: a 3D Bioprinter, a bioink or hydrogel, and human cells. Currently, generating human cells is a significant bottleneck due to the time needed to culture expand cells for the bioprinting process. With the RoosterBio RTP stem cells, this is no longer the case. The cells can be thawed and used immediately. Now, we can finally offer our customers complete ready-to-use solutions. The RTP cells will fast-track bioprinting research and discovery.” RoosterBio’s mission is to accelerate the development and commercialization of Regenerative Medicine products, by providing standardized stem cell product platforms that enable rapid translation of discoveries into product development.
