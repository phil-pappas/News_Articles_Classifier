Two cameras for the price of one? Twitter \nLeaker Steve Hemmerstoffer has tweeted a picture of the supposed Huawei P9’s camera stripe. It suggests that the device is set to feature dual rear-facing cameras. \nNot only does the picture show two cameras, it also shows two more sensors next to them. One would expect one of those to be for an LED flash, although the other could be for laser autofocus like what you get with the LG G4 . The picture also suggests two variants of the phone- an LTE version and a Delux version. \nWe heard about this device back in May with the rumoured specs saying that it would definitely be a high end phone. The processor powering it is supposedly the Kirin 950, made from TSMC’s 16nm process. Also it is set to have a curved designed, fingerprint scanner on the back and 5.2-inch screen. \nInterestingly the rumours at the time also said the camera would be 16MP. It seems quite unlikely Huawei will be able to pack in two 16MP cameras if it is set to be dual on the back so we’ll have to see how that plays out. \nDon’t expect this device to be out anytime soon though as it has been suggested the P9 will not be announced until 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:47:42.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
