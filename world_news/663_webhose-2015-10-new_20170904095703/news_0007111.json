The technology helps telecommunications companies explain data and usage charges on billing statements; turns complicated insurance policies into interactive educational tutorials; and empowers financial service providers with the ability to better understand and communicate investment options to clients. Each EngageOne Video acts as a customer service, sales, and marketing resource as viewers create their own experiences through self-selection of topics and actions relevant to their needs. Available around the clock for the always-on customer, EngageOne Video is developed for the individual consumer and can be accessed through any device of their choosing. \nEngageOne Video offers human-like communications that improve customer satisfaction, lower call center volumes, and deliver higher customer retention rates. With the ability to draw on individual consumer insights, EngageOne Video can present tailored information for new customer on-boarding or billing inquiries, as well as deliver up-sell and cross-sell opportunities specific to the account. \nBy fusing Big Data and predictive analytics with customer intelligence, EngageOne Video provides a significant customer service advantage over static videos. Organizations hoping to address specific questions can build in intelligence, and add prompts and content most relevant to the customer’s immediate situation. Added functionality, including comprehensive dashboards showing video performance and success metrics can also provide organizations with insights into common inquiries. This helps inform future sales and marketing campaigns while improving the overall customer experience. \nAbout the Technology Innovation Awards \nThe Technology Innovation Awards, the largest business and technology leadership awards program in the industry, cover 28 categories spanning from big data to mobile technology to CIO and CFO awards.
