Otherwise it is just on paper,\" he said.\nThe OECD's proposals on tackling so-called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) aim to shake up rules dating back almost a century that govern taxation of profits from international commerce.\nG20 governments are expected to approve them at a summit in November, though the plan will not be legally binding.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the BEPS initiative could help avoid a race to the bottom in economic policymaking.\n\"What we can't do, and the initiative that's being announced here is a way to show that we won't, is that we can't get into a beggar-thy-neighbor kind of economic policymaking,\" Lew said.\n\"There's an important step being taken here in announcing the consensus being reached on base erosion and I hope it's indicative of the political will to do some of the positive things that are described as well,\" he said.\nFor Germany, Schaeuble did not rule out the introduction of tax breaks for companies on revenue generated from patented or licensed research.\nThe government has repeatedly said it would consider introducing so-called patent boxes if there were no progress toward fair tax competition at a global level.\n\"That could be a way with tax means to promote research work in Germany,\" Schaeuble said of patent boxes. \"Many people are calling for this and there are many good arguments to do it. But we will discuss it calmly.\"\nUnveiling its tax recommendations on Monday, the OECD said they represented a fundamental shift, though critics said they did not go far enough.\nThe OECD said a conservative estimate of the amount of untaxed money moved by companies into tax havens was $100 billion to $240 billion annually, suggesting tens of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue.\nTax advisers agreed that the measures - which had been debated over the past year - could force many companies to restructure their operations and rethink how they fund themselves.\n(Additional reporting by Krista Hughes ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:10:49.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
