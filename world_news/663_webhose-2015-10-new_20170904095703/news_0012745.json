Saleh Al-Jasser director general of Saudia was also present at the ceremony. \nAt a press conference later on Thursday in the operations building Al-Jasser said the SR350 million Saudia facility would also be ready by mid-2017 as part of its strategic program that includes fleet development expansion of its flight network and installation of the latest information technology. \nAl-Jasser said the new building would allow Saudia to administer all operations under one roof. The plan is eventually to increase the number of flights from 500 to 1000 a day which would be one of the highest airline operations in the world he said. \nHe said the Kingdom's airports would increase the number of passengers they handle from the current figure of 28 million to 45 million by 2020 a goal that has been laid down in GACA's operational plan. \nOn privatization he said Saudia has taken significant steps in certain areas including supplies and types of services and setting up companies with shares owned by the public. \nAl-Jasser said the entry of a third airline company in Saudi Arabia was no problem for Saudia and would be good for competition. He was referring to the plan by Qatar Airways to launch Al-Maha airline company to operate along local routes in the Kingdom. \nAl-Maha would reportedly initially operate flights from Jeddah Riyadh Dammam Madinah Abha and Qassim. Qatar Airways already operates international flights between Doha and Riyadh Dammam Jeddah Taif Qassim Al-Ahsa and Madinah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:52:24.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
