Based on amendments introduced by Rapporteur Knut Fleckenstein (S&D), procedures for limitation and selection of port service providers are notably bound to become much more straightforward.\nPatrick Verhoeven, Secretary General of the European Community Shipowners’ Association (ECSA), said: “We welcome this approach. It is in everyone’s interest that procedures are as transparent and simple as possible. With the proposed changes on the table, we see no reason whatsoever to maintain the current exemption of cargo handling and passenger services, let alone justify the additional exclusion of pilotage that is proposed by some MEPs.\n“In the interest of legal certainty and the widely praised ‘level playing field’ we therefore encourage MEPs to go for an inclusive story.”\nEuropean shipowners warn for additional restrictions that may be introduced under the guise of social protection.\nLieselot Marinus, Director of Shipping and Trade Policy at the ECSA, said: “We support proposals that seek to improve the qualifications, safety and working conditions of employees. But we cannot accept attempts to force disproportional restrictions on new market entrants through unjust application of rules on transfer of undertakings.”\nMEPs will be discussing the 712 amendments that have been tabled on the proposal at the monthly meeting of the TRAN Committee this afternoon. Compromise amendments are under consideration and it is expected that TRAN will vote on the proposal in November, 2015.\nFor all the latest on the ECSA, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:56:55.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
