Ongoing business earnings per diluted share((1)) totaled a record $3.45 compared to $3.04 in the same prior-year period, primarily driven by the benefits of cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, ongoing cost productivity, favorable price/mix and benefits from acquisition integration activities. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20040202/DETU004LOGO \nNet sales in the quarter were a third-quarter record $5.3 billion compared to $4.8 billion during the same prior-year period, an increase of over 9 percent. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased nearly 25 percent. \n\"We are pleased with the strong financial results we delivered in the third quarter,\" said Jeff M. Fettig, chairman and chief executive officer of Whirlpool Corporation. \"Our operating plans and focused execution delivered another quarter of record revenues, operating profit and earnings in spite of a challenging operating environment in several key emerging markets.\" \nThird-quarter GAAP operating profit totaled $329 million compared to $335 million in the same prior-year period. Record third-quarter ongoing business operating profit((2)) totaled $418 million, or 7.9 percent of sales, compared to $387 million in the same prior-year period. Benefits from acquisition integration activities, cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, ongoing cost productivity and favorable price-mix more than offset unfavorable currency, declining emerging market demand and increased investments in marketing, technology and products. \nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the company reported cash used in operating activities of $(157) million compared to cash used in operating activities of $(128) million in the same prior-year period. Whirlpool Corporation reported free cash flow((3)) of $(492) million in the first nine months of 2015 compared to free cash flow((3)) of $(532) million in the same prior-year period. \nOUTLOOK \nWhirlpool Corporation has updated its full year 2015 guidance primarily to reflect continued weakness in emerging market demand and negative currency impacts. As a result of these changes, along with the benefits of previously announced actions to improve margins, the company now expects to deliver GAAP earnings per diluted share of $9.75 to $10.25 and ongoing business earnings per diluted share of $12.00 to $12.50 for the full year 2015. 2015 EPS Outlook Prior GAAP Diluted EPS(i) $9.50-$10.50 Legacy Product Warranty and Liability Expenses(ii) (0.41) Reduced Restructuring Expenses(ii) 0.61 Additional Benefit Plan Curtailment Gains(ii) 0.15 Brazil Demand and Currency (0.50) Effective Tax Rate Benefit 0.25 Current GAAP Diluted EPS(i) $9.75-$10.25 Benefit Plan Curtailment Gain (0.61) Restructuring Expense 2.24 Combined Acquisition Related Transition Cost 0.57 Legacy Product Warranty and Liability Expenses 0.41 Pension Settlement Charges 0.15 Proceeds Related to a Business Investment (0.62) Antitrust Resolutions 0.13 Ongoing Business Diluted EPS(i) $12.00-$12.50 (i) Diluted EPS available to Whirlpool. (ii) These changes do not impact Ongoing Business Diluted EPS. \nFor the full-year 2015, the company now expects to generate free cash flow((3)) of approximately $600 million to $700 million. Included in this guidance are restructuring cash outlays of up to $200 million, capital spending of approximately $700 million to $750 million and U.S. pension contributions of approximately $72 million. \n\"We remain focused on value creation and executing our long-term growth strategy,\" said Fettig, \"and we will deploy additional actions as necessary to continue delivering strong returns for our shareholders.\" \nTHIRD-QUARTER REGIONAL REVIEW \nWhirlpool North America \nWhirlpool North America reported third-quarter net sales of $2.8 billion, unchanged from the same prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased nearly 3 percent. \nThe region reported a third-quarter operating profit of $349 million, compared to $304 million in the same prior-year period. Ongoing business segment operating profit((4)) totaled a third-quarter record of $336 million, or 12.0 percent of sales, compared to $304 million, or 10.9 percent of sales, in the same prior-year period. Ongoing cost productivity and favorable raw materials more than offset unfavorable currency and increased investments in marketing, technology and products. \nThe company expects full-year 2015 industry unit shipments to increase by approximately 5 percent. \nWhirlpool Europe, Middle East and Africa \nWhirlpool Europe, Middle East and Africa reported third-quarter net sales of $1.5 billion, compared to $0.8 billion in the same prior-year period, an increase of 85 percent. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased over 127 percent. \nThe region reported third-quarter operating profit of $32 million, compared to $9 million in the same prior-year period. Ongoing business segment operating profit((4)) totaled a third quarter record $71 million, or 4.9 percent of sales, compared to $9 million, or 1.2 percent of sales, in the same prior-year period. The benefits from acquisition integration activities, favorable price-mix, ongoing cost productivity and the benefits of cost and capacity-reduction initiatives more than offset unfavorable currency and increased investment in marketing, technology and products. \nThe company expects full-year 2015 industry unit shipments to be flat to up 2 percent. \nWhirlpool Latin America \nWhirlpool Latin America reported third-quarter net sales of $0.8 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the same prior-year period.

Improved product price/mix and the benefit of cost and capacity reductions were more than offset by unfavorable currency and lower unit volumes due to a weaker demand environment in Brazil. \nThe company expects full-year 2015 industry unit shipments in Brazil to decrease by approximately 20 percent. \nWhirlpool Asia \nWhirlpool Asia reported third-quarter net sales of $346 million, compared to $157 million in the same prior-year period, an increase of 120 percent.

Ongoing business segment operating profit((4)) totaled a third quarter record $27 million, or 7.7 percent of sales, compared to $(8) million, or (5.0) percent of sales, in the same prior-year period. Benefits from acquisition integration activities, favorable raw materials and the benefits of cost and capacity-reduction initiatives positively impacted margins. \nThe company expects full-year 2015 industry unit shipments to decrease by approximately 2 percent. \n(1) A reconciliation of ongoing business earnings per diluted share, a non-GAAP financial measure, to reported net earnings per diluted share available to Whirlpool and other important information, appears below. \n(2) A reconciliation of ongoing business operating profit, a non-GAAP financial measure, to reported operating profit and other important information, appears below. \n(3) A reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to cash provided by (used in) operating activities and other important information, appears below. \n(4) A reconciliation of ongoing business segment operating profit (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, to reported segment operating profit (loss) and other important information, appears below. \nTHIRD-QUARTER 2015 // PRODUCT LEADERSHIP, INNOVATION AND AWARDS \nWhirlpool Corporation is the global home appliance industry leader with deep consumer insights and a strong portfolio of brands worldwide.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Millions of dollars except per share data) (Unaudited) \nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as \"ongoing business\" measures, including ongoing business operating profit (loss), ongoing business operating margin, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin, ongoing business earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), ongoing business earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin, ongoing business earnings (loss) before income taxes, ongoing business earnings per diluted share, ongoing business segment operating profit (loss), ongoing business segment operating margin, and free cash flow. Ongoing business measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management believes that free cash flow provides investors and stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These ongoing business financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported operating profit (loss), net earnings per diluted share available to Whirlpool, reported operating profit (loss) by segment, and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the following reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. \nOngoing Business Operating Profit, Ongoing Business Earnings Before Interest and Taxes and Ongoing Business Earnings Per Diluted Share \nThe reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing business operating profit, ongoing business earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing business earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, operating profit and net earnings per diluted share available to Whirlpool, for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
