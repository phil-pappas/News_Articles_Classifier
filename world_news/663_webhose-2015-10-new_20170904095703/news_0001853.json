Sales of its pickup trucks and crossover vehicles are climbing in the U.S., weighing against weaker global sales.\nHere’s what to expect from GM earnings.\nEarnings: Analysts polled by FactSet expect GM to report adjusted earnings of $1.19 a share in the third quarter. That would be up from 97 cents a share a year ago.\nRevenue: The same analysts forecast GM third-quarter sales to reach $36.87 worldwide, down from $38 billion a year ago.\nSales in North America are expected to be higher, however, at $26.5 billion, up from $25.8 billion a year ago. Revenue from its South America division, is expected to shrink to $2.42 billion, from $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2014.\nStock reaction: GM shares have lost 5.2% of their value so far this year, compared with a loss of 1.5% for the S&P 500 index. Charts look a lot brighter for GM in recent months, however, with shares up 8% in the last 90 days, contrasting with losses of 4.7% for the index.\nAnalysts have an average price target of $40.71 on the stock, which is about 23% upside from Monday prices.\nWhat to watch for: Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect a “large beat” for GM in the third quarter, mostly thanks to its North America unit, according to a note published last week.\nGM is selling more cars in its home market thanks mostly to lower gasoline prices and low interest rates, but elsewhere in the world it has felt the pinch of a stronger dollar and macroeconomic pressures.\nSales in South America recently fell 31%, and sales in other developing countries, including China, also fell.\nBut GM has shown strength in its product development, and is set to be “a likely leader” in electric cars and connected-car technology, analysts at Credit Suisse said in a recent note.\nCredit Suisse analysts increased their price target on GM stock to $36 a share on such hopes, and said GM is a good investment relative to other car makers, particularly rival Ford Motor Co. F, +0.26%\nGM enjoys better cost controls and a better product lineup for the next two years, they said. It also gets good exposure in China with its Wuling and Baojun brands (through a joint venture with Chinese auto makers), while its less mature finance company has “substantial earnings upside,” the analysts said.\nInvestors will also want to hear whether GM management may have used the recent share price softness to accelerate buybacks during the quarter, said Goldman Sachs analysts.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:46:03.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
