He or she has to restore the image and credibility of the IEC from the dented image that Tlakula opposed on it.\nBut the main question to be asked is if Mashinini would really be unbiased, come any future elections, this after having been so close to Zuma’s inner circle.\nElections has to be free, fair and without intimidation, fault or favour, but we can seriously wonder how and where the loyalty of Mr Mashinini would lie in future elections, and how his decision once elections is done and dusted can be ‘bought’?\nThat the ANC is desperate to have the right people in the right places, in view of its diminished support base and the upcoming local elections of 2016, is as clear as daylight.\nAnd what better move to make than to put one of your closest allies in the position of Chairperson of the IEC just if it is ever needed to ‘alter’ those votes cast to be in favour of the man that you served closely and the party that you obviously support.\nIn time to come we will see that this appointment wasn’t made on the face of having someone transparent, loyal, unbiased and a-political person in the position, but for personal and party benefit, and then the consequences may bite us in the shin and for us then to realize that the appointment was made with a personal and party agenda behind it.\nThe ANC at this point in time is so desperate to secure its support come the 2016 elections and what better place than to have one of your own as Chairperson of the IEC?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:11:06.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
