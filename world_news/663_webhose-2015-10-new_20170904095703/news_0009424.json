Indian organisations have detected 117% more information security incidents over the previous year. The number of such security incidents shot up from an average of 2,895 incidents to 6,284 in 2015. This is a sharp deviation from the global trend, which saw a 39% increase in security incidents over the previous year.Indian firms have seen a steady increase in the average number of incidents detected over the past five years, with a CAGR of 68%.The financial loss incurred by Indian companies because of security breaches has also doubled. It stood at $1.3 million on an average last year. This year it has increased by 104 percent and is estimated to be $2.8 million on an average. And what do you think are the factors that led to the speedy detection of security incidents? Indian organisations are rethinking their cyber security requirements and preparing for advanced threats. Organizations have invested in technologies that have helped them detect security breaches which went unnoticed earlier.The drastic improvement in cyber technologies has helped organisations detect more incidents than before. An organisation can now detect attackers as they enter its network, whereas earlier it could only catch attackers on their way out, if at all.Since the Indian companies have started investing in cyber security technologies they are now able to detect more incidents through better end point protection, anti virus, event monitoring system and web application software.Another reason for the detection of more incidents is the convergence of information technology, operational technology and consumer technology, which has helped organisations adapt and evolve business models. What are some of the new trends in information security? Over the last two years incidents of insider threat saw a steady reduction. This year there has been an increased number of such threats from employees, suppliers and customers.An insider caused nearly 15 security incidents for every 10 incidents caused by an outsider. Yet, a majority of businesses are unprepared for insider threats.Most of the Indian companies do a poor job of identity management. For example companies don't remove access after an employee has quit the organization. Generally, across the globe MNCs have set up a good identity management system to minimise insider threat. India is yet to invest in that area.Insiders have an advantage as they have authorised access to information and hence have no need to breach any security controls. They also understand the organisation's competitive environment better than any other external actor. They know exactly where to look for the company's most valuable information.Former employees were a major security threat. This indicates that the companies need to establish greater rigour in their exit-related processes and make sure that all accounts and access of the users are deactivated upon separation.With the advent of internet, enterprises have extended the access to their suppliers and customers. But they don't have a proper backend system to manage the access that is being provided to the customers and suppliers. This leads to security incidents.For almost 50 percent organizations, suppliers and customers as likely sources of security incidents.Some organisations are exploring the use of data analytics for identity and access management to monitor employee usage patterns and flag outliers. In this scenario, the data analysis solution looks for patterns around the employee access entitlements and then identifies unwanted access. How are emerging technologies like cloud and big data impacting the security landscape? There's a trend unique to Indian market - when it comes to security a lot of companies are looking for cloud based solution. If they move to cloud they can get a lot of threat intelligence. if an organization moves on a cloud platform from Amazon, Microsoft or Google these cloud providers have their own threat intelligence center on cloud that helps enterprises protect their data better.Big data analytics is another technology that improves security standards within the enterprise. A data-driven approach can shift security away from perimeter-based defences and enable organisations to put real-time information to use in ways that can help predict security incidents. Data-driven security enables companies to better understand anomalous network activity and more quickly identify and respond to security incidents. It can also be effective in reducing or quickly detecting employee security incidents by monitoring their behaviour for suspicious activity. In India, over 1/4th of the CIOs have plans to employ big data analytics for improving their security programmes in the next 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:50:10.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
