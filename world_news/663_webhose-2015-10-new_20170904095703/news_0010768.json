Investors will be looking to see if Alibaba can improve take rates to make up for this slowdown,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said. \nMediocre data from the firm behind China's biggest and most-successful e-commerce platforms could provide fresh fodder for bears predicting China is heading for a much harder economic landing than the official figures would suggest. \nHaving warned in September of slower-than-expected sales, Alibaba's revenue in the three months through September is expected to be 21.3 billion yuan ($3.35 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data analysing forecasts from 28 analysts. \nThat would represent an increase of 26.7 percent from the same quarter last year, when year-on-year growth was a sizzling 53.7 percent. \nIn the April to June quarter, revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV) - the total value of goods transacted across Alibaba's platforms - both eased to their slowest rates in more than three years. \nTo be sure, government data shows retail sales have continued to grow above 10 percent so far this year, even as GDP growth has slowed to 6.9 percent in the third quarter. \nBut a China consumer confidence index produced by ANZ Bank and polling company Roy Morgan fell to a record low in August, and research firm Gartner says smartphone sales recorded their first fall in China during the second quarter. \nEven so, Alibaba founder Jack Ma told shareholders in a letter earlier this month that high savings rates and lower prices online would continue to drive e-commerce spending regardless of the economic environment. \nAlibaba celebrated the one-year anniversary of its record $25 billion initial public offering in September by watching its share price dip to an all-time low of $57.20 that month. \nSince then it has rebounded back above the IPO price of $68.
