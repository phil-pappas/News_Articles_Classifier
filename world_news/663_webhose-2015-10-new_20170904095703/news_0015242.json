CEO Kazuo Hirai told a technology conference on Tuesday that following the hack, the movie studio has \"come out more resilient, more strong and they have a very good management team in place now.\" Hirai said there wasn't much of a business impact from the hack, although he said employee morale was hurt for a short time.\nFormer Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal left her position after a trove of embarrassing emails was leaked, including racially insensitive remarks about President Barack Obama's purported taste in movies. She continues to run a production venture at Sony that will handle major blockbuster franchises such as the \"Spider-Man\" series.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:37:53.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
