We're confident in the value this Offer provides to COS shareholders.\" \nThe latest offer, which is subject to certain customary conditions, represents a significant premium of 43% based on the closing prices of the COS shares and the Suncor shares. \nIt would also result in an investment in an integrated energy company with significant liquidity and access to capital. \nSuncor said it has structured the offer to meet the requirements of a 'Permitted Bid' under the existing shareholder rights plan of COS. \nIncluding COS' estimated outstanding net debt of C$2.3bn ($1.7bn) as at 30 June 2015, the total transaction value is about C$6.6bn ($5.03bn). \nResponding to the Suncor offer, COS said that it would communicate a recommendation to shareholders soon, after reviewing the offer and related take-over bid circular. \nCOS holds a 36.74% interest in the Syncrude project, which produces light, sweet synthetic oil from Canada's oil sands. \nImage: Suncor develops and produces natural gas in Western Canada.
