It includes issues such as expanding the definition of \"licensing body\", the implementation of the CMOs' obligation to negotiate with users in \"good faith\", the complaints process and alternative dispute mechanisms, and sanctions and enforcement action taken by the IPO. \nThe IPO is inviting interested parties to submit substantive comments on the legal effect and impact of the Draft Regulations by 10 November. A summary of responses will be released once the Draft Regulations are in force. \nA copy of the technical review and Draft Regulations is available here . \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Dentons \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email… Your first step to b * By using the service, you signify your acceptance of Privacy Policy (Updated: October 8, 2015) \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through its website \nJD Supra collects users' names, companies, titles, e-mail address and industry.
