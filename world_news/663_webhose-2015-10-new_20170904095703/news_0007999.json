SCinet, the powerful network that is providing more than 1 Terabits per second (Tbps) of capacity for the SC Conference, is provisioning multiple 40/100G Ethernet links that will be showcased November 16-19, 2015 in Austin, Texas. Spirent Federal will be critical in helping to verify these links so that exhibitors can effectively use them for their high performance computing applications and demonstrations. \nThe SCinet is using Spirent TestCenter software with Spirent two-port 100 GbE fX and two-port 40/10 GbE fX2 modules. The test also uses Spirent Federal’s SPT-N4U chassis, which is designed to lower the cost of testing devices and networks powering the always-on data network. Spirent Federal's solution is being used for line rate qualification and performance testing of several 40/100Gbps Ethernet links to national research and education networks. \nSpirent TestCenter, along with the latest modules and chassis, supports testing at bit rates from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps and beyond. Since accuracy is critical to analyzing traffic at line rate, Spirent’s 100G module has a system clock with a resolution of 2.5 ns, more than twice as fast as required to support Ethernet at 100 Gbps. All ports can be synchronized to provide the accuracy required to evaluate the performance and QoE of services delivered over 40/100G Ethernet. \nFor more information about Spirent Federal’s high speed Ethernet testing solution, visit http://www.spirentfederal.com/IP/Products/Spirent_TestCenter/Overview/ . \nAbout SC15 \nSC15, sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) offers a complete technical education program and exhibition to showcase the many ways high performance computing, networking, storage and analysis lead to advances in scientific discovery, research, education and commerce.
