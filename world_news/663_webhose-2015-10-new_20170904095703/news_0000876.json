However, data scientists have been faced with an unattractive trade-off. They can use scarce internal resources to collect data and maintain confidentiality, but this is expensive and slow with a high opportunity cost. An external crowd can be more economical and faster, but runs the risk of breaching confidentiality. \nWith the new CrowdFlower and iMerit partnership, and the launch of the NDA Crowds capability on the CrowdFlower data enrichment platform, enterprise customers with sensitive data no longer have to make this trade-off. For the first time, teams needing large sets of data - from data scientists, to data-driven product managers and business process owners - can now collect high-quality, human-curated datasets at scale, secure in the knowledge that their data is only seen by iMerit data specialists, who have signed non-disclosure agreements with CrowdFlower and work in secure locations. \n\"The CrowdFlower mission has always been focused on helping companies enrich their data,\" said Lukas Biewald, chief executive officer and founder at CrowdFlower. \"By adding this new data confidentiality capability in our data enrichment platform, we're expanding the types of sensitive data sets that can be processed by our customers. We're thrilled to be raising the bar again for how we serve leading data science teams through this exciting partnership with iMerit.\" \n\"We're delighted to be partnering with CrowdFlower to deliver this confidential, high-quality service through our skilled and continuously trained staff working in a secure environment,\" said Radha Basu, chief executive officer at iMerit. \"We created iMerit because we saw a need for human-empowered computing, and to combine this with an opportunity to provide stable jobs to women and youth around the world.\" \nTo learn more, visit http://info.crowdflower.com/nda-contributors or come and hear iMerit CEO Radha Basu speak on the topic of Human-Empowered Data at the Rich Data Summit at The Village on October 14. \nAbout CrowdFlower CrowdFlower is the essential data enrichment platform for data science teams.
