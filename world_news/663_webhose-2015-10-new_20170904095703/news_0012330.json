Reuters/Pascal Rossignol \nGoogle, which has now morphed into holding company Alphabet Inc, is in talks with messaging startup Symphony Communication Services LLC for a round of fundraising, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. \nSymphony's chat service allows financial firms, corporate customers and individuals to put all of their digital communications on one centralized platform. \nThe talks are ongoing and no terms are finalized yet, the source added. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Monday that Google invested in a new round of funding for Symphony that values the company at about $650 million, citing people familiar with the matter. ( on.wsj.com/1RreVN1 ) \nThe service is backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other big Wall Street banks. \nGoldman led a group of 14 banks including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co in making a $66 million investment in Symphony last October, when Symphony was set up. Symphony did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nMany on Wall Street think of Symphony as a rival to Bloomberg LP and Thomson Reuters Corp, which provide messaging and information services for bankers, traders and investors. \nThose terminals can cost tens of thousands of dollars per year for each customer. \nSymphony is available to businesses with more than 50 users for $15 per user per month. Smaller businesses and individuals can use the tool for free. \nLast month, Symphony said they are working with News Corp's Dow Jones to offer news stories in its service and with McGraw Hill Financial Inc to integrate data and analytics from its S&P Capital IQ product. \n(Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Don Sebastian)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:00:33.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
