Now located at 27629 Chagrin Boulevard in Woodmere, the new IOIO is set in one of Cleveland’s upscale retail areas, next door to Studio MZ. Their former space was located at 34302 Euclid Ave.\n“We chose our new location because it opens up a lot of new possibilities for our clients,” said Lee Ponsky M.D., IOIO principal. “It’s a more centralized area that is close to the freeway so it’s easy for our clients to get to us…plus there are a lot of things to do in this area.”\nAccording to Dr. Ponsky, Ink On Ink Off/IOIO Studio’s new location offers and a very aesthetically pleasing experience for clients.\n“To us, it’s always been about the experience of our clients, so being located in a cool area like this definitely adds more dimension to our studio,” Dr. Ponsky said. “Now we are more of a destination – we are already seeing a lot more foot traffic and clients dropping in to check us out.”\nInk On Ink Off/IOIO Studio’s new space includes two treatment rooms: One that houses their state-of-the-art PicoSure laser which they use for tattoo removal and skin revitalization, while the other room is devoted entirely to new tattoo artistry.\n“We are extremely excited about our studio’s design,” Dr. Ponsky said. “Our tattoo room can open up into the waiting area so other guests can watch tattoos being done if the client chooses.”\nIn addition, the new space has a quiet relaxation area where clients can go to unwind after treatments, and the artists’ drawing space that overlooks the studio. Bright white walls and tall ceilings add to the airy, upscale feeling and provide a backdrop for local artists to showcase and sell their art, while wooden barn doors and rustic metal beams bring in an organic feel that is both refreshing and soothing.\n“Another exciting thing about our new location is that we now have retail space that allows us to sell a few select products like the Khushi skin care line out of New York, unique PF Candles out of San Francisco, and our very own skincare line…IOIO,” said Sidney Quinn, Ink On Ink Off/IOIO Studio general manager.\nInk On Ink Off opened in March of this year and was the first clinician-led studio in Cleveland to offer tattoo alterations, removals, and new artistry all under one roof. According to Dr. Ponsky, the move to the new location allows them to spread their message.\n“We’ve always said we want to introduce a new concept,” Dr. Ponsky said. “Tattoos are mainstream now, and we want people to feel comfortable coming in to our high-end studio, whether it is for a new tattoo, to alter an existing tattoo, or remove one.”\n“We are redefining the way people think about tattoos, and skin revitalization, and now with the new location, we hope our studio will provide an inviting, hip comfortable environment while still offering a slight clinical feel to instill confidence in our world class quality,” Dr. Ponsky explained. “Our vision is to build a clinical arts community that provides clients with options to ‘redefine their canvases’ that haven’t been available until now.”\nIn addition to their tattoo emphasis, Ink On Ink Off/IOIO Studio also has a steadily growing skin rejuvenation and revitalization business that utilizes the same PicoSure laser they use for tattoo removal to remove acne scars, age spots and wrinkles, and offer skin tightening, according to Ink On Ink Off/IOIO Studio Physician and Medical Director, Jill Miller, MD.\n“This same laser technology lets us help our clients achieve tremendous results on acne scars, wrinkles, age spots, freckles, and other pigmentation issues,” Dr. Miller said. “They love the way we are able to give their skin a more youthful and healthier appearance.”\nIf you’d like more information about Ink On Ink Off, or would like to schedule a free consultation, you can visit their website at http://www.inkoninkoff.com , and IOIOstudio.com or call their office at (216) 633-7569.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5pbmtvbmlua29mZi5jb20="], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:35:29.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
