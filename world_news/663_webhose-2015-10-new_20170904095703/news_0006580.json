Thanks to the efforts of our many associates, our builders and city, state and federal officials over the past five months, we are here today. We look forward to welcoming back our customers and delivering on our mission of improving the health and wellness of Baltimore.\" \nIn honor of the grand re-opening, The Rite Aid Foundation will present a $10,000 donation to Bettye M. Adams, principal of The Historic Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Elementary School. The school, which is located less than a half mile from the Rite Aid at 300 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, serves nearly 500 students and will use the donation to help fund athletic equipment for physical education classes in support of furthering the physical fitness and wellbeing of the students. \nRite Aid currently operates 30 stores in the city of Baltimore and an additional 70 locations in the surrounding area and employs approximately 800 associates. \nThe re-built store features the Company's highly popular Genuine Wellbeing store format, which was designed with Rite Aid's commitment to providing services, products and resources to help its customers and their families live healthy lives in mind. \nUpon entering the store, there is a direct wooden path leading to the pharmacy department, the core of Rite Aid's business.
