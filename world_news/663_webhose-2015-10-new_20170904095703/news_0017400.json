Semble Foundation is perfectly positioned and equipped to transform the way faith-based nonprofits across the country address financing needs. The Foundation’s principals have a wealth of experience in this arena, having independently helped the nonprofit and faith-based community access over $1 billion in necessary financing. The catalyst of the Foundation’s approach is an online lending platform, licensed by the Foundation, which provides investors the ability to channel their investment capital toward the loan needs of faith-based organizations they want to impact. By offering a solution tailored toward the needs of the nonprofit, Semble Foundation is able to significantly reduce payments and ultimately equip nonprofits with the resources to drive their core missions in the community.\nSemble Foundation’s mission is to be a financing resource for every faith-based nonprofit looking to profoundly impact their communities. Nonprofits are constantly battling converging challenges of limited resources and high cost of capital. By offering a solution that lowers these costs, the Foundation provides nonprofits with a path to redirect millions of dollars toward objectives affecting missional impact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:10:33.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
