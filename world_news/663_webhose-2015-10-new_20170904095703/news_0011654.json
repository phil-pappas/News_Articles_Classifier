I came up with this idea so that you can match your TV to the decor of any room.\"\nHe created a prototype for the TV / MONITOR WRAP to change the appearance of a conventional flat-screen television or computer monitor. The accessory ensures that the TV or monitor matches the surrounding decor. This prevents the TV or monitor from standing out or being an eyesore. The unit helps tie the room together in a pleasing fashion. Furthermore, it features a stylish, decorative design.\nThe original design was submitted to the Pittsburgh office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
