The attorneys general are likely to seek compensation for consumers and redress for environmental harm, building their own investigations under state laws that protect consumers from deceptive trade practices and set clean air standards.\n“This is a really important case and it has big economic and health consequences. It’s nowhere near the scale of tobacco but you are kind of in that realm,” said former Wisconsin governor and attorney general Jim Doyle , who participated in the multistate investigation that ended with a landmark settlement against tobacco companies in 1998. “This is the kind of case that you elect an A.G. for, to stand up for the safety and health of the people of the state.”\nVolkswagen is “looking at an enormous settlement, just enormous, when you think about how many cars are out there,” he said.\nThe case, in some respects, presents a slam dunk: Volkswagen has already admitted wrongdoing, affecting roughly a half million cars in the United States.\nThe company also suspended its top quality-control executive a person close to the company said Tuesday. Frank Tuch , 48, is the fifth high-ranking executive to be suspended in connection with the emissions test scandal.\nThough the violations appear clear, the multistate investigation is not likely to conclude quickly. For comparison, a multistate attorneys general investigation of ignition switch defects involving GM cars — a review that started shortly after GM announced a recall 20 months ago — remains active today.\nLikewise, the VW case in the states promises to unfold at a measured pace. Volkswagen may want to deal first with any criminal charges, as the Justice Department investigates potential illegality by the company and its executives. The Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Trade Commission are also investigating.\n“Until the criminal case clears, nobody is going to talk about civil. Volkswagen will not settle until the criminal investigations are resolved,” said James Tierney , program director of the national state attorneys general program at Columbia Law School, and a former Maine attorney general.\nSeveral states have assumed leadership roles. They are New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and Tennessee, where VW operates a U.S. manufacturing plant. California and Texas are leading their own inquiries for now.\nTexas became the first state to go to court this month, filing lawsuits alleging Volkswagen violated consumer protection laws and clean air standards. The petitions seek restitution for owners of 32,000 VW and Audi diesel models registered in the state and civil penalties, including $20,000 for each violation of the state’s Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\nBy the time the various inquiries are finished, Volkswagen is likely to enter a uniform settlement with all the states, Tierney said.\nVolkswagen said it could not discuss specific litigation. But, spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan added, “We are cooperating with all investigations into the matter.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:08:13.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
