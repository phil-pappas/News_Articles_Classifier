UNI Version 2.28.22.0 adds enhanced functionality including compliance to the just released American Heart Association's 2015 Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC) . Gaumard provides a wide range of tetherless simulators that allow for full mobility during CPR and ECC training scenarios. \nJohn Eggert , Executive Vice President of Gaumard, stated, \"The updated guidelines are evidence based and geared toward appropriate training for care providers. As such, we are encouraged by the recommendations to use high-fidelity simulators when possible in CPR and ECC training and for the use of capnography, a tool used in CPR monitoring. We've designed both our high-fidelity tetherless simulators and our skill trainers to be exceptional CPR and ECC training aides. Our UNI operating system for our tetherless simulators now includes quantitative waveform capnography to best monitor CPR.\" \nFirst launched in 2009, UNI® supports the entire family of Gaumard's wireless and tetherless high-fidelity simulators and is installed on tablets that communicate wirelessly with Gaumard simulators. The fully wireless simulation system provides Care in Motion ™ allowing training scenarios to take place anywhere: a patient care location, hallway, ambulance or even outside of a medical center. UNI further adds to the realism offered by Gaumard simulators by providing real-time direct control of the patient simulator's speech and clinical response. \nLearn more about UNI and download our latest update here: http://www.gaumard.com/links \nLearn more about the 2015 CPR and ECC Guidelines of the American Heart Association here: http://2015eccguidelines.heart.org/ \nGaumard® Scientific Company has designed, manufactured and marketed simulators for health care education for more than 60 years.
