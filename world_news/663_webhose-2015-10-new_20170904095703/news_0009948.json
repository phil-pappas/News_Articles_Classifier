Huawei will work closely with Britain in the development of technology applications in the telecommunications segment.\nHuawei is keen on using graphene in the ICT sector. More details are likely to be announced during the visit of China's President Xi Jinping to Britain. The telecommunications equipment manufacturer from the world's second largest economy is investing millions of pounds in the research project.\nThe University of Manchester's National Graphene Institute will lead the research project. In addition, several partnerships are scheduled for signing up during President Jinping's five-day tour to the United Kingdom.\nRyan Ding , Executive Director and President (Products and solutions) of Huawei, said in a statement that the \"aim is to help developers create innovative services and rapidly respond to customers' business needs.\" Of late, Huawei is on the expansion spree as it's spreading its presence in Australia, India and the United States markets.\nThe latest investment plan of China in ICT sector will also ease the pressure on the government as it's been facing criticism over ailing steel industry. Thousands of jobs have been cut in the UK steel industry and China has been impacted negatively. Industry observers expect this issue may also be resolved during President Jinping's visit.\nHuawei is focusing on developing industrial applications using Graphene in a more commercial way. It's estimated that graphene is 200 times stronger than steel. Huawei sees good potential in using fuel cells, aeroplane wings, water purification technology and significantly durable mobile phones.\nHuawei is fast emerging Chinese mobile maker and giving tough competition in the global market. Its investment plan will bring China and the UK closer in graphene research and development project.\nThe massive inflow of cheap steel from China is the one of the major factors that weakened the competitiveness of UK's steel industry. Coming to graphene, the University of Manchester has helped many independent companies exploiting it in a commercial way. Graphene is a single atom thick discovered by The University of Manchester.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/19/us-huawei-tech-investment-idUSKCN0SD09X20151019", "http://cdn.springboardplatform.com/storage/js/ingage/apingage.min.js", "http://mgid.com/advertisers/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=add", "http://mgid.com/", "http://news.sky.com/story/1571725/chinese-giant-huawei-backs-wonder-material", "http://english.cri.cn/12394/2015/10/19/4081s900126.htm"], "published": "2015-10-20T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:54:04.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
