Photo: Supplied\nThere are those who love music and those for whom it is merely something pleasant in the background. I suspect General Ulysses S Grant was one of the latter group. He is Quote: d as having said that; \"I know only two tunes: one of them is 'Yankee Doodle' and the other isn't.\"\nThere are lots of General Grants in the world. They're perfectly content with a little all-in-one stereo of modest power and cost and does all the stuff they need with CDs, radio, USBs, Bluetooth and near-field communication. They don't fret about the stereo's ability to handle challenging transients seamlessly and figure cross-talk is something that happens over a dinner table. And good luck to them; at the end of the day they have lots more money left over for Mars bars than poor sods like me who are always striving for that unachievable one per cent extra.\nFor all the General Grants I have good news. Recently I spotted Sony's CMTSBT300WB micro system at one of the big electrical retailers and it's neat. It has taken the aesthetics that are currently de rigueur among more expensive amplifiers to offer clean, uncluttered lines and intuitive controls, complemented by a couple of speakers that look just as good.\nIn other words, it looks far more expensive than it is, and proper audiophiles will take it rather more seriously than your average mini system. So you can invite your discerning friends over and not have them snicker and point. Sony's website lists it at $499 but this retailer had it at $494 the day I was there. I'm sure he would have gone down a bit on that if asked nicely.\nAdvertisement For that price it's loaded. Airplay, Bluetooth, near-field communication and a digital radio tuner in addition to FM, with a single disc CD/DVD player. There are bass and treble controls and bass boost, and MP3 and a USB. WMA and AAC files can be played back through home-recorded CDRs or CDRWs. The USB is on the front fascia right where it should be and there's a headphone plug there too.\nThe speakers are two-ways with a 2.5 cm soft-dome tweeter and a 12 cm mid/bass driver below it, and they sound good for the money. Definition is fine and with accurate and clear highs extending smoothly through the midrange, and there's good voicing throughout. It can get a little muddy down in the low end and when bass boost is on it threatens to overpower everything else. It's for dancing, not listening.\nThere was a Panasonic SCPMX70 next door. It didn't look as good but it was great value, the recommended price of $499 knocked down here to $439. It also has separate bass and treble controls (and they do make a difference), and USB and headphone plugs up front, near field communication and Bluetooth as well as CD, but no DVD.\nThe speakers are three-ways with a 14 cm mid/bass and two tweeters, one of 1.9cm and a 1.5cm, and there's a digital radio tuner as well as FM.\nI like the sound of this one too, and I'm particularly impressed by the wide soundstage which I suspect comes as a result of having the smaller tweeters in addition to the regular tweeters.\nThe other one I liked was Onkyo's CS265, standing out from all the others because it's all white (another four colours are listed on the website but locally the choice is black or white). It was ticketed at $349 and while it missed a digital radio tuner, having only FM, it sounded terrific for the money.\nThere's CD (no DVD), Bluetooth, near field communication and USB and the speakers are two-ways with a 10cm mid/bass and a two-cm tweeter. There are bass and treble controls and the USB and headphone plugs are at the front.\nAll these three sound good and the interesting thing is that, to my ears at least, they sound better than all the systems that were surrounding them, which ranged from $359 to $999. But then I have my ears and yours are different, and so is your taste in music. The best idea is to take your own music along.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:03:10.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
