Hall was removed from Forbes.com. Silicon Valley’s diversity volcano erupted again this week, but Forbes attempted to quash the discussion by deleting an opinion piece that contended there is no problem in the tech workforce.\nThe piece, which was then published on Medium by author Brian S. Hall , makes an argument that has existed in the tech business for decades: The smartest and hardest working in tech will succeed regardless of race or gender in Silicon Valley, which he called “probably the most open, welcoming, meritocratic-based region on the planet.”\nHall said he was notified by a reader that the piece was taken down. Forbes did not respond to multiple attempts to obtain comment about why Hall’s post violated its terms of service, as the site claims.\n“Considering the wide range of pieces in Forbes, including the various opinion pieces across the site, I was absolutely surprised by their decision,” Hall said in an email interview. “I do not know the specific reasons for the removal, though suspect that it’s controversial stance was unwelcome.\n“I can sympathize,” he added. “Since its publication, I have received thousands of angry, harassing messages.”\nHall faced scorn on Twitter after the post originally published on Forbes, including by journalists who felt he was downplaying a serious issue and not supporting his argument with sufficient data.\nBecause we have jobs of our own and don't have time to show you how to do yours. https://t.co/0OYLFPoYtx\n— Arik Hesseldahl (@ahess247) October 7, 2015 @brianshall @ahess247 @maciejbacal I have no desire to silence you. I'd like to read a better-crafted opinion from you on this\n— Jon Fortt (@jonfortt) October 7, 2015 Hall, a freelancer who has written for Forbes, MacWorld, ReadWrite and other publications, wrote in his piece, “The success of Silicon Valley is not due to diversity — or to any bias. Rather, to brilliance, hard work, risk taking, big ideas and money.”\nHis advice to readers who want to be successful in the valley is to follow the example of others who preceded them.\n“They took math and science classes, and did their homework every night. They practiced ACT tests over and over. They enrolled in good schools and focused on English, Political Science and Humanities. Okay, that last bit is not true. They took computer programming, engineering, chemistry — hard subjects that demand hard work.”\nHall’s approach is at the crux of arguments that have gone on for years against affirmative action hiring, based on fear that hiring quotas become more important than finding the right person for the job. But he fails to address the fact that diversity data continues to be issued from Silicon Valley company after Silicon Valley company that shows the biggest tech companies, those with the biggest piles of cash and biggest market caps, are still mostly white- and male-dominated.\nInstead, Hall wrote that “anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that disproportionately more Chinese, Indians, and LGBQT succeed in Silicon Valley than just about any place in America.”\n“I did not include the self-reporting demographic data released by tech companies because even if their data is fully correct, which I doubt, it merely echoes my larger point that tech companies are doing amazingly well as they are,” Hall said in an email interview. “They are not experiencing any crisis, certainly not a ‘diversity crisis.’”\nWhat Hall wrote is factually accurate at its core — a good programmer of any ethnicity or gender can succeed in Silicon Valley. But he ignores the sexism and discrimination that women and minorities can face once they are working in tech, which lead some to leave the industry. While Ellen Pao lost her discrimination case against her former employer, venture capital stalwart Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the trial showed that the valley is still a boy’s club , and often a white boy’s club.\nExecutive leadership and boards are still more tilted toward white males, showing a glass ceiling for many minorities and women. In his piece, Hall does not address the glaring disparity in data for executive leadership, which tend to show a greater percentage of white males the higher up the corporate ladder one looks.\n“The boardroom and exec teams of companies in Silicon Valley ought to contain the best, the brightest, the most successful,” Hall said in our interview. “Tim Cook was not made CEO of Apple AAPL, -1.16% because he is gay. Marissa Mayer was not named CEO of Yahoo YHOO, +1.57% because she is a woman. Sundar Pichai is not running Google GOOG, -0.50% GOOGL, -0.45% because he is Indian, but because he is amazingly capable. They all earned these jobs.”\nCiting anecdotal evidence to enter the debate on a problem that some big companies such as Intel Corp. INTC, +0.63% are now spending big money on to try and solve seems wrongheaded. Intel and other companies realize problems including that there are children and young adults who lack access to the type of tech-focused education that Hall champions, and they are doing something about it.\nWhen asked about the fact that many big companies are focused on hiring a more diverse workforce, Hall said he believes “this is little more than a public relations initiative, but if it improves the company’s earnings or helps people, that’s great.”\nBut he added that “Quotas kill innovation, and Silicon Valley runs on innovation.”\nWhether you agree with Hall or not, we need to have a civil and nuanced discussion on all sides of this important issue. Forbes may have been pressured to do the politically correct thing by taking down Hall’s article, but that move seems like censorship seeking to rob us of an opportunity to talk about a stance shared by more than just the post’s author.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://t.co/0OYLFPoYtx", "https://twitter.com/maciejbacal", "https://twitter.com/ahess247/status/651809498500308993", "https://medium.com/@brianshall/the-article-on-diversity-in-tech-that-forbes-took-down-15cfd28d5639", "https://twitter.com/brianshall", "https://twitter.com/jonfortt/status/651802601525133312", "https://twitter.com/ahess247", "http://graphics.wsj.com/diversity-in-tech-companies/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:00:56.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
