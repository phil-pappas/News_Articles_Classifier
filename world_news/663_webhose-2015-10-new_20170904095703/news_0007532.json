The company has launched a new website at http://www.photoscribetech.com/ , to facilitate ease in navigation through laser solutions and product development offerings, while making it easy for businesses of all kinds to learn about how laser technology can be applied to them.\nThe newly updated PhotoScribe Technologies website has an aesthetically pleasing layout, with a seamless navigation experience at the forefront. It’s seven-option home page breaks down information about PhotoScribe into: general info about the company, products and services , service search by industry, service search by application, consulting, news and a contact page.\nPhotoScribe Technologies CEO, David Benderly, says, regarding the new site launch “Over the years, our customers have called PhotoScribe their ‘best kept secret’, but in creating a new website, we wanted to have something that would speak to those who weren’t familiar with our work. Designed as a conversation opener, the new PhotoScribe website is an overview of the kinds of industries we serve. The bulk of our business is founded in developing custom solutions and applications. We hope a sampling of our offerings are perceivable to new visitors when browsing for a partner in innovation.”\nThe new website offers several unique pages, designed for ease of search by professionals with laser knowledge, as well as those new to learning about lasers who are looking to explore. One of the most innovative pages is the “Browse by Wavelength” page under the Products & Services tab, which allows visitors to hover along the electromagnetic spectrum, from infra-red through ultraviolet, exploring products that fall within a given nanometer range. Particular wavelengths display a pop-up list of compatible laser technologies, enabling one to click through and choose the perfect laser. In addition to a wavelength browser, PhotoScribe’s website has a page devoted entirely to short pulse duration lasers, the ultra-fast preferred choice for micro and nano-scale fabrication. The short pulse duration lasers are used on materials that are extremely difficult to make, such as diamond, glass, and polymers. In addition, the Products & Service tab section has sub-pages relating to PhotoScribe’s microscopy services, machine vision systems, and direct part marking.\nTo better serve clients who are new to laser technology, PhotoScribe has employed an Industry page, which serves as an easy search for how learning about how the company’s technology can be employed. The list of industries covered includes: glass, pharmaceutical, electronics, automotive, jewelry, packaging, plastics, aerospace, security and medical. By scrolling and clicking on an industry in the banner, or alternatively on the left, solutions by industry appear, alongside suggested products to execute them. Similarly designed, the Applications page is meant to assist someone new to the technology in finding a product that assists with a particular application. Laser use on pills & gelcaps, glass, metals, catheters, cardboard & paper, microfluidics, optics, gemstones, rubber gaskets and watermarks are some examples of application features. Because of PhotoScribe’s pioneering of diamond inscription technology, both the jewelry and gemstones pages feature sub-pages explaining inscription, hot vs. cold laser systems, marking, engraving quality and system design, for those looking to explore their gem inscription services.\nThe Consulting page has a bulleted list on how PhotoScribe Technologies can assist in solving challenges a company may face, highlighting a variety of the their services, such as microanalysis, photogenic energy, or micro fabrication, amongst others. In addition, the News page is updated with republished online and print articles regarding PhotoScribe Technologies’ new products and innovation.\nOut with the old and in with the new, the PhotoScribe Technologies website offers endless information on lasers, furthering the company’s stance as the international resource for custom laser development.\nAbout PhotoScribe Technologies:\nFounded in 1998, PhotoScribe Technologies is headquartered in New York, NY.
