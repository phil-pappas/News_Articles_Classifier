This trend has been particularly acute in the Gulf, where operators profited hugely from the large expatriate population contacting home.\n \"You either join the OTTs or you fight them, so we embraced them fully,\" said Kukhun.\nHe said such an approach would make money for his company by attracting more subscribers and ultimately getting its customers to use more of its services, raising average user revenues.\nAfter seeing its earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fall by about two-thirds from 2011-2014, Ooredoo Kuwait's first half EBITDA rose 13 percent year-on-year to 21 million Kuwaiti dinars ($69.6 million) as its customer base grew by nearly a tenth.\nOne benefit of being late to introduce 4G is that its technology is newer than its rivals, said Kukhun.\n\"We're able to demonstrate a clear difference in the data network which is one of the major demands of customers,\" said Kukhun. \"Typically they evaluate your data offers and connectivity before they look at call packages. People spend more time using data than making calls.\"\nThe company also has operations in Algeria, Tunisia, the Maldives and Palestinian Territories.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:09:08.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
