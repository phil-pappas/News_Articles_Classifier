His books have been translated into 28 languages and he won two French prizes for thriller and mystery literature and one in Germany.\n\"Things have improved, but there are a lot of things that have not changed,\" he said on Thursday in an interview with BDLive. \"I was just walking in (Rosebank Mall, Johannesburg) and the shops are stocked to the rafters. We have free media and free enterprise and an economy that’s OK. It’s not great, but it’s functional, and that is one thing that has not changed. Ordinary people live ordinary lives here and there is goodwill between people who work together because they don’t have the choice of politicising everything. I think that safeguards us against politics. What we are most afraid of is some sort of civil uprising, but there is still goodwill among ordinary people.\"\nDetails\nTITLE: Icarus AUTHOR: Deon meyer PUBLISHER: Hodder and Stoughton\nIcarus is Meyer’s sixth thriller in which detective Benny Griessel appears; and the fifth in which he is the protagonist. This time Griessel, an alcoholic who has managed 602 dry days, falls horribly off the wagon after encountering a tragedy involving a friend.\n\"Griessel is always struggling,\" says Meyer. \"In Devil’s Peak, he was struggling, but at the end of Cobra (the penultimate Griessel novel), he was shot up very badly and his commanding officer was killed. He’s very vulnerable in Icarus. It’s his time to fall off the wagon.\"\nAlthough Icarus’s setting, the glorious Cape Winelands, is not the reason for Griessel’s succumbing to booze — after all, he views wine as a waste of alcoholic effort — the juxtaposition of these in this round’s murder doesn’t make life easier for him.\nGriessel and detective-buddy Vaughn Cupido are sent to investigate the murder of notorious internet entrepreneur Ernst Richter, whose body is found in sand dunes near Blouberg.\nIn Icarus, Meyer has juxtaposed the tragic story of a Stellenbosch wine farm with one of the Western Cape town’s other major industries — technology. \"I needed two industries that were rubbing up against each other,\" says Meyer, who moved to Stellenbosch from Durbanville a few years ago.\n\"There are real stories of wine farms in the Cape that are incredibly sad,\" he says, adding that the mystery genre is his favourite because \"it encapsulates everything a good story might be\".\n\"There is good and evil and justice at the end. I think that crime fiction tells the kind of stories people like to read. Real-world crime is tragic. Look at crime anywhere — 85% of it happens in disadvantaged communities and is domestic in nature; often it is drugs- or alcohol-related. Crime fiction is not about crime; it’s stories about people.\"\nIn Icarus — as in many examples of crime fiction — a pivotal character is a psychopath. \"I wanted to explore what happens if you have a psychopath who has great sporting talent… They are just born that way — is that evil, or a brain defect? How can a brain defect be evil? Evil is fascinating to deal with in literature; in life it’s more complicated.\"\nExploring evil almost comes with the territory of writing about crime, but Meyer says he is \"not even sure there is something like evil\".\n\"I just think we do things that have terrible, terrible consequences. I don’t think people are inherently good or bad, I think humans are just very smart animals and animals are not good or bad. We are just inherently human.\"\nThat said, psychopaths — at least some of them — are for many the personification of evil because their lack of conscience and empathy allows them to do \"horrendous, horrific stuff\".\n\"It’s a fascinating thing. It’s established by science that there is very little treatment. There is a US penitentiary where they are using certain behaviouristic treatments … but their brains just work differently…. The problem with psychopaths and sociopaths is that some of them live life without doing major harm, so summarily removing them from society is problematic,\" he says.\nMeyer is halfway through his next novel and has been writing fulltime for \"about six or seven years\" after having to give up his day job when book touring became encompassing. \"The one thing my job always did was expose me to other people and their stories. You need that to be able to write intelligently…. I (now) need to make sure I have a social life and do stuff outside of my writing environment.\"\nIcarus streaks like lightning to a feisty climax and is full of twists and turns. It is one of Meyer’s strongest novels yet.\nMeanwhile, an international cast and crew has assembled in Cape Town to start production of a television series based on Meyer’s Dead Before Dying, produced by Germany’s All-In-Productions.\nNorwegian actor Trond Espen Seim is set to play protagonist Mat Joubert — another of Meyer’s dissolute policemen — and Resident Evil star Boris Kodjoe will play Joubert’s nemesis Sanct Snook. The series will be directed by Hungarian-born Peter Ladkani.\nSouth African actors include Arnold Vosloo, Colin Moss, David Butler, Johnny Pienaar, Bart Fouche, Andre Jacobs, Alex McGregor, Danny Keogh, AJ van der Merwe, Deon Lotz, Treasure Tshabalala, Susan Danford, Kim Syster, Michelle Scott, Marion Holm, Brendon Daniels, Crystal Donna Roberts and Graham Clarke.\n\"I am deeply honoured, and very excited,\" says Meyer in a statement on his website.\n© BDlive 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:14:25.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
