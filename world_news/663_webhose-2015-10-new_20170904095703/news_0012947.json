VACAVA Inc., an expert in processing reengineering is announcing a poster presentation highlighting 'Clinical laboratory centralized licensure and accreditation management â€“ How to increase efficiency and quality' led by Hether Seifert BS, MSM, CCRP of the Mayo Clinic at the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) annual meeting October 28-30, 2015 in Long Beach, CA. The poster presentation explains the challenges of laboratory certification and accreditation management and a more effective process. Developed by Hether Seifert , the hypothesis states that centralized laboratory licensure and accreditation can be managed more effectively and efficiently with centralized online records, changing the manner by which laboratories manage data collection, approvals and submissions.\nIn collaboration with VACAVA, a new lab certification management software application was developed to simplify data collection, management and access. This cloud-based implementation enables remote data entry in a real-time sharing environment with features such as certification renewal notifications, compliance reports and profile management. It also has the ability to archive certificates and prepopulate certification and accreditation forms.\nThis lab certification software application is now available to healthcare organizations of all sizes.
