While passwords are still the primary form of authentication used in organizations around the world, weak or stolen user credentials remain the primary point of entry for cyber criminals. Passwords are susceptible to phishing, reverse engineering and brute force attacks, but due to legacy security frameworks, many organizations are locked into a password-dominated authentication process.\nToday, Identity Automation announced advancements to its RapidIdentity full-lifecycle identity and access management solution that frees organizations from their password dependence and introduces a new level of security.\nAs part of today’s announcement, Identity Automation also introduced its vision of authentication, a future where passwords are no longer forced on users, and instead they are authenticated in whatever way makes sense based on factors that apply to the specific individuals, including, but not limited to, user role, risk rating, location, time of day access or day of week access.\nMulti-Factor Authentication Is a Security Best Practice\nDevices can be stolen. Passwords can be cracked. Challenge responses can be guessed using social media. Even biometric data can be obtained from physical contact or can be digitally copied. With all the sophisticated risks facing organizations today, one authentication method alone is simply not enough; multiple factors of authentication are needed.\nIdentity Automation’s vision for the future of authentication is based on strong, multi-factor authentication to prevent fraudulent identity attacks and illicit actions. Multi-factor authentication is a counter-measure that adds an extra layer of protection to identity and access management by requiring users to supply multiple forms of self identification. The core self identification factors are:\nKnowledge - something you know\nPossession - something you have\nInherence - something you are\nNew Authentication Methods\nTo personalize and customize the authentication process, Identity Automation is unveiling an expanded suite of authentication methods available to customers using RapidIdentity 3.5, which now includes:\nChallenge-Response\nSMS One-time Password\nKerberos Method\n3rd Party Social Media Methods\nFingerprint Scan\nFacial Recognition\nGeolocation\nBluetooth Proximity\nThese new methods will allow organizations to determine the best and most appropriate authentication policies for their unique employees and environments instead of forcing passwords onto all users.\nA Policy-Driven Approach and Modular, Plug-and-Play Architecture\nRapidIdentity 3.5 now features the industry’s first policy-driven authentication. This allows organizations to easily personalize authentication methods based on user, location or system simply through the creation of policies which are attached to each scenario.\nAdditionally, RapidIdentity 3.5 is now built using a modular, plug-and-play architecture, enabling the rapid addition of new authentication methods without affecting policies already in place. Many organizations have authentication methods so deeply ingrained in their system that they cannot quickly add new methods. RapidIdentity 3.5’s modular architecture makes adding new methods a fast and seamless process.\nSupporting Quote: s\n“Cyber criminals are becoming more sophisticated and aggressive by the day. Multi-factor authentication is needed in every organization and must be seen as a best practice throughout the industry. We must move beyond passwords to make our systems as secure as possible.”\n--James Litton, CEO and Founder, Identity Automation\nAbout Identity Automation\nIdentity Automation is a leading provider of Identity and Access Management software.
