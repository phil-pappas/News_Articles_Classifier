I don't know for certain, which is why we are taking the precaution of reaching out to everyone,\" Harding told the BBC. \nTHIRD BREACH THIS YEAR \nThe attack is the third data breach to hit TalkTalk this year, and experts said it would damage the reputation of the company, which competes with bigger rivals BT, Virgin Media and Sky in the broadband market. \n\"Their brand will be damaged and their customers will say it is the final straw,\" said computer security expert Graham Cluley. \nShares in TalkTalk, which had fallen 7 percent since the group's websites went down on Wednesday, fell as much as 8.5 percent on Friday to a two-year low of 238 pence. \nSome customers took to Twitter to vent their anger. \n\"I see #talktalk has been hacked again, seriously need to go to another provider, especially as I find out via BBC and not TalkTalk,\" said Cardiff-based user Lan. \nMonrad said hackers seeking to exploit the value of stolen customer data often publish small samples of stolen data in order to attract buyers in the underworld who will in turn try and exploit customer details for financial gain. \n\"Our field intelligence operation has found what appears to be a direct dump of various database information from TalkTalk,\" he told Reuters in an interview. \nHe said the samples FireEye has collected contain specific bank account and credit card information from what appears to be TalkTalk customers. \nA TalkTalk spokesman said the company was trying to determine whether key customer financial details and passwords were protected by encryption in the company's databases. \n\"We are still investigating the extent of information accessed and exactly what customer data may have been compromised,\" the spokesman said. \nThe Metropolitan Police said its cyber crime unit was investigating an alleged data theft from a telecommunications website, without giving details. \nPersonal data including names, addresses and phone numbers were stolen from TalkTalk at the start of the year, and in August servers owned by Carphone Warehouse, the retailer which founded TalkTalk, were attacked, potentially affecting 480,000 TalkTalk mobile customers.
