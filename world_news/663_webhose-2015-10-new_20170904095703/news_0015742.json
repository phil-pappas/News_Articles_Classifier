It is unclear whether the two companies are considering a full-blown merger or whether they are planning to combine parts of their business operations. More Adobe shares drop on profits warning \nEMC was worth about $50bn at the close of trading on Wednesday. A large part of its value is based on an 80 per cent stake, worth some $27bn, in virtualisation software company VMware. \nA deal would mark the most significant realignment yet in the IT sector, as traditional hardware companies reposition themselves for the cloud era. It would also cement Dell’s transition from PC maker to a full-blown IT company, adding storage equipment to expanding business in servers and IT services. \nEMC came under shareholder pressure last year after activist investor Elliott Management took a stake and pushed the company to break itself up. However, two people who have closely followed EMC’s fortunes questioned how easy it would be to structure a deal that would appease its shareholders while also being digestible by Dell, which went private two years ago. \nEMC shares jumped in after-hours trading after the Wall Street Journal first reported the talks of a possible combination between the two companies. They were up about 9 per cent at more than $28, putting them back above the price Elliott paid for its stake. \nEMC has been studying a range of options since early this year, when it made a standstill agreement with Elliott. The agreement ran out last month, and the company has been working to come up with a transaction that would resolve its shareholders’ concerns, said a person familiar with its efforts. \nA full takeover of EMC would amount to one of the biggest tech deals ever undertaken. However, even with the after-market bounce on Wednesday the shares are still below the level at which they started this year, making it less likely that Elliott and other EMC shareholders would back a deal that did not promise a greater return. \nAs a private company, a big acquisition could prove a challenge for Dell, which is backed by private equity firm Silver Lake. Founder Michael Dell has made it clear since he took Dell private that he does not think a public listing is suitable for a company in the midst of a significant business transition. \nEMC was in talks with Hewlett-Packard last year about a possible deal. However, HP — which had been seen as the most obvious acquirer of EMC’s storage business other than Dell — is effectively out of the running given its own break-up, which is due to take effect before the end of this year. As a tax-free transaction, the deal would prevent HP Enterprise, as the IT company resulting from the spin-off will be known, from returning immediately to the market to pursue another large transaction, said a person familiar with its position.
