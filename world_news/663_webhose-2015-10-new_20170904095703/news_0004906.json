Agiliance disclosed year-over-year quarterly sales growth of 70 percent, with current license bookings increasing 216 percent and deferred license bookings increasing 90 percent. In each of the last four quarters, Agiliance business has skyrocketed with year-over-year quarterly growth rates of 77 percent, 69 percent, 51 percent, and 70 percent. Software license business grew faster at over 150 percent each quarter, as Agiliance continues to onboard regional and global partners, who benefit from services dollars to deliver RiskVision® use cases for Operational and Security Risk. \nCustomers investing in RiskVision during Q3 2015 were from sectors like the U.S. Federal government, energy, financial services, healthcare, media, retail, and technology services. They included the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, U.S. Government Printing Office, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratories, First Energy, Deutsche Bank, First American Financial, Fiserv, Freddie Mac, Sheetz, Inc., Bell Canada, and HCL Technologies. Many new Global 1000 customers were added to Agiliance’s prestigious client base. \nAccording to various industry sources, the 2015 market for Operational and Security Risk tools is growing at a healthy 10 – 15 percent rate. Agiliance’s growth far exceeds this rate for various reasons: Boards and C-suites require time-to-value: RiskVision data-driven use cases are in enterprise production within 60 - 90 days, in the cloud or on premise. Regulatory regimes require easy adaption: RiskVision analytics, content, reporting, scoring, workflow, and upgrades are configurable and flexible without programming. Risk management runs on big data: RiskVision manages over 1.5 million assets and 10,000 users in a single instance, to orchestrate accurate dashboards, KPIs, and KRIs in real-time. For example, since 2013 the VA used RiskVision for FISMA Accreditation & Authorization and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM), and now manages over 1.5 million assets used by 5,000 VA employees. Risk automation projects are budgeted continuously: Agiliance received its 40 th RFI / RFP year-to-date in Q3 2015 that require one or more of its solutions. Cloud security is trusted: RiskVision’s licensing is now majority-delivered via subscriptions. \n“We are pleased to be growing five to seven times faster than our peers, with our strategy and execution to deliver flexible, speedy, and highly scaled solutions to our customers,” said Joe Fantuzzi, president and chief executive officer at Agiliance. “We continue to differentiate in the industry with high success rates and satisfaction ratings, at one-third to one-half the total cost of ownership of comparable offerings. We invite all organizations who require risk management automation to test RiskVision in a proof of concept against any other vendor, who claims they can deliver our standard of care.” \nAbout Agiliance \nAgiliance, the Big Data Risk Company, is the leading independent provider of integrated solutions for Operational and Security Risk Intelligence.
