Why not?\"\nMutations in ALDH1a1 may effect the action of GABA and \"predispose some people to alcoholism by disabling this brake on our reward machinery\", a Stanford spokesman added.\nPoll loading …\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/jasperhamill", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:20:50.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
