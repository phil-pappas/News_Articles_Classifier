This, in turn, gives an estimated location so that services such as ambulance, firefighters, or police can be sent as quickly as possible.\nAdvertisement However, unlike other international systems, the technology does not provide a precise address, so unless the caller can tell ESTA exactly where they are, it can take valuable time to pinpoint a location during an emergency, when every second counts.\nInsiders admit the matter is particularly concerning in the context of new figures showing that demand for ESTA's services continues to grow. According to the agency's latest annual report, ESTA answered 2.4 million calls last year, with almost 60 per cent coming from mobile phones.\nThe agency said it was imperative the federal communications department and Australia's mobile carriers worked together to improve the technology, known in the industry as Push MOLI (Mobile Origin Location Information).\n\"It's a federal challenge, and also the carriers have to invest money to progress MOLI to the point where we can pinpoint locate a caller,\" Ms Weiss said.\nESTA's annual report was one of dozens quietly tabled in Victorian Parliament in recent weeks. Other reports also revealed:\nA doubling of prisoner complaints to Victoria's health services commissioner. About 33,209 Victorians lodged Freedom of Information requests over the past year – the lowest number since 2009. The remuneration rate for government ministers currently ranges between $130,000 to $199,999, according to figures cited by the department of premier and cabinet. According to ESTA's annual report, Triple Zero emergency calls have increased by 3 per cent since 2013-14. Asked what action it would take to improve ESTA's mobile location technology, a federal department of communications spokesman said a review had already taken place, which examined, among other things, \"how the Triple Zero service can take advantage of new technologies and respond to changing community expectations\".\n\"While the Triple Zero service is working well, the current arrangements for the national Triple Zero operator were established when voice calls from landlines dominated the telecommunications landscape. Technology and the way people communicate have changed significantly, offering opportunities to improve the existing voice arrangements, as well as potentially new ways for people to access assistance,\" the spokesman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:06:47.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
