We have a capacity for hope that’s unmatched by other nations. Sometimes though, it is necessary to step back and view our predicament in order to realise that most of the things we hope for probably won’t happen in our lifetime.\nI say “probably” as with anything, all the entries (listed in no specific order) are open to falsification, or still, we might see the things we hope for materialise and most likely when we expect it. Heck, just ask the last guy who won the National Lottery. With this in mind I present to you the top 100 things South African’s Probably won’t see in their lifetime:\n1. The Proteas winning the ICC Cricket World Cup.\n2. A white ANC leader/black VF leader.\n3. An end to load shedding.\n4. A new AND funny Leon Schuster movie.\n5. Victor Matfield retiring from rugby.\n6. John Robbie having nothing to add/comment/say about a topic.\n7. The abolishment of mini-bus taxis.\n8. The end of “Noot vir Noot”.\n9. The Rand being as strong/stronger than the US Dollar.\n10. Oscar Pistorius owning up to what he did.\n11. An end to comparing present day South Africa to apartheid South Africa.\n12.

The renaming of Table Mountain (let’s hope).\n26. Braais without beer and boerewors.\n27. The police arriving at your house faster than pizza does.\n28. Soccer mom’s parking their massive SUVs wherever they want.\n29. An ANC member who can recite the freedom charter from memory.\n30. A steep reduction in ‘sin tax’ (it’s really hurting us all, the tax more than the cigarettes).\n31. Developers saying “Hey, I think we’ve built enough malls now”.\n32. Bokdrol spoeg becoming an olympic sport.\n33. The discontinuation of BEE (no matter how contradictory it becomes).\n34. Schalk Burger passing the ball.\n35. The legalisation of marijuana (sorry would-be-white-rastafarian-dreadlocked-capetonians).\n36. A Wimpy preparing your eggs exactly liked you asked for them.\n37. Our Zimbabwean counterparts oust Robert Mugabe, ala Egyptian-style, which means…\n38. Mugabe appearing in the Hague to atone for his crimes.\n39.

An end to the renaming of streets (there’s always some freedom fighter’s grandmother’s brother’s son-in-law’s dog we forgot to name one after).\n44. Actual life-sentences beng served for murder.\n45. Better gun control (to legally own a gun is an arduous and expensive process, meanwhile every would-be hijacker seems to get his hands on an AK-47 like its nothing).\n46.

Microsoft Word’s Spellchecker’s English (South Africa) , reflecting our vernacular accurately, because it isn’t lekker to type out your grans koeksister recipe if all Word wants to do is is correct you bru.\n75.

Super talented Pieter Toerien bringing some of the great old and local plays to a theater near you, e.g. Boesman and Lena.\n77. A Carte Blanche episode which is watchable beginning to end.\n78.

South Africa’s status quo , demanding the the “Cullinan Diamond” be returned.\n80. A home brewed movie which gains international acclaim but doesn’t portray South Africa as a squalid pile of [sic] ( Tsotsi 2005) or a dystopian pile of [sic] ( District 9 2009).\n81. All CBD’s (not just Cape Town’s) becoming more than crime addled hell holes.\n82. The closing of all Spur restaurants (we are a nation of ’Spur people’ after all.\n83. Barry (“Cousin”) Hilton doing a standup show which isn’t drier than his jokes on the Savannah ads.\n84. A Bafana Bafana coach who actually achieves something or doesn’t quit within a year after landing the job.\n85.

The actual realisation of the Rainbow Nation as envisioned by Madiba.\n94. Lego, which is just Lego (i.e. doesn’t move, require batteries, comes preassembled).\n95. The upgrade of any major highway ever again (after Sanral’s e-toll woes I think it’s a case of once bitten, twice shy).\n96. Less rights for convicted criminals (they should be allowed to vote, that’s it).\n97. Die Stem being removed from the national anthem (don’t lie Mr. Malema we all know its your favourite part too).\n98.
