The announcement comes from TEAM at Oracle OpenWorld 2015 where they are participating in the event as presenters of two unique sessions in the WebCenter space . \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151026/280266 \nTEAM's DOCSConnect joins the power of Oracle WebCenter Content 11g (WCC) and the highly developed Oracle Public Cloud offering, Documents Cloud Service. This hybrid enterprise content model provides security, compliance, and data management features with the extensive collaborative capabilities of the cloud. DOCSConnect is the first connector that functions solely with WebCenter Content 11g and Oracle DOCS rather than utilizing a third party installation or interface. TEAM developed DOCSConnect in order to provide a deeply integrated, controlled, and auditable hybrid document system to ensure content could be accessible and editable at all times from any device. \nDOCSConnect is an enhancement component within Oracle WebCenter Content 11g. Not only does DOCSConnect provide improved access to enterprise content, it enables an unprecedented level of collaboration and maintains auditable version histories of files uploaded in both WCC and DOCS. DOCSConnect allows WebCenter Content 11g to serve as a Single Point of Truth (SPoT) for all enterprise content while leveraging the burgeoning power of Documents Cloud Service and Oracle's Public Cloud platform. \"Oracle's cloud products are game-changers for the traditional enterprise software model and our DOCSConnect product is a powerful way to bridge the gap between paradigms. The best of WebCenter merged with the next generation of enterprise capabilities, enables true collaboration for our customers,\" said Doug Thompson, CEO of TEAM. \nFor more information on DOCSConnect, watch their YouTube Video on the product, and visit www.teaminformatics.com/products/docsconnect . \nAbout Oracle Open World 2015 \nOracle OpenWorld is an annual Oracle event for business decision-makers, IT management, and line-of-business end users.
