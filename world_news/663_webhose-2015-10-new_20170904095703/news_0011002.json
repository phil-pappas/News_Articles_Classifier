Showcased in the October issue of CRN, the “100 People You Don’t Know But Should” list can be viewed at http://www.crn.com/100people . Karani's featured listing can be found online here .\nThe CRN editorial team, assessing feedback from solution providers and other industry executives, compiles this list to celebrate under-the-radar channel-management team members from the industry's top vendors and distributors. Those selected have worked tirelessly to create, promote and manage programs and policies that support and drive IT channel sales.\n“CRN recognizes that many unsung heroes deserve to be spotlighted for their behind-the-scenes efforts,” says Robert Faletra, CEO of The Channel Company. “This list honors those in the IT channel trenches, toiling each day to achieve success for their companies and partners.”\nKarani, who held director-level channel positions at a number of network security vendors before joining Quick Heal earlier this year, was hired to launch the India-based company's expansion into the North American market. Under his leadership, Quick Heal has established a fast-paced North American channel program anchored by Seqrite , a comprehensive cloud-enabled line of network security solutions directed at the small to medium enterprise market. In the past quarter alone, Karani has signed three new distribution agreements spanning Canada and the U.S., with more alliances in the works.\n\"Competition is fierce in the IT security space and there are many hurdles to building a successful channel program, which is why we're fortunate to have an executive of Farokh's caliber and expertise to lead our North American channel initiatives,\" said Kailash Katkar, CEO, Managing Director and Co-founder of Quick Heal Technologies. \"We congratulate him on his tireless dedication to our channel partners, and commend him on this outstanding recognition from CRN.\"\nAbout The Channel Company\nThe Channel Company, with established brands including CRN®, XChange® Events and IPED®, is the channel community’s trusted authority for growth and innovation.
