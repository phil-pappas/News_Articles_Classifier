CEO Kazuo Hirai told a technology conference on Tuesday that following the hack, the movie studio has \"come out more resilient, more strong and they have a very good management team in place now.\" Hirai said there wasn't much of a business impact from the hack, although he said employee morale was hurt for a short time.\nFormer Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal left her position after a trove of embarrassing emails was leaked, including racially insensitive remarks about President Barack Obama 's purported taste in movies . She continues to run a production venture at Sony that will handle major blockbuster franchises such as the \"Spider-Man\" series.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:40:12.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
