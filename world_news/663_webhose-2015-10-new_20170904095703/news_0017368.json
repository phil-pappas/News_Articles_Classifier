The full video is below, with some brief viewing tips after that.\nThe first 14 or 15 minutes, of the 25-minute total session, are about a previously underpublicized aspect of Al Gore’s post-vice presidential life. This constitutes the promised “news” of the session, and it’s what I explore at much greater length in a long article in the upcoming November issue of the magazine.\nThe short version of the news is: over the past decade, Gore and his colleagues have developed and applied an unusual approach to investing in global stock markets, with a heavy emphasis on environmental sustainability. Ten years into this approach, they have results to report, and those results make them, startlingly, among the very, very most profitable asset managers anywhere in the world. You name your cutthroat financial expert, and Gore’s team will probably have come up with better returns.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/466fbtEKWSA?rel=0"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:47:05.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
