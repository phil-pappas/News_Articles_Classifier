Could this be policing of the future? \nREMEMBER the Tom Cruise flick, Minority Report (and now a subsequent TV series), where police, through the use of freaky mutant humans, could predict who was going to commit a crime? \nWell world, it looks as though we are taking a small step towards that future. \nJapanese hi tech firm Hitachi has revealed that it has developed a system that can predict when and where a crime will occur. \nIt’s called the Hitachi Visualisation Predictive Crime Analytics and it’s able to absorb massive amounts of data from a variety of sources such as social media, weather reports, bus timetables and maps and the distance from public buildings such as schools or hospitals. \nIt then crunches all this information to find patterns that humans would most likely miss. \n“A human just can’t handle when you get to the tens or hundreds of variables that could impact crime like weather, social media, proximity to schools, Metro [subway] stations, gunshot sensors, 911 calls,” Darrin Lipscomb, the co-founder of the firm that developed the crime-monitoring tech that Hitachi later acquired, told Fast Company .
