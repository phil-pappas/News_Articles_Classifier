Twitter \nFollowing rumours, Dell has announced its plans to buy data storage company for $67 billion, a deal which smashes the record for the largest ever purchase in the tech industry. The deal saw EMC agreeing to a sale price worth around $33.15 a share. \nFollowing the announcement, Dell’s founder chief executive Michael Dell told The New York Times, “We’re continuing to evolve the company into the most relevant areas where IT is moving. This deal just accelerates that.” \nThis move comes at a time where the PC industry is starting to wane a little, but once the deal gets shareholder approval, it’ll make Dell one of the largest providers of enterprise computing products. \nThe terms of the deal are fairly complicated and admittedly a little confusing, but the basic idea is that the agreement reportedly includes a “go-shop” provision that allows EMC to consider bids from rival firms. It might seem like a bit of a bad idea, at least for Dell, it shows investors that they’re getting the best value possible out of the sale. Also in the sale, aside from cash, Dell’s acquisition will also include a tracking stock that’ll be issued to investors, accounting for EMC’s 81 per cent stake in VMWare, which will remain an independent business despite the acquisition. \nWith this acquisition Dell says it’ll now be able to offer “end-to-end” solutions to clients. \nYou can read the full announcement right here . If business jargon isn’t your thing however, just be happy that you’re able to witness one of the biggest acquisitions in tech history.
