VASCO Data Security International, Inc. (NASDAQ: VDSI), a global leader in authentication, electronic signatures, and identity management, announced today two new DIGIPASS authenticators with Cronto-based visual transaction signing capabilities. Both hardware authenticators utilize an encrypted color QR code to protect against the newest and most sophisticated hacker attacks on online and mobile banking.\nDIGIPASS 780 is a small, hand-held authenticator with a color touchscreen display and PIN protection. The addition of PIN protection enhances the security of the device and expands the protection schemes that may be employed by a bank. DIGIPASS 780 also features a rechargeable battery and multi-language support.\nDIGIPASS 880 is a smart card reader and authentication and signing device. The smart card reader allows remote banking customers to insert their EMV card into the built-in card reader creating a card-present environment for online banking and ecommerce transactions. This provides the highest level of security against fraud and protects sensitive payment and user data.\nCronto technology utilizes a high-definition color QR code to provide a unique and highly-secure authentication and visual transaction signing solution. Cronto technology helps banks protect customers against attacks that incorporate effective hacking techniques such as phishing and social engineering by replacing less secure methods of login (such as username and password) and transaction verification.\nVisual transaction signing enhances user convenience by reducing the interaction required â€“ users simply point their Cronto-enabled device at their screen and the QR code is automatically captured allowing all of the encrypted transaction details to be communicated through a secure channel without the risk of tampering. Cronto technology is available in select DIGIPASS hardware and software solutions.\n\"The online banking environment is becoming more dangerous as sophisticated threats and fraud schemes continue to threaten users and the transactions that they are conducting online,\" stated Jan Valcke , President and COO of VASCO Data Security. \"Our Cronto technology allows banks to meet the critical challenge of balancing the need for heightened security against users' demands for more convenient access to their banking applications online.\"\nFor additional information about DIGIPASS 780, visit www.vasco.com/DIGIPASS-780\nFor additional information about DIGIPASS 880, visit www.vasco.com/DIGIPASS-880\nAbout VASCO\nVASCO is a world leader in providing Two-factor authentication and digital signature solutions to financial institutions.
