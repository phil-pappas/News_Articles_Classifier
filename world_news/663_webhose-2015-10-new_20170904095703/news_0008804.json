Krafcik most recently served as an executive at TrueCar, which provides market-based pricing information on new and used cars.\nGoogle Inc. is competing with traditional car makers to develop self-driving vehicles.\nThe Mountain View, California, company has been testing self-driving cars near its Silicon Valley headquarters, and more recently in Austin, Texas. Its cars have driven more than 1 million miles on California highways or city streets.\nIt has promised to deliver a driverless car in five years, but many experts find that timeframe ambitious.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
