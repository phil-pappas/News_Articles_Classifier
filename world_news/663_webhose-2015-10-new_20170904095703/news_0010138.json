(NASDAQ: ZFGN)? Did you purchase your shares between January 12, 2015 and October 16, 2015? Did you lose money in your investment? \nRigrodsky & Long, P.A. announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased the common stock of Zafgen, Inc. (\"Zafgen\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ZFGN) between January 12, 2015 and October 16, 2015, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company and certain of its officers (the \"Complaint\"). \nThe Complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants issued materially false and misleading public statements, and/or failed to disclose material information concerning adverse thrombotic events experienced by patients in the Company's clinical trials of its primary new drug product, beloranib. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that one participant in the beloranib Phase 3 study, who had died, was receiving beloranib and not a placebo. In addition, the Complaint alleges that while Zafgen had reported 2 thrombotic events in prior clinical studies, there had actually been 4 such events, as well as 2 additional thrombotic events in other ongoing studies. \nThe Complaint further alleges that on October 15, 2015, the Food and Drug Administration placed a partial clinical hold on beloranib. On that news, the price of the Company's common stock fell to a close of $10.36 per share on October 16, 2015, from a close of $21.02 per share on the previous day. \nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 21, 2015. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Any member of the proposed class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice. One of the key factors in selecting the lead plaintiff is the size of the loss. The larger the size of your economic loss, the greater the likelihood that you may be appointed to serve as lead plaintiff. Alternatively, you may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. \nIf you purchased shares of Zafgen during the Class Period, and wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact Timothy J. MacFall, Esquire or Peter Allocco of Rigrodsky & Long, P.A., 2 Righter Parkway, Suite 120, Wilmington, DE 19803 at (888) 969-4242; by e-mail at info@rl-legal.com ; or at: http://rigrodskylong.com/investigations/zafgen-inc-zfgn . \nAttorney advertising.
