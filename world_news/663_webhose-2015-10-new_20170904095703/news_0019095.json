This Market Leadership award is given each year by Stratecast to the company that has demonstrated excellence by capturing the largest market share within the global CSP billing mediation segment. Huawei leads this market, and continues to grow at a year-over-year rate much higher than the overall billing mediation market. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276562 \n\"Given the rapid rate at which data volumes have grown, as 3G and 4G mobile technologies have now become mainstream, the need for a responsive and flexible mediation solution to address these data volumes is crucial for accurate data management and accountability,\" said Karl Whitelock, Global Director Operations, Orchestration, Data Analysis, and Monetization Strategy at Stratecast | Frost & Sullivan. \"Real-time rating & charging and policy management systems need aggregated and correlated usage data to address all bill generation and customer notification needs. In today's real-time environment, a robust mediation engine is essential for delivering customer-appealing services.\" \nReal-time customer expectations place billing mediation, along with real-time rating & charging, at the forefront of effective long-term customer satisfaction. Next on this expectation list is the rising concern of CSPs, globally, to understand, in real time, which services customers are using, where the highest value customers are in the network, and on what advanced service options they are willing to spend to better meet their needs. Analysis of mediated data is at the forefront of this type of business approach. \nHuawei delivers convergent mediation capabilities that support any service, on any network. Designed for ease of configuration and management, the Huawei Mediation solution includes pre-built interfaces, out-of-the-box templates, and a Web-based configuration platform to simplify integration with network elements, services, and downstream systems. The Huawei Mediation solution is built upon a rules-based engine that facilitates configuration of any step in the end-to-end mediation processing flow. The solution also offers centralized operations management for monitoring, dealing with exceptions, and reporting. \nAs the company has grown to be a revenue leader in the CSP billing market, its billing solution offerings, including mediation, have improved in functionality, quality, and performance. Many of Huawei's newest CSP customers have purchased its mediation and billing solution offerings due to the company's long-term vision tied to its end-to-end billing, customer care, and partner management solution, known as the Huawei Business Enablement System (BES). \nFrost & Sullivan Best Practices awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service and strategic product development.
