RayStation is one of the most advanced independent treatment planning systems available and will provide an ideal complement to the unique Accuray treatment delivery systems, enabling customers to choose the delivery technology that will best meet their needs. Accuray and RaySearch previously announced a long-term collaboration regarding the RayCare ® oncology information system. \"This agreement marks an important progression in our partnership with RaySearch. We believe the integration of their industry-leading TPS along with our innovative treatment delivery systems will enable clinicians to further optimize their experience and use of Accuray technology long-term,\" said Joshua H. Levine , president and chief executive officer of Accuray. \"Our goal is to maximize the clinical effectiveness of our Systems and enhance the ease with which they integrate within the radiation oncology department. We are pursuing multiple paths to achieve this result, including this agreement with RaySearch, which will provide both flexibility and enhanced options for our customers.\"\nUnder the contract, Accuray will have the opportunity to offer RayStation to clinicians who use the TomoTherapy and CyberKnife System product portfolios. Current RayStation users report that the software provides multiple benefits including advanced treatment planning tools, leading workflow support, and an excellent user experience, all of which enhance treatment delivery flexibility within a radiation oncology department.\nAccuray has an installed base of more than 500 TomoTherapy Systems and more than 300 CyberKnife Systems worldwide. Treatment planning support for TomoTherapy Systems in RayStation is targeted for release during 2016 and support for CyberKnife Systems for release during 2017.\n\"This agreement with Accuray enables us to expand our relationship with a like-minded company committed to improving the way radiation therapy is delivered,\" said Johan Löf, president and chief executive officer of RaySearch Laboratories AB (publ). \"For the first time ever, treatment planning for both of the Accuray systems as well as conventional linear accelerators will be available in one integrated treatment planning system. This integration alone will entail significant gains in efficiency for clinics that have several types of machines. Additionally, we see that many of RayStation's unique strengths are exceptionally well suited to the Accuray systems. In summary, we think that this collaboration will strengthen both RayStation's and the Accuray systems' competiveness.\"\nAbout the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy Systems\nThe Accuray CyberKnife M6™ Series and TomoTherapy H™ Series treatment solutions cover the entire spectrum of radiation therapy needs.
