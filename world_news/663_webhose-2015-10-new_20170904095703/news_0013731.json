With those devices at their fingertips, many of these physicians send medical records or other protected health information (PHI) to providers or patients, through email or text messaging. While convenient, neither PHI disclosure method is compliant with the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which carries penalties up to $1.5 million per violation. \n(Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273352 ) \nFaxing health information, still a popular disclosure method for providers, can be HIPAA-compliant; nevertheless, it carries inherent privacy and penalty risks. The oldest option, postal mail, is secure and carries a lower error risk than faxing, but it remains cumbersome and costly. \nEnter MedTunnel , a novel and free web-based healthcare communications solution. It helps providers and patients eliminate faxing, postal mail, and unsecured email and text messaging. It is a secure, HIPAA-compliant application with an integrated suite of features allowing providers to disclose PHI documents across the care continuum. This includes providers, patients, insurance companies, lab companies, government agencies, etc. It allows users to exchange secure messages, and it offers a portal to patients. Care providers can easily manage all of this from a computer, mobile device, or both. \n\"As a practicing physician, I am thrilled to say that MedTunnel delivers essential, powerful, and secure PHI disclosure and communication tools that allows providers like me to practice compliantly and efficiently. All at no cost to providers or their patients.\" Kishore Tipirneni, an orthopaedic surgeon who is also the co-founder and chief executive officer, further notes, \"Unlike some other free communications solutions available, it is HIPAA-compliant, robust, and offers features typically found only on expensive software platforms.\" \nDr. Tipirneni, who has been in private practice for almost 20 years, was motivated to start MedTunnel after recognizing that the methods for releasing medical information have not kept pace with the modernization of electronic health records (EHRs). Several secure and compliant information technology (IT) solutions for release of PHI exist, but most are complicated, call for costly implementations and service agreements, and typically require practices to sign a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA). \nMedTunnel requires no complicated software installation or service agreements. Furthermore, since it acts only as a secure conduit for releasing PHI - meaning MedTunnel itself cannot access any PHI - a BAA is not necessary. \nEven without contractual obligations, MedTunnel is sure to become a long-term, indispensible partner for busy, productive practices. \nIts integrated application suite offers the following functions: -- Document Transfer - Providers can send, receive, and view medical documents, including radiographic images, from any web browser or using the MedTunnel app for any major smart mobile device. -- Instant Messaging - Text messaging and email are hugely popular with patients, but few providers communicate in this manner because of HIPAA privacy and security concerns. The messaging feature - a hybrid of text messaging and email platforms - functions via any smart mobile device or computer. It offers a secure HIPAA-compliant method for communicating with office staff, other providers and practices, and patients. -- Patient Portal - The patient portal page allows patients to access their PHI. The portal also allows established and prospective patients to request an appointment, ask a question, or send images of their insurance cards for pre-visit benefits eligibility verification. \nThe potential cost savings of these tools are significant: from reducing the need for paper and toner to eliminating expensive fax equipment, from reducing mailing costs to eliminating unnecessary personnel time. \nIn addition, MedTunnel helps providers improve efficiency by seamlessly releasing PHI from EHRs to providers and patients, while the patient portal feature reduces practice phone-call volume. \n\"With practices facing flat or shrinking reimbursements from health insurers, managing practice costs is vital,\" observes Dr. Tipirneni. \"I'm proud that MedTunnel helps medical providers practice more compliantly and efficiently with improved essential communication between colleagues and patients. We're confident that it will be a provider's essential communications partner for many years to come.\" \nAs part of its core mission, MedTunnel is committed to reducing the excessive paper consumption in medical practices by promoting electronic delivery of PHI between providers and patients. The company's founders hope that, with the widespread implementation of their environmentally friendly application, health professionals and patients alike can help preserve our planet's precious natural resources. \nAbout MedTunnel, LLC: \nMedTunnel is the way of the future for efficiently and securely communicating Protected Health Information.
