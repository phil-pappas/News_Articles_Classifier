It blends together leading edge information and communications technology solutions, radical new power systems architectures and innovative market mechanisms, to support increasing renewable energy deployment and the electrification of transportation and heating. \nWhat you will study \nYear 1: You combine a series of short intensive research-led MSc level classes and Continual Professional Development (CPD) modules with training in professional engineering skills and research methodologies. These are designed to develop your technical expertise in advanced power systems and smart grids topics. You explore potential PhD topics through two industry-inspired mini projects, presenting your results to partners. Your PhD topic will be agreed at the end of your first year. \nYear 2-4: You will study at either the University of Strathclyde or Imperial College and your research will be enhanced with advanced MSc classes and further professional training. Your research project and experience will be augmented through an appropriate industrial or international secondment for up to 3 months. You will also be encouraged to attend conferences, seminars and other joint training events. Throughout your studies you will have unique access to the extensive range of laboratories and world class research facilities at both institutions. \nEligibility & entry requirements \nStudentships are available for UK citizens who have, or are about to obtain a first class or 2.1 Honours, or an MSc degree in a physical sciences or engineering discipline. Studentships begin on 1 October each year, cover University fees, stipend and travel allowance for four years. \nHow to apply \nTo apply, send your CV, academic transcripts and a covering letter explaining why you are interested in studying within the Centre to Shirley Kirk on eee-cdtadmissions@strath.ac.uk \nContact", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:24:59.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
