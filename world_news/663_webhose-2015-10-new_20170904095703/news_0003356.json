The price of $33.15 a share is 28 percent above EMC's closing level on Oct. 7, just before reports surfaced that a deal was in the works.Here is the official release from Dell (or you can scroll down for the full text).News of the deal first leaked last week. It's not just big, it's actually twice as big as the previous largest tech-only deal, which was the Compaq-HP deal, valued at $33.4 billion. (The Time Warner-AOL deal was larger, but TW wasn't regarded as a tech company at the time.) A complicated merger The merger will be complex and costly to execute, given the sheer size and scope of both companies. But the payoff could mean that Dell gets a broader enterprise business, while EMC gets some breathing room after its recent troubles.Dell, EMC, and VMware which specializes in a technology called \"virtualization\" that helps companies make their data centers more efficient have all been facing pressure from cloud services like Amazon Web Services, which lets customers outsource their data crunching and data storage needs to one of the e-retail giant's hugely efficient data centers. Dell CEO Michael Dell In addition, Dell has reportedly been hit hard by the sagging PC market, threatening its PC manufacturing business.For its part, EMC has fallen on some hard times. Free software like Hadoop, which can be run on commodity servers, has seriously impacted EMC's storage and data processing businesses, since it removes the need for customers to buy often-pricey software and hardware products.EMC reportedly began a strategic review to explore various options last year. And over the summer, EMC vowed to cut $850 million in expenses, prompting employees to start bracing themselves for mass layoffs.Plus, long-time EMC CEO Joe Tucci was slated to retire in February 2015, but that didn't happen. He has made no secret of the fact that he's searching for his replacement. With the merger, that problem goes away. The full text of the official statement: Michael S. Dell, MSD Partners and Silver Lake Lead Transaction to Combine Dell and EMC, Creating Premier End-to-End Technology Company Date : 10/12/2015 Date : 10/12/2015 Brings together the industry's leading innovators in digital transformation, software-defined data center, hybrid cloud, converged infrastructure, mobile and securityEMC stockholders to receive approximately $33.15 per share (based on the assumptions described below) in a combination of cash as well as tracking stock linked to a portion of EMC's economic interest in the VMware businessVMware to remain an independent, publicly-traded companyDell Inc. and EMC Corporation today announced they have signed a definitive agreement under which Dell, together with its owners, Michael S. Dell, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Dell, MSD Partners and Silver Lake, the global leader in technology investing, will acquire EMC Corporation, while maintaining VMware as a publicly-traded company.Under the terms of the agreement, EMC shareholders will receive $24.05 per share in cash in addition to tracking stock linked to a portion of EMC's economic interest in the VMware business. Based on the estimated number of EMC shares outstanding at the close of the transaction, EMC shareholders are expected to receive approximately 0.111 shares of new tracking stock for each EMC share. Assuming, for illustrative purposes, a valuation for each share of tracking stock of $81.78, the intraday volume-weighted average price for VMware on Wednesday, October 7, 2015, EMC shareholders would receive a total combined consideration of $33.15 per EMC share and the total transaction would be valued at approximately $67 billion. The value of the tracking stock may vary from the market price of VMware given the different characteristics and rights of the two stocks.The EMC Board of Directors approved the merger agreement and intends to recommend that stockholders of EMC approve the agreement.
