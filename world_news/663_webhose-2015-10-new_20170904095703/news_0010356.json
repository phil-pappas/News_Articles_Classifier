Recently, they are focusing on details than the whole image when photographing the products because the survey indicated that customers are mostly influenced by the photographs showing the details of the products when they decide to purchase them.\nThe mall also concentrates on customer satisfaction service for customers around the world. They are making full preparations such as hiring people who are familiar with the culture and language of the countries they made entry to and monitoring competitor.\nIn 2013, they also completed the development of shopping malls in English (en.bluepops.co.kr), Chinese (cn.bluepops.co.kr), and Japanese (bluepops.jp) through 'Cafe24( www.cafe24.com) ', the largest e-commerce solution brand of Korea. Later, they developed shopping malls in Spanish (es.bluepops.co.kr) and Portuguese (br.bluepops.co.kr). They are planning to open shops in open markets in each country to broaden the sales channel and build up customer trust.\n\"We will lead customer satisfaction by keeping the balance between price, quality, and service instead of focusing on only one aspect. We believe that BLUEPOPS will get close to success through balanced customer satisfaction.\"\n\nSOURCE BLUEPOPS\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.bluepops.co.kr/ \nhttp://www.cafe24.com/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:40:58.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
