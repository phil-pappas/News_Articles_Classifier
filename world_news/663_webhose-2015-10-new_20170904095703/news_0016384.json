In this webcast , MetricNet, a leading source of online benchmarks and a pioneer in IT Service and Support benchmarking, shared the results of MetricNet’s 2015 Global Benchmarking Initiative for Service and Support. They also discussed the methodology, defined the KPIs used for benchmarking, and shared performance data from more than 140 companies worldwide. “Many Service and Support professionals are unfamiliar with the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are important to track and trend.” said Jeff Rumburg, Managing Partner of MetricNet. “Even fewer are aware of what constitutes acceptable performance vs. world-class performance.”\nMetricNet’s global benchmarking data suggests that the vast majority of Service and Support organizations track very few, if any, performance metrics. In this live presentation, MetricNet shared empirical observations from the best-in-class as well as evidence for metrics as a foundation discipline in IT Service and Support.\nThose interested in viewing the recording can do so on the BrightTALK website . All professionals involved in the delivery and support of IT services are encouraged to watch. This includes C-level executives, IT directors, Service Desk and Desktop Support Managers, and supervisors.\nJeff Rumburg delivered the webcast.
