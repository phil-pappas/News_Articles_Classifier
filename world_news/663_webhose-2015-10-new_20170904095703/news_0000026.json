Photo: Bloomberg\nThe line between PCs and handheld gadgets continues to blur as Microsoft unveils a new range of Lumia smartphones designed to double as desktop computers.\nThe recently-released Windows 10 continues Microsoft's quest to unify PCs and mobile devices with a universal interface. While desktop and notebook computers running Windows 10 can behave like tablets, Microsoft's new flagship Lumia smartphones running Windows 10 Mobile can also behave like desktop computers.\nThe 13cm Lumia 950 and 14.5cm 950 XL smartphones are built around familiar touch-friendly tiles, with access to Microsoft's app store â€“ which is finding its feet but still tends to be last in line for new apps behind Apple's iOS and Google's Android.\nAndroid, iOS and Windows 10 Mobile devices all offer the ability to wirelessly mirror what's on the screen with your television. Along with this, the new Lumia Windows 10 Mobile smartphones are also compatible with Microsoft's new Display Dock cradle, which features video output for connecting to a screen.\nAdvertisement Rather than stretch the mobile-style menus and apps for a large screen, the Lumia smartphones display the traditional Windows desktop on a monitor when connected via the Display Dock. The dock also features three USB 2.0 ports for connecting desktop accessories like a keyboard and mouse, allowing the Lumia smartphones to completely mimic a Windows 10 desktop PC.\nYou're not quite running a full version of Windows 10, as the Lumias run on mobile-friendly ARM processors rather than Intel-style PC chips. Instead, you see a stripped-down version of Windows, similar to the now defunct Windows RT notebooks, which looks like the standard desktop and can run a range of desktop applications including Microsoft Office. The phones uses the same Windows 10 Continuum features built into other Windows hybrid devices, making it easy to jump between desktop and tablet mode.\nAlongside the new smartphones Microsoft has also launched the Surface Book high-end notebook with a detachable keyboard, and the Surface Pro 4 tablet, with an optional screen cover featuring a built-in keyboard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:52:09.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
