The indices measure the performance of the world's sustainability leaders. RobecoSAM invites more than 3,400 publicly traded companies, including 800 companies in emerging markets, to report annually on their sustainability practices. Companies are selected based on a comprehensive assessment of long-term economic, environmental and social criteria with a strong focus on long-term shareholder value that account for general as well as industry-specific sustainability trends. Only firms that lead their industries based on this assessment are included in the indices. The indices are created and maintained according to a systematic methodology, allowing investors to appropriately benchmark sustainability-driven funds and derivatives over the long term.\nWatch EMC's Chief Sustainability Officer, Kathrin Winkler discuss the importance of DJSI here .\nRobecoSAM Quote:\nGuido Giese , Head of Indices, RobecoSAM\n\"Over the years the DJSI index family has not only come to be the gold standard for corporate sustainability but has also become a competitive platform where companies receive recognition for their sustainability practices. The Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) is a state of the art, in-depth sustainability performance assessment methodology. Thanks to its broad reach, the results of the CSA are one of the leading sources of information on how listed companies around the globe are exercising financially material ESG practices. The entire DJSI index family benefits from that.\"\nEMC Quote:\nKathrin Winkler , Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, EMC Corporation\nEMC is honored to be recognized by this highly respected investor index for the fifth consecutive year.
