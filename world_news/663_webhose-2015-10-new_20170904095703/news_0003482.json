The events have also claimed the scalp of its chief executive, who has resigned in the wake of the revelations.\nMaurice Blackburn said almost 700 people around Australia had already registered their interest in a potential class action, and expects the number to grow.\n“Today’s announcement reveals that the scope of people affected in Australia is much larger than was first thought, and in our view a class action is now most likely,” Mr Scattini said.\nThe Australian consumer watchdog, the ACCC, has said an enforcement investigation into Volkswagen is a priority for the regulator, which will not hesitate to take action if consumers were exposed to misleading representations.\nThe use of defeat devices is prohibited under design rules covered by Australian consumer law mandatory safety standards. The maximum penalty for each breach of the law is $1.1 million, which could end in a total fine into the billions of dollars for Volkwagen.\n“It beggars belief that VW got itself into this situation in the first place but it adds insult to injury for the company not to address the issue of compensation to vehicle owners,\" Mr Scattini said.\n“The class actions mechanism is the best chance people have of holding companies that have caused mass wrongdoing to account.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:44:23.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
