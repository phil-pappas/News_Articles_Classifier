[ 1 ] INTUNIV must be used as a part of a comprehensive ADHD treatment programme, typically including psychological, educational and social measures. [ 1 ]\n\"The approval of INTUNIV marks a significant advance in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in Europe . Previously, physicians had only one licensed non-stimulant option for these patients,\" said Perry Sternberg , Senior Vice President, Neuroscience Business Unit, Shire. \"The importance of simply providing physicians with the ability to choose the non-stimulant option that may best suit the needs of their patients should not be overlooked, considering the complexities and different manifestations of the disorder in children and adolescents.\"\nThe European Commission decision to grant approval is based on data from three pivotal Phase 3 studies investigating the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of INTUNIV in children and adolescents with ADHD. [ 2 ] - [ 4 ]\nThe European Commission decision to grant Marketing Authorisation follows a positive opinion adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in July 2015 and applies to all 28 EU member states and Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway .\nAbout ADHD in children and adolescents\nADHD is a common psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] and is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO). [ 8 ] The core symptoms are inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. [ 7 ] Worldwide, prevalence of ADHD is estimated to be between 5.29% and 7.1%, and just under 5% for children and adolescents ( [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] While the exact origin of ADHD is unknown, it is recognised that the disorder may be caused by the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. [ 9 ] - [ 11 ]\nAbout INTUNIV\nINTUNIV is indicated in the EU, Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway as a non-stimulant for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old for whom stimulants are not suitable, not tolerated or have been shown to be ineffective. [ 1 ]\nINTUNIV must be used as a part of a comprehensive ADHD treatment programme, typically including psychological, educational and social measures. [ 1 ]\nGuanfacine is a selective alpha-2A adrenergic receptor agonist in that it has 15-20 times higher affinity for this receptor subtype than for the alpha-2B or alpha-2C subtypes. [ 1 ] Guanfacine is a non-stimulant. The mode of action of guanfacine in ADHD is not fully established. Preclinical research suggests guanfacine modulates signalling in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia through direct modification of synaptic noradrenalin transmission at the alpha 2- adrenergic receptors. [ 1 ]\nThe effects of guanfacine in the treatment of ADHD have been examined in children and adolescents (6 to 17 years). Guanfacine showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo on symptoms of ADHD based upon investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). [ 1 ]\nINTUNIV is also licensed in the US and Canada . For more information on the product labelling in these markets, refer to the US Prescribing Information and the Canadian Product Monograph, respectively. In the US, generic versions of Intuniv for the treatment of ADHD are available.\nINTUNIV safety information [ 1 ]\nGuidance for Use\nPre-treatment screening: A baseline evaluation needs to be conducted to identify patients at increased risk of somnolence and sedation, hypotension and bradycardia, QT-prolongation arrhythmia and weight increase/risk of obesity.\nMonitoring: During dose titration, weekly monitoring for signs and symptoms of somnolence and sedation, hypotension and bradycardia should be performed. During the first year of treatment, the patient should be assessed at least every 3 months for signs and symptoms as during dose titration and for weight increase/risk of obesity.\nThe physician who elects to use Intuniv for extended periods (over 12 months) should re-evaluate the usefulness of Intuniv every 3 months for the first year and then at least yearly, and consider trial periods off medication to assess the patient's functioning without pharmacotherapy, preferably during times of school holidays.\nDiscontinuation : Patients/caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue Intuniv without consulting their physician. Blood pressure and pulse may increase following discontinuation of Intuniv. Individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes. Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored in all patients during dose downward titration and following discontinuation of Intuniv. Tapering Intuniv dosing during withdrawal is recommended to minimise these potential withdrawal effects.\nContraindications\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\nSpecial warnings and precautions for use\nCaution is advised when treating patients with Intuniv who have a history of hypotension, bradycardia, syncope or a condition that may predispose them to syncope such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia or dehydration, heart block or cardiovascular disease. Caution is also advised when treating patients with Intuniv who are being treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other medicinal products that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. Patients should be advised to drink plenty of fluid.\nGuanfacine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a known history of QT prolongation, risk factors for torsade de pointes or who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval.\nIntuniv may cause somnolence and sedation predominantly at the start of treatment. Before Intuniv is used with any other centrally active depressants the potential for additive sedative effects should be considered. Patients should not drink alcohol whilst taking Intuniv. Patients are advised against operating heavy equipment, driving or cycling until they know how they respond to treatment with Intuniv.\nPatients with emergent suicidal ideation or behavior during treatment for ADHD should be evaluated immediately by their physician.\nChildren and adolescents treated with Intuniv may show an increase in their BMI. Therefore, monitoring of height, weight and BMI should be done prior to initiation of therapy and then every 3 months for the first year, taking into consideration clinical judgement. 6 monthly monitoring should follow thereafter, with more frequent monitoring following any dose adjustment.\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\nInteractions\nWhen Intuniv is used concomitantly with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, grapefruit juice) and inducers, plasma concentrations of guanfacine may be elevated or lowered, potentially affecting the efficacy and safety of Intuniv.\nSide effects Very common (frequency greater than or equal to1/10): Somnolence, headache, abdominal pain and fatigue. Decreased appetite, depression, anxiety, affect lability, insomnia, middle insomnia, nightmare, sedation, dizziness, lethargy, bradycardia, hypotension, orthostatic Common hypotension, vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, (greater than or abdominal/stomach discomfort, dry mouth, rash, enuresis, equal to1/100 to irritability, blood pressure decreased and weight Please consult the SPC for rare (≥1/10000 to NOTES TO EDITORS\nShire enables people with life-altering conditions to lead better lives.\nOur strategy is to focus on developing and marketing innovative specialty medicines to meet significant unmet patient needs.\nWe provide treatments in Rare Diseases, Neuroscience, Gastrointestinal and Internal Medicine and we are developing treatments for symptomatic conditions treated by specialist physicians in other targeted therapeutic areas, such as Ophthalmics.\nhttp://www.shire.com\nTHE \" SAFE HARBOR \" STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nStatements included in this announcement that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.
