Over 10% of boys will also become victims. Most of the perpetrators are known and trusted by the families. \nAlarmingly, almost half of all dementia patients suffer abuse from their caregivers. \nWhile these facts are unsettling, there are simple, quick and effective steps a parent can take to help reduce the likelihood of their loved ones suffering from any abuse or mistreatment. \nCaregiverChecks.com provides superior quality information about caregivers, in a legal, ethical and proactive manner. With CaregiverChecks.com, parents can have an in-depth look into any potential caregiver, including criminal records, fraud convictions, financial indiscretions, and other areas of concern. \nDan and Jay Kim, the husband-and-wife team that founded CaregiverChecks.com, are parents as well as technology experts. They developed CaregiverChecks.com to address the problem faced by millions of Americans everyday: The fear and uncertainty of trusting a virtual stranger for the care of those you love most. \nParents can use CaregiverChecks.com to quickly screen potential or existing caregivers, and make informed decisions about granting unfettered access to their family and their homes. \nCaregiverChecks.com meets the high standards established by the Association of Premier Nanny Agencies, and is owned and operated in America (many \"background check\" companies are actually offshore data-mines that provide little information of value, no accountability, and cause potential liability issues). \nThe company partnered with Pattie Fitzgerald, a nationally known child safety expert and founder of Safely Ever After, to offer \"Keeping Loved Ones Safe this Halloween,\" a lively segment that is perfect for news programs and community events. \nFor more information on keeping your family safe this Halloween, contact CaregiverChecks.com at (310)-356-7001, or visit: www.caregiverchecks.com . \nConnect:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:34:57.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
