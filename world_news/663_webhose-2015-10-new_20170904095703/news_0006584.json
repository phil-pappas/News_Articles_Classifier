When it comes to brain growth and speech development, a child’s first four years matter more than the next 80 years combined. Research has now proven that the number of words a child hears throughout the day strongly predicts future vocabulary, IQ, and emotional well-being. Starling’s ultimate goal is to motivate parents to talk to their young children to provide this development and have their child reach the stars, at any age.\nShaped like a friendly star, Starling is soft, seamless and safely attaches to babies’ clothes via a tethered magnetic clasp. The companion VersaMe app pairs with the Starling to set word count goals, monitor progress and achieve a higher level of verbal engagement; the app also includes activity ideas and challenges.\n“My hope is that the Starling becomes a ubiquitous tool to empower parents and families to help all children fulfill their potential in life,” states Nicki Boyd, co-founder of VersaMe.\n\"Design is good when it's in perfect harmony with the user, and even better if its value extends into a lifelong benefit like Starling. Soft, colorful and friendly, we made Starling nearly as cute as your little darling,\" said Dan Harden, President/CEO and Principal Designer of Whipsaw.\nStarling launched on Indiegogo on October 20, reaching 140% of their funding goal in the first 20 hours alone. The campaign is still going strong and would greatly appreciate additional support. No personal need for it and no planned baby shower on the social calendar? No problem, donate a Starling through Indiegogo as the company is also working with non-profit foundations to provide Starlings to low-income families.\nAbout Whipsaw:\nWhipsaw is an Industrial Design & Engineering consulting firm located in Silicon Valley California, with a focus on innovative product design, development & branding.
