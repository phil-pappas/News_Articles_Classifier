Photo: AP\nThe US FBI is investigating claims by an anonymous computer hacker that he stole potentially sensitive files from the private email account of CIA director John Brennan and posted them online.\nThe exposed documents appear to include a roster of senior US national security officials with their phone and Social Security numbers, a log of calls made by former CIA deputy director Avril Haines, and a list of email addresses that the hacker claimed were taken from Brennan's AOL account.\n\"We are aware of the reports that have surfaced on social media and have referred the matter to the appropriate authorities,\" a CIA spokesman said.\nOther US officials said that the FBI had launched an inquiry and that the Secret Service was investigating related claims that the hacker obtained private information from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.\nAdvertisement Meanwhile, the hacker appears to have created a Twitter account to brag about the breach, posting documents allegedly stolen as part of the hack.\n\"It does not appear that any classified information was accessed\" meanwhile.. pic.twitter.com/tOSlMtS3Ly\nâ€” cracka (@phphax) October 19, 2015 The potential breaches are likely to intensify security concerns over senior government officials' use of private email and internet accounts. Hillary Clinton's campaign for US president has been beset by allegations that classified material may have been exposed on the private email server she used while serving as secretary of state.\nThe claims were first reported Monday by the New York Post , which described the unnamed hacker as a \"stoner high-school student\" who told the newspaper that Brennan's account was used to store sensitive files, including his 47-page application for a top-secret security clearance. It was unclear whether that application had been posted online.\nThe hacker said he was motivated by \"opposition to US foreign policy and support to Palestine\".\nHe said he had obtained the information through a \"social engineering\" ploy in which he posed as a Verizon technician and tricked the company's tech-support unit into revealing Brennan's account number, password and other details. He said he then used that information to pose as Brennan in a call to AOL in which he requested a reset of the CIA chief's online password.\nThe hacker said he had repeatedly prank-called Brennan since August, once reading the CIA director's Social Security number to him over the phone before Brennan hung up.\nThe New York Post reported that the hacker's access was cut off after Brennan learned that his account had been infiltrated. Some of the files appear to predate Brennan's tenure as CIA director. Before taking that job in 2013, he served as President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser.\nThe hacker also claimed to have broken into the account of Johnson's telco Comcast and listened to his voicemails and taken a screenshot of a billing page.\nPrevious CIA directors have faced serious consequences for computer-related breaches. John Deutch was stripped of his security clearances in 1999 after mishandling classified information on home computers. And David Petraeus resigned from the top CIA post in 2012 after admitting to an extramarital affair that FBI investigators had uncovered in his personal emails.\nThe Washington Post and Fairfax Media", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/10/18/stoner-high-school-student-says-he-hacked-the-cia/", "https://twitter.com/phphax/status/656152792453795840", "http://t.co/tOSlMtS3Ly"], "published": "2015-10-20T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:01:18.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
