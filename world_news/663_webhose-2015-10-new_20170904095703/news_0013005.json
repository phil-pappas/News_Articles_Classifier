The new line is initially being launched with two highly integrated box-PC models that include necessary interfaces for the most common peripheral devices, as well as intelligent API middleware to simplify application development. The API middleware allows application development without dependencies to the peripheral devices, and a vast library of commonly used peripherals is available. The ADi-SA1X and ADi-SA2X integrated box PCs are based on AMD and Intel® processors and offer both state of the art graphics performance and an onboard GPU option. The ADi-SA1X and ADi-SA2X support up to eight independent displays and are equipped with external, field-removable storage, Wi-fi, two GbE ports, four USB 3.0 and three USB 2.0 ports, 4x DP on board (4096x2160, 60 fps), 1x PCIe x16 Gen3, 1x PCIe x1 Gen2, 2x Mini PCIe slots, 4x RS232 + 1x RS485/RS422, and 7.1 channel audio. In addition, the new ADi-SA1X and ADi-SA2X deliver multiple hardware and software security options suited for retail, vending, and gaming applications and are designed to meet GLI (Gaming Laboratories International) standards.\nADLINK has also developed several special peripherals including the ADi-SIOG , an Intelligent USB I/O Controller Hub for the Class III/II, VLT/SBG, AWP, POS/POI and retail markets. The controller is equipped with 1MB battery backed NVRAM and a crypto and authentication security chip that combines power-off monitoring and date/time stamping features to enhance security. The ADi-SIOG has 32 inputs and outputs to support retail/gaming-specific peripherals.\nADLINK has also introduced the ADi-BSEC intelligent SECURITY and NVRAM PCI Express Card. The ADi-BSEC is a high-speed PCIe card with up to 16MB NVRAM. It also offers a crypto and authentication security chip featuring SHA-256, RNG, UID, EEPROM, and OTP.\nADLINK’s iAPI intelligent middleware simplifies the development of new applications. By offering standard APIs for development, iAPI provides a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), a Protocol Translation Layer (PTL), and supports ccTalk, ID003, EBDS, TCL, and SSP protocols. Combined with ADLINK’s iAPI intelligent middleware, the ADi-SIOG and ADi-BSEC accessories deliver an extensive device library out of the box.\nFor more information on our new line of all-in-one industrial box PCs for retail and gaming, please visit: http://www.adlinktech.com/infotainment\nAbout ADLINK\nADLINK Technology is enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) with innovative embedded computing solutions for edge devices, intelligent gateways, and cloud services.
