But what about for budget users? Let’s check out what is in store for them as Lumia 550 takes center stage. - Advertisement - \nSince the tremendous success of the Window Surface range, this is a further sign Microsoft is getting serious about taking on Apple has both hardware and software makers. This new \"budget\" phone could score a blow in a space that Apple has always served poorly. If you can remember the disaster of the iPhone 5C ? \nWe have previously taken a look at the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL and how Microsoft is making its debut of Windows 10 on their mobile devices with such bang. Quad HD screen, superior hardware and 20MP Carl Zeiss camera are just some of the highlights for the two of them. Well, if you can afford to spend in the range of $550 - $650, then you should seriously consider either one of them. \nIf you can’t afford that much, and you want to ride on Windows 10, then Lumia 550 is your best shot. Off-hand, we can say that the specs aren’t that much to of a different from their previous Lumia 540 which was released back in May 2015 also a good budget phone. Perhaps the time has come for a slight upgrade, and the best part is that you will get all the benefits of the latest OS that Microsoft has to offer on the tablet. More on that later, but for now – let’s start with the low-down on the device. \nDespite its smallish screen, the Lumia 550 isn’t exactly small and thin as it ships with a body of 136.1 x 67.8 x 9.9 mm (5.36 x 2.67 x 0.39 in) and comes weighing in at 141.9 (5.01 oz). It will be sporting a 4.7-inch High Definition LCD screen with 720 x 1280 pixels or ~315 ppi pixel density that is quite the average for a screen of this size. \nRegarding performance, the Lumia 550 will be equipped with the Qualcomm MSM8909 Snapdragon 210 chipset paired with a Quad-core 1.1 GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Adreno 304 graphics and 1GB RAM. All this points to a very average performance that enables you to run most apps and games with ease. But once you start to multitask, you might experience some lags start to appear. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the Lumia 550 will be blessed with a 5MP-2MP camera setup. The 5MP primary camera has a 1/4 inch sensor size with f/2.4 aperture, LED flash, auto and manual exposure, auto and manual white balance, automatic photo upload to web services, full resolution photo and video upload, full-screen viewfinder, geotagging and touch focus. As for the 2MP secondary camera, it has a f/2.8 aperture to cater for all your selfies and video calls. Now this is where things are starting not to look good for this budget smartphone. \nThe device will have 8GB of internal storage and surely that is not enough. Fortunately, you can further expand it up to a maximum of 200GB that is totally huge. No worries here. \nAs for its battery, the Lumia 550 will be equipped with a Li-Ion 2100 mAh battery that technically allows it to last you for at least a day in between charging. \nNow here’s the great thing about Windows 10. The Lumia 550 comes with the latest version of the Office apps you love. Word, Excel, and PowerPoint have been optimized for mobile use. They function beautifully on a phone, and with rich editing tools built in, the new Outlook Mail app makes managing email on the go effortless. You can now work anywhere as long as you bring your smartphone with you - you can access the same great Microsoft services and apps that you are familiar with on your laptop. Free OneDrive storage helps keep your documents safe in the cloud and gives you the freedom to access and edit them on your phone. \nStart your day with a personalized snapshot of all the information you need with Cortana, your personal assistant. It will provide you with traffic info, the weather forecast, and your schedule for the day. Need to buy flowers? With Cortana for Windows 10, you can set a location-based reminder on a PC, and it will arrive just in time on your Lumia. Get your own personal assistant and find out what it is like to have help to go about your daily tasks. \nFinally, you should be informed that the Lumia 550 has 4G LTE connectivity that adds a bit more weight. Not every budget device has the luxury of a fast internet connection, which is a plus point for it. - Advertisement - \nWith a release date in December 2015, the Microsoft Lumia 550 seems to be a good prospect for entry-level users who are on a budget. The fact that it comes with the latest Windows 10 makes for a real game-changing experience. Let’s just hope that it has enough firepower to be able to lend you all the support you possibly want from a smartphone. \nThe Microsoft Lumia 550 is expected to be available in December 2015 for just $139, and it will be available in Black and White. It has an exchangeable back cover that allows you to change easily to something catchier, just like the Lumia of old.
