The addition of these distinguished individuals will bolster SITC’s already prominent consortium of thought leaders in the cancer immunotherapy space. Diverse Expertise and Perspectives The collective experience of the newly elected officials supports the Society’s position as a leader in the field, dedicated to furthering the science and application of cancer immunotherapy. Jérôme Galon, PhD French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, Cordeliers Research Center “As an immunologist, I am pleased to see the progress made by the Society and our field, and wish to push forward towards the cure of cancer. I wish to foster the Society’s impact and influence by establishing relationships with key strategic partners, and to establish collaborative interactions to disseminate information on cancer immunotherapy to a broad audience,” said Dr. Galon. SITC believes that Dr. Galon’s pursuit of networking opportunities with SITC champions at top institutions will further develop the field of cancer immunotherapy and the Society’s current initiatives. Samir N. Khleif, MD Georgia Regents University Cancer Center “These are very exciting times for our field. I believe that we collectively are going to be changing the face of cancer medicine for years to come. SITC will have a major role to play in further advancing the field of immunotherapy in these exciting but challenging times of today’s funding environment and medical practice. It is great to be part of such a progressive organization. I bring the perspective of a Director of a new and dynamic cancer center with a strong commitment immunotherapy as one of the cornerstones of the GRU Cancer Center and cancer medicine in general.” said Dr. Khleif. The Society welcomes Dr. Khleif knowing he will bring a diverse perspective due to his experience with various stakeholders in the current immunotherapy landscape. This includes perspectives from his time as advisor to the FDA, service on multiple Federal advisory panels, service on scientific advisory boards for major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and his longstanding service to SITC. Pamela S. Ohashi, PhD Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network “I have been working for several years to translate research findings to clinical trials, and have learned tremendously from this process. Cancer immunology continues to be an exciting field with integral aspects from basic science to medicine, and look forward to bring to the Board a perspective from the basic sciences,” said Dr. Ohashi. The Society looks forward to Dr. Ohashi’s contributions to the Board of Directors, specifically her Canadian perspective on issues related to immune therapy. SITC’s newly elected officials will promote the goals and vision of Society as the leading membership-driven organization specifically dedicated to the advancement of the science and application of cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Terms will commence immediately following the SITC 2015 Annual Meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, the largest and most prestigious cancer immunotherapy meeting in the world.
