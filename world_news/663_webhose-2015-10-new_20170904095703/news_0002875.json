Location data from mobile phones may only be stored for four weeks.\nTelecom and Internet companies will be forbidden from storing the content of communications, while email traffic is excluded from the new law. Data retention centers will also be located in Germany, Justice Minister Heiko Maas told parliament.\nPrivacy is a particularly sensitive issue in Germany because of the surveillance by the Gestapo in the Nazi era and by communist East Germany's Stasi secret police.\nDisclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about widespread espionage in Germany by the United States caused outrage in Germany.\nThe debate over the new law set Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives (CDU) at loggerheads with her Social Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partner, while opposition parties and critics argued the law violated human rights and would put millions of citizens under general suspicion.\nLast year, the European Union's highest court overthrew a rule that required telecoms companies to store the communications data of EU citizens for up to two years on the grounds it infringed human rights.\nIn 2010, Germany's Constitutional Court blocked a law to store all data for six months.\nMaas saw the new legislation as a compromise that would give police an \"additional tool\" to help fight the most serious crimes.\n\"It is proportionate because less data will be stored, we will save data for a much shorter period and because access to the data has been made significantly harder,\" Mass said.\n(Editing by Richard Balmforth )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:25:26.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
