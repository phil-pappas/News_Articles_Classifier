Target Americans have many, many options nearby to buy their Halloween candy, so Target is offering a little technological fun to get an edge on the competition. The Minneapolis-based chain debuted Treatster, a social-minded website that's designed for desktop and mobile devices and lets viewers search for the best trick-or-treating locations in their neighborhoods. When viewers visit Treatster , they can turn on location services and see their areas' most popular candy haunts, marked on a map with smiling jack-o'-lanterns. The website lets people add their homes and \"upvote\"—a signature of approval—any house or storefront on the map. The more upvotes a location gets, the larger the jack-o'-lantern appears (users can vote one time for a house). Target's website shows you the best places to trick-or-treat in your area (Hell's Kitchen, in our case). In a light-hearted branding move, Target used its bulls-eye logo as an eye on the jack-o'-lantern. The effort ties into the retailer's YouTube endeavor called House on Hallow Hill that launched last week . It lets mobile viewers explore cobwebbed rooms in a 360-degree fashion by tilting and angling their smartphone screens. Check out a clip from that appeal below.
