But it was hardly at the front of the line with the NX, its belated entry in the red-hot small-crossover segment.\nThe compact NX was a brand-new vehicle for the 2015 model year and will continue as a carryover for 2016. I had an opportunity earlier to drive the gas-engine-powered NX, the 200t. This time I spent a week with the hybrid version, the 300h.\nThe hybrid gets significantly better mileage than the turbo-encouraged 200t and its sportier variant, the F model. It delivers EPAs of 35 m.p.g. city and 31 m.p.g. highway in the front-drive form I drove, and 33 m.p.g. city and 30 m.p.g. highway with all-wheel-drive. The 200t and F get 22 m.p.g. city and 28 m.p.g. highway as front-drivers and 21 m.p.g. city and 28 m.p.g. highway as four-wheelers.\nThat better mileage comes at a price. Part of that price is initial cost. The hybrid tester cost $4,855 more than the comparable gasser at a time when petrol is cheap.\nThere is also a performance price to be paid. The 235-horsepower turbo in the 200t and F models urges those cars from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in seven seconds. The hybrid, whose gas engine and two electric motors combine for 194 horsepower, takes nearly nine clicks.\nBased on Toyota RAV4 architecture, the NX is the latest Lexus to team the automaker's triumvirate of workmanship, ride quality, and quietude with more stylish and distinctive design, as underscored by the advent of a signature Lexus grille.\nLexus' rather recent departure from its bland beginnings is evident in the NX design exercise. This is lively, eye-catching sculpting. I'm not a big fan of the wasp-waisted signature grille, but I do like the ebb and flow of this car's body. The sloping roofline and sharply raked rear window are nice design elements. True, they don't do rear vision a lot of favors, but that roof still gives a tall rear-seat passenger sufficient headroom.\nThe tester's interior also was interesting and aesthetically pleasing. Alternating two colors, as well as saddle-stitched soft-touch surfaces with hard, bright metal-edged accents, produced a unique layered look. The two-tone leather seats, featuring smooth surrounds and perforated inserts, were both handsome and comfortable.\nThe interior turned out to be quite roomy for a compact. There was good legroom in the five-seater's outboard rear seats, and a generous cargo area behind them.\nDriving the NX 300h proved a pleasant pastime. While not as lively as the 200t, it moved along well enough for the purposes of the real world. The drivetrain, which employed a continuously variable automatic transmission instead of the conventional six-speed automatic found in the 200t and F models, was generally quiet. The engine did protest a bit when flogged at a stoplight.\nHandling was a plus. With only 6.7 inches of ground clearance, the NX didn't exhibit as much body roll in the corners as some higher-perched brethren I've been in. Despite the ample serving of competence and control, the suspension afforded a supple ride.\nThe well-insulated NX proved largely immune to the acoustic indignities visited upon it by wind and road surface. The comfortable driving position added to the pleasure quotient, as did the accessibility of the instruments and controls.\nThe NX 300h is decently equipped in standard attire, but the tester needed more than $9,000 worth of options to acquire luxury emblems like leather seats, a power moonroof, navigation, and electronic safety devices.\nThe NX has a top, five-star government safety rating.\nalhaasauto@aol.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:27:23.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
