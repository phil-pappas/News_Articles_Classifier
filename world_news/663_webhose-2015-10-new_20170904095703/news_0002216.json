There are much better options available, with more and more technology dedicated to reducing use of paper.”\nAIIM conducts annual research into the state of the paperless office, and early results from this year’s research, ‘Paper-Free Progress: measuring outcomes’, shows that 31 percent of business executives admit their office is piled high with paper documents.\nAIIM’s research consistently shows that not only does paper create expensive waste, but it also clogs up business processes. By digitizing content, enterprises can improve their ability to serve customers quickly and effectively, facilitate collaboration, improve access to information for team members, and increase overall productivity.\n“We will never get rid of paper entirely,” says Mancini, “but the volume used unnecessarily every day is mind-blowing. World Paper Free Day is all about asking people in workplaces around the world, to think a bit harder about whether they really need to press that print button. We all know that that’s the best way to help your business flourish, as well as protect the environment.”\nBusinesses and individuals alike can register for World Paper Free Day and get a WPFD Pledge Kit including social badges, by completing a simple online form. For each registration, AIIM will make a donation to One Laptop per Child, the non-profit organization offering laptops for children in developing countries.\nAIIM would also like people to get behind the campaign by sending photos of the adverse or unproductive ways that paper affects their work life. Fujitsu is offering five of its ScanSnap iX100 mobile scanners as prizes for the most extreme ways. All you have to do is Tweet your picture between now and November 6 using the hashtag #WPFD.\nPrizes will go the most creative and humorous efforts!\nGet involved via social media:\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/worldpaperfree and #wpfd\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/worldpaperfreeday\nGoogle + - https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/105682915438965916441/105682915438965916441\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/5357252\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9cPCUYf3LlGmBrVbg5QLZg\nAbout AIIM\nAIIM has been an advocate and supporter of information professionals for 70 years.
