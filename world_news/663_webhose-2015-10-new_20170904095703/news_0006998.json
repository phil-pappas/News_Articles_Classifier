This capital is in addition to that raised in previous rounds bringing the total investment in Bracket to more than $130M. New investors in the round include Fidelity Management and Research Company and Goldman Sachs, joined by Bracket's previous investors Allegis Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, ARTIS Ventures, Columbus Nova Technology Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, and Sutter Hill Ventures, plus strategic investors GE and Qualcomm. \nThis new capital will be used to further develop the unique Bracket Computing Cell and to finance the technology's global rollout. \"Bracket is fundamentally redefining enterprise computing,\" said Tom Gillis, CEO and co-founder of Bracket. \"Financial firms need to remain technology leaders, and we're working with some of the very largest as we define the blueprint for the data center of the future. Our vision is to provide a secure, advanced, virtual infrastructure that spans multiple clouds, both private and public, with one consistent set of capabilities. Having investors of this quality bolsters our efforts to build this ambitious technology.\" \nLeading financial services firms and security conscious enterprises have worked closely with Bracket to support its development of an innovative architecture for public clouds known as the Computing Cell. The Bracket Computing Cell allows enterprise applications and data and their associated security, networking, and data management infrastructure to reside in a single software construct. The Computing Cell has been architected to run across multiple public cloud providers, as well as in a company's on-premise data center, yielding a single virtual enterprise-grade infrastructure with consistent controls. \n\"Imagine if you could encapsulate your most sensitive applications, data, and services and have them run securely across leading hyperscale public clouds and your private cloud, all the while ensuring consistent security controls and data management capabilities,\" said Jason Lango, CTO and co-founder of Bracket. \"This is what a Bracket Computing Cell allows. It enables an enterprise without boundaries, without sacrificing security and control.\" \nBracket has worked closely with leading IT organizations in its development of this technology. As a result of this collaboration, several large F200 organizations have been able to deploy mission critical IT applications like CRM systems on the public cloud-fully protected and supported by the Bracket Computing Cell. \n\"We are pleased to be working with forward-thinking companies like Bracket Computing on deploying an enterprise public cloud solution that addresses access, performance, and security considerations within our organization,\" said Don Duet, co-head of the Technology Division at Goldman Sachs. \nWithin its Computing Cell, Bracket's unique encryption technology creates a secure fabric that extends an enterprise customer's root of trust across multiple hyperscale clouds that it doesn't necessarily control. This approach allows encryption to act as a new perimeter of the network. These logical controls can span multiple public clouds, while still maintaining the highest levels of enterprise security. \nThe Bracket Computing Cell is powering some of the largest IT applications in the world, and is available now at www.brkt.com . \nAbout Bracket Computing \nBracket Computing is a leader in Virtual Infrastructure Software that spans multiple heterogeneous clouds with one set of advanced security, data management, and networking infrastructure.
