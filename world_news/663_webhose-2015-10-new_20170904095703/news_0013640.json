During an Oct. 20 breakfast sponsored by the Data Transparency Coalition, Gribben highlighted how that approach has opened his eyes. \nBy linking financial data with place-based performance data, he said he was able to identify synergies among SBA contract winners, such as Accion. \nIn fiscal 2014, SBA awarded Accion contracts for women's business counseling and training and for a microloan program. Because the awards came from two different program offices, however, SBA officials were clueless about Accion's potential until they got the bird's-eye view afforded by the Data Act, Gribben said. \n\"There's no way that [the two different program offices] would have known, necessarily, that this entity received two different awards from SBA,\" he said. \"I didn't know [that type of dual-purpose information] existed, sitting in the CFO's office, and it makes me wonder what other synergies might exist that we're not exploringâ€¦because one program office doesn't know where another program office made awards.\" \nUncovering gaps \nThe same data linkage also highlighted shortcomings. \"There's this large part of the country which is underserved from the [SBA's] microloan program, and I didn't know it,\" Gribben said. \nIt wasn't until he got a peek at a Data Act-powered visualization -- a map of the U.S. showing program awards and their geographical reach -- that he clearly saw that huge swathes of the Rocky Mountain West, the Mississippi Delta and a big chunk of North Carolina were not covered by SBA microloans . \nIf data linkage within one small agency has already revealed such big opportunities for growth and change, Gribben said connecting data among agencies could go even further to help government achieve its mission. \n\"How much more am I going to be able to link?\" Gribben wondered, looking forward to future revelations. \nFOIA deluge? \nBringing previously siloed financial data together, however, is bound to reveal some discrepancies. \"My fear is we're going to start getting tons of [Freedom of Information Act] requests to explain our data,\" Gribben said, noting that \"there will be disconnects\" in the financial reporting. \nHe said SBA can almost completely reconcile the numbers on USAspending.gov with its awards data, but given the new accounting challenges, it's unlikely any agency will be 100 percent squared up. And that made him wonder what the Office of Management and Budget's tolerance for discrepancies might be. \n\"What happens when we have tons of errors that pop up?\" he asked. \"We still don't know exactly what we are reconciling to.\" \nMark Reger, deputy controller at OMB, offered a few words of reassurance. He said it's a brave new world for CFOs as they incorporate data over which they have no control into a unified structure. \nThe key will be teamwork, he added. \n\"For the CFOs, yes, you have ignored the procurement people for all these years,\" Reger said. \"Now you're going to have to work together.\" About the Author \nZach Noble is a staff writer covering cloud, big data and workforce issues.
