Designed for early learners aged 3-6, the new lessons include a range of fun online math games and activities that cover essential numeracy skills and concepts such as measuring lengths, elapsed time, vertical addition, rounding numbers, and multiplication word problems.\nThe popular online math program now includes 130 interactive math lessons. Each lesson features ten structured activities, fun songs, colorful animations, and collectible pets that children hatch and collect for rewards.\nThe Mathseeds program is developed by the same team of educational publishers behind the multi-award winning online reading program, Reading Eggs. The program is designed to teach children essential early math and problem solving skills to prepare them for their early years of school.\nMap 26 is set in the Galapagos Islands. Each Mathseeds map offers a different set of pet rewards, unique to their habitat, with previous map locations set in Canada, Madagascar, the Great Barrier Reef, and other virtual environments.\nAt the end of each map, children complete a multiple-choice quiz, and if they pass, they are awarded a printable certificate.\nParents can also access a dashboard to track their childâ€™s progress and download reports.\nMathseeds is compatible with PC, Mac, and iPad and Android devices.
