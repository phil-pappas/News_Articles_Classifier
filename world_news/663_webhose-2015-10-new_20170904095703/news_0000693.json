For today’s comparison, we are going to take a look at the Samsung Galaxy A8 which oozes class and premium a look and feel with the right amount of firepower to boot; and a pocket rocket with a tantalizing camera and the highest resolution that you can find in a smallish device. - Advertisement - \nWe all know how Samsung has positioned its A-series as their new lineup of premium metal series. In fact, it is the first time that Samsung has ventured into equipping their most recent flagship such as the Galaxy Note Edge and Galaxy Note 5 with the premium metal body. \nEver since Microsoft took over Nokia, things are beginning to turn around for them. And who hasn’t heard of the rave reviews that Windows 10 OS is getting, and it is about time a smartphone gets its own version. This is where the Lumia 950 will be the pioneer model to be getting it, once it gets released to the market next month. Seems like the tide is now turning slightly in the favor of Microsoft against the mighty Android and Apple. \nNow let’s start with the appearance first. The Galaxy A8 is actually the thinnest smartphone yet from Samsung. With a body measurement of just 158 x 76.8 x 5.9 mm (6.22 x 3.02 x 0.23 in) and weighing in at 151 g (5.33 oz), and further complemented by its all-metal design; it is definitely a stunner. Heads will turn when you brandish it in public. But it is most likely you have to operate with two hands, well unless you have a large enough hand that is. \nAs for the Lumia 950, it will be wrapped in a polycarbonate body which will make it look outstanding. With a body measurement of 145 x 73.2 x 8.2 mm (5.71 x 2.88 x 0.32 in) and weighs 150 g (5.29 oz), it sure is slim and lightweight. \nIn terms of look and feel, you can’t deny how good the Galaxy A8 looks. The fact that it is also very thin makes for a supermodel kind of excitement. It is like you are taking a huge celebrity out for a date. \nScreen-wise, the Galaxy A8 is sporting a 5.7-inch Full HD Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~386 ppi pixel density. Then there’s the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 which adds more protection to this phablet. \nWhereas, on the Lumia 950, it will be sporting a 5.2-inch Quad HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~564 ppi pixel density that simply is amazing. There’s also the ClearBlack display being used to ensure the best in terms of color reproduction. To round it all off, there’s the Gorilla Glass 3 for added protection. The screen is scratch-resistant and tough enough to let you relax and enjoy your time with the device. \nIf you are looking for and is comfortable with a huge screen device, then look no further than the Galaxy A8. But if you are looking for something smaller, then it does not get any better than the Lumia 950. \nTruth be told, the large metal body on the Galaxy A8 is great. But does it have the necessary hardware to boot? The answer is yes, as we can find it equipped with the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset paired with an octa-core with the combination of two, separate quad-core processors which is Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics and 2GB RAM to top it all off. There will be no issues whatsoever for you to run all the latest apps and games. Although at the same time, it would have been a little bit nicer with 3GB or 4GB RAM right? \nNo such worries on the performance of the Lumia 950 though, as there’s the latest Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset, a Hexa-core processor comprising of Dual-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57 & Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 418 graphics and 3GB of RAM. It sure does possess a lot of firepower and you can be assured of the best when it comes to performance. - Advertisement - \nAs for the camera department, the Galaxy A8 is sporting Samsung’s top-of-the-line 16 Megapixel primary camera which is currently being used in Galaxy S6/S6 Edge and Galaxy Note 5. How lucky it is for the Galaxy A8 to have such honor. Plus, it is also sporting a 5 Megapixel secondary camera which is being heavily touted by Samsung to be a great selfie device. \nCamera is one thing that most Lumia devices are great at. And on the Lumia 950, you can be assured of the highest quality with its 20 Megapixel primary camera that comes with Carl Zeiss optics and lets you take incredible pictures without having to adjust your settings. It automatically takes sharper images of fast-moving subjects and a triple LED natural flash helps create accurate lighting in darker environments. Rich Capture lets you quickly adjust the color saturation level of bright or dark areas and add or remove the flash afterwards. With higher resolution and a much improved fast-action capture, 4K video lets you preserve your precious memories in stunning quality. Then there’s the Optical Image Stabilization that comes with a virtually seamless auto focus, this combination will let you take super-sharp and silky-smooth videos. \nStorage-wise, you can find 16GB of internal storage plus an option to further expand to an additional 64GB via the microSD slot. Anytime you run out of space, pop it to your PC and transfer everything and start afresh. \nBy taking lots of high-res photos and 4K videos; you won’t find any issues on the Lumia 950. There should be enough storage capacity with it having 32GB of internal storage – to which you can further expand up to a maximum of a whopping 200GB via its microSD slot. Go ahead and take all the photos and videos to your heart’s content. \nIn terms of battery, the Galaxy A8 is powered by a non-removable Li-Ion 3050 mAh battery. Quite frankly, it should easily power up the device for at least a day. \nAs for the Lumia 950, it is set to have a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery supplying juice to it. This should also be sufficient enough for at least a day in between charging. But it does have the added benefit of fast charging and wireless charging that you can tap into. \nNow we’ve come to the final stretch and it is a toss-up between choosing Android or Microsoft OS. On the Galaxy A8, there’s the Android Lollipop 5.1 which is quite common these days. If it were to get an update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0, then it should be great and extends its life for a few more months. \nNow we come to the main selling point for the Lumia 950 which is the Windows 10 OS. With Android coming out with Marshmallow 6.0 and Apple with its iOS 9.0, it is about time that Microsoft has a weapon up its sleeve. It has released Windows 10 for the desktop version, and the Lumia 950 will be its first device to be equipped with its mobile version. \nSo what it great about Windows 10 then? Office apps and Outlook Mail have familiar rich editing tools that scale to fit the screen you’re using and the brand new Windows Store makes it easy to find apps, music, and videos. And with Cortana for Windows 10, you can use your PC to set a location-based reminder that will arrive just in time on your Lumia. \nConnect your Lumia 950 to a Microsoft Display Dock and use it with an external monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse. Office apps and Outlook scale up to create a big screen-optimized work environment that makes you more productive. It provides users with a PC-like experience that is powered by your phone. A quick and easy way to get the productivity benefits of a mouse and keyboard while leaving your laptop at work and relax knowing that you have a convenient way to get things done. \nFinally, there’s the Windows Hello Beta, which is an incredibly personal and secure way to unlock your Lumia 950. Simply wake up your device, look directly at the screen, and the infra-red camera technology automatically authenticates you. \nWe can only talk about it, and as the saying goes – seeing is believing. Let’s wait until its release before we can scrutinize it further. But as far as things stand at he moment, Windows 10 on mobile is set to be a great proposition. - Advertisement - \nWith the Samsung Galaxy A8, it is already elevating the Galaxy A series even higher. Coupled with the well-known reputation that Samsung has, it is selling like hot cakes. If you are looking for a device that has a huge screen, great hardware, great camera and an extremely hot body; then this is it for you. \nBut when you compare it against the Microsoft Lumia 950, it seems like a different playing field altogether. Things are already looking up with the impending release of Microsoft Lumia 950 next month. Excellent resolution, excellent camera and the even more excellent brand new Windows 10 OS accompanying it; you can be sure of a whole new level of experience in the smartphone industry. If that is still not able to convince you yet, then perhaps the 20MP Carl Zeiss camera would. Be prepared to take some of the best shots that a camera phone allows you to. \nThe Samsung Galaxy A8 is currently available for $499 USD. It is available in Pearl White, Midnight Black, and Champagne Gold. \nThe Microsoft Lumia 950 is expected to be released sometime in November 2015 for an estimated price of $549 USD. And for the first time in recent months, it will only be available in Black and White – no vibrant colors like the previous Lumia iterations that we are so used to.
