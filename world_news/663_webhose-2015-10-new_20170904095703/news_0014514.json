The Guzhen Lighting Fair is based on the enriched lighting industrial resources of the lighting capital. The Fair is oriented toward export, but also engaged in domestic sales. The Fair is a platform that gathers high-quality and new-style products with competitive price, focuses on the latest industrial trends of the lighting industry, and takes the innovative exhibition running mode of \"Exhibition Shop Linkages\" to build a large-scale, one-stop lighting, lamp procurement and trade platform with an exhibition area of 700,000 square meters to provide a lighting feast for the industry. The main venue (Lighting Capital Guzhen Convention and Exhibition Center) has an exhibition area of over 30,000 square meters, a stand area of 12,717 square meters, and 1,413 standard booths. Thanks to the great industrial base of Guzhen, in addition to the industrial resources from the organizer, China Association of Lighting Industry, the high-end exhibition platform and other various advantages have attracted many companies to join successive Fairs. With an annual output value of over a hundred billion RMB, Guzhen enjoys a huge industry cluster integrating both lamp production and trading, and has become one of the four largest lighting professional production bases and sales markets in the world. With a favorable market environment and relying on its own great lighting industrial resources, the Guzhen Lighting Fair integrates different resources once again, and has become oriented toward export while still engaged in the domestic market. It is worth mentioning that the Guzhen Lighting Fair is launching the brand-new 'Overseas buyers Business Matching Meeting' to optimize the effect of exhibiting, improve their trade volumes, and enrich the experience of the guests. The value of the Fair will be maximized by matching exhibitors with overseas buyers, arranging for meetings during the Fair, promoting one-on-one trade matches, and helping buyers and suppliers conclude transactions with quick and effective one-stop services!
