The company plans to build at least eight more, city documents show. Installers for Google Fiber confer while working, March 19, 2013, in northwest Kansas City, Kansas. (Keith Myers/Kansas City Star/MCT) \nGoogle spokesman A.T. McWilliams said installing the Fiber Huts is an important first step, but stopped short of confirming the expansion. \"We continue to make great progress working alongside city leaders, and hope to share an update soon,\" he said. \nThe expansion into San Jose, which comes after four years of courtship between Google and City Hall, would make San Jose one of the largest cities to offer the fiber-optic service, which promises faster internet with a connection of up to 1,000 megabits per second. Comcast's fastest Internet plan in San Jose reaches 250 megabits per second and AT&T offers 18. Google Fiber also boasts a TV service with more than 150 channels, encroaching on a Silicon Valley market dominated by by AT&T and Comcast.

San Diego and Irvine are the only two other California cities being considered for the service. \nAccording to the project proposal, Google plans to install 2,300 miles of fiber optic cables -- 1,340 miles below ground and 960 miles in the sky using existing utility poles. An environmental report released last week shows the construction of the huts have no adverse impact on the environment. Google will use existing roads, underground utility poles and water, gas, and electricity lines to design and build the new network, according to the analysis.

( (Chris O'Brien/staff)) \nResidents have 30 days to comment on the proposal before it goes to the Planning Commission in November for adoption, said city Planning Director Harry Freitas. The commission is expected to approve the two conditional use permits and Google will apply for more permits in several stages. \nCity Hall sources say an official announcement about Google Fiber's expansion into San Jose could come as early as late November or early December. \nGoogle is also in talks with city officials in Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and its home base of Mountain View about installing Fiber infrastructure. \n\"We are optimistic that there will be a decision soon and we look forward to an announcement from Google,\" said Sunnyvale spokeswoman Jennifer Garnett. \nIt's not clear if Google Fiber will initially roll out to all of San Jose or select neighborhoods that demand the service -- which Google calls \"fiberhoods.\" \nThe first \"Fiber Hut\" will be in Councilman Pierluigi Oliverio's district. He said District 6 residents have long demanded the fiber service. \n\"They think Google has panache or they think the competition will provide lower price opportunity,\" Oliverio said. \"I've heard comments about AT&T and Comcast not being very friendly because they're the only providers in town.\" \nBut just as Google Fiber expands its footprint into San Jose, other broadband providers are also rallying the city to provide fiber internet and TV. Councilman Johnny Khamis said AT&T is planning to bring GigaPower -- it's fiber-optic network -- to the city within the next few months. \n\"AT&T hasn't made that announcement yet, but they've approached me already,\" Khamis said. \"They know where Google Fiber is and they try to head them off at the pass.\" \nKhamis says he welcomes the competition and said it gives San Jose residents more choices -- including himself. \"I cant wait to get rid of the provider I have,\" he said. \"Competition should help the market become more customer-friendly.\" Follow Ramona Giwargis at Twitter.com/ramonagiwargis or contact her at 408-920-5705.
