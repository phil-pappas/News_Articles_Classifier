I have never been more angry or ashamed.\nWarren Cass, Toronto\nAs Canadians are pulled into a distracting and spiteful debate over the niqab, we have to ask if the attack on a pregnant Muslim woman wearing a hijab is the human cost of politicians resorting to “dog whistle” tactics and relying on the forces of petty bigotry to retain power (Quebec Legislature Pleads For Calm After Muslim Woman Attacked – Oct. 2).\nIf so, it reveals a morally bankrupt leadership. This should be cause for reflection within the ranks of the Conservative Party, and the Bloc Québécois. Once planted, the seeds of hatred yield a sour and uncontainable harvest.\nK.S. Hanna, Kelowna, B.C.\nWhy would Gilles Duceppe, of all people, be concerned about what anyone wears to a Canadian citizenship ceremony?\nReuel S. Amdur, Val-des-Monts, Que.\nNiqab election?\nCultural elitists, including The Globe and Mail’s editorialists, decry the lack of long-term vision being expressed during the current election campaign, yet paternalistically think they know more than the average Canadian and denounce the vast majority of Canadians who do have a long-term vision on at least one election issue: the niqab (From Campaign To Culture War – editorial, Oct. 2).\nInstinctively, Canadians know that long term, this matter flies in the face of dearly held Canadian values of openness and equality; if not checked in the bud, the issue will slowly but surely negatively change Canadian culture, values and the open society we so pride ourselves on experiencing today. The niqab is an affront to an “open and free” society.\nContrary to elitist rhetoric, it subjects women to second-class status – as is clearly acknow-ledged by those same elitists as they observe countries like Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan. Moreover, it is an affront to the people of this great nation for someone who wishes to join us, to demand that she be accommodated, rather than that she accommodate herself to the nation she wishes to join. It is time the elitists got on board with the average Canadian and quit with the sophistry and paternalistic attitude.\nJim Church, Kelowna, B.C.\nI want to commend The Globe for reminding Canadians that this election is about much more than what someone might wear to a citizenship ceremony. The media has been willing to countenance this farcical discussion for too long, so it is refreshing to read a thoughtful, principled reminder of what is at stake on Oct. 19.\nBut there is a larger issue here. Canada has long prided itself on its tolerance and has, unlike too many of its wealthy peers, largely managed to prevent xenophobia from creeping into its political discourse. This admirable record is now under threat in an election that has seen Muslims turned into political props exploited for cheap electoral points in contentious but poorly informed debates on Islamic State, refugees and, most recently, the niqab.\nThis is politics at its most cynical, deplorable and un-Canadian. It is an insult to our collective intelligence and sense of moral decency, and it is an affront to the millions of us who have questions about substantive issues that are not being addressed.\nIs it too much to ask that we have a thoughtful, reasoned discussion on the state of our country and where we are going as a nation? Or have we finally succumbed to irrationality and fear?\nGraeme Young, St. Catharines, Ont.\nYou are correct that the niqab is a distraction that should not be an issue in a national election. But the underlying issue is not just a distraction. It is a fundamental question of what kind of leaders we want for our country.\nDo Canadians really want a leader who appeals to crass emotions on divisive non-issues using misleading statements? Do we want to complain about the lack of ethics in our politicians, then reward such behaviour?\nMike Jensen, Calgary\nStripped citizenship\nRe Tories Bid To Strip Citizenship From Canadian-Born Terrorist (Oct. 2): The government’s new powers to strip citizenship from alleged terrorists scares me: no guaranteed right of appeal, no right to see the evidence the government has of your foreign citizenship, no right to even see the evidence the government has of the alleged crime. If an accused can’t appeal and can’t view the evidence against them, what is there to stop a government from accusing and deporting anybody?\nNothing?\nWayne Nickoli, London, Ont.\nAre you registered?\nLast week, I spoke to my brother who said he had to re-register to vote, despite the fact he has lived in the same residence for the past five years and voted in the last election from that address.\nI thought this was a little odd, that it likely wouldn’t happen to me. I’ve filed my tax return from that address (in which I expressly consented to the CRA sharing my information with Elections Canada); have a business number and GST number registered with the CRA from that address; my driver’s licence and registration are registered to that address; I voted in the last provincial election from that address. I began to wonder if I, like my brother, would have to reregister to vote. I checked Elections Canada online. Lo and behold, I wasn’t registered.\nGiven that the Canada Elections Act provides that “The Register of Electors shall be updated from (a) information ... (ii) that is held by a federal department or body and that electors have expressly authorized to be given to the Chief Electoral Officer …” and I had expressly authorized the CRA to share this information with Elections Canada, I am at a loss to understand why I wasn’t registered.\nIn my mind, the failure to effectively share information within government agencies is a most insidious form of voter suppression. Elections Canada and the government should be increasing access to democracy, not erecting arbitrary barriers which may prevent citizens from exercising their democratic rights.\nI urge any voter who hasn’t received a voter registration card to check Elections Canada online to ensure they are registered to vote, and register if they are not.\nPaul Emerson Reid, lawyer, Priddis, Alta.\nAbout that lineup\nStephen Harper has a weak lineup? Seriously? (Weak Conservative Lineup Reflection Of Harper’s Leadership – Oct. 2). The NDP had a bar manager vacationing in Vegas who became an MP.\nDev Randhawa, Kelowna, B.C.\n Topics: Conservative Party Comments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:00:23.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
