But it has long harbored hopes of building its own alternative operating system, which would give it more control over the software and services that consumers use on their devices.\nHowever, it has struggled to convince third-party developers to rebuild their applications for Tizen smartphones, given the nascent operating system's still-negligible market share.\nIn recent months, Samsung has continued to plow ahead with Tizen anyway, embedding it in more the company's products.\nIn addition to the Samsung Z1 and Z3 smartphones, Samsung--the world's largest seller of televisions--said earlier this year that every one of its TVs would soon run Tizen, giving the operating system a boost thanks to Samsung's roughly one-third share of the global TV market.\nAnd in September, Samsung unveiled the Gear S2 smartwatch, the latest in a string of wrist-mounted devices powered by Tizen.\nBut the biggest test for Samsung will come in the competitive smartphone market, where other aspiring smartphone platform builders like Microsoft Corp. and BlackBerry Ltd. have stumbled.\nPart of the challenge for Samsung so far is that its Tizen smartphones now occupy the lowest end of the market. The first model, the Samsung Z1, is priced at less than $100 and aimed at first-time smartphone users.\nIn contrast, the new Samsung Z3 smartphone offers what the company calls \"an upgraded user experience,\" with a 5-inch high-definition resolution display and an 8-megapixel camera--specifications that aren't a far cry from some of its midrange offerings in developed markets.\nThe phone is called the Samsung Z3 because it offers \"a significant jump from the earlier Samsung Z1 in terms of specifications,\" according to Asim Warsi, a vice president for Samsung's India mobile business.\nThe new device will go on sale on Oct. 21 for 8,490 Indian rupees, or about $130, Samsung said.\nThe company said the phone was \"designed specifically for the Indian market,\" and didn't disclose plans to sell it in other countries. After the Samsung Z1's launch in India in January, sales of the phone were extended to neighboring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.\nWrite to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 06:12 ET (10:12 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:42:05.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
