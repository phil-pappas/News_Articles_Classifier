They are not just thinking about backend works and inventory anymore, but also realise the importance of design.\"Jain believes that design's role is in solving the user's problem and in inspiring the customer to buy something not thought about before. He observes that the demand is mostly coming from smaller companies. \"The big players have a very data-centric approach, which means that they are making design decisions based on data. Smaller ones are taking design more seri ously during this festive season, because they need to position themselves unique among the others,\" said Jain.Nevertheless, he has also been approached by the likes of YepMe, Koovs and Nykaa to spruce up their looks for the season. While Jain quips that he is finding it almost impossible to find designers this festive season, Aashish Solanki, founder and CEO of NetBramha, estimates a three-fold increase in traffic and engagement. \"There is scope for adding a lot of specific features in the app-design during festive seasons,\" Solanki said.\"Scheduling the delivery is going to be interesting. Delivery and gifting on the day of the festival and those sort of personalisations via the app are being included in the design aspects.\" According to Solanki, returns is going to be a challenging area where design and analytics would need to work hand-in-hand. \"Tonnes of brainstorming is happening with designers giving about 100-200 ideas and accordingly they (online companies) have to work with their back-end and logistics,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:26:03.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
