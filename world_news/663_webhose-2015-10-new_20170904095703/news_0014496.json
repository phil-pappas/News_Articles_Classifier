Building on our recent work on optical manipulation in hollow-core photonic crystal fibre, this project focuses on nanoscale waveguides and particles. The aim is to provide a deeper understanding of the interplay of optical forces, fluidic flow, and heat-transport in these systems, and to transfer this knowledge to advanced applications. In related experiments, you will develop novel optofluidic reactor concepts that will have a major impact on the studies of photo-catalytic systems and novel light-activatable anticancer drugs. \nCandidates will hold a strong physics or related PhD or be close to obtaining a PhD, with experience in optical trapping, spatial light modulation/holographic beam shaping, or nanoparticle spectroscopy. \nIn addition to proven experimental skills the candidate should ideally have experience in working across disciplinary boundaries. They should expect to be involved in both construction of new optical trapping- and spectroscopy rigs using lasers as well as a variety of chemical sample preparations. Experience in the field of photonic crystal fibre or fibre optics in general would be helpful, as well as with microfluidic technology. \nThe Cambridge NanoPhotonics Centre ( http://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk ), consisting of the groups of Prof Jeremy Baumberg and Dr Tijmen Euser, collaborates widely across the University of Cambridge including the Departments of Chemistry, Engineering, Physics of Medicine, Cancer Research UK, Chemical Engineering, Materials as well as many international partners, industry, and with several major EU programmes. The group of Dr Euser brings in strong expertise in waveguide-based optical trapping and photochemistry and synergies with a wide variety of researchers across the University of Cambridge.
