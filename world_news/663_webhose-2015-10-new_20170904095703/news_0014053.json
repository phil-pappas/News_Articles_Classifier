The ultra-compact GigaMux 3300 system is the latest addition to the GigaMux portfolio of products. The Sorrento Networks GigaMux 3300 solution is unique in both its low cost of deployment and compact footprint compared to other available offerings.\nThe increased bandwidth of this solution enables optical transport across metro edge and core topologies of native 100G client traffic, or the flexibility to multiplex up to ten 10G or two 40G client sources to a single 100G line. This boosts the bandwidth capacity of current fiber plants significantly, enabling operators to maximize their fiber utilization before investing in expensive additional plant. The alternative would be to lay or rent new fibers or purchase standard Ethernet services.\n“The new normal is rapidly becoming the 100G speed for bandwidth services, and the GigaMux 3300 offers an easy and cost-effective path for service providers to achieve this,” comments John Mitchell, Director of Product Management at Sorrento Networks. “We see many of our customers eager to deploy such speeds, but are hampered by the challenges of laying or renting new fiber. This offers a fast and cost-effective solution and represents a significant enhancement to the Sorrento Networks GigaMux product portfolio.”\nThe innovative optics engine of the GigaMux 3300 100G solution lowers the cost threshold for smart coherent technology in the metro domain. Fiber spans of up to 1500km are supported, without regeneration, in addition to offering simplified network design with electronic dispersion compensation and operation over low quality fiber plant. Up to 80 100G channels can be supported per fiber using GigaMux 3000 and GigaMux 3200 photonic filters.\nSorrento Networks is demonstrating the GigaMux 3300 at Broadband World Forum, London at booth D11.\nThe GigaMux 3300 adds to the existing portfolio of products – GigaMux 3000, 3100 and 3200 – extending the offer of right-sized solutions per application. The GigaMux 3300 allows current users of the Sorrento Networks GigaMux 3200 to multiplex existing 10G services to 100G, freeing wavelengths channels for future use. In addition, the coherent nature of the GigaMux 3300 100G line signal enables 100G traffic to ride seamlessly over spare channels in existing GigaMux 3200 fiber infrastructure without further plant re-engineering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:55:46.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
