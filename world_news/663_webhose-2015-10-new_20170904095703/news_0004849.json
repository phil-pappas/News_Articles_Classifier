To grip something, it has to understand what it is gripping, what is the weight of the object it is gripping and how much force it should apply to not to break it or drop it. One starts admiring the dexterity God has provided us with, when one tries to imitate and incorporate it in robots. Very recently at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Bianca Homberg, Daniela Rus (the director of MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) and their colleagues showed the latest advance in robotic digits. The robots that they have developed have modular fingers made of silicone and embedded with sensors. These fingers are dexterous enough to pick up everything from soft toys to single pieces of paper without needing to be programmed to understand what it’s gripping. It is to be noted that MIT has done a lot of work in making robotic hands this year and Daniela Rus is actually a sort of pioneer in soft robotics. In the latest design of robots, three molded silicone fingers, ribbed on the inside edge to ease bending and increase friction, are slid over the digits of a robotic arm. While robotic hands generally use a sensor nearby, like a camera or a motion sensor Russ embedded a bending sensor in each finger. When each finger’s sensor bends and sends a signal that it’s touching an object, it knows to stop tightening its grasp.
