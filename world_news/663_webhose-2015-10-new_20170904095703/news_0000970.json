It said the quarter was exceptional and warned the fourth quarter would be lower.\nThe company's shares rose 1.2 percent in early trade.\nBelow are comments from Chief Financial Officer Espen Gundersen:\nSEES WEAKER Q4\n\"In collection, everything is about Germany, where we have significant replacement orders. Please bare in mind that third quarter was exceptional, so both revenues and EBITA will be significantly down in Q4.\n\"I won't say how much weaker. But we want to send a message that the third quarter was exceptional. Don't put those figures in your spreadsheets.\"\nTAKING MARKET SHARE IN GERMANY\n\"We are benefiting from our state of the art technology (the T9 bottle recycling machine). German retailers are the most sophisticated we have.\n\"We are a little bit more optimistic than half a year ago.\" (Reporting by Ole Petter Skonnord, editing by Terje Solsvik)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:10:51.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
