October 20, 2015 \nNashville, Tenn. — PCT, Syngenta and industry colleagues took time out of their PestWorld schedules to recognize the 2015 Crown Leadership Award winners during a special ceremony on Wednesday night. The awards spotlight individuals who have contributed positively to the growth and development of the structural pest control industry, as well as established ties with fellow business leaders, civic groups and customers in their local communities. This is the 27th consecutive year in which Syngenta has partnered with PCT for the awards. “Before we begin tonight, I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank all of you for your support of the Crown Leadership Awards. When we launched this program approximately a quarter century ago in a modest hotel suite at a National Pest Control Association Convention in Seattle it was a very different world,” said PCT Publisher Dan Moreland. “To provide some perspective on just how long ago that was, according to the Beloit College’s ‘Mindset List’ that provides a look at the cultural touchstones that shapes the lives of America’s college students, 1989 was the year the Internet was about to transform all of our lives, as well as the year Jeff Bezos launched Amazon, which is now the world’s largest retailer with annual revenues in excess of $89 billion and employing 183,000 people.” The 2015 Crown Leadership Award winners are: • Jennifer Leggett, Lindsey Pest Services • Ron Harrison, Rollins Inc. • Dr. Ed Vargo, Texas A&M University • Chris McCloud, McCloud Services View photos of the event from Syngenta’s Twitter feed here . \nIf you know of a member of the pest control industry you would like to nominate for next year’s awards email dmoreland@gie.net.
