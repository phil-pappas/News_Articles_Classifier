San Francisco-based Lyft, which currently operates in more than 150 U.S. cities, has one of the leading smartphone applications that connects drivers with passengers in need of a ride. Lyft is known for making transportation a more welcoming, memorable, and enjoyable experience backed by a culture of treating its drivers better. \nStarting in select markets later this year, Lyft drivers will earn cents-per-gallon rewards that can be redeemed at Shell simply by enrolling in the Fuel Rewards program. Discounts will grow based on the number of rides drivers give every week, so the more they drive, the more they’ll save. After joining, Lyft drivers will have additional ways to earn fuel savings, which can also be redeemed at participating Shell stations. \n“Driver support is a key differentiator for Lyft. We're excited to provide their drivers with ways to save money on a significant business expense - fuel - every day,” said Brandon Logsdon, President and CEO of the Fuel Rewards program. “Fuel Rewards already helps millions of U.S. consumers save on the cost of fuel and now, we’re happy to welcome Lyft drivers to our national partner loyalty program.” \nThe financial value to Lyft drivers is clear: Not only have fuel discounts been ranked as the most-valued loyalty reward by a recent nationwide Excentus/Ipsos eNation survey, but fuel can become a very costly expense in ride-share driver operations, with millions of gallons consumed monthly across the Lyft driver network. Through the partnership, Lyft drivers can drive down the cost of their fuel expenses, while enjoying the high quality and premium fuels offered at over 12,500 participating Shell stations across the country. \n“We’re introducing an exclusive, first-of-its-kind partnership with Fuel Rewards that will drastically decrease the amount of money Lyft drivers pay for fuel at participating Shell stations – where top drivers could position themselves to earn several free tanks per week,” said David Rust, head of operations strategy at Lyft. “We look forward to piloting this in a few markets over the coming months, and expect to have a national rollout to cover 12,500 Shell stations across America early next year.” \nThe Fuel Rewards program, with over six million members, is a national loyalty program comprised of merchant partners across multiple categories that rewards members with coveted savings on the cost of fuel, through their everyday purchases made at thousands of participating retailers across the country. \nFor more information about the Fuel Rewards program, the Lyft partnership, or to arrange an interview with company executives, please contact Vanessa Horwell at vhorwell@thinkinkpr.com (305.749.5342, x232) or Patricia Nunez at pnunez@thinkinkpr.com (305.749.5342, x233). \nAbout the Fuel Rewards program, owned and operated by Excentus \nThe Fuel Rewards ® program is a coalition loyalty program that helps national and regional retailers and brands achieve greater success by offering their consumers a coveted, frequently used and universal loyalty currency in the form of cents-off-per-gallon fuel savings at the pump. Constantly innovating and adapting to support mobile environment, the Fuel Rewards program helps participating retailers and brands attract new customers, boost sales, and increase levels of spending and satisfaction among existing customers. Consumers are able to earn Fuel Rewards savings from everyday purchases and redeem them at participating Shell stations nationwide. The Fuel Rewards program is owned by Dallas-based Excentus, which has helped more than 10 million consumers save hundreds of millions of dollars on fuel since its founding in 2006.
