In addition to FIU, the team is led by faculty from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and also includes faculty from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Carnegie Mellon University, and Lehigh University. Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation will serve as an industry partner. \nAt FIU, Mohammed's four co-investigators from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering are Kemal Akkaya, Arif Selcuk Uluagac, Arif Sarwat and Alexander Perez Pons. \nIn the first half of Fiscal Year 2015, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), part of the Department of Homeland Security, responded to 108 cyber incidents impacting critical infrastructure in the United States. As in previous years, the energy sector led all others with the most reported incidents. The National Security Agency also reported that it has seen intrusions into industrial control systems used in the electrical grid by entities with the apparent technical capability \"to take down control systems that operate U.S. power grids,\" according to the \"Cybersecurity Issues for the Bulk Power System\" congressional report. \nThe center's researchers will address vulnerabilities and challenges in delivery systems of the U.S. power grid. Their goal is to protect hardware assets, make systems less susceptible to cyber attack and provide reliable delivery of power if such an attack were to occur. \nThe FIU team will be involved in aspects of the project that include protection of core power grid controls and operations by building security and privacy protection into components and services that include micro-grid assets, smart metering and electric vehicles; protecting the communications infrastructure and providing security management capabilities to address operations beyond human capacity; and providing security testing and validation to evaluate the effectiveness of protective measures on the FIU Energy Systems Research Laboratory's Smart Grid Test Bed in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering within the College of Engineering and Computing. \nFor a picture, please click here . \nMedia Contact:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:20:07.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
