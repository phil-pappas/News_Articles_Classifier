It is aimed at improving grid reliability, lowering costs and encouraging clean energy. \nThe rule remains in effect while the case continues. \nThe nine-member court could be divided 4-4, with conservative Justice Samuel Alito recusing himself from the case. An even split would uphold the lower-court ruling. \nConservative Chief Justice John Roberts said he was concerned about the federal government exercising too much authority over retail electricity markets, traditionally overseen by states. \n\"You have to have some sort of limiting principle, otherwise FERC can do whatever it wants,\" Roberts said. \nJustice Anthony Kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote in close decisions, asked questions indicating he could favor a narrower ruling against the government that would allow FERC to rewrite the regulation rather than ruling that FERC has no authority to issue one. \nThe court's liberal justices were more supportive of FERC. \nJustice Elena Kagan said it would be an \"odd result\" if the court does not allow the agency to regulate on the issue because Congress made clear in the 2005 Energy Policy Act that \"it wanted FERC to lower barriers to demand response.\" \nThe Electric Power Supply Association, PPL Corp and other trade groups that challenged the regulation would lose out if the regulation is upheld because it is likely to reduce demand for electricity generation. \nThe Electric Power Supply Association's members include Exelon Corp and Dynegy Inc. Utility group Edison Electric Institute, which represents such companies as Entergy Corp and Southern Company, also challenged the rule. \nSome utilities and companies that support the regulation backed the government's appeal. \nA ruling is due by the end of June.
