The big things are around really innovative ­reforms in how we deliver infrastructure and major services so we are looking seriously at things like 3D printing.”\nHe said 3D printing of infrastructure components was producing “stunning” ­results across the world, with bridges in Europe being constructed in weeks and 40-storey buildings being built in China in a month.\nAlready, councils were achieving hundreds of millions of dollars in savings by putting data storage in the cloud and signing up for centralised shared services in areas such as customer contact, debt collection and ­insurance. Councils were also using drones and satellite technology to efficiently monitor wild ­ani­mal populations and capacity of dumps.\nWinton council in the state’s central west is about to launch its own geothermal power station, which it expected would save it $1 million a year.\nMr Hallam said the federal government had frozen financial assistance grants and successive state governments had slashed capital works subsidies for water and sewerage, capped infrastructure charges, and reduced profits from water charges that were subsidising other services.\n“Really tectonic movements have been occurring — changes in the nature of rural communities, particularly in remote ­places,” he said.\n“There’s a romantic view about the bush but it’s actually owned by some of the biggest Australian and international interests. The bottom 10 to 15 councils in Queensland would only raise 5 to 10 per cent of their own revenue.’’\nAssociation president Margaret de Wit told the conference satisfaction with council performance, based on the latest ­association survey, was 71 per cent, the highest in 10 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:29:46.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
