The company has 6.3 million subscribers who can listen to a catalogue of 35 million songs for 9.99 euros a month.\nThe company set a price target for the initial public offering of between 36.40 euros and 49.24 euros, and said it plans to sell 8.242 million new shares.\nDeezer said it expected net proceeds of about 291 million euros, based on the low end of the IPO price range. An over-allotment option to increase the number of shares sold by 15 percent could bring additional gross proceeds of 45 million.\nDeezer's largest shareholder with 27 percent is tycoon Len Blavatnik's Access Industries, while Orange owns 11 percent. Three music labels, Warner Music, Sony Music and Universal Music, part of Vivendi, together own close to 15 percent of the shares.\nAnalysts have put a potential stock market value of about 1 billion euros on the company.\nBNP Paribas and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the IPO. Citigroup and Societe Generale are acting as joint bookrunners.
