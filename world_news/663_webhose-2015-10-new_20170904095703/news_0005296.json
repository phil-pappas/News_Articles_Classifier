Photo: Samsung\nFollowing up from the Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo, Gear Fit, Gear Live and Gear S, the Gear S2 is actually a wearable duo: the S2 and the S2 Classic, though to Quote: Highlander, \"there can only be one\".\nAdvertisement The S2 Classic is a 40mm watch with a black gloss finish, a ceramic bezel, and a replaceable leather strap. There are eight watch bands to choose from, sold separately.\nThe S2 Standard is 11.4 mm thin and 42mm wide. The straps are available in Silver or Dark Grey. The catch: It's only compatible with special Samsung straps.\nTech specs Both smartwatches come pre-loaded with 15 watch faces and sport a 302 pixels per inch (ppi) resolution screen, a 1 GHz dual core processor, and run Tizen OS.\nSamsung claims the S2 can go two-to-three days without charging in its special wireless cradle. They boast 512 MB of RAM and 4GB of internal memory, 1.9GB of which is user accessible.\nThey also features a power saving mode, an IP68 certified privacy lock, an accelerometer, gyroscope sensor, heart rate sensor, barometer, and are dust and water resistant.\nThe watches are compatible with Android devices running 4.4 (KitKat) and above, with a minimum of 1.5GB RAM. Both models are Wi-Fi compatible, and offer NFC and Bluetooth 4.0. A 3G compatible version is expected at some point in the near future.\nApps The wearables feature apps which include Schedule, S Voice, Voice Memo, News, Maps & Navigation, Find My Device, Weather Media, and Music Player.\nBoth the Classic and the Standard feature rotating bezels which are used to navigate through menus and apps (left for notifications, and right for apps and widgets), a click action for feedback, two buttons, and a touch screen.\nAn Apple Watch competitor The S2 will certainly give its Android competitors a run for its money. In terms of navigation, the S2 also has the potential to compete with the Apple Watch. It's designed to cut down on the clicks, twists or swipes it takes to get to a particular app or function.\nUnlike the Apple Watch, whose Crown supports vertical scrolling, the S2 is designed for horizontal and vertical scrolling.\nThe Apple Watch requires users to swipe upwards to access the glances menu and then swipe left or right for information access, a step more than the Gear S2's navigation.\nThe top button works as a back control and returns users to the last screen they were viewing. Whereas on the Apple Watch the Crown button takes users back to the watch screen and from there they can navigate to their app or feature of choice. Pressing the home button on the watch face will also take users back to the app hub.\nThe S2 standard retails at $499 while the S2 Classic is $100 more expensive at $599. The Watch bands range from $59 to $89\nThe S2 is available from the Samsung Experience Store or the eStore from Wednesday and will be available at major retailers from November, just in time for Christmas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:19:47.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
