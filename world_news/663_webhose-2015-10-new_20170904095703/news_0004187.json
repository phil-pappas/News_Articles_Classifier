This is spurring adoption rate at a clinical and ambulatory level. \n- The POCT market for cardiac biomarkers is spurring the growth in this region.- With the implementation of Affordable Care Act (ACA), there is a shift toward value-based care. This is increasing pressure on manufacturers to produce more cost efficient and efficient devices for consumers, especially in the hospital sector.- Manufacturers are seeing the value of integrated and wholesome platform solutions in this emerging value-based system. - Device companies like Medtronic are entering the cardiac space to provide telehealth solutions to patients. Siemens and Roche have a unique advantage due to their strong affiliation with their medical devices and pharmaceutical wings, respectively. - Companies with different diagnostic wings have a unique advantage, as they can offer a more integrated solution to diagnose a patient. \n- Still in the early stages, the cardiovascular segment has tremendous potential for personalized medicine. There is a movement toward this space similar to other fields, like oncology. - In the future, heart failure therapy is going to utilize a combination of multiple markers for risk assessment and diagnosis. Many of these biomarker tests are going to combine into a panel test rather than compete individually.- Products with a narrow therapeutic index, which can be dangerous either over- or underdosing, have a higher profitability capacity to develop companion diagnostic tests to determine sensitivity to the product. - Companion diagnostics is a major opportunity for manufacturers as cardiovascular disease holds only % of the overall companion diagnostics market space.- Integrating digital apps enables manufacturers to understand consumer behavior but also provide differentiated products compared to competitors. \n- Manufacturers can begin to offer consultations and services for biomarker testing and not be exclusive to providing lab solutions.Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03327250-summary/view-report.html About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
