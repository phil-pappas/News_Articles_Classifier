The ASAP program is designed to standardize data exchanges between alarm monitoring companies and public safety answering points (PSAP), which can include emergency numbers for police, fire, ambulance, etc. \nThe ASAP program enables the automated transmission of initial alarm event notification by the Diebold Monitoring Center to the local PSAP, event status updates from the PSAP to Diebold, and additional bi-directional updates and communications between the two. \n“With ASAP, priority alarm signals are processed within seconds, not minutes, ensuring that complete and accurate information is transmitted from the Diebold Monitoring Center to the PSAP every time,” said Damon Kanzler, Diebold electronic security, vice president, centralized services and business processes. “This time savings will improve dispatching services for Diebold customers while reducing the volume of time-consuming alarm calls to local PSAPs and increase our dispatcher productivity.” \nAn emerging, next generation protocol, ASAP is currently available in 11 U.S. cities/counties with five others in testing and more on the way. Diebold is integrating ASAP into its central station operations beginning with Richmond and Henrico County, Virginia in September, 2015. \"We are excited to have Diebold now transmitting alarm activity through the network and look forward to their expansion into additional cities,\" said CSAA President Pamela J. Petrow. \nAbout Diebold Diebold provides the technology, software and services that connect people around the world with their money - bridging the physical and digital worlds of cash conveniently, securely and efficiently.
