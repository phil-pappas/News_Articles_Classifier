The session will take place October 26 from 4:45 pm to 5:30 pm at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in Salon 12/13.\nSession Abstract:\nWith several proof-of-concepts and a few early network function virtualization (NFV) deployments, NFV experts know what is working, what needs to be done, and the roadblocks preventing the full rollout of NFV. This panel of industry leaders from across the NFV ecosystem will share their perspectives from successful NFV deployments—what has worked and what areas need to be fixed— and how to best utilize Oracle’s products to deliver significant new revenue. Hear about the obstacles—technical as well as political—that had to be overcome, and the results that have been achieved.\nIn addition to the session participation, Dialogic’s PowerMedia XMS software media server will play an important role in the demonstration of Oracle Communications Evolved Communications Application Server at the communications pavilion. The live demonstration will show an anonymous caller screening application, made possible by the media recording and playback features of PowerMedia XMS. The demonstration will be available in the Marriott Marquis second floor atrium during exhibit hours on Monday, October 26 through Wednesday, October 28.\n“We see great opportunities in NFV and technical alignment with Oracle Communications Application Orchestrator,” said Jim Machi, Senior VP Product Management and Marketing at Dialogic. “Dialogic PowerMedia XMS enables a host of new valuable, revenue-generating applications to communications service providers because of its ability to scale media resources in an NFV environment.”\nDialogic’s PowerMedia XMS is a highly scalable, software-only media server that enables standards-based, real-time multimedia communications solutions for IMS, MRF, Enterprise, and WebRTC applications on premise or in the cloud.
