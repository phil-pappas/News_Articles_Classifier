Established in 1972, Nectar revolutionised the bulk handling industry in the 1980s by developing ports around the world when it invented and launched the world’s first mobile bagging system.\nMore recently, Nectar has developed its strategy towards the management, operation and maintenance of terminals, starting in 2011 with the Beira Coal Terminal in Mozambique.\nIn operating the coal terminal, Nectar is responsible for all of the activities within the terminal from the unloading of coal from the trains up to loading of the vessels, including maintenance of all terminal equipment.\nThe terminal has a design throughput capacity of 5 million tonnes per year and has a vessel loading capacity of 2,400 metric tons per hour.\nNectar chose DBIS to provide their terminal management system for Beira and the organisations have worked closely together on various initiatives until 2015 when Nectar was awarded two major projects; firstly a ten year concession to operate the Freetown Terminal in Sierra Leone and then a joint venture between Seasia Logistics Philippines Inc. and Nectar to construct a US$18.5 million terminal in Bataan, Philippines.\nNectar will operate each terminal with a local management team but at the same time allow the central management to interact with the terminals to monitor the performance of the operations from both a process and a financial perspective.\nFor this to work effectively, Nectar needed consistency in the local operational practices and the capability to access real time information remotely. To facilitate this Nectar has followed up their decision at the Beira terminal and implemented the CommTrac terminal management system from DBIS.\nIn 2015, DBIS released CommTrac V4, a totally new release of the CommTrac software created using a web user interface, which is perfectly suited to the requirements for remote access required by Nectar.\nCommTrac V4 has also been created to meet the needs of break bulk and general cargo terminals as well as DBIS’ traditional customers in the bulk sector. This additional functionality provides Nectar with the perfect platform to develop their terminal business in whichever direction the market requires.\nTo keep human resources to a minimum Nectar will use a single system administrator based in the UK to manage master data and commercial terms within the systems, training of local teams will also be performed by Nectar’s own super users.\nTo deliver the software to the terminals in a quick and simple way the decision was made to construct containerised offices, which use modified shipping containers as administrative offices and server rooms, interconnected using Wi-Fi. This allowed the systems to be connected to weighbridges and fully tested in the UK prior to shipping by standard container liner service to the destination country where they could be set down, powered up and put into operation, quickly and easily.\nFor more information on DBIS, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:38:34.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
