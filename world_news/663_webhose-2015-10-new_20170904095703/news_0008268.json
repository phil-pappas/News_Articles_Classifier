Charles Dance -- who played Tywin Lannister on \"Game of Thrones\" -- is Mr. Bennet, patriarch of the family.\nThere's plenty of slashing, punching, choking, shooting, blood spurting and blowing stuff up, so don't worry about being bored with a typical Regency romance.\nEven the Bennet father reminds his daughters' suitors at dinner that a woman's place is not at the hearth but at the head of an army. \"My daughters are trained for battle, sir, not the kitchen.\"\nWatch the Bennet sisters in action with this new full-length trailer of \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\" The movie is due to hit theaters on February 5, 2016.", "external_links": ["http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/09/5e991c4b-5a9e-4e1d-bca8-1772c9b4b65d/resize/570xauto/0e1e212cb6955f996f8187afdd4165c1/zombies3.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/syjfmdvLu9c", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374989", "https://youtu.be/syjfmdvLu9c"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:06:00.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
