Their unwavering support of our talent fosters a fearless creative environment that allows artists to create their best work.” Balian will continue to oversee the strategic development and production of original limited series. She developed FX Networks’ first limited series, Fargo, and developed the new limited series American Crime Story, whose first instalment, American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson, will premiere soon. \nClemens will continue to oversee the strategic development of new drama and comedy series. Clemens developed the dramas The Strain, Tyrant and the new drama series The Bastard Executioner from Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter, as well as the comedies You’re the Worst, Man Seeking Woman, Married and Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll. Frank oversees all facets of day-to-day production for the entire slate of FX Networks’ original programming, including the dramas the Bastard Executioner, The Americans, Tyrant and The Strain, and the anthology series American Horror Story. In addition, he supervises the production of the FX Networks’ comedy series It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Archer, Louie, The League, Married, You’re the Worst, Man Seeking Woman, Sex&Drugs&Rock&Roll and Baskets, as well as the upcoming Better Things and Atlanta. \nThese are the latest promotions for the network; in July, FX Networks promoted five senior executives within its marketing, digital media and on-air teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:37:14.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
