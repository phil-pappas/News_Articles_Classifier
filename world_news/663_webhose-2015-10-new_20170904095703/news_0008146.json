Allies and enemies have learned the value of networking, whether it's to coordinate campaigns or recruit followers. Technology offers many benefits, but only when systems can talk to each other--a formidable challenge with today's rapid advances in social media, commercial technologies and the Internet of Things. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130410/DC92618LOGO \nRepresentatives from the military, government and academia will be networking in person at MILCOM 2015 October 25-28 at the Tampa Convention Center in Florida. Lt. Gen. Mark S. Bowman, USA, director, command, control, communications and computers/cyber, J-6, the Joint Staff, will kick off the event by sharing the Joint Staff's perspective on the event's theme: \"Leveraging Technology--The Joint Imperative.\" \nMILCOM has long been considered the premier international conference for military communications and communicators. In addition to speakers and panels, it features a technical program in which dozens of experts present their professional papers and also participate in panels and tutorials. Topics range from cellular networks to system performance to active authentication and behavioral biometrics. \nIn the restricted-access technical program, subject matter experts present research about U.S. government programs that is not available to the general public. Attendees of this program must have an active U.S. security clearance that can be verified via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) and must preregister for MILCOM to attend this program. Information about the clearance verification is provided during the preregistration process. The deadline to register for the restricted-access program is October 19. \nAFCEA International and IEEE are co-sponsoring the 34th annual MILCOM conference. More than 30 of the event's sessions have been designed to support certifications related to U.S. federal cybersecurity requirements. In addition, over 150 companies will demonstrate their technical solutions in the exhibition section. \nRegister to attend MILCOM 2015 online .
