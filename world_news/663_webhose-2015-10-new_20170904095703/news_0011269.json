The company’s inclusion on the INC 5000 list is based on a three-year growth rate of 46%. The workforce solutions company reported $34.4 million in revenue through increased head count with the company’s largest clients while expanding its portfolio growth in midsize and small companies. Additionally, the company’s leadership team - Michael Kasmir, Daniel Wolford, and Alan Slate - brings over 50 years of combined industry and executive experience, which has allowed the company to maintain a competitive edge by maintaining a well-established network of the best and brightest emerging talent in the technology and science industries. Kaztronix has offices in McLean, Virginia and Iselin, New Jersey but “through its applicant tracking and web-based time capture systems,” says co-founder Daniel Wolford, “the company has leveraged their technological capacity to service clients remotely throughout the entire United States.” To date, Kaztronix has serviced clients in 37 states, including several multinational brands. “Although our brick and mortar offices are on the East Coast, the company has serviced a national client base from day one,” says co-founder Michael Kasmir. “Wherever we operate, our mission continues to be focused on providing clients, candidates and team members with the opportunity for growth and a promising future.
