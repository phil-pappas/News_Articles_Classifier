Thailand-based agency, WPP Team P&G ASEAN, has secured the 'Best Campaign By Country' Award with their \"Invisible Wives\" digital video for P&G's Downy brand. The campaign also brought home to Thailand the Silver Dragon in the Best Innovative Idea category and a Black Dragon in the Best Digital Campaign Category. The 'Dragons of Asia' awards event took place in Kuala Lumpur on September 30th. WPP Team P&G ASEAN devised the creative \"Invisible Wives\" campaign to launch Downy's brand new 'scent-switching' proposition to the fabric enhancer market. The Agency told the Downy Scent Switcher story through a Social Experiment Video which explored whether couples take each other's presence for granted after they have been together a while. Wives switched places with look-a-likes and it was only when they used Downy Parfum’s Scent Switcher that their husbands noticed. Catching the attention of the PMAA judges, the video is fun and disruptive and shows the power of smell amongst our senses, highlighting Downy's benefit. WPP Team P&G's Creative Director, Sunny Ng, developed the award-winning 'Invisible Wives' campaign supported by Account Director, Nattawut Seethi. The campaign was designed for the Indonesian market, yet proved so successful it went on to be reapplied in Singapore and Philippines. WPP Team P&G ASEAN Managing Director, Joy Degollado, comments, \"These awards are testimony to our agency's commitment to be P&G ASEAN's partner in breakthrough ideas that connect with consumers and build business. It was a tough journey as it truly was a cut-through idea, but our clients gave us the confidence and support to make it happen.\" This is the inaugural year of the Blue Dragon Award, which is awarded to the highest scoring campaign from an agency in each country. \"This year heralds the launch of Asia's first Marketing Communications Industry Performance Ranking Ladder for the Malaysian and Asian Marketing Industry. Apart from being the top ranking Thai Agency, WPP Team P&G ASEAN takes up 11thposition on the inaugural Asian Ranking Ladder\", Mike Da Silva, Director, PMAA Dragons of Asia. A number of the 185 Judges this year reported that the Campaigns they judged, showed a strong execution of marketing disciplines (up 45%) and a strong focus on results, than in previous years. \"The rapid emergence of social media and the almost universal access to mobile has changed the game for markets. Despite the speed of these changes, this year's Dragons of Asia entrants demonstrated an excellent understanding of both the most effective messages and the appropriate use of media. I was stunned with the depth of thinking that is now apparent in promotional marketing which, if this year's winners are any indication, will surpass other marketing communications disciplines in driving effectiveness for marketing investment.\" Rob Langtry. Judge and Global Chief Strategy & Marketing Officer, The Woolmark Company. 206 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:17:52.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
