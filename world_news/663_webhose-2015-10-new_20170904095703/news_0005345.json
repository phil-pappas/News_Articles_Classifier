The authors include more than 150 New Horizons project and NASA personnel; Principal Investigator Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) is first author. This high-resolution image captured by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto’s surface shows a remarkable range of subtle colors, digitally enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. The bright expanse is the western lobe of the “heart,” informally known as Tombaugh Regio. The lobe, informally called Sputnik Planum, has been found to be rich in nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices. Pluto’s diameter is 1,473 miles (2,372 kilometers).

The data returned so far show a surprisingly wide variety of landforms and terrain ages on Pluto, as well as variations in color, composition, and albedo (surface reflectivity). Team members also discovered evidence for a water-ice rich crust and multiple haze layers in Pluto’s atmosphere, and found that Pluto is both larger and more ice rich than expected prior to the flyby. \n“The Pluto system surprised us in many ways, most notably teaching us that small planets can remain active billions of years after their formation,” said Stern. “We were also taught important lessons by the unexpected degree of geological complexity that both Pluto and its large moon Charon display.” \nObservations of Pluto’s moons show Charon has extensive resurfacing, extensional tectonics, and a puzzling dark terrain at its North Pole. Evidence also points to variations in the composition of its crust. \nAlthough no new satellites were detected, New Horizons provided the first resolved images of Pluto’s smaller moons Nix and Hydra, finding Nix is approximately 34 miles (54 kilometers) long and Hydra is 27 miles (43 kilometers) long. Puzzlingly, their surface reflectivities are significantly higher than Charon’s. \nThe spacecraft’s science payload collected more than 50 gigabits of data from the Pluto system leading up to and at closest approach. Data were gathered by the suite of science instruments aboard New Horizons, including the Ralph infrared spectrometer/imager, the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), the Alice ultraviolet spectrograph, twin REX radio science experiments, the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) detector, the PEPSSI charged-particle spectrometer, and a student-built and operated dust detector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:41:42.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
