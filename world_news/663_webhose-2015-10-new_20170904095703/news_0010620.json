Google’s parent company is now named Alphabet Inc .\nThe Google-led Series C fundraising values Mobvoi at $300-million, with the startup maintaining a controlling stake, said co-founder Li Yuanyuan in a telephone interview. The size of the U.S. firm’s investment was not disclosed by Li or in Mobvoi’s e-mailed statement on Tuesday.\nThe deal, not Google’s first in China but one of few, comes as the company seeks to re-establish itself in the world’s largest Internet market by population of users.\nBecause services like its search, e-mail and mapping are blocked in China, the U.S. firm is trying to cement partnerships with domestic providers like Mobvoi, which offers technology similar to Apple Inc’s Siri and Google’s own version.\nMobvoi previously partnered with Google to provide Chinese-language voice search for the latter’s Android Wear smartwatch operating system. The Chinese firm will use the money from its fundraising to invest in AI and robotics research.\nMobvoi is also developing voice search to be integrated into vehicles and a robot for families in China, said Li.\nWhen contacted, a Singapore-based Google spokesman declined to elaborate on how the Mobvoi investment fit with its China strategy.\nAlthough Google has maintained an engineering and sales presence in China, it largely withdrew its services out of China five years ago after refusing to continue self-censoring search results.\nCEO Sundar Pichai has made no secret that he wants to get back into China, with his bet riding on Google Play, the app store for its Android mobile operating system, despite it currently being borderline inaccessible in China. He faces an uphill struggle.\n More Related to this Story Google offers competing software free to Microsoft Office defectors\nGoogle’s huge online library doesn’t violate copyright laws, U.S. court says\nGoogle’s new parent adopts a different creed\nTopics: Technology United States of America China Google Inc.
