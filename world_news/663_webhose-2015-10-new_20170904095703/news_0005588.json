A small amount of data is used for news alerts (if online, roughly 1 KB each, about once a day) and user-optional feedback (up to 100 KB per feedback report),\" it added. \nThe app will use the same transit data for DMRC metro, DTC buses, DIMTS (orange) buses and Gurgaon Rapid Metro as that found on Google Maps and available offline for the users. \nAccording to Google, around 2.6 million people travel by Delhi Metro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:02:04.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
