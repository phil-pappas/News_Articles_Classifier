With the new interface, you can: -- Analyze and interact with your data in new ways. Create pivot charts and tables from any field of metadata or coding information, and then save them as widgets to see at a glance where different types of information intersect. Simply click into the widgets to drill into your data even further. -- Search in a whole new way. An interactive interface takes the complexity out of building complex searches, letting you quickly add criteria and drag and drop conditions into logic groups. -- Create custom dashboards. Drag and drop your data visualization widgets and lists anywhere on the page, and save your work as a dashboard for easy access to whatever your business needs, such as easy reporting on case progress or quick identification of trends in your data. \n\"Relativity 9.3 is going to change the way our customers work with their data,\" said Andrew Sieja, president and CEO of kCura. \"They now have a seriously powerful data analysis platform to visualize and interact with their growing data sets--and we focused on making it easy for any user. We're excited to see how our customers are going to put it to use.\" \nIn total, Relativity 9.3 has 115 new features, including: -- Greater performance and productivity in Processing, including support for E01 files, as well as the ability to process and extract text with mixed use of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages simultaneously -- Tighter integration between Relativity Processing and Data Grid, helping you start review sooner than ever, even for the largest cases -- The ability to store billions of documents per case in Data Grid, Relativity's NoSQL data store, as well as immediate search capabilities while data is loading--so you don't need to build or maintain indexes behind the scenes -- A revamped production model that automates complex productions, reducing the time delays and common errors that can occur when pushing productions out the door -- Publicly available APIs for data query and analysis, search construction, and processing, giving developers more flexibility with the platform, such as the ability to build interactive interfaces and programmatically execute processing jobs \n\"This release strengthens the platform from end to end in direct response to feedback from the Relativity community,\" said Sieja. \"The next three days at Relativity Fest are going to be awesome, as we celebrate their involvement in the evolution of our software and work side by side in educational sessions and hands-on labs.\" \nTaking place in Chicago through October 14, Relativity Fest is an annual conference designed to educate e-discovery practitioners and connect the Relativity community.
