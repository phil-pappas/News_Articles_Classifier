The personal-computer craze went mainstream in the 1980s. But I carefully fact-checked this one! (And then double checked because, really, 1979 seems too early.)\nHere’s what I found: At the very end of the episode, “ Thanks for the Memories ,” Doogie clicks back through some old journal entries—all the way back to this one:\nMarch 21, 1979... This is my new computer. Dad would only buy it if I promised to keep a stupid journal every night. I hate this! What a fruitless exercise!\n(Naturally, Doogie updates the entry: “April 27, 1992... Journal Entry No. 4,773. Thanks, Dad.” Aww .)\nOkay, so he definitely had a computer in 1979, but what kind of machine was Doogie using for all that time? I know my family used our first computer, an Apple IIc, for years—but that model didn’t come out until 1988. ( I loved that thing .) Let’s take a closer look at Doogie’s: \nABC In an online thread about vintage computers , someone suggests Doogie’s machine had an IBM 8513 monitor—but that model didn’t come out until 1987. (I guess it’s possible Doogie saved journal entries on a floppy disk and transferred them to his new machine when he upgraded.)\nIt definitely looks like an IBM—you can even see that little oval logo on the top left corner. Kinda like this one:\nWikipedia And it’s definitely a different computer than the machine featured in the pilot episode:\nABC But I don’t know nearly enough about classic IBM computers to call this one. \n@AdrienneLaF The blue background always made me assume it was an Amiga or a Commodore 64.\n— Patrick Ho-grim (@phogan) October 13, 2015 (I’ve asked some folks at IBM if they know and will update this space when I hear back.) In the meantime, anybody have any good guesses?

She’s a polished, experienced debater, and she profited from standing on stage with the four other men in the field. Chafee and Webb seemed nervous and uncomfortable, while Sanders was—as always—Sanders: Fervent, grumpy, unfiltered, and righteously angry.

He scribbled arrows by each margin of the pad, both pointing inward. The arrow near the left margin, he said, represented how governments worldwide could stimulate ingenuity to combat climate change by dramatically increasing spending on research and development. “The push is the R&D,” he said, before indicating the arrow on the right. “The pull is the carbon tax.” Between the arrows he sketched boxes to represent areas, such as deployment of new technology, where, he argued, private investors should foot the bill.

He was 52, two years younger than Barack Obama is now; he hadn’t worked outside the government in decades; and even if he managed to cope personally with a historically bitter disappointment that might have broken many people, he would still face the task of deciding how to spend the upcoming years.\n\r \r Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity.\nEvery day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth.\n\r \r Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After , which was published earlier this year.\n\r \r Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?\n\r \r Continue Reading Gus Ruelas / AP / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic The Game at 10: Reflections From a Recovering Pickup Artist Kathy Gilsinan A decade since the book pushed “pickup artistry” into the mainstream, Neil Strauss has some mixed thoughts on its legacy.\nWhen Neil Strauss’s blockbuster book about pickup artistry came out a decade ago, I was a Midwestern ingenue in New York City, and I read it mostly as a defensive measure. A nice Ph.D. student named Jon had mentioned The Game , and was demonstrating how it worked by means of “The Cube” routine, where you ask a woman to imagine a box standing in the desert, and you tell her about herself based on how she describes it. (The cube represents the woman’s ego or something—so if it’s big, it means she’s self-confident; if it’s transparent as opposed to opaque that means she’s open as opposed to guarded; if it’s pink that means she’s bright and energetic … basic non-falsifiable horoscope-type material she can read herself into and then find you perceptive.) It was basically a way to harness people’s love of talking about themselves in order to score.\n\r \r Continue Reading Greg Kahn The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration Ta-Nehisi Coates American politicians are now eager to disown a failed criminal-justice system that’s left the U.S. with the largest incarcerated population in the world. But they've failed to reckon with history. Fifty years after Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s report “The Negro Family” tragically helped create this system, it's time to reclaim his original intent. \nBy his own lights, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ambassador, senator, sociologist, and itinerant American intellectual, was the product of a broken home and a pathological family . He was born in 1927 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but raised mostly in New York City. When Moynihan was 10 years old, his father, John, left the family, plunging it into poverty. Moynihan’s mother, Margaret, remarried, had another child, divorced, moved to Indiana to stay with relatives, then returned to New York, where she worked as a nurse. Moynihan’s childhood—a tangle of poverty, remarriage, relocation, and single motherhood—contrasted starkly with the idyllic American family life he would later extol.\nContinue Reading Latest Notes A Story I Hope You'll Read: Al Gore’s Role as the Green Warren Buffett Hillary's Pretty Good Night in Vegas Orbital View: The Other American in Space Quoted Here Is a Short Dog in Tall Grass More Most Popular On The Atlantic Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Who Won the Democratic Debate?

By which I mean: a few dominant, sober-sided media outlets; a news cycle punctuated by evening network-news shows, morning (and sometimes afternoon) newspapers, weekend newsmaker talk shows, and weekly news magazines; and political discourse that shared enough assumptions about facts and logic that journalists felt they could do their jobs by saying, “We’ve heard from one side. Now let’s hear from the other.”\n\r \r I can barely remember any of that, and I got my first magazine job (with The Washington Monthly ) around the time of the Watergate break-in and subsequent Woodward-and-Bernstein scoops, when all parts of the old-style journalistic ecosystem were still functioning.\n\r \r Continue Reading Subscribe Get 10 issues a year and save 65% off the cover price.\nState Alabama Alaska Alberta American Samoa APO/FPO-Africa APO/FPO-Canada APO/FPO-Europe APO/FPO-Middle East APO/FPO-Americas APO/FPO-Pacific Arizona Arkansas British Columbia California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Guam Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Manitoba Marshall Islands Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Micronesia Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Brunswick New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York Newfoundland Newfoundland-Labrador North Carolina North Dakota Northern Mariana Isles Northwest Territories Nova Scotia Nunavut Ohio Oklahoma Ontario Oregon Palau Pennsylvania Prince Edward Island Puerto Rico Quebec Quebec Rhode Island Saskatchewan South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virgin Islands Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming Yukon Territories Fraud Alert regarding The Atlantic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:37:41.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
