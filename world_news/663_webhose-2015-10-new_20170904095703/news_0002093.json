For a while anyway, the answer looks like being Monday’s high of US73.82c.\nThis high coincided exactly with a key chart level and suggests the Aussie could be in for a volatile period.\nThe recent rally in the Aussie dollar was driven partly by markets seeing reduced downside risk for emerging economies and commodities and partly by waning conviction about a US rate hike in December.\nA number of factors combined to cap the Aussie rally earlier this week:\nSellers came out of the wood work to take advantage of the commodity rally. At the end of the day, little has happened in recent weeks to change the demand/supply outlook for most major commodities. The World Steel Association, for example downgraded its outlook for global steel demand this week. It’s now tipping demand to fall 1.7 per cent this year and to grow only 0.7 per cent next year. In this scenario, iron ore supply cuts will be needed to accommodate new production by Roy Hill and others if lower prices are to be avoided. Similarly, the International Energy Agency is now forecasting growth in oil demand to throttle back to 1.2 million barrels from 1.8 million this year. With Iran planning to return 0.5-1 million barrels a day to the market, surpluses are likely to persist well into 2017 with resultant to downside risk to oil prices. Import data for China was weaker than expected. Westpac made a surprise increase in mortgage rates. Assuming the other major banks follow suit, this will increase pressure on the RBA to cut its official cash rate, creating downside risk for the Australian dollar. Against this background, today’s Australian employment data could be important for market thinking on the potential for an Australian rate cut and the near-term direction of the Aussie dollar.\nSitting over the top of all this is the overarching question of US monetary policy. After disappointing US employment data last month, markets have downgraded the probability of the Fed hiking rates in December to 35 per cent. However, it’s arguable that the US economy is approaching a more mature phase in its recovery cycle, where job growth tends to stabilise compared to the initial surges typically seen in the earlier stages. With this in mind, the Fed may not be too fazed by a throttling back in jobs growth now that the unemployment rate is back down to 5.1 per cent. Weekend comments by influential Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer make it pretty clear that he sees a December rate hike as a live issue. Markets appear to have worked into a situation where a December rate hike might be a minor surprise, creating upside risk for the US dollar and downside for the Aussie.\nAussie Dollar Chart\nThese factors all create potential for volatility and this week’s chart developments point to this possibility.\nMonday’s high in the Aussie dollar stopped neatly at the 38.2 per cent Fibonacci retracement of the last big swing down from US81.5c to US69c. Whether this was a self-fulfilling phenomenon caused by a lot of people watching this level I don’t know. However, technical traders will be aware that it’s a common occurrence and can help develop a road map for possible future market moves.\n38.2 per cent is the first of the major Fibonacci retracement levels. Shallow retracements limited to 38.2 per cent indicate strong ongoing down trends. In the scheme of things, it shows sellers are keen to come back in force after a proportionately minor rally. Where they push prices under the previous low from the 38.2 per cent retracement; powerful momentum is indicated. So this now becomes one possibility to watch out for.\nHowever, there’s a more common scenario surrounding the 38.2 per cent retracement level. This is where it turns out to represent only the end of the first swing in a larger and more complex corrective rally.\nThis kind of scenario is traced out by the dashed lines on the weekly chart below. From here we might move lower from Monday’s high, form a base and ultimately complete a larger corrective rally. The resistance line and 40-week moving averages around .755c might be candidates as target levels for this larger correction. This is the more volatile scenario suggested by Monday’s peak at the 38.2 per cent level. The fact that indicators like the Stochastic Oscillator in the box below the chart point to ongoing upward momentum adds weight to the possibility that this is the scenario which plays out for the Aussie dollar.\nTechnical and fundamental analysis by Ric Spooner , Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets @ricspooner_CMC", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ricspooner_CMC"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:06:53.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
