Available materials are PEEK (polyetheretherketone) and PAEK (polyaryletherketone) polymer based composite formulations that are optimized for additive manufacturing. \nArevo Labs’ composite formulations use high performance polymer matrix with carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber and glass fiber. These composite materials elevate performance thresholds for strength, stiffness, durability, wear resistance, chemical resistance, thermal stability and electrostatic discharge (ESD) properties. For engineers and product developers, the result is an additive manufacturing with state-of-the-art materials to produce advanced thermoplastic composite parts. The 3D printed parts are optimized for mechanical properties using Arevo’s advanced software algorithms that encompass Additive Finite Element Analysis and true 3D printing. \n“We are excited to announce commercial availability of 3D printed PEEK and PAEK composite parts for the first time,” said Hemant Bheda, CEO and founder of Arevo Labs. “We have successfully developed end use applications in Aerospace, Single Use Medical Devices, Oil & Gas and Factory Automation and are working closely with OEMs to scale up production.” \n“Fabricating high performance composite parts with 3D printing opens up new design opportunities for us. The two main advantages are improved complex geometries and new material possibilities,” said Kent Holder, Product Line Manager at Superior Energy. Superior Energy serves the drilling, completion and production-related needs of oil and gas companies worldwide. \n“I can confirm that the drone arm printed with AREVO’s Katevo-CF material with no internal structure is much stronger than a carbon fiber filled SLS arm with inner ribs,” says Ido Baruchin, Head of Design at Matternet. Matternet is a developer of smart drones for transportation, focusing on last mile logistics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:15:04.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
