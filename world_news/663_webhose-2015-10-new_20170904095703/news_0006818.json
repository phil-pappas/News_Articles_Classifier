The country's lunar exploration director Liu Jizhong said in a speech that ant-like devices would be more flexible than rovers.\nHe also outlined plans to put a lander on the far side of the Moon and put satellites in place to explore the satellite's poles.\nBecause there may be water ice at these poles, the operation could eventually allow for the development of a Lunar base.\nHe said: \"When exploring the unknown, we should not just follow others. China should be more creative.\"\nSenior engineer Lin Yilu added: \"If China expands the range of its lunar exploration, such as exploring the south and north poles and the far side of the moon, it needs a constellation of satellites covering different areas of the moon's surface.\"\nMr Liu also came up with a proposal for a heavy-lift vehicle with a payload of 100,000kg to help establish the base, a payload far in excess of current standards.\nWhen complete, Elon Musk's Falcon Heavy will be able to lift just over half that weight.\nIn a speech reported by Chinese state news agency Xinhau, Mr Liu said also wants his team to explore faster propulsion techniques to deliver deep-space probes in shorter times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:29:35.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
