With the mountains and ocean on your doorstep it offers a terrific ‘playground’ for outdoor recreation. The fine weather and lack of traffic are far more attractive than Dublin. Interdisciplinary research collaborations are not necessarily contingent on large external research funding and we attract excellent postgraduates from overseas who bring a wealth of diversity of skills.” \nDr Aisling O’Sullivan (Ireland) Senior Lecturer in Civil and Natural Resources Engineering Post-doctoral Research Associate in Bayesian Analysis in NMR Department of Chemical and Process Engineering Full-time (37.5 hours per week) Fixed term (3 years) position \nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is one of the most commonly used analytical techniques in chemistry. Traditionally NMR relies on the use of large, superconducting magnets and very high magnetic field strengths in order to distinguish between different molecular species. Recently, new NMR instruments have been developed that use permanent magnets and hence are much cheaper and more compact than conventional NMR instruments. These new devices open up opportunities for entirely new applications of NMR, especially with regard to monitoring of chemical reactions. However, the sensitivity of these instruments is not sufficient for many applications. \nWe have recently developed a new mathematical technique to extract quantitative spectral information from very low quality NMR data. The new approach uses Bayesian statistics to fully exploit our prior knowledge of the samples to be studied. \nDuring this project, we will collaborate with Magritek, the world’s leading manufacturer of permanent magnet NMR devices, to develop and implement our proposed algorithm on these permanent magnet devices. The project will primarily focus on the development of the algorithm, but will also require an element of practical work. In particular, the project will involve collaboration with our partners at Scion who are interested in using permanent magnet NMR devices to monitor chemical reactions using sustainable or green feed stocks. \nWe are seeking a self-motivated applicant with an excellent academic record and strong written skills for this post-doctoral research position. You will be expected to demonstrate outstanding ability in mathematics, whilst maintaining a pragmatic approach. You should have a demonstrated track record in Bayesian analysis or computational processing of spectroscopy or imaging data. You will also need to demonstrate an aptitude to learn a broad range of new skills, outside your existing discipline. There will be an opportunity for you to assist with the supervision of a PhD student who will be working on related aspects of the project. \nYou should hold a PhD in engineering, mathematics or physics. You will need to demonstrate that you have the right to work in New Zealand. Assistance with visas may be provided by the university should that be required. \nYou will receive a salary of NZ$65,000 p.a. for 3 years, as well as associated benefits from being an employee of the university. \nFor more information about this project, please email daniel.holland@canterbury.ac.nz \nDownload the full Position Description \nThe closing date for this position is: 9 November 2015 \nThe University of Canterbury is committed to promoting a world-class learning environment through research and teaching excellence, and has a vision statement of “People Prepared to Make a Difference”.
