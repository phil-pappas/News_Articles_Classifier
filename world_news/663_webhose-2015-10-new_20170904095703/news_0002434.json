He also asked Modi to clarify whether he endorsed Bhagwat's view.\n\"Why are you silent on reservation policy? If you support Bhagwat's views, say so or else throw him out,\" Prasad said while addressing a joint press conference of Mahagathbandhan here.\nFlanked by state Congress president Ashok Choudhary and JD(U) MP and spokesman Pavan Kumar Varma, the RJD chief also said if Modi is not in support of reservation, he is a \"nakli (fake)\" backward.\nLalu said reservation in all government jobs and educational institutions should be in proportion to the population of dalits and OBCs. \"At a time when we are looking for an increase in reservation percentage, the RSS is conspiring to end it. We will not allow any party to end the provision of quota.\"\nHe also said, \"PM Modi, BJP and RSS are infamous for anti-dalit and anti-ST policies and decisions. Subjugation and annihilation of the rights of the deprived classes, particularly SC, ST and backward classes, are ingrained in the BJP and RSS mindset, manifest in the thought process and action of none less than the PM.\"\nPrasad further asked Modi, BJP and RSS to tender an apology to the nation for their anti-dalit and anti-OBC mindset. \"Modi is carrying forward the RSS ideology of denying social justice and subjugating the deprived sections. We demand an apology from Modi, BJP and RSS.\"\nHe also attacked Modi for making a sizeable cut in budgetary allocations for the welfare of SC/ST. \"Modi government has dealt a body blow to all welfare schemes relating to SCs and STs across India by imposing sharp budgetary cuts. A budgetary cut of Rs 19,734 crore in 'Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan' and Rs 12,406 crore in 'Scheduled Tribes Sub- Plan' has been made in the Union budget for 2015-16 compared to the Union budget for 2014-15 (interim budget for 2014-15 was presented by the Congress-led UPA government),\" Prasad said.\nHe also targeted BJP president Amit Shah and said, \"Shah is dreaming of becoming PM by pushing back his mentor Narendra Modi.\" Questioning the BJP's development agenda in Bihar polls, Prasad asked why was the BJP promising free distribution of TVs, laptops and motorbikes among youth if the saffron party was sure of developing the state. He also alleged that BJP was trying to bribe people for votes.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:04:24.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
