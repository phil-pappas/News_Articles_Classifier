Brady recently developed its Platinum Partner program to support the distributors who have made a commitment to exclusively market Brady products. “The Platinum Partner program was created to support our distributors and assist them in growing sales,” says Stewart Landy, channel manager for Brady. “This is the first year of the program, and the first year we’ve had the opportunity to award one of our distributor partners. A big congratulations to Horizon Solutions for earning the award – it was well deserved and a true reflection of their strong performance and partnership.”\nPlatinum Partner of the Year finalists were evaluated by Brady’s sales leadership teams. The criteria under review were: sales performance, sales force engagement, executive engagement, and sales and marketing activities.\n“To be selected as the inaugural Platinum Partner of the Year recipient is a tremendous honor for Horizon Solutions,” says Scott Wilson, director of Industrial and Safety Products and Services for Horizon Solutions. “Our relationship has grown over many years of hard work. There are three key areas that have helped make this possible: Brady’s foresight and innovation, commitment to its affiliated distributors and, most importantly, the quality of the field sales people that cover our territory.”\nThe Platinum Partner program offers distributors a variety of sales and marketing programs, and will continue to expand around the needs of Brady’s platinum distributor partners.\nFor More Information\nFor Brady’s complete product offering, visit BradyID.com .\nAbout Brady Corporation:\nBrady Corporation is an international manufacturer and marketer of complete solutions that identify and protect people, products and places.
