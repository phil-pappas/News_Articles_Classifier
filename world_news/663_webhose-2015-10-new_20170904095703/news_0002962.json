It doesn’t matter if it’s a cloudy day. Every second about 65 billion neutrinos, forged in the sun’s fiery core, are travelling at nearly the speed of light through the one square centimetre taken up by your fingernail.\nDitto for the rest of you. Right now trillions upon trillions of neutrinos are passing through you and the entire planet like bullets through wisps of cloud.\nReuters Oct. 06 2015, 10:36 AM EDT Video: Watch the Nobel Prize for Physics announcement You can’t feel them. Yet these ephemeral essences – mere ghosts on the particle family tree – have nabbed something entirely tangible: Canada’s latest Nobel Prize.\nFor Arthur McDonald, the Queen’s University professor emeritus who shares this year’s physics prize for the pivotal neutrino experiment he directed at the bottom of a Sudbury nickel mine, the outcome could hardly be more perfect.\n“It was a pretty pleasant awakening,” said Dr. McDonald, of the 4 a.m. phone call he received on Tuesday from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nThe prize is the ultimate validation of a gutsy decision made by Dr. McDonald together with many other researchers and government funding agencies to build an experiment on the strength of an unproven idea. It will stand as an example of Canadian-led science at its best, with an emphasis on collaboration, a blending of theory with technical prowess, and the combined expertise of both university and government researchers supported by industry and all converging on a single challenging problem.\n“I think you have to be willing to have an overall objective that only a team can accomplish,” said Dr. McDonald, when asked what it took to bring the $73-million experiment to fruition. “It’s too big for any one person.”\nDr. MacDonald, 72, shares the $1.26-million (Canadian) prize with Takaaki Kajita of the University of Tokyo. Together they represent complementary experiments in Canada and Japan that were the first to show neutrinos have mass and can switch from one type or “flavour” to another – a property that is subtly connected to the deeper nature of matter and reality itself. The prize comes 14 years after Dr. McDonald and his team announced their groundbreaking result at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, and about three decades after the experiment was first conceived.\n“Art McDonald’s Nobel Prize for his trailblazing discoveries serves as a powerful example of what can be done in Canada today, with focus, foresight and persistence,” said Neil Turok, director of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ont.\nFor non-physicists, the effort was as abstract and unseen as the neutrino itself. Yet, it’s an area that grew out of the practical development of nuclear science that followed the U.S. Manhattan Project, the race to build the first atomic bomb – and an area in which Canada was, for a time, at the forefront, because of a cluster of talented researchers at the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories (now Chalk River Laboratories) northwest of Ottawa.\nDr. McDonald, who was born in Sydney, N.S., came to Chalk River in 1970 after earning his PhD at the California Institute of Technology. He spent a dozen years at the federal lab before taking up a professorship at Princeton University. But a few years later, an exciting proposal for a neutrino experiment set in motion his return to Canada.\nBy then, physicists had been puzzling for years about what had come to be known as the solar neutrino problem. After the neutrino was first verified in 1956, experiments designed to capture neutrinos generated by nuclear reactions in the sun were coming up short. Either physicists’ basic understanding of how the sun shines was wrong or there was something unexplained about neutrinos that could reveal more about particle physics as a whole.\nOne possible answer was that the three known flavours of neutrinos, called electron, muon and tau neutrinos, were swapping identities – a situation that is mathematically possible if the mass of each neutrino flavour differs from the others by a small amount. Since the sun makes only one kind of neutrino, experiments that were built to spot only that type would have missed this.\nCanada proved to be the key to cracking the mystery. The heavy water that is used in CANDU reactors makes an excellent neutrino catcher. Importantly, it can also be used to detect neutrinos in two ways. One reaction is sensitive only to electron neutrinos, the other involves all three flavours (but without distinguishing between them). By comparing results from both reactions, physicists reasoned it should be possible to test the idea that neutrinos can switch identities and therefore have mass.\nTo provide meaningful results, the experiment would need 1,000 tonnes of heavy water surrounded by sensitive detectors and carefully shielded from radioactivity as well as from cosmic rays more than two kilometres below ground. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was born, and starting in 1989 with Dr. McDonald at its helm, the audacious plan began to gain funding and momentum. “It was a difficult project, never done before,” said Pekka Sinervo, senior vice-president of research for the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research in Toronto, who served on the experiment’s advisory committee.\nHe said that Dr. McDonald led the difficult process of building the experiment with a light touch and a genuine concern for the people behind the science.\n“He was very clear on where the experiment had to get to … and he was also the one who understood everything that was going on.”\nThere would prove to be many hurdles along the way and there was competition too. In 1998, researchers with the Japanese neutrino experiment, Super-Kamiokande, announced their first evidence that neutrinos produced in Earth’s atmosphere were switching flavour. The following year, Dr. McDonald and his team were taking data on solar neutrinos. They would soon have their answer.\n“We really had a eureka moment,” said Dr. McDonald, about the moment when the entire team first saw the accumulated data. The missing solar neutrinos were now accounted for. They had shown that electron neutrinos from the sun can change flavour after they are made, and a new and intriguing property of matter was waiting to be explored.\nFollow Ivan Semeniuk on Twitter: @ivansemeniuk\n More Related to this Story Canadian’s Nobel win highlights successes of Ontario research facilities\nThe secret military project that led to a Nobel Prize\nCanadian Inuit leader one of three winners of ‘alternative Nobels’\nComments Print /\nLicense A A", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "http://license.icopyright.net/3.8425?icx_id=26677185", "https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/.", "http://license.icopyright.net/g2/3.8425?icx_id=26677185", "https://twitter.com/@ivansemeniuk"], "published": "2015-10-06T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:50:30.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
