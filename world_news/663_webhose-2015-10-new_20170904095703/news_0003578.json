But no one has used the image-sharing network to publish an entire novel – at least not until Matilda and Harry. \nHey Harry Hey Matilda is the debut novel of writer and photographer Rachel Hulin – and the debut Instagram novel. Over the course of nine months, it will tell the story of a pair of witty, cerebral fraternal twins as they navigate the struggles of 30-something life and their own complicated relationship. \nOn one side: Matilda Goodman, a frustrated artist working as a wedding photographer. \nOn the other: her brother Harry, an anxiously untenured English professor. \nThe story unfolds gradually as e-mails between the two, divided up into a series of Instagram photo captions. The photos themselves are largely taken from Hulin’s 15-year career, though she’s also cast models and made images specifically for the project. Sometimes they illustrate the text they accompany; sometimes – as is the case with all great Instagrams – they just evoke a place or a mood. \n“I love Instagram,” Hulin said. “I’m fascinated by this idea of everyone turning their lives into these daily visual narratives.” \n\nHulin has always been into narratives, visual and otherwise. Previously she worked as a photo editor and writer in New York, and has shot images for Martha Stewart Living and the New York Times. Six years ago, she began messing around with a blog that told the stories of two characters, Harry and Matilda. She played around with it for a while, showing a few friends, but eventually abandoned it to work on other projects. \nA photo posted by Matilda and Harry Goodman (@heyharryheymatilda) on Sep 29, 2015 at 6:15pm PDT \n\nStill, the characters stayed with her, as did the idea of using e-mails to tell their story. In 2014, Hulin began working on a novel, finishing it in the spring of 2015. \nAfter finishing, however, Hulin realised that a whole host of digital artifacts could double as narrative techniques: photos, e-mail accounts, personal websites even. She launched a newsletter and built Matilda a site for her wedding photography business. She also began going through her own photo archives and casting friends to play the principals for her Instagrams. \nThe result is an immersive digital narrative that makes Matilda and Harry feel eerily real. So real that Hulin has begun getting very earnest messages at “Matilda’s” e-mail account. \n\nHulin wasn’t setting out to reinvent the genre, she cautions: she spent a year crafting this novel, and that work matters more to her than the novelty of how she’s publishing it. But it’s given her an audience that’s unusual for first-time literary fiction. \n“I like waking up and seeing what people have said. It’s very fun,” Hulin said. – The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:29:42.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
