Fig. 1: About 19.5MW-output \"Handa Solar Power Plant.\" A fund financed the project while the Mitsui Group provided every service from development to operation. (source: upper by Mitsui & Co Plant Systems, bottom by Nikkei BP) \nAn investment association (fund) financed by institutions such as corporate pensions served as the power producer, with the Mitsui Group solely entrusted with development, operation and other services. Using the same method, the Mitsui Group has developed a total of about 96MW-output solar power plants at 28 locations in three phases and structured funds for them ( See related article ). \nThis power plant is located on a site owned by Toyota Industries Corp in Kamihama, Handa City. Handa City is situated in the Chita Peninsula, which boasts a high amount of sunshine, and is, therefore, suited for solar power generation. The Mitsui Group decided to construct a mega-solar power plant on this site, introduced to it by Chiyoda Corp, which provided engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services. \nIn accordance with Chiyoda's proposal, the plant adopted solar panels manufactured by Solar Frontier KK and PV inverters manufactured by Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corp (TMEIC). \nThe site was originally part of the former Nakajima Aircraft Co's plane factory, which is now partially used by Toyota Industries for such operations as a lift training center and for used car storage. The unused areas are now rented as the mega-solar power plant site (Fig. 2). Fig. 2: The power plant was set up on the unused areas rented by Toyota Industries. They are part of the former Nakajima Aircraft's plane factory and are located near the heart of Handa City. (source; Mitsui & Co Plant Systems) \nAlthough it is designated as an industrial area, the site is near the heart of Handa City, with residential areas spreading to the west and north. For this reason, according to Mitsui, the rent is relatively high.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:54:18.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
