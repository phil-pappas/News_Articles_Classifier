BUCHI’s new vacuum pump , the new V-300, has also recently been released, providing the option of noiseless vacuum for the new evaporator. Eco-friendly recirculating chiller options are also available. \nFor more information, visit www.buchi.com/rotavapor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:31:23.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
