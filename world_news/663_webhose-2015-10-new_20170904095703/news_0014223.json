The findings could have implications for regenerative medicine and treatments for women suffering from placental dysfunction. \nThere are approximately 100,000 cases every year in the U.S. that account for placental dysfunction diseases. In addition, one in every 100 couples suffers from recurrent miscarriage, according to lead researcher, Yossi Buganim, Ph.D., of the Institute for Medical Research-Israel-Canada. \nBuganim, a professor in the Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer Research at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, and his team were successful in creating fully functional induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs), for the first time. \nBuganim told Bioscience Technology that the team’s approach worked, where other attempts failed, because previous efforts tried to generate trophoblast stem cells from embryonic stem cells, while Buganim used fibroblasts as a starting material.

Also, “as far as we know these cells are the only induced cells (besides induced pluripotent stem cells) that reach such a high degree of nuclear reprogramming, indicating that their quality is fairly good.” \nThere are some downsides however, including that currently they are using viruses to deliver the genes because it is easy. Once the work advances into the clinic the team would need to use mRNA molecules, which are harder to introduce. \nThe study was done on mouse cells to show full functionality: injection into early embryo and examination of the developing placenta. But the team still needs to show that the technique is successful for human cells. \nUp next, Buganim hopes, “to show rescue capability in various placental dysfunction mouse models and to generate iTSCs from human cells to be able to start clinical trials.” Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:03:50.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
