It is an effective site to Look Up any unknown phone number owners \nWith nearly 700 million phone numbers in the United States, the odds of knowing where an unfamiliar number is calling from are pretty slim. A new service, www.reversephonenumberlookup.me, is aiming to help with that by allowing users to search U.S. phone numbers to help determine who is calling them. \nThe Reverse lookup service will give people the power to locate quickly a phone number that is not known to them where they can receive the information that includes the owner. The service is beneficial to people who are receiving unwanted calls, or for people who need to know the identity of the caller so they can decide if they are going to accept the call or not. \nThe U.S. phone number system is known as the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and encompasses 25 distinct regions in 20 countries primarily in North America, including the Caribbean and the U.S. territories. \nThe NANP divides the territories of its members into numbering plan areas (NPAs) which are encoded numerically with a three-digit telephone number prefix, commonly called the area code. Each telephone is assigned a seven-digit telephone number unique only within its respective plan area consisting of a three-digit central office code and a four-digit station number. \nThat system makes it possible to find out who is calling based on a phone number – even when the person is calling from a cell phone. That feature is particularly important given that more than 40 percent of U.S. households no longer have a landline, a number that’s only likely to increase. As each cell phone carrier has its own three-digit central office codes, reverse lookup services can pinpoint the location and cell phone carrier of an unknown number. \nThere are numerous reasons to use a reverse lookup service for phone numbers. It can help find the identity of an unknown caller, identify an area code, help recall a name, or identify an unfamiliar number on a phone bill. \nMore information is available at https://www.reversephonenumberlookup.me \nAbout Reverse Phone Number Lookup \nAt Reverse Phone, Number Lookup people can search US Phone Numbers to know who is calling them.
