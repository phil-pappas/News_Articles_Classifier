Revenue in the quarter rose to $2.78 billion from $2.51 billion, while earnings increased to $965.6 million, or $4.15 a share, from $856.9 million, or $3.62. Excluding certain items, the company's per-share earnings rose 18% to $4.48.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $3.80 a share in earnings on $2.65 billion in revenue.\nBiogen's stock price has been hammered since the company reported in July a slowdown in revenue growth for its biggest-selling product, the multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera. Since then, the company announced the departure of its sales chief and analysts' expectations for the drug have been significantly lowered.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n 21, 2015 08:01 ET (12:01 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:07:56.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
