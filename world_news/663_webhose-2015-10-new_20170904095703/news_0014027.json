The new build for phones includes support for missed call notifications and sending texts on your PC, Skype integration, as well as improvements to Cortana, the Photo app, and Storage settings. \nWith this build on your phone, Cortana will now notify you on your PC (as long you have Windows 10 build 10565 or higher) that you missed a call. Furthermore, when that happens, you can reply with a text to the person who called you right from your PC. Cortana then makes sure that your phone sends the text on your behalf. \nEven if you don’t miss a call, you can send a text from your PC at any time. To do so, fire up Cortana, type or speak “Text” and the name of a contact on your PC (just like you would on your phone) and Cortana will do the rest. \nToday’s update bumps the Windows 10 build number from 10549 , made available to testers on October 14, to build 10572. Unlike Windows 10 for PCs, which launched on July 29, Windows 10 Mobile hasn’t been released yet — it’s behind in terms of features and polish compared to its PC counterpart. \nMicrosoft plans to launch the first Windows 10 phones in November and roll out Windows 10 Mobile to existing Windows Phone users in December . \nMore to follow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:03:55.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
