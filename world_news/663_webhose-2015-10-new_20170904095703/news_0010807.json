The R-Car E2 solution was developed to deliver optimized infotainment and display audio for entry-level integrated cockpit systems. Altia DeepScreen code for the R-Car E2 offers impressive HMI development capabilities for this platform, including integration of genuine 3D content. Thus, automotive companies using Altia for Renesas’ R-Car can create a high class user experience for even a lower end car model.\nThe capability to run 3D content on Renesas’ R-Car E2 is made possible by Altia’s 3D Scene Object, which easily integrates content created in popular tools like Autodesk Maya®. It supports features including different light types, surface materials and timeline animations. Textures are supported for diffuse, normal and reflection maps. These features allow for realistic 3D effects like shiny metal, rubbery tire treads and transparent glass.\nWith the Altia Design 3D Scene Object, a single timeline sequence of multiple animations can be split into discrete channels of animation which can be independently controlled. The 3D Scene Object converts what would normally be movie playback into event-driven GUI animation since animations can be driven by real-time data or user interaction.\nUnlike other GUI development solutions, Altia-generated graphics for Renesas’ R-Car E2 require no large, mysterious black box engines or slow, interpreted languages. All native C source code is provided by DeepScreen, thereby simplifying certification. Additionally, Altia generates code only for the GUI assets needed to run on the R-Car E2, which saves memory, boosts performance and means less code to validate and test.\nAltia’s DeepScreen target for Renesas’ R-Car E2 makes the most of on-chip resources. Altia offers full support for all visible layers using either the 2D rendering graphics pipeline or the newly developed engine of the R-Car E2 – providing WYSIWYG layer control multi-display functionality using its innovative Layer Manager. Each layer can be configured flexibly to make use of the R-Car E2's various features aiming to optimize memory usage and drawing performance. For more advanced designs, Altia supports static or runtime font rendering using the FreeType font engine.\nAltia's user interface development tools are used by companies across the world to develop colorful and custom user interfaces for their products. With Altia Design, the GUI editor and centerpiece of Altia's tool chain, users create custom graphics from scratch or use assets from tools like Adobe Photoshop to draw their GUIs, create animation, define behavior and optimize user experience. Once complete, Altia DeepScreen generates pure C source code for the Altia design model that can be deployed onto a variety of low- to high-powered processors from industry-leading silicon providers like Renesas, Freescale, NXP, STMicroelectronics, Cypress Semiconductor, Spansion, Texas Instruments and more.\nFor more information about Altia for Renesas’ R-Car E2, email info@altia.com.\nAbout Altia\nAltia, Inc. is a software company that provides graphical user interface design and development tools that can be used from concept to final product code.
