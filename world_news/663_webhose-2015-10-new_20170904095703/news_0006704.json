Microsoft says it's for scientists, engineers and gamers who need a lot more performance than a tablet.\nThe laptop starts at $1,499, compared with $899 for the new Surface Pro 4 tablet. And while the Surface Book is called a laptop, the screen is detachable so that it effectively becomes a tablet. The company touted its clipboard-like functions for people on the go.\nThe Surface Pro 4 tablet is faster and thinner than before, yet it comes with a slightly larger screen at 12.3 inches.\nBoth devices will come out later this month.\nSurface sales have picked up after a slow start. Revenue from tablets and accessories more than doubled in April-June quarter to $888 million. Microsoft is hoping for a further boost from the summer launch of Windows 10, which had favorable reviews. The Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 are the first Surface devices to ship with Windows 10 already installed, though older models are able to get free upgrades.\nAlthough the Surface still represents a small part of Microsoft's overall business, it provides a window into the company's various ad-supported services, including search and maps.\nAt the closing of a nearly two-hour event in New York, CEO Satya Nadella said that the devices are part of Microsoft's vision \"to move people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows.\"\nEarlier, Microsoft unveiled two new phones and a fitness tracker as it continues efforts to reduce its dependence on personal computers and traditional software.\nThe new Lumia 950 and 950 XL phones will work with an optional dock. You can attach a regular monitor, keyboard and mouse and work with apps on the phone just like you would on a Windows 10 desktop.\nMicrosoft has struggled to make phones that run Windows. Over the summer, the company wrote down the value of Nokia's phone business, which it bought just a year earlier, for $8.4 billion. It also announced 7,800 job cuts in the phone business.\nMicrosoft is hoping to lure those who use Windows desktops and laptops regularly. The new phones are better at complementing those devices than iPhones and Android phones.\nThe new phones start at $549 and will be available in November.\nThe new Microsoft Band, meanwhile, now tracks elevation and works with the company's Cortana virtual assistant. It will be available for $249 starting Oct. 30.\nMicrosoft also teased Xbox One games and console bundles and demonstrated its upcoming HoloLens virtual-reality device by showing a \"mixed reality\" game that combines animation with real-world objects. Attacking robots know how to break through walls and go around furniture.\nDevelopers will be able to buy a prototype early next year for $3,000.\n Microsoft Surface Satya Nadella", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56141993/turbine/ct-microsoft-surface-new-products-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-06T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T18:48:16.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
