While Walt Disney Co. and Sony Pictures have produced successful Peter Pan movies, Warner Bros. isn’t so lucky.\n“When you talk about fairy tales, if it’s not under the Disney brand, it’s a tough sell,” Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co., said before weekend results were announced. “They can’t tap into it in the same way Disney does.”\nThe effects-laden film had been forecast by researcher BoxOffice.com to open with sales of $16.5 million and $46 million in its full domestic run. Even with foreign sales, it will be hard for Time Warner Inc.’s film division to recoup its costs. The picture opens on Oct. 12 in China, the world’s No. 2 movie market and one of a few possible bright spots for the picture.\nBoth Imdb.com and Box Office Mojo had put the film’s production budget at $150 million, a sum that doesn’t include money the studio spent advertising the picture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:49:20.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
