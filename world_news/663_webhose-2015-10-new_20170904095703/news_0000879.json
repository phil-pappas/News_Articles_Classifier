Without those cuts, the group calculated that there would be an additional 0.5-1.1 C (0.9-2.0 F) of warming.\nCurrently, temperatures are about 1.8 C (3.2 F) warmer than in pre-industrial times.\nA separate analysis this week by the U.S.-based Climate Interactive group projected 3.5 C (6.3 F) of warming based on the current pledges.\nAll major carbon polluters except India submitted targets by Thursday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:28:11.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
