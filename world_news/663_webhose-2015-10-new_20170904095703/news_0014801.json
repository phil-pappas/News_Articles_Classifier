It will act as a \"language translation service,\" standardizing data across as many as 20 databases. \n\"To tackle this herculean task, we need to systematically look to big data to ensure the decisions we make for students today will pay off in the form of degree completion and ultimately career success,\" said Ellucian CEO Jeff Ray. \nTexas Tech University is one of the 15 institutions partnering with Ellucian in the project. \n\"The amount of data we take in for each student and prospective student is overwhelming,\" said Texas Tech CIO Kay Rhodes. \"With the Ellucian higher education data model, we'll help to create a single definition across the entire student lifecycle, giving us a more logical way to access all the data we've captured.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:31:13.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
