How about swallowing one? \nAt the recent Code/Mobile conference in Half Moon Bay, CA all eyes and ears were on Jawbone’s CEO Hosain Rahman. He spoke with Re/code’s Kara Swisher about how ingestible sensors could play an important role in the future of wearables. \nJawbone Up, the company’s smart fitness tracker syncs with an app and delivers personalized tips and reminders to help the user make healthier choices.While Jawbone is popular in the world of wearables,Rahman believes that in the future, people will be swallowing sensors that would be capable of actively monitoring factors from within the body. \nThese fitness sensors, once implanted or swallowed could remain in the blood stream and give valuable data about the user.Rahman cited a situation where it could potentially track the blood alcohol level and alert the user against driving under the influence of alcohol.

As Jawbone and other players invest resources into this exciting technology, its a development I will be closely following. \nAre wearables overrated? Are they a fad or here to stay? Please share your thoughts in the comments below. \nHaving caused quite a stir in the consumer space, wearables are already beginning to make their presence and value felt in the workplace too.But, where there is hype, there are challenges. \nimage :www.The verge.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:47:36.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
