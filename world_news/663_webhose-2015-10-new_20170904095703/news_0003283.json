That is the question being explored by local start-up Dark Sea Industries, an aerospace company focused on developing new propulsion technologies for space-related industries. \nThe company is a virtual tenant in STC's Cecchi VentureLab and is currently conducting a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to raise money to construct several prototypes that will test the theory behind using a superconducting coil, or solenoid, to create electromagnetic fields to propel spacecraft. \nThe big idea explores the possibilities of using electric or magnetic fields already in the space around the Sun (heliosphere) or Earth (magnetosphere) to power magnetic sails. \nThe technology inventor and company administrator Craig Davidson, is consulting with Professor Chris Hall, Chair of the UNM Department of Mechanical Engineering and Professor Peter Vorobieff from the department. \nUndergrad mechanical engineering student John Padilla is working as an intern with the company. .

The LightSail satellite yesterday overcame a series of glitches to unfurl its solar sails, a propulsion system that's entirely different to traditional rockets, thrusters or even solar panels. The prototype craft, built by the US Planetary Society and funded by public donations, is testing the ... read more Selex ES delivers air defense radars to Poland The content herein, unless otherwise known to be public domain, are Copyright 1995-2014 - Space Media Network.
