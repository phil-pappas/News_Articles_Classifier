The plan is for a January debut. \nNBCUniversal and its owner, cable and Internet giant Comcast, have been trying different ways to get young people's attention as live TV viewing declines, like investing in new media outlets BuzzFeed and Vox. \nBut Seeso will have to compete for attention in a crowded market. There's live online TV like Dish Network's Sling; Netflix, with its huge library of content; HBO's online channel; and niche services like anime-focused Crunchyroll.
