The airline expects to have the service available on a total of 10 A320 jets by next year.\nThe partnership represents the latest example of how airlines are expanding entertainment offerings to compete and generate revenue.\nThis week, Global Eagle Entertainment, a provider of airline entertainment services, announced a partnership with Sony Music to offer its songs to passengers of Global Eagle’s clients, including Southwest Airlines.\nUnited Airlines recently expanded entertainment options to include HBO shows such as “Game of Thrones” and “Entourage.”\n“Adding Netflix by itself is unlikely to motivate a passenger to switch to an airline, but when considering all offerings, it may tilt them toward choosing a particular airline,” said Jay Sorenson , an airline consultant.\nAlthough some carriers charge passengers for onboard entertainment, Sorenson said airlines don’t consider entertainment systems as big revenue sources.\nOn Virgin America, passengers can stream Netflix shows and movies for free on their own devices through March 2, after which the airline will evaluate pricing options. Starting next month, the airline will offer “House of Cards” seasons 1 through 3 on the airline’s seatback entertainment system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:21:03.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
