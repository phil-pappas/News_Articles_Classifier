The ECB rolled out the program in March 2015 to avoid a deflation scenario for the euro area and initially planned for it to run until September 2016.\nThe Dutch central banker said it was too early to speculate on whether he would support an extension of the program, according to the interview.\n\"I would like to point out that only a third of the program has been executed. We still have more than €700 billion of asset purchases to go. It is in the interest of everyone to allow the current program to be as effective as it can,\" the newspaper Quote: d Mr Knot as saying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:49:21.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
