Founded in 1995 in New York City , LivePerson has since grown into a global company with more than 1,000 employees and 12 offices around the world, and more than 18,000 brands, including many of the Fortune 500 companies. Since LivePerson pioneered online messaging, its platform has seen tremendous growth in consumer connections, from 500,000 in 2001 to now more than 25 million connections a month. \"LivePerson has remained steadfast in our mission to create meaningful connections between brands and consumers and to challenge anything that stands in the way of that. The 1-800 number is still the predominant channel of connection for brands, and it is causing a lot of consumer frustration and time wasted on hold,\" said LoCascio. \"Consumers have moved on from voice to mobile messaging when they connect with friends and families, and it's time for brands to now make that shift. We have built LiveEngage to help brands bridge this disconnect. Through LiveEngage, brands no longer put valued customers on hold, and instead stay connected through secure and scalable mobile messaging-- in the pocket of consumers.\" This theme will be the focus of Wednesday's Aspire, which will feature discussions led by industry experts and thought leaders from brands that also see the power of online and mobile messaging, including: Backcountry, Royal Bank of Scotland , TalkTalk and Westpac Bank. The one-day event will help attendees create valuable connections and gain insight into how leading brands are differentiating the customer experience through connection. Aspire will also include demonstrations of the latest features of LiveEngage, best-practices breakout sessions led by customer experts, and technology deep-dives hosted by LivePerson specialists.
