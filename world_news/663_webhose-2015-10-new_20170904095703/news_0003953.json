New systems have been created that use artificial intelligence algorithms to adjust to the user’s preferences; regulating conditions such as heat and humidity throughout the day in response to light levels, user action, and the time. Gone are the days of fiddling with the heating timer as soon as November approaches. Welcome to the homes of the future. \nThermostats such as those by Nest, Ecobee, and Honeywell, purport to learn your schedule, making sure they are not using energy to heat up the house when nobody is in, saving you money on your energy bills. Honeywell’s technology lets the user assign a ‘geofence’ of up to 7 miles around the thermostat, setting up ‘Away mode’ when the user moves past these set boundaries. \nWhen you cross over the geofence on your return home the heating will snap back on, making sure you don’t have to get back to a cold house. Nest learns how long your home takes to warm up, and can schedule the heating to come on at the optimum time for your needs. If you connect the device to your Wi-Fi, you can have access to current and updated information about your house from a mobile device. It's Getting Hot in Here \nThe nest has three temperature sensors, which are all paired with sensors that monitor humidity, light, and motion. Using all of this information, the Nest determines when you are not at home, and can adjust its schedule accordingly. AlexRoz | shutterstock \nTo monitor the temperature of the environment, the Nest uses a digital temperature sensor. Silicon-based temperature sensors are a new technology that eliminate the need for analogue-to-digital converters, a component that would be necessary for traditional temperature sensors such as thermistors, resistance temperature detectors and thermacouples.

If the difference between absolute V BE for different transistors is accounted for, a value for temperature can be measured and converted into a scale, such as degrees celsius. This enables constant temperature analysis, with measurements available at any time. \nNest similarly measures the humidity of a room to offer maximum comfort. Humidity can be measured using two separate sensing principles; capacitive measurements, and resistive measurements. \nThe former is the most common, and works by using two electrical conductors. Between these conductors, a non-conductive film layer helps to create an electrical field. Moisture in the air changes the voltage of the electrical field between the conductors. These changes in voltage are then converted into a measurement of humidity. \nHumidity sensors are commonly used in industrial settings, where humidity may adversely affect the cost output and quality of products, and in domestic settings, where our comfort relies on a quality HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) system. Creating An Atmosphere \nLighting systems have also begun to make the step into becoming a more connected, more intuitive part of user’s lives. Philips’ Hue lights emphasize a unique brand of personalization, connecting their users to their light bulbs through their phones. \nThe lights can switch color, allowing users to program an automatic switch to soft, cozier tones in the evenings. Additionally, timers and notifications can be set so that the lights strobe gently when the clock runs out making sure you don’t forget about what’s in the oven. Alba - Stacklighting | YouTube \nStack lights learn in an intuitive manner, monitoring user habits to become as efficient as possible. Stack lighting’s niche attraction is that they require no switching on, turning on themselves when it is deemed necessary, and also adjust their own hue depending on the situation and time of day. \nIn practice, this means that the bulbs emit a bluer light in the morning, and a more yellow light at night, in an attempt to mimic the tones of the light outside. This, the app’s creators suggest, may positively affect users’ health, sleep patterns and energy levels. \nStack also offers the temptation of efficiency; the lights only come on when necessary, and also adjust light levels so as not to waste any energy. Stack lights also detect motion in the house, and can contact the user if they are not at home via their mobile phone. Seeing the Light \nApplications such as Stack lighting and the Nest thermometer, where hardware adjusts itself to light conditions, are mostly provided with their information on light levels via an internet connection. goldenjack | shutterstock \nThis is the case with desktop application Flux, which assesses a user’s location to adjust light levels and blue light exposure from computer screens as the sun goes down. However, more sophisticated technologies such as Nest lso use light sensors to detect the particular light level in a room. \nAmbient light sensors detect and adjust to light levels in a similar way to the human eye. They are used in a variety of applications, such as the automatic dimming of lights in a car so as not to distract the driver, control of the intensity of car headlights and in the commercial dimming of offices and premises at night. \nThey work by converting light into a current or voltage, using a photodiode. When light enters the photodiode, most of the photons pass through, creating an electron-hole pair. An electric field separates electron-hole pairs; the electrons will move towards the cathode, and the holes towards the anode, resulting in a photocurrent. The magnitude of the photocurrent, when converted into a digital signal, informs the technology of the current light level. Homes of the Future \nTechnology is beginning to make our home lives more comfortable, with simple and innovative solutions that take much of the work out of manually monitoring the atmosphere of your home. As the size of the internet of things grows we can expect our homes to become well-tuned machines, responding to human needs as and when they are required.
