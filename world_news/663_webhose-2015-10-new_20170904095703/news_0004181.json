Instead, a notification pings your smartphone, alerting you to a sign-on attempt from a different device. Click a check to approve the log-in or an X to deny access.\nIt’s mostly meant for smartphone users, though using an alternate e-mail address is an option for those without a smartphone.\n“In the future, our Account Key will be compatible with gestures, fingerprints, facial recognition,” Dylan Casey, Yahoo’s vice president of product management, said at a news conference Wednesday. “It even has an Apple Watch integration.”\nYahoo officials touted the innovation as a means of better securing its users’ information and restricting access to accounts that are subject to billions of hack attempts daily.\nThat’s because most users’ passwords are insecure — the most common passwords leaked in the recent Ashley Madison hack included “123456,” “password” and “DEFAULT” — and are often used multiple times for different websites or services. Though they are intended to safeguard information, passwords often prove an easy entry point for hackers looking to steal information, Casey said.\nBut also, Yahoo officials said, users hate passwords. They’re easily forgotten, frustrating to recover and annoying to change, said Jeff Bonforte, Yahoo’s senior vice president of communication products.\nYahoo is the first major e-mail provider to go password-free. But, officials said, competitors probably won’t be far behind.\nGmail — the e-mail client most notably absent from the list of accounts with which Yahoo’s new app can sync — was consulted about the no-password move while it was still in the works, Casey said.\n“We hope everyone leapfrogs in this together,” Bonforte said. “But we hope that (Yahoo) will be the one to take this full mainstream.”\nThe move to abolish passwords is one of many Yahoo Mail updates pegged to the service’s 18th anniversary, including new mobile app and features that streamline contacts, enhance search and help sync with social media accounts.\nIt’s unlikely Yahoo’s new features will do much to attract users, said Andrew Frank, the research vice president at Gartner. But it might help retain the ones it already has.\n“For existing Yahoo Mail customers, I think Yahoo does have to continue to show the world that it’s innovating and improving its products and doing things that are advancing the user experience,” Frank said. “Sounds like what this might do is give people a reason to use the Yahoo e-mail app or some other phone-based client, which I think would give them more opportunity to add advertising and grow revenue.”\nBonforte estimated the cost of enhancing Yahoo’s mail features and doing away with passwords amounted to “tens of millions of dollars,” but declined to cite specific numbers.\n\nMarissa Lang is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
