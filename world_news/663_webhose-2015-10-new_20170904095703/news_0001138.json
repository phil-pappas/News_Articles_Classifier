The bus collided with a truck near the village of Puisseguin on Friday, and authorities say at least 40 people were killed.\nSavary called it one of the worst crashes in recent years in the region.\nAn official with the national gendarme service said the crash occurred near the town of Puisseguin, and that death toll may have been so unusually high because the bus caught fire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:48:49.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
