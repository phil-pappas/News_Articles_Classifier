The PI Integrator for Business Analytics enables rapid and easy utilization of sensor-based data captured within the PI System with existing advanced analytics and visualization tools within the industry. The new integration is designed to facilitate an organization's access to large volumes of time-series data within enterprise information architectures supporting data warehouse, big data and analytics initiatives. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151013005147/en/ \nWith the increasing power of visual and statistical analytics tools, organizations are seeking innovative ways to drive continuous improvement by gaining new insights and optimizing existing processes, infrastructure and assets. The PI System stores large volumes of variable frequency sensor-data in original fidelity, ensuring that the archived data always reflects the physical behavior of operational equipment. Leveraging advanced visualization and analytics tools with these datasets has always been challenging due to inconsistencies in the source data, incomplete data, missing data context and the need to leverage advanced indexing technologies to ensure scalability for data searching and access. \nOperational data has natural variations due to the cycles of equipment, processes, and environmental conditions—gaps, spikes, variable frequency, and uneven spacing are all expected when measuring attributes of the physical world. Using OSIsoft’s expertise in managing time-series data and the PI System, the PI Integrator for Business Analytics can efficiently and securely query very large volumes of historical records and align the data using cleansing, filtering and shaping rules applied by the user. The product then transposes the data into a row-column format that most BI, Data Warehouse, and Big Data systems can natively ingest and analyze. Essential to advanced analytics and visualization is context and governance of data entering systems. The new integration also ensures that context and governed data are made consistently and accurately available to the analysis engines. \n“This product transforms data into information, empowering users to perform their own analyses to make or validate decisions,” says Rodrigo Quintero, Operations Model & Planning Manager from Cemex. “Now, time is spent on discovering new insights instead of data extraction and processing.” \n“This integration will be transformational for enterprises, bringing together OT and IT organization’s data, people and tools,” said Martin Otterson, Executive VP of Sales, Marketing and Industry at OSIsoft. “Today our customers have licensed over 1.5 Billion sensor–based data streams captured from over 17,000 industrial sites in 127 countries worldwide. The new integrators enable everyone across an organization to access and benefit from the data insights using industry standard tools including big data platforms such as SAP HANA, SQL based data warehouses or visualization tools like Tibco Spotfire and Tableau.” \nTo learn more, please visit www.osisoft.com/corporate/business-analytics \nAbout OSIsoft, LLC \nOSIsoft, a global leader enabling operational intelligence, delivers an open enterprise infrastructure to connect sensor-based data, operations and people to enable real-time and actionable insights.
