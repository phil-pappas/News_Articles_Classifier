Developed by Digital Legends Entertainment and published by GAMEVIL, Afterpulse is now available for free download everywhere on App Store. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279046 \nIn addition to Apple's Metal API and full 64-bit support, the game uses full physically based deferred rendering, HDR post processing and skeletal animations with ragdolls to create true-to-life movements and photorealistic lighting, shadows, smoke and crossfire. \n\"We are thrilled with this partnership that brings worldwide live operations expertise and a deep understanding of Asian markets. It is the right match to position and service Afterpulse as a product with global reach,\" says Xavier Carrillo-Costa, CEO and Founder of Digital Legends Entertainment. \"Learnings from four previous generations of shooters for mobile have allowed us to make key decisions for Afterpulse on camera, controls, enemies and combat, and to find the right balance between run and aim action. With Afterpulse we have achieved a genuine and definitive mobile shooter experience.\" \nAlong with its top-notch graphics, Afterpulse also boasts enhanced online matchmaking for live free-for-all battles and 8-player Team Deathmatch games. Using zone server technology, each match is made with optimal player experience in mind. \nGAMEVIL USA President Kyu Lee says, \"We knew as soon as we saw Afterpulse that it would push the boundaries of mobile gaming. It not only has realistic graphics, but it also provides the perfect environment for a competitive online community. As a third-person shooter, the game is new territory for GAMEVIL, but our experience with online multiplayer games made this a natural fit.\" \nWhen players aren't battling in multiplayer matches, they can expand and personalize their arsenal and hone in their shooting skills through quick two-and-a-half minute training sessions. Players can choose their own battle style with seven types of weapons - Handgun, Shotgun, Assault, SMG, LMG, Sniper and Rockets - and power up, combine and evolve their firearms for limitless possibilities. \nStarting now until October 29, 2015 at 11:59 pm PDT, new players can download and log in to Afterpulse to receive 250 Gold (valued at 10 USD) and a 4-star iOS-exclusive Elite Operator Cap that provides increased protection against SMGs. \nAfterpulse is now available worldwide on App Store. \nDownload Afterpulse on App Store: http://bit.ly/Afterpulse \n\"Like\" Afterpulse on Facebook: http://facebook.com/AfterpulseGame \nFor more information, visit http://www.gamevil.com . \nABOUT DIGITAL LEGENDS ENTERTAINMENT \nDigital Legends Entertainment is one of the world's leading AAA mobile game developers that delivers superb gaming experience to smart phones, tablets and connected TVs across all operating systems powered by its proprietary Karisma Engine. \nDigital Legends Entertainment is recognized for its own state-of-the-art multi-platform technology, its in-depth game development experience and its original IP designs such as the award-winning games Kroll and the AAA free-to-play title The Respawnables. \nThe Respawnables (TM) and Afterpulse (TM) are registered trademarks of Digital Legends Entertainment S.L. \nFor additional information, visit www.digital-legends.com . \nFollow Digital Legends Entertainment on Twitter @Digital_Legends and \"Like\" Digital Legends Entertainment on Facebook at http://facebook.com/DigitalLegendsEntertainment . \nABOUT GAMEVIL \nGAMEVIL, with over 500 million game downloads and experience publishing hundreds of games on multiple platforms, is one of the most active and innovative mobile game companies in the world.
