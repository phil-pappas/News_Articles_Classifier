The XR32220 , XR32430 and XR32431 include an adjustable low voltage logic interface that simplifies their use in low voltage and multi-voltage systems. \nIn many applications, RS-232 transceivers interface with UARTs, MCUs and other logic devices operating from supplies less than 3.3V. The XR32220 and XR32431 feature a low voltage logic pin (V(L)) that can be used to adjust the transceiver's logic output levels and input thresholds for compatibility with lower supply voltage logic. The V(L) range is 1.65V to 5.5V. The adjustable low voltage interface eliminates the need for a level shifter/translator between the transceiver and UART or MCU. \nThe XR32220, XR32430 and XR32431 are available in RoHS compliant, green/halogen free, space-saving 4mm x 4mm QFN (XR32220) and 5mm x 5mm QFN (XR32430/31) packages. The XR32220, XR32430 and XR32431 are priced from $0.74 to $0.94 in 1,000-piece quantities. Demoboards and samples are available at www.exar.com/transceivers . \nSummary of features: -- Wide 3.0V to 5.5V supply operation -- 1.65V to 5.5V logic interface V(L) pin (XR32220, XR32431) -- Auto on-line circuitry automatically wakes up from a 1ÂµA shutdown -- Regulated charge pump yields stable RS-232 outputs regardless of V(CC) variations -- XR32220: 250kbps min transmission rate -- XR32430, XR32431: 250kbps/460kbps/1Mbps min transmission rate \nAbout Exar Exar Corporation designs, develops and markets high performance integrated circuits and system solutions for the industrial & embedded systems communications, high-end consumer and infrastructure markets.
