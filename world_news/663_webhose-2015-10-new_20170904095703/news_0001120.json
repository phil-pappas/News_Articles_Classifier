U.S. e-commerce sales are expected to hit $79.4 billion in November and December, up 14 percent from a year earlier, according to EMarketer, showing that spending continues to shift online from brick-and-mortar retailers.\nThe cloud division generated third-quarter revenue of $2.09 billion, an increase of 78 percent from a year earlier. Analysts’ estimated sales of $2 billion, according to an average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nAmazon reported a profit of $79 million, or 17 cents a share, from a loss of $437 million, or 95 cents.
