While the latter knows what they want to buy and therefore needs a wide range, the former does not know what they want and therefore product range should not be overwhelming, he told ET.Abof has a 3D trial room where customers can try the clothes priced between Rs 300 and Rs 4,000. On not offering discounts, Gupta said, \"We don't believe in getting a shirt for Rs 8,000 and give a discount on that.\"Pinakiranjan Mishra, national leader, retail and consumer products, at consultancy EY India, felt that the no-discount model could be risky. \"Ecommerce players have to move away from an only discount model eventually, but as of now these discounts are important for consumer, especially at that age group (18-25). Without discounts, there can be some dissonance,\" he said. \"Having said that, the assortment and price value equation will make all the difference for long term success,\" Mishra added.Aditya Birla Group has created a new team of about 200 people mostly based in Bengaluru and poached from online players such as Snapdeal, Myntra and Zomatoover the last nine months. The group has also tied up with third party vendors for logistics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:54:59.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
