I don’t think the contraption is necessarily a bad thing, but there’s a time and place for it, preferably in parks where there is space ... and no cars.” \nHania Hoss, 29, also from Dubai, said: “I don’t think hoverboards should be used in malls – a shopping centre is not a playground. There are dedicated areas for kids to play, and a mall would not be safe for the children or the shoppers.” \nRania Maroun, 28, also said that the use of hoverboards in indoor malls posed a danger. \n“It’s bad enough when children are running around in shopping centres, but to have them on speedier methods of transport would pose a greater danger. You wouldn’t let children roller blade in shopping centres, why let them use the scooters?”\nRabia Khalid, 26, thought the ban was a step in the right direction to keep children and shoppers safe. \n“The scooters look great, but I don’t think malls are the place for them. Are people expected to clear the way so that those with hoverboards can pass through?\n“I understand malls in the UAE are not just malls but rather a social space. With hoverboards, however, it just doesn’t work. \n“Allowing hoverboards would create the same problems it would if children were allowed to bring their bikes.”\nMs Khalid said hoverboards should be used only in designated areas. \n“I’m not sure how much the person on the hoverboard is in control of the device. There are little kids, families and elderly people in the mall.”\n\ndmoukhallati@thenational.ae \nnalwasmi@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:32:21.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
