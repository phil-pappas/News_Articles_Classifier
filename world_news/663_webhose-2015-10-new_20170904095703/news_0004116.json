They use onscreen blocks and flow charts to provide a simple programming environment without the need to dive into lines of code, memorise a long list of commands and learn the syntax of a programming language. Just like beginners' swimming lessons, the idea is to introduce young kids to the basics and nurture their enthusiasm, rather than dropping them in the deep end and hoping they can keep their head above water.\nBoth apps are very visually orientated, letting children drag blocks around the screen to build simple programs and control characters. Once children grasp the basics they can start to create simple games using programming concepts like conditions and loops in a way that's easy to understand.\nWhile these apps are a great starting point, older primary school children may start to push their boundaries. At this point they might be ready to upgrade to the more powerful desktop version of Scratch.\nVERDICT\nScratchJr is colourful and intuitive, but fast learners will soon outgrow its limitations and Hopscotch offers more room to grow – especially for budding game developers. Bright novices who fall between the recommended age groups should tinker with both apps to see if they can grasp the fundamentals of Hopscotch rather than starting in the ScratchJr class for beginners.\nSCRATCHJR\nfree (iOS/Android/Windows Phone)\nAimed at five to seven-year-olds, ScratchJr has a handy video tutorial to get kids started. Once they know the basics they can create interactive onscreen environments, such as animals which move and make noise when you tap them. ScratchJr supports sprite collisions – detecting when objects touch – and kids can edit the look of characters and record their own sounds.\nHOPSCOTCH\nfree (iOS)\nAimed at nine to 11-year olds, Hopscotch is easy to use but offers a big jump in complexity from ScratchJr – offering many of the features of desktop Scratch but in a more visually intuitive way. The ability to create variables, along with more ways to trigger onscreen events, makes Hopscotch a much more powerful game development environment than the basic ScratchJr.\nCHECK THIS OUT\nThe desktop version of Scratch (developed by MIT) lets children create far more complicated programs, but retains the idea of using building blocks rather than lines of code. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux – even on the cheap Raspberry Pi mini-PC. You can also use Scratch on the desktop to send commands to other devices, such as a Laika motor controller board at the heart of a Raspberry Pi robotics project.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:01:32.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
