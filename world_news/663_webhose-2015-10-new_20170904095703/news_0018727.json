Avanti’s superior, disruptive communications technology has the potential to generate $500m in ebitda from existing assets, it forecast. \nTelit Communications lost 15.2 per cent after the communications equipment maker cut profit guidance. It blamed delayed orders ahead of US mobile operators switching off their 2G spectrum next year. \nRWS Holdings , a patent translation and language services specialist, rose 18.7 per cent. Revenue growth rebounded towards the end of its fiscal year to September and 2016 is looking positive, with a healthy pipeline of new business, RWS said in a trading update. \nPenny stock Sovereign Mines of Africa , owner of a gold project in Guinea, rose 297 per cent after extending by one week its exclusive talks with a possible development partner it has not named. Sovereign has said it plans to raise funds if the partnership is agreed. \nHigh demand for big data analysis bolsters Fusionex \nShares in Fusionex rose 10 per cent this week, after the Aim-quoted software company said it was experiencing strong demand and had raised nearly £14m to accelerate its growth , writes Lucy Ren. \nIn a trading update on Thursday, the group — which is based in Kuala Lumpur and produces products that analyse big data to help companies improve their sales — forecast that its full-year profits would beat market expectations. \nFusionex said that, in the year to September 30, it had made progress in securing new clients and broadening the appeal of its flagship analytics platform, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. \nIt also said it had successfully raised £14m through a placing of 4.3m shares at 325p, a 1.5 per cent discount to the previous mid-market close. George O’Connor, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said that Fusionex would continue to benefit from the “revival of interest in tech shares”. Its share price closed the week at 379p. \nMobile Streams’ shares boosted by 544% profit rise \nMobile Streams ’ share price nearly trebled this week after the company — which sells apps, games and content for smartphones — reported full-year results well ahead of expectations, writes Nicholas Megaw. \nIn August, the company had issued a profit warning , saying challenges in its core Argentine market meant it would struggle to break even. Its shares duly fell 30 per cent. But results for the year to June 30 showed an increase in profits, despite falling revenues. \nRevenues of £29.1m were 40 per cent lower than in the previous year, but lower marketing and administrative costs lifted pre-tax profit by 544 per cent to £832,000. \nSimon Buckingham, chief executive, said new products and new markets such as Nigeria and India made him “confident about the company’s future prospects”. At present 87 per cent of Mobile Streams’ revenues come from Argentina, so it was badly affected by the depreciation of the peso. Mobile Streams has reduced the proportion of its cash held in Argentina to 4 per cent. \nThe shares closed at 14p on Friday, up 195 per cent for the week. \nAnimalcare revenues up 5% despite fall in pet numbers \nAnimalcare , the York-based vet supply business, reported a 5 per cent rise in annual revenues this week, to £13.5m — despite an unexplained drop in UK pet numbers, writes Kate Burgess . \nIt quoted industry figures showing the number of UK pet cats had fallen 7 per cent to just over 7m, while the number of pet dogs was down 5 per cent to 8.5m, even though the economy has improved. This, the group said, had an impact on its performance but it still achieved a 13 rise in pre-tax profits to £3m. It also said it remains debt free and strongly cash generative, allowing it to raise its dividend by a tenth to 6.1p this year — helping its shares to bounce 10 per cent. \nAnimalcare now expects to benefit from new laws next year requiring domestic pets to be microchipped — although as yet there is little evidence of pet owners rushing to comply, and the company warns of increased “price consciousness” among consumers. Shares in the company, which joined the Alternative Investment Market in 2008, have risen 42 per cent this year, and now stand at a high of 239p. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
