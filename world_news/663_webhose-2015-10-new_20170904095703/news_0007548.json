Oi has a large share of Brazil's fixed-line market, but has fallen behind rivals in the mobile race and has been trying to make up ground while cutting its heavy debt load.\nOi said on Monday that BTG received a proposal from LetterOne \"containing a proposal for the company to enter into exclusive negotiations with LetterOne with respect to a potential transaction with the objective of a possible consolidation of the Brazilian telecommunications sector, involving a potential business combination with TIM Participacoes.\"\n\"In accordance with the proposal from LetterOne, sent by BTG Pactual to the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the company's board of directors, LetterOne would be willing to make a capital contribution of up to $4.0 billion in the company (Oi), subject to the consolidation activities,\" Oi said.\nWrite to Rogerio Jelmayer at rogerio.jelmayer@wsj.com\n 26, 2015 08:05 ET (12:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:20:54.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
