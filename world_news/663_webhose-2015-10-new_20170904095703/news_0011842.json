It had a particularly strong data performance on highways.\nThe telcos were embroiled in a legal battle last year over their respective network coverage, with Telstra winning a Victorian Supreme Court battle after Optus said in advertisements it had similar coverage to Telstra. Telstra successfully argued those advertisements were “false, misleading and deceptive.”\nVodafone, which came in third place overall, improved on its 2014 score by just under 40 per cent. Telstra improved by 7 per cent, a mild improvement that was reflective of its strong 2014 scores.\nThe results come from the P3 CommsDay Mobile Benchmark 2015, a test conducted by German consulting and testing services firm P3 communications that involved specially equipped vehicles driving across areas that represented around 70 per cent of the Australian population.\nCommsDay said all three operators should be pleased with their year-on-year improvements, and said further improvements could be expected next year as Telstra Optus and Vodafone each roll out their LTE capabilities, which should lead to fewer dropouts and much faster call setup times.\nThe smartphones used for testing were the Samsung S5 Cat 4 smartphone for voice testing and the Samsung Note 4 Cat 6 smartphone for data, running commercially available firmware.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/optus-closing-the-gap-on-telstras-mobile-coverage/story-e6frgakx-1227568832576"], "published": "2015-10-14T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:18:52.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
