These professionals are revenue generators as well as brand ambassadors and provide a critical feedback loop on products, UI and nuances that can’t be discerned by sales and product developers alone. All that in addition to playing their all-important interface role,“ said Jaspar Weir, President and Co-founder of TaskUs. \"We’ve seen that understanding the customer can drive change in a company from new user interfaces to product offerings. Smart companies are taking note and bringing in the customer support team earlier in the decision-making process.” \nFeatured speakers at the event included Tom Chi, former head of experience at Google X who led the development of Google Glass; Tammy Kernz, head of customer support at Google Express; Ian MacBean, director of user operations at Yelp; Kirsty Traill, VP customer support at Hootsuite; and David Ginsburg, VP and global head of user services at Box. Key takeaways included: Customer support can act as a source for insights to influence the organization's strategies including product and service offerings. Customer support analytics are crucial to understanding how customers are flowing through the company ecosystem. Customer support knows where the hang-ups are first. Customer support teams should be the product team’s best friends. CX teams develop the narrative around the impacts of product or service defects that can be valuable to tweak an offering and support critical decision-making around important failure points. Customer support teams need to do a better job of promoting themselves and building relationships within their companies in order to exercise influence. \nThe CX Summit, hosted by TaskUs, the world’s leading customer support outsourcing company for rapidly growing startups.
