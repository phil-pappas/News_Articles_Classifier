The ability to accurately measure glucose levels in blood is essential for people afflicted with diabetes so they can effectively manage the disease, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA). \n\"The results of these studies show ARKRAY products meet new ISO accuracy performance requirements for blood glucose meters,\" said ARKRAY USA President Jonathan Chapman . \"These studies demonstrate our commitment to provide affordable, accurate blood glucose meters and test strips that help those afflicted with diabetes to live a more fulfilling and healthier life.\" \nDiabetes, or diabetes mellitus, is a metabolic type of disease in which affected people have high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate (Type 2), or because the islet cells in the pancreas no longer produce insulin (Type 1, sometimes referred to juvenile diabetes). People with untreated diabetes typically experience frequent urination, become increasingly thirsty and hungry. The ADA estimates that more than 30 million Americans suffer from either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and that 25.9% of American's 65 years of age or greater will have diabetes. \nAbout ARKRAY USA , Inc. \nARKRAY USA , Inc. is a division of ARKRAY, a global leader in diabetes care with headquarters in Kyoto, Japan .
