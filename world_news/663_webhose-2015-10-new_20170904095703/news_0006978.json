The scanned photo will only be handled by the roller without causing damage. With a flatbed photo scanner, users need four steps to scan: lift the scanner’s lid, lay the photos out one-by-one on the scanning bed, close the lid and scan. ePhoto Z300 replaces all of these steps with a single picture insertion. Once the photo has been detected, the scanner grabs it and scans it automatically.\nePhoto Z300 is bundled with easy-to-use software that includes some useful photo enhancement tools and effects that easily fine tune the scanned images, making it fun to relive old memories and enjoy making them better.\n“The ePhoto Z300 makes it easy to convert your old photo albums, which is especially nice during the holidays,” said Robert Fuchs, marketing manager for Plustek USA. “The ePhoto is designed to take in photos one-by-one to ensure smooth scanning and turn them into high-quality digital images, ensuring they will keep forever.”\nKey features of the ePhoto Z300 include:\nCCD sensor captures high quality of colors Detects and scans photos automatically Soft-touched rollers provide added protection to prevent photos from scratches Easy-to-use ePhoto software features color enhancement and effect tools Scans both documents and photos up to 8.5” in width Bundles with ABBYY FineReader 9.0 OCR and NewSoft Presto!
