Booking services have to have customer complaint mechanisms and surge pricing will be banned during emergencies.\nA second stage of regulation, starting after legislation is passed, will require ride-share drivers to have compulsory third party and property insurance.\nThe founder and CEO of mobile taxi payments platform ingogo, Hamish Petrie, said he fully supports a level playing field and said it was encouraging to see innovation being embraced by government.\n\"We applaud the ACT government's move to reduce regulatory burdens and costs for taxi drivers so that they can more effectively compete with other point to point transport models,” he said.\n\"However, we do question whether a truly level playing field has been achieved by the ACT government reforms and we have concerns that this model may face challenges in larger, more complex markets, should it form a precedent for other territories.\"\nHe said he has several concerns, including the high price of taxi licence fees which will remain high at $10,000, and the high costs of security cameras that taxi drivers have to wear.\nThe taxi industry was more scathing. The Australian Taxi Industry Assocation CEO Blair Davies criticised the ACT government’s announcement that it would be legalising ride-hailing as “rushed and flawed” and as nothing more than a pitch for popularity rather than an example of good government.\nThe ATIA said it believes the ACT Government has come up with a decision that is for Uber’s benefit, rather than one for the greater good of all Canberrans.\n“The ACT Government had the opportunity to show real leadership on this issue but instead they failed to work up comprehensive solutions with key stakeholders such as insurers, the taxi industry, the hire car industry and even its own CTP scheme administrators,” he said.\n“This failure in process has distorted the Government’s decision in favour of one company, Uber, a multi-billion dollar foreign company that is currently fighting with the ATO because it wants its ride-hailing drivers to be able to provide services without having to declare and remit GST on those services.\n“State and Territory governments rely on GST revenues to prop up their budgets, so a company as big as Uber, taking the stand that it is, surely doesn’t need or deserve handouts and help ups from this tier of government.\"\nMeanwhile 13CABS chief operating officer Stuart Overell said he was pleased to see the ACT government recognise the need for change, but was still concerned about small competitors operating anonymous and cash services without visibility or accountability.\n“The move to stop ride-sharing services from picking up ‘hails’ is sensible, but must be enforced to stop anonymous services,” he said.\n\"It’s important because ride-sharing vehicles are not fitted with the same security features as taxis, which have tamper-proof, always-on GPS and a permanently powered, fire resistant security camera.\"\nThe ACT government believes its regulations strike a balance between allowing the sharing economy to thrive in Canberra while recognising the pressure it puts on existing taxi drivers and owners.\n\"These reforms are a win for Canberrans and those travelling to the territory, improving access to diverse transport options and competitive pricing,\" Transport Minister Shane Rattenbury said in a statement.\n﻿With AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:07:07.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
