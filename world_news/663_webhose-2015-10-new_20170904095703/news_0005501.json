Imgur Dollar Shave Club is known for its ads poking fun at competitors like Schick and Gillette, claiming last month to have become the No. 2 best-selling razor in the U.S. Now, Gillette is fighting back with a rather unorthodox approach: turning negative tweets about the startup into ads. And with Dollar Shave Club still perceived as \"the little guy,\" it's not going very well. Over the past few days, Promoted Tweets from Gillette have started showing up in news feeds from Gillette customers who have evidently tried but weren't impressed by Dollar Shave Club's subscription service. Tried Dollar Shave but the blades just weren't as good. Back w @Gillette . You get what you pay for! pic.twitter.com/AAl4ZKY0Aj — John Caron (@jcaron2) July 15, 2015 This is way too funny @Gillette trolling @DollarShaveClub with promoted tweets & That Bigot Archie Bunker is sad pic.twitter.com/bTqIXbyARG One tweet in particular from Ermin Maslic, an account executive at VaynerMedia, raised eyebrows yesterday. The way the situation played out was unusual. In August, Maslic tweeted that he didn't like Dollar Shave Club's products, calling out Gillette. Tried Dollar Shave Club and didn't like the blades at all. You've won me back @Gillette — Ermin Maslic (@erminmaslic) August 12, 2015 Now, the tweet is running as a paid ad, with some questioning whether VaynerMedia was involved in the stunt. This morning, VaynerMedia's Gary Vaynerchuk responded on Twitter, saying his shop doesn't work with Gillette and that Maslic's tweet was sent before he worked at the agency. — Gary Vaynerchuk (@garyvee) October 8, 2015 Per Vaynerchuk, Gillette asked Maslic to use his tweet, but he was not paid. But the VaynerMedia confusion is just the beginning for Gillette, which is getting all kinds of negative reactions. The social campaign has sparked a ton of backlash on Twitter from users who say the P&G brand's name-dropping ads are too aggressive—showing the risk big-name marketers take when calling out an underdog. Not enjoying the \"battle\" between @Gillette and @DollarShaveClub that's happening via ads on my feed. I use neither. Go @SchickHydro ! — Americo Capodagli (@americocap) October 8, 2015 I want to say something mean about Dollar shave club and something nice about Gillette so they'll pay to promote my dumb tweets — K. Thor Jensen (@kthorjensen) October 8, 2015 im never buying a @Gillette product again after seeing them pay to promote tweets trolling their competitors like @DollarShaveClub . — justin from info (@justinstoned) October 8, 2015 So @DollarShaveClub has the best way of advertising on the market. Get Gillette to promote themselves awfully while trying to bash dsc — Crazy Duck (@TehCrazyDuck) October 8, 2015 Really all these stupid promoted tweets from @Gillette knocking @DollarShaveClub have me wanting to give @DollarShaveClub a try.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:44:43.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
