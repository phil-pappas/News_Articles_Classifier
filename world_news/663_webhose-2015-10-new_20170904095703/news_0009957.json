The monitors segment is further classified into three sub-segments, namely low acuity monitors, mid acuity monitors and high acuity monitors. Monitors segment is a high value and low volume segment, which held 38.0% share of the global vital signs monitoring devices market in 2014. The monitors segment is expected to expand at a significant CAGR, more than the CAGR projected for the global vital signs monitoring devices market over the forecast period. Furthermore, the temperature measurement devices segment is sub-segmented into liquid-filled thermometers, digital thermometers and infrared thermometers. Temperature measurement devices was the most dominant segment among all other sub-segments in terms of volume, which stood at 26,813,778 units in the global vital signs monitoring devices market by the end of 2014. Meanwhile, the blood pressure measurement devices segment has been sub-segmented into sphygmomanometers and automated blood pressure monitors. The standalone pulse oximeters segment is projected to be the fastest growing segment in the market owing to its penetration into home care settings. \nRequest a Free Sample Report: http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-410 \nGrowth of the global vital signs monitoring devices market is mainly driven by the increasing importance of vital signs monitoring devices in home care settings, the expanding application of vital signs monitoring devices in the sports industry and the surge in ambulatory surgical centres across various countries, which actively employ vital signs monitoring devices routinely. The global vital signs monitoring devices market is fairly fragmented and is prone to the usage of large number of low quality products, which could hamper growth of the market. Also, the high end, advanced vital signs monitoring devices are being adopted at a lower rate into the market, especially in the developing regions, which again is acting as a restraint for the market. \nThe global vital signs monitoring devices market is fragmented with a few major players and several small players. This trend is expected to continue over the forecast period as well. This is attributed to the low production cost of products such as thermometers. The vital signs monitoring devices companies are engaged in increasing awareness about their products through various marketing activities that are carried out in end use segments such as hospitals, clinics, ambulatory surgical centers and home care settings.
