Not surprisingly, global research reveals customers prefer ‘blended’ over ‘siloed’ multichannel experience\nBoston, MA (PRWEB) October 19, 2015\nIndustry analyst and market research firm Hypatia Research Group announces a webinar scheduled for Thursday October 29th entitled Best Practices in Engagement and Loyalty, hosted by CRMXchange with support from Bright Pattern, InContact and SparkCentral.\nWebinar: Best Practices in Customer Engagement and Loyalty\nWhen: Thursday October 29th, 2:00 pm EDT\nRegistration Link\nHypatia’s primary research finds that enterprises now interact with and support their customer in ways that are constantly becoming more varied and increasingly complex. Customers, already suffering from extreme information overload, are receiving more than 10X messages per hour than just five years ago. Getting and keeping them engaged now requires a team of professionals rather than just one very overworked marketing specialist as customers expect that brands will interact with them through ANY channel of preference with both historical and contextual awareness. Hypatia Research Group surveyed more than 1000 global organizations and only respondents with direct accountability for selection or use of software and services for customer service & support functions were utilized for this primary research.\nAccording to Leslie Ament, “Our analysis shows that 70% of global organizations now offer customers the option of interacting independently through various channels due to customer demand, preference and expectation of anywhere, anytime, and any channel of support. However, the proverbial Achilles Heel in offering a multi-channel customer experience is when companies continue to offer this via a siloed approach rather than as a blended experience. Providing customers a truly seamless, ‘blended’ experience should be an organizational goal for all customer-centric companies.”\nREGISTER NOW to hear Leslie Ament, Senior Vice President, Research & Principal Analyst, Hypatia Research Group as she discusses best practices and trends in global multi-channel engagement that foster customer loyalty and enhance ROI.\nWhat attendees will learn:\nHow companies are increasing customer engagement through services and tools such as mobile, chat, SMS messaging, screen sharing, co-browsing, and video; The changing priorities and return on investment from responding to customers via social media; How to identify the best people and information resources to respond more quickly to customer inquiries;\nWhy “guided intelligence” reduces customer effort while increasing agent productivity.\nAbout Hypatia Research Group\nIndustry analyst and market research firm Hypatia Research Group delivers high impact market intelligence, industry benchmarking, best practice, and vendor selection research for how businesses use technology and service providers to capture, manage, analyze and apply customer and market intelligence to enhance performance and accelerate growth.
