(Zhong Zhi/Getty Images) \nLos Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer owns 4% of social media company Twitter Inc., he revealed in a tweet on Friday. \nIt’s unclear how his stake will impact Twitter’s new push to revive its once-stellar user growth and get advertisers to spend more on its service. But Ballmer’s proclamation already has been apparent good news for Twitter shares, which were up nearly 5% in Friday’s trading to above $31. \nEarlier this month, Ballmer used Twitter to call the San Francisco company “remarkable” and said it has an “amazing chance to innovate and grow,” especially under its recently re-appointed Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. Good job @twitter , @twittermoments innovation, @jack Ceo, leaner, more focused. Glad I bought 4% past few months. Like @alwaleedbinT move too — Steve Ballmer (@Steven_Ballmer) October 16, 2015 I think @twitter is remarkable. There is amazing chance to innovate and grow. Excited to see progress with @jack as CEO Impressive dude! — Steve Ballmer (@Steven_Ballmer) October 6, 2015 \nStill, Ballmer’s large stake in Twitter came as a surprise. Ballmer over the past few months has become one of the largest individual Twitter shareholders, owning more of the company than even Dorsey, who’s sold off significant chunks over the past year. Twitter co-founder Ev Williams and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal own slightly more than Ballmer. \nLarge shareholders tend to get greater acknowledgement from management, and it’s possible Ballmer could come to advise Twitter on strategy or help them form connections in sports, media and tech. Twitter declined to comment. \nIn recent days, Twitter has announced new products, the layoffs of 8% of its workforce and hired a Google executive as executive chairman. It’s all intended to put Twitter “on a stronger path to grow,” Dorsey said in an email to employees this week. \nFor his part, Ballmer hasn’t exactly had the Midas touch. This year, in his first season as Clippers owner, the team lost in the second round of the playoffs. \nAnd as chief executive of Microsoft from 2000 to 2014, he was slow to steer the company toward smartphones and tablets. Shares of Microsoft dropped about 40% over his tenure by the time he announced his intention to retire. He continues to own 4% of Microsoft, and Forbes estimates his net worth as $23 billion. \nChat with me on Twitter @peard33", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:11:39.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
