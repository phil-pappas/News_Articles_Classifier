Monica Eaton-Cardone of dispute mitigation firm Chargebacks911 weighs in.\nTampa Bay, FL (PRWEB) October 05, 2015\nAccording to the recently released 2015 Mobile Payment Security Study, out of more than 900 cybersecurity professionals surveyed, 47% of respondents revealed that mobile payments are not secure and carry significant perceived security risks. The study, which was conducted by global cybersecurity association ISACA, reported that 87% of those respondents predict there will be a large increase in the number of mobile payments data breaches over the next 12 months. (1) Monica Eaton-Cardone, COO of leading dispute mitigation and loss prevention firm Chargebacks911, says the perceived lack of security in mobile payments technology has had a negative impact on its adoption, pointing out that consumers are slow to use mobile payment technology such as Apple Pay or Google Wallet despite the convenience of it.\nISACA ranked the vulnerabilities associated with mobile payment based on the survey data:\nAt 26%, use of public WiFi was the highest ranked vulnerability; Lost or stolen devices was the second highest ranked vulnerability at 21%, With phishing and shmishing (phishing via text) at 18%, and Weak passwords at 13%. (1)\nThere is a striking discrepancy between consumer interest in mobile payment technology and actual use of mobile payment technology. Tech Target reported that 57% of consumers were interested in mobile payment technologies; however, only 3% of mobile phone owners used their mobile wallets for in-store purchases in the past three months. (2)\n“The perceived and actual risks associated with mobile payment technology is precisely the reason why adoption of mobile payment technology, such as Apple Pay, has been slow and stilted at best,” says Eaton-Cardone. “Consumers are slow to adopt the technology, and developers are slow to invest new technology due to perceived lack of interest. However, improvement in technology and security would improve the customer's willingness to use said technology. It becomes a Catch-22.”\nAccording to Future Market Insights, the global mobile payment market is projected to be worth $2.8 trillion by 2020. (1) Because this opens the door for an increased security fraud, Eaton-Cardone urges the tech industry to create new technologies to protect consumers.\nAccording to LexisNexis, Payment card fraud in the United States rose by 38% from $23 billion in losses in 2013 to $32 billion in losses in 2014. This loss from fraud is equivalent 0.68% of revenue. (3) Per Eaton-Cardone, EMV is the best option for fraud protection as EMV relies on the customer's past history to determine if the purchase is valid or not. By utilizing a micro-chip to store sensitive information, the customer's buying patterns and spending habits are analyzed in about a millisecond in order to detect suspicious activity. Eaton-Cardone says EMV will soon become the go-to for consumers and merchants alike.\nEaton-Cardone founded Chargebacks911 to address an unmet need in the credit card industry, and taught herself how to build the IT component required to support the business. Through her work in put processes in place for e-Merchants and the banking system regarding ethical practices and work out resolutions where there aren't any currently, Eaton-Cardone has seen first-hand that gender should not stop anyone from going after their dreams. As Eaton-Cardone is in the minority of women who holds an executive position in a technical field, she has been an advocate of long-term solutions for diversity in the tech industry.\nAbout Monica Eaton-Cardone:\nMonica Eaton-Cardone is an entrepreneur and business leader with expertise in technology, e-commerce, risk relativity and payment-processing solutions.
