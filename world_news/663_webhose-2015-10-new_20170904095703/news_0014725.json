I wonder if we can have a chat.\nI don’t want to sound like I’m not a fan, because truly, I’m a fashion tragic. I’m a stereotypical shoe fetishist, I say ‘vintage’ instead of op shop, I once even described green as chartreuse. But seriously, there are things I’ve read lately — looks that are apparently hot and trends that I’m supposed to get on board — that I don’t think you’ve thought through.\nNow, I’m used to haute couture being a touch out of reach, and I like it that way. When I pore over a Paris Fashion Week catwalk like some people enjoy porn, I want the clothes to be utterly unwearable. Ridiculous and glorious and outrageous next to my street wear, in the way Serena Williams would look if she played at my daughter’s tennis club. It’s what high art should be. I want the clothes to be a mashup of Futuristic/Kimono/Tarzan/Zombie/Tupperware.\nIs this a trend now? Picture: Instagram\nIt doesn’t matter if these shoes cost you $5000. They are hideous, and they are slippers.\nNow this is what we call a fancy hoodie. Unless you are Anne Hathaway, don’t try this at home. Picture: Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images\nFreckles are back in vogue, literally. And these ones are painted on.
