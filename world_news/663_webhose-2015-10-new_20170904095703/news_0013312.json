(NASDAQ: CDRB), an enterprise software development firm that licenses its proprietary software solution to enable simplified secure access and communications between PC and Mac environments on virtually any computer, tablet, or smartphone, today, in light of Apple's release of its first update to Mac's newest operating system OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 this past Wednesday, issued an update on its impending release of iRAPP for OS X El Capitan 10.11.1. \nAs mentioned in its September 18th press release , the Company made the following specific changes to iRAPP to support El Capitan: (1) the remote login behavior updated to meet El Capitan security standards and in some cases enhanced to improve the system interaction with iRAPP; (2) the network subsystem was improved and optimized for better performance in secure remote scenarios; and (3) all server components were revamped to meet Apple's 'System Integrity Protection' requirements. \nTom Moreno, President of Code Rebel, commented, \"When new OS X features are introduced, we work diligently to support them through our iRAPP protocol. Given the quick and successful completion and release of iRAPP Beta for El Capitan 10.11, we have been careful to not lose our momentum over the past few weeks.\" \nHe continued, \"Our team has been focused on fully merging code into a production build and finalizing roll out testing to customers. Based on customer feedback, we identified an isolated QA issue related to the 'file mounting feature' which has since been fixed. We have installed 10.11.1 and tested the latest build of iRAPP v2.8.8552 released 2015/10/12, and it's working. No critical issues have been found. Now in the final stage of testing, assuming no other issues arise, we anticipate its release this coming week.\" \nMac's OS X El Capitan, released on September 30, 2015, has significantly improved performance, spotlight search, multi-window management, metal graphics technology, as well as a revamped notes app, pinned sites and tab mute for safari. The OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of Macs. Other highlights include the improvement of VoiceOver reliability and addition of over 150 new emoji characters with full Unicode 7.0 and 8.0 support. \nLeading Code Rebel customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as AT&T, Microsoft, Cisco and Bloomberg, use iRAPP to enhance enterprise collaboration, employee productivity and services.
