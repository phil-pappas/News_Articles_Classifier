(PRWEB) October 22, 2015\nPointSource , a mobile design and development firm, has developed the API reference implementation that will accelerate the Pinterest Buyable Pin integration for IBM WebSphere Commerce customers. With this technology, PointSource can enable retailers to capture a new mobile revenue channel targeting Pinterest’s 100 million users.\nAccording to a study by ComScore, Pinterest reaches nearly 30 percent of the digital population in the U.S, and data from Ahalogy shows that 52 percent of Pinterest’s daily users access the app while shopping in store. Last week, the social media site announced that it was expanding its mobile commerce platform to allow the buyable pin API to work with IBM WebSphere Commerce. PointSource, working with both IBM and Pinterest, has developed an API reference implementation to accelerate that integration.\n“We are excited about the opportunity this provides for IBM customers to expand their mobile commerce channels and connect with their target customers more effectively,” said Stephanie Trunzo, chief digital officer at PointSource. “Our team is eager to partner with new brands to leverage the trend toward aggregator apps and help retailers create comprehensive mobile strategies.”\nThe PointSource software supports product feeds, carts, shipping methods, payment information and order status. External dependencies include WebSphere Commerce, a payment platform like Stripe or Braintree, order management that is completely integrated into WebSphere Commerce and monitoring capabilities.\n\"As an IBM Premier Business Partner, PointSource brings significant value to our clients with their knowledge and experience working with IBM Commerce solutions,\" says Adam Orentlicher, director of eCommerce offerings & strategy for IBM. \"Their Pinterest Buyable Pin API reference implementation will help merchants leveraging WebSphere Commerce and Commerce on Cloud to enable consumers to move from a pin to a purchase with ease.\"\nThis announcement follows several esteemed achievements for PointSource this year, including a second year on the Inc. 5000 and three Hermes Creative Awards. The company was recently named one of North Carolina’s fastest-growing companies by Business North Carolina Magazine and made the Triangle Business Journal’s 2015 Best Places to Work list.\nTo learn more about PointSource and how it can accelerate your brand’s path to Pinterest integration, visit http://www.pointsource.com .\nAbout PointSource\nPointSource blends the creative energy of an agency with the technology savvy of an enterprise firm to build mobile solutions that solve complex problems and change businesses.
