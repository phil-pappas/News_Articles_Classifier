(TSX:PER) (“Perk” or the “Company”), a leading cloud-based mobile rewards platform provider, announced today the official launch of Perk.TV, a website owned and operated by the Company where members can earn Perk Points for watching popular videos in their internet web browser. Since the launch of Perk.TV on September 23 rd , over 10 million videos have been viewed to completion by members. \nThe Company launched Perk.TV based on market trends indicating advertisers’ allocation of budget continues to be strong in a mobile web and browser environment and consumer media consumption also remaining strong on those platforms. Perk.TV provides users with yet another vehicle for which they earn Perk Points, and complements Perk’s other quality applications as well as Perk’s Appsaholic Rewards Platform for third party vendors. \nTed Hastings, Chief Executive Officer of Perk, stated: “While typically our members have earned Perk Points through our wide selection of mobile applications, we realize there is a significant percentage of consumer attention and advertising dollars still being spent on traditional websites accessible by desktop and mobile users. This allows our Company to further differentiate its revenue stream by entering new partnerships with advertisers that generally focus on reaching consumers through website advertising. Perk.TV is off to a great start and we believe this success will continue as we grow our user base and expand our advertising network.” \nAbout Perk.com Inc. \nAs a leading mobile rewards platform, Perk brings together the interests of consumers, advertisers, and publishers by offering users rewards such as Perk Points which is a digital reward system. Perk Points can be redeemed for gift cards, cash, or loaded on to Perk Plastik, a re-loadable branded debit card. In addition, Perk works with brands and publishers to reach consumers through truly engaging and innovative formats using rewards as a way to achieve maximum engagement of their brands and products. \nPerk currently owns and operates 12 mobile applications that allow members to earn Perk Points. Perk also operates numerous websites as well as AppTrailers, a leading mobile video rewards app and Perk.TV. In addition to offering Perk Points to members through its own mobile applications and websites, Perk launched Appsaholic Software Development Kit which allows mobile and desktop publishers to utilize Perk’s rewards system to engage and entice users through the publisher’s own applications and websites. \nAdditional information about Perk can be found at its corporate website: ir.perk.com. \nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements \nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including with respect to Perk’s business, Perk’s ability to grow its active consumer base; user and advertiser engagement; Perk’s ability to establish new marketing partnerships; Perk’s ability to expand into new markets; and Perk’s ability to acquire and integrate new businesses and technologies.
