It takes content and services from a single source, and channels them to in-built native mobile apps and a responsive portal. It offers a complete content management system, personalized analytics and a development kit that will allow in-house developers to write their own screens. \nAmong other features are: Native apps and portals managed through a single platform; Polling functions that teachers and students can use in real time in the classroom; Attendance monitoring via iBeacon technology; and Cross-system integration that allows institutions to deliver security alerts and services to students via their devices. \n\"There is an app for everything in life,\" said Derek Rathel, director of mobile solutions for campusM. \"However, most universities do not have a single, official app for prospects, students and alumni. campusM allows administrators to track, monitor and increase engagement.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:08:05.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
