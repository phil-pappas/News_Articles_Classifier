A federal court filing says there have been 76 thefts by Los Alamos personnel in 2015.\nAn affidavit says lab officials contacted federal investigators on Sept. 30 to say a subcontractor's employee had stolen items.\nThe day before, police responded to a call about a man throwing materials into bushes near the lab. Officers found several radioactive items, including a band saw that tested 500 times above the allowable limit for contamination.\nA Los Alamos spokesman referred questions to the FBI , which didn't respond to a request for comment.\n———\nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com \n0 Shares Email Star Comments Feds Investigate Multiple Thefts of Radioactive Items at Lab   \n  \" \nPoliceman   \nGoogle   \" \nLong-  \" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:53:32.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
