Additionally, Oracle has announced enhanced capabilities in Oracle Order Management Cloud and across the entire Oracle Supply Chain Management Cloud. Together these enable manufacturers to operate their supply chain in a modern cloud environment across the key business processes of: Source to Settle (including Procure to Pay and full direct material support) Ideas to Commercialization (for both manufactured and purchased products) Order to Cash (and with Oracle CX Cloud, to extend to marketing, sales and quoting) Plan to Produce (combining planning, manufacturing and fulfillment) \nBusinesses in industrial manufacturing and high tech industries face an unprecedented level of complexity when managing their global supply chains. The global economy has forced companies to innovate quickly, execute rapidly and scale their supply chains, all while minimizing costs. With the additions of Oracle Planning Central Cloud and Oracle Manufacturing Cloud, manufacturers now have a comprehensive, fully integrated suite of supply chain applications delivered in the cloud to address these challenges. \n\"Today's modern supply chain requires best-in-class technology powering modern holistic business process, and for this to be delivered on the Cloud,\" said Rick Jewell, senior vice president, Supply Chain Management Applications, Oracle. \"Oracle SCM Cloud now addresses all those needs with innovative and comprehensive solutions, and because this is also part of the Oracle Public Cloud, manufacturing companies can now operate their entire business on a single, integrated cloud platform -- all from Oracle.\" \nOracle Planning Central Cloud To streamline the plan to produce process into a single efficient flow, Oracle introduced Oracle Planning Central Cloud. This is a new highly responsive planning application that integrates supply and demand planning into a modern graphical and intuitive analytics workbench. It combines forecasting, inventory and supply planning with a multi-dimensional analytics framework and will provide intelligent recommendations by presenting complex supply chain information in a simple and business focused format. This allows planners to identify what is important, rapidly target the best resolution and put it into effect. Oracle Planning Central's tight integration with other Oracle SCM Cloud applications eliminates the gap between planning and execution by allowing businesses to trigger material transfers, manufacturing work orders and purchase requisitions based upon the results of the plan. \nOracle Manufacturing Cloud The new Oracle Manufacturing Cloud will give businesses the ability to efficiently set up and run production operations. The application enables customers to design the manufacturing process and processing standards, create and manage work orders and monitor shop floor status. This helps them to quickly and easily execute jobs and analyze and control work order costs. Oracle Manufacturing Cloud was designed for ease of use. It starts with an industry standard data model to define plant data, but presents it with a modern user interface to give the engineer an advanced graphical editing tool to build a sequence of operations that defines each manufacturing process. The application offers fully integrated support for multiple processes (build to stock, configure to order, assemble to order, outsourced) from product innovation to production to comprehensive cost management. Oracle Manufacturing Cloud also integrates with Oracle PLM Cloud and Oracle Product Master Data Management Cloud, to streamline the entire product innovation process from idea to concept to design to commercialization to manufacturing. \nOracle Order Management Cloud Oracle Order Management Cloud can now support multiple order capture sources such as Oracle CPQ Cloud, Oracle Commerce Cloud, EDI or legacy systems. It also includes its own built-in order capture, pricing and configurator capability, that can also be used to provide cross-channel order maintenance and management capabilities. Oracle Order Management Cloud supports fulfillment within the Oracle SCM Cloud, as well as multiple external fulfillment sources. It supports complex fulfillment flows such as configure-to-order, drop-ship, back-to-back and internal material transfer flows. \nExpanded SCM Capabilities to support Holistic Business Flows Planning Central, Cloud Manufacturing Cloud and updates to Order Management Cloud are complemented by existing and expanded capabilities in the rest of the Oracle SCM Cloud portfolio, including: Direct material support in Oracle Procurement Cloud Complex fulfillment and inventory movement flows in Oracle Inventory Cloud Standard costing in Oracle Cost Management Cloud Expanded integration and change management between Oracle Innovation Management Cloud, Oracle Product Development Cloud, Oracle Product Hub Cloud, Oracle Manufacturing Cloud and Oracle Projects Cloud. \nThis combination has been designed to support holistic business flows, with fully integrated and consistent processes, while still preserving the ability to deploy solutions in a targeted or incremental manner. \nThe preceding is intended to outline our general product direction.
