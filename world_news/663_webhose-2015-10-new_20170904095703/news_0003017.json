But Justice Duncan Ouseley disagreed, ruling that the app relies on GPS signals and did not operate in the same way.\nThe association said it would appeal.\nTransport for London said it would ensure regulatory requirements were met and said it would gauge public opinion on a range of potential changes to the rules for private hire vehicles, including stricter rules on insurance and English language skills.\n\"We know that some ideas put forward for consultation are controversial, which is why we want as many people as possible to tell us what they think to help shape the future of private hire in London,\" said Leon Daniels, Transport for London's managing director of surface transport.\nUber has come under fire in several European countries, including France, Italy and Spain.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:46:18.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
