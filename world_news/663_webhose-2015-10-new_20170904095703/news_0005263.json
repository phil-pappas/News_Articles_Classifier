Virginia Commonwealth University and West Virginia's Marshall University , both Blackboard customers, will be tapping into a bundle of services that includes the learning management system (LMS) software, as well as collaboration, content sharing and analytics functionality. Virginia Commonwealth worked with Blackboard to develop the bundled solution. \nInternet2 is a collaborative organization made up of universities and research organizations that tackle common technology challenges and develop offerings for its members. \nThe Blackboard suite, which is managed by the vendor, has a discounted price and includes: Blackboard Learn, Collaborate, Analytics for Learn and Outcomes Assessment â€” akin to the company's Learning Insight set of applications. Internet2 members will also gain access to xpLor , a cross-LMS content sharing and discovery technology that allows users to import content and then tag, rate and align it to learning outcomes. The bundle also gives access to the company's consulting services and help desk support.
