The professor was a major driving force behind the open letter calling for a ban on killer robots. Photo: Ryan Stuart\nThe Terminator analogies are inevitable, but Toby Walsh says we're still a good 50 years away from having killer robots quite as sophisticated as that.\nIn fact, it's the \"stupid\" nature of technologies being used in the so-called \"third wave\" of warfare, known as autonomous weapons systems – killer robots, for short – that has him worried. Very worried.\nOnly a few days ago an anonymous whistlebower, already being dubbed the \"second Snowden\", leaked classified US military material detailing its use of drones in warfare.\nThe \"drone papers\", published in The Intercept , revealed that in a single five-month period during a US operation in Afghanistan, nearly 90 per cent of people killed in drone strikes were not the intended targets.\nAdvertisement Without human intervention, Walsh says, that figure would be \"even worse, guaranteed\".\nThough he calls himself an \"accidental activist\", the UNSW artificial intelligence professor and researcher at Data61 (formerly NICTA) sees it as his scientific duty to inform humanity of the impending, self-imposed peril.\nWalsh was a major driving force behind the open letter calling for a ban on killer robots which was signed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and more than 2000 AI researchers in July, helping bring significant media attention to the issue. A number of NGOs including Human Rights Watch have been campaigning on the issue since 2012 under the umbrella group Stop Killer Robots.\nWalsh and his colleagues fear an arms race in autonomous weapons could have disastrous consequences. Once companies begin manufacturing these weapons, they risk falling into the hands of enemies including terrorists or rogue states. A market flooded with swarms of cheap, terrifying, autonomous weapons – which cannot compute the ethics or intricacies of warfare – unleashed upon innocent people is a worst case scenario.\nIt's not going to be \"clean\", simulated warfare with robots killing robots.\n\"That would be a good thing but rather naive and idealistic,\" Walsh says.\n\"Wars are very asymmetric; they're not fought between nation and nation, but against terrorists, rogue nations etc. They're not going to sign up to 'gentleman's rules' – otherwise, why not just settle it with a chess match or tiddlywinks?\n\"We need to start acting now.\"\nWalsh is in New York this week to discuss the issues and answer ambassadors' questions at a side event at the United Nations' First Committee on Disarmament & International Security, which meets annually in October.\nWhile several nations have openly supported a ban on lethal autonomous weapons, the big names – the US, Britain, Israel, China – are missing from the list. Australia has yet to make a formal statement on where it stands. The Department of Defence was contacted for comment but did not respond in time for publication.\nOne issue is whether a ban would include technologies already in existence or only those subsequent to an agreement, and it has been noted that if it's the latter, countries like the US and Britain, with more time to build their existing technologies, would benefit from delayed negotiations.\nWalsh says so-called killer robot technology is \"technically feasible\" today, even if countries aren't deploying them just yet. Realistically, they could be doing so within a few years.\n\"The US claims there's always a human somewhere in loop but it's only a little matter of computer code to take that human out of the loop,\" he says.\nWhile a UN ban wouldn't prevent the technology from existing, it would impart a significant stigma in the eyes of the international community and put a lid on their manufacture and a potential arms race. A previous UN ban on \" blinding lasers \" was successful in preventing the technology from appearing on the battle field today.", "external_links": ["http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/ccwc_p4/text", "https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/the-assassination-complex/"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:02:43.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
