Not, you might think, promising territory for entrepreneurs. But if you did think that, you would be wrong. The past few years have seen the appearance of a sprinkling of firms that claim to know how, given an appropriately open cheque book, to overcome the problems that the bureaucracy and group-think of the established endeavours cannot.\nSome of these startup ventures have raised only enough money to keep garage-scale efforts ticking over. Others have attracted considerable sums. Steven Cowley, the boss of Britain’s Atomic Energy Authority, reckons there is more than $450m of private investment in various schemes around the world, and in May ARPA-E, an American government agency, put $30m more into the pot. None of the startups, in truth, is likely ever to construct a commercial-scale reactor. But their journeys may unravel bits of thorny plasma physics, or discover elegant engineering tricks, that help others to do so. They may thus reap rewards for their shareholders indirectly, via the patent system.\nIn this section Stellar work Nuclear proliferation Who’s the number one son? Fungus, the bogeyman Hidden no more Animal taxonomy Reprints\nFreed from the constraints of mainstream thinking, the imaginations of the physicists and engineers behind these startups can run riot. Some propose new ways of tweaking the fields at the heart of magnetic confinement: dense plasma focuses, field-reversed configurations, magnetic mirrors, polywells and spheromaks are all bits of jargon that often pop up. Others seek to tweak the design of tokamaks, the current workhorses of the field. A version that resembles a cored apple rather than a doughnut (the most common shape) looks promising.\nSome want to give their gizmos different wrappings. Several groups are looking into magnets made of “high-temperature” superconductors, that operate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, rather than the liquid helium now used. And a couple of companies are re-imagining the physics of fusion altogether, by advocating unusual fuels or exotic reactions that involve unstable particles called muons.\nThe most common schemes, though—and the ones being paid for by ARPA-E—belong to a class called magnetised-target fusion. These use magnets to wrangle the plasma before bashing it with huge pistons or the like to compress it to the point where fusion can take place.\nThere is, then, no shortage of ideas. But there is still a credibility gap. The history of government projects shows it is easy to get promising early results from some clever piece of apparatus, and use these to suggest that, with only a bit more work or investment, success is assured. Usually, it isn’t.\nAnother trap is scale. A lot of startups have designs that are small, and therefore look cheap. Again, though, history shows that what starts off small rarely stays that way. Fusion energy, if it can be made to work at all, may simply be impossible on a small scale. But “venture capitalists don’t want you to say it’s going to cost five billion,” says Stephen Dean, an old hand in the field who now runs a foundation called Fusion Power Associates. “They want you to say five million, and there’s a tendency to tell them that.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/20151024_STP500.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:38:34.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
