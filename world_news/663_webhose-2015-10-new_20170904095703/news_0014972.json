Leading ISP Solcon has deployed the integrated solution to extend the reach of its Solcon TV platform, while also ensuring the revenue security of its content offering. \nThe collaboration underpins Divitel's role as an online video publisher (OVP), allowing Solcon to deliver OTT content in a robust and secure manner. Solcon NV, a leading Dutch ISP, relies on the joint solution to address one of the most complex issues in the video value chain, digital rights management (DRM). Solcon recognized the importance of having a robust revenue security solution in place and worked with Divitel and Verimatrix to develop a managed DRM to serve as a building block to their platform. Solcon also relies on VCAS for IPTV to secure its traditional, linear service offering. \n\"There are many challenges associated with the deployment of a new service offering,\" said Peter van der Vlies, CEO of Solcon. \"However, when you work with proven vendors with an expansive and trusted partner ecosystem, many of the risks and challenges are minimized. We chose to partner with Divitel and Verimatrix on this deployment because of the relative ease of deploying a pre-integrated solution featuring two best-in-class technologies.\" \nThe VCAS for Internet TV revenue security solution provides a complete multi-screen security solution for OTT services implementing the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and MPEG-DASH protocols for live TV content. Ensuring that decryption keys are kept safe and distributed only to authorized users and client devices, the cardless security solution provides the same high level of digital TV security that Verimatrix is recognized for in 800 IPTV deployments. \nVCAS for Internet TV is integrated with Divitel's DOC, which ensures exceptional end-user experience and satisfaction. The Divitel Operating Center is a high-tech monitoring facility that provides 24/7 proactive support and manages video distribution platforms and solutions worldwide. \n\"We are proud of our collaboration with Verimatrix and Solcon. Our managed solution with Verimatrix enables us to better support Solcon's business case and provide the ROI they require,\" says Rob Verkes, account manager, Managed Services, Divitel. \"The integrated solution also offers Solcon the flexibility to expand their services easily.\" \n\"OVPs are growing in popularity -- as is the likelihood of content piracy,\" said Steve Oetegenn, president, Verimatrix. \"OVPs demand the same level of security as traditional networks in order to enhance revenue security and increase quality of service (QoS) for their subscribers. Our integrated solution with Divitel helps mitigate the risks often associated with DRM, while also serving as the foundation for future growth and expansion, and we are delighted to be working together with Divitel on Solcon's exciting deployment.\" \nAbout Solcon \nSolcon is a Dutch nation-wide internet service provider with almost 20 years of experience.
