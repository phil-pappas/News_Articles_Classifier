It needs to correct the car’s course not to where I am now pointed, but (to) where I meant to go,” Horowitz said.\n“The computer has extra sensors and processes information so much faster than I can react,” Horowitz said.\n“If the car can tell where I mean to go, it can drive itself there. But it has to know which movements of the wheel represent my intention, and which are responses to an environment that’s already changed,” he said.\nFor a stroke patient, a “smart” prosthesis must be able to interpret what the person means to do even as the person’s own body corrupts their actions (due to muscle spasms or tremors).\nThe algorithm may make it possible for a device to discern the person’s intent and help them complete the task smoothly.\n“We call it a psychic robot,” Horowitz said.\n“If you know how someone is moving and what the disturbance is, you can tell the underlying intent – which means we could use this algorithm to design machines that could correct the course of a swerving car or help a stroke patient with spasticity,” he said.\nThe study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n 08, 2015 9:46 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:37:46.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
