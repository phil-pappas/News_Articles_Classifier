Services offered include scaffold engineering, project consultation, modelling, planning, on-site support services, and design review. \nThe firm is headquartered in Houston, Texas, and is the official dealer for both the US and Canada. Flexible scaffolding for chemical plants and power station \nAllround速 Scaffolding exceeds the standard of conventional scaffolding. Its construction provides adaptability and flexibility and is the industry standard for modular scaffolding. \nAllround速 Scaffolding is used for facilities such as chemical plants, power stations, construction sites, and factories, as well as shipyards and airfields. Easy-to-assemble lightweight scaffolding \nLayher SpeedyScaf Scaffolding is used for both scaffolding work and for building trades. \nIt is a versatile product that is efficient and fast to construct, and easy to disassemble. \nSTAR Frame Scaffolding can be used in addition to the Allround Scaffolding system. It offers lower purchase costs, reduced weight, while still providing the same strength as the Allround system. Robust scaffold systems \nThis Keder Roof System is inexpensive, lightweight, versatile, and provides a comprehensive solution to bridging small and medium-sized gaps. \nThe weather protection system also can be assembled quickly, without a crane, and has a wide variety of uses. \nMeanwhile, Casette Roof Scaffolding is used for bridging larger gaps and managing heavier loads. \nThe rugged system can be used on every scaffolding system. It is strong enough to walk on, and has translucent sections which supply illumination. Protective scaffolding decks for asbestos removal and sandblasting \nThe Protect System Scaffold System gives maximum protection during asbestos removal, sandblasting, for noise protection, or to give protection from the weather. \nIt is adaptable to both Allround速 Scaffolding systems and to the SpeedyScaf速, and provides many benefits, such as being fast, and safe-to-use. \nLayher also offer scaffolding decks, which can be used as both a work surface and a stiffener. These are available as steel decks, stalu decks, which are made using a lightweight aluminum structure with a strong steel cap, and robust decks, which are a combination of wood and aluminium. \nSteel planks can also be used to provide more safety when working with corners and for length equalisation. Heavy-duty stairway solutions for temporary access \nA full range of stairway solutions are offered by Layher, ranging from public stairway towers, to simpler internal access. \nAll Layher stair towers meet US safety regulations, and each has a standard layout of ten, 12, or 16 legs. \nLayher also offer heavy-duty scaffold towers, which can bear extremely heavy loads, and are ISO:9001 TUV certified. High-tensile steel scaffolding \nLayher Lightweight is a modular line that is set to revolutionise the scaffolding industry. \nThe line is one of Layher's newest creations. It uses special high-tensile steel, which reduces the weight of components, making scaffolding easier to erect, safer to use, and more cost-effective, due to lower shipments costs. \nLayher Lightweight is compatible with existing Layher scaffolding and components. Guardrails, steel toe boards, and telescopic stabilizers \nLayher also supplies many extra accessories and components. \nThese include advance guardrails, which protects users from falling during the erection and dismantling of scaffolding, steel toe boards to be used in chemical plants and refineries, as well as telescopic stabilizers to prevent obstruction during assembly. \nOther accessories offered include, edge protection railing clamps, console brackets, couplers, scaffold tubes, and anchors. On-site training, project consultation, and logistical analysis \nAs well as its extensive range of products on offer, Layher also provides on-site training and management, planning, project consultation, and logistical analysis.
