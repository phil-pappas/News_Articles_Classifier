The account was suspended on Monday afternoon.\nThe hack of Brennan’s AOL account was first reported by the New York Post . According to the Post the unnamed hacker described himself as an “American high school student who is not Muslim and was motivated by opposition to US foreign policy and support for Palestine”.\n“We are aware of the reports that have surfaced on social media and have referred the matter to the appropriate authorities,” a CIA spokesperson told the Guardian. The FBI said that it too is investigating the hack.\nRelated: OPM director resigns over data hack that affected up to 22 million Americans\nSeveral of the cell numbers, posted by the hacker on Twitter, went directly to voicemail, though one went to a woman who said that she had been receiving calls for the person on the spreadsheet “for like two years”.\n“I always tell people this is the wrong number,” she said. “If you do get in touch with him, could you ask him to update his information?”\nThe hackers – two of them, they say – have said on their Twitter accounts that they support Palestinian statehood; they also told Gawker with respect to the sudden spotlight on the breach that they were “pretty hype about it”.\nThe pair of Twitter accounts associated with the hack kept up a steady stream of teasing tweets followed by screenshots of potentially damaging information, including screenshots of financial info.\n— CWA (@_CWA_) October 19, 2015 Do we copy John Brennan's Questionaire for National Security Positions?

Clinton is expected to testify before Congress about her private email server on Thursday.\nThe hack is one of dozens in the last several weeks, among them data broker Experian, the US government’s Office of Personnel Management, and a hotel chain owned by Donald Trump.\nSven Schrecker, chief architect of IoT security solutions for Intel, saidthe problem was not technological. “People haven’t had to worry about this for 15 years,” he said. “Every single email app out there has the capability to take [security measures such as] keys and certificates. Nobody uses them. Nobody. That’s your technology solution. That’s the problem.”\nThe advent of the “internet of things”, said Schrecker, is likely to raise awareness, if only because it will create further security challenges. “I don’t understand how, without a security infrastructure in place, any of that will ever be secure,” he said (Intel and other companies are designing such architectures). “There’s a certain time window, that we’re in right now , when we need to address these problems.”\nFormer NSA technical director Jasper Graham said that he had some sympathy for government organizations trying (and failing) to change their practices.\n“The government is in a real bind in that they’re not like a lot of industries,” said Graham, who now works for security company Darktrace as senior vice-president of cyber technologies. “They have a lot of demands that say ‘you must interact with this department’ and it doesn’t matter if that’s a small department in the middle of nowhere that has no security.”\nGraham likened the breach to evolving standards at banks. “Back in the very early days of bank-robbing, there wasn’t a standard for how to build a bank vault,” he said. “Now we don’t have vaults built out of straw any more.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/CWA?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/_CWA_/statuses/656193783625854976", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/18/stoner-high-school-student-says-he-hacked-the-cia/", "https://twitter.com/_CWA_/status/656193783625854976"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:18:02.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
