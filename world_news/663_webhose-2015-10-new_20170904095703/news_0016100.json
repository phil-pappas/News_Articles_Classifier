Photo: Glenn Hunt\nNew Zealand has dethroned Australia as the nation with the fastest 4G LTE networks in the world, but Australia now offers both respectable speed and coverage, according to a new report.\nHow fast does your mobile internet connection need to be? According to Netflix , five megabits per second (Mbps) is sufficient to stream video in high definition (HD). A report from OpenSignal, a British analytics firm that measures global mobile broadband speeds, shows that most of the time 4G subscribers in Australia have more than enough for HD streaming and are just shy of the 25 Mbps required to stream video in ultra-HD quality.\nLast year, Australia's 4G mobile networks delivered average speeds of 21 to 22 Mbps, earning our country the top spot in OpenSignal's worldwide rankings . Still, 4G speeds in Australia were available just 58 per cent of the time.\nThe firm's latest report , covering the three months to September, shows Australian smartphone users have access to a 4G connection 72 per cent of the time. That is good, but the great news is that increased coverage hasn't come at the expense of speed, with Australian operators delivering average real-world download speeds of 21 Mbps.\nAdvertisement Generally, when more users pile on to the same network, they will experience slower speeds, due to network congestion. That this hadn't happened suggested Australian operators had struck a good balance between performance and coverage, OpenSignal chief executive Brendan Gill said.\n\"A common trend we see is that as operators increase coverage and the network matures – meaning more consumer adoption and data traffic is going over it – we often see speeds suffer due to the increased load on the network. The fact that the Australian operators haven't suffered from this is a good sign,\" Mr Gill said.\nOpenSignal's data shows that Telstra has the fastest network in Australia, delivering 23 Mbps average speeds, versus 19 Mbps for both Vodafone and Optus. Vodafone offers the best coverage, with its users enjoying 4G 77 per cent of the time, a shade ahead of Telstra's and Optus's users, who are covered by 4G 76 per cent and 70 per cent of the time respectively. Three months ago, Telstra and Vodafone delivered 74 per cent coverage, followed by Optus' 68 per cent.\nIn terms of 4G coverage, Australia is now on par with early adopter Sweden, where networks have historically offered fast connections and broad coverage, but now deliver average 4G speeds of just 13 Mbps. US consumers are on a 4G connection 74 per cent of the time, but on average enjoy speeds of just 10 Mbps, while British 4G subscribers experience an average of 13 Mbps and only have access to a 4G network half of the time.\nThe firm gathers statistics from iPhone and Android users who have installed its app, which lets users take spot checks on the speed of their mobile broadband connection. The app has been installed on more than 10 million Android devices.\nWhile coverage has improved in Australia, New Zealand grabbed top spot in its debut appearance in OpenSignal's reports dating back to 2013. New Zealand's average download speeds were 36 Mbps for the quarter, followed by Singapore's 33 Mbps, Romania's 30 Mbps, and South Korea's 29 Mbps. Other nations ahead of Australia were geographically compact Denmark, Hungary, Austria and the United Arab Emirates.\nThe nation to beat remains South Korea, where three operators individually offer near ubiquitous coverage and average speeds of no less than 26 Mbps.", "external_links": ["https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306", "http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/australias-4g-networks-the-fastest-in-the-world-20140220-3350n.html", "http://opensignal.com/reports/2015/09/state-of-lte-q3-2015/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:47:44.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
