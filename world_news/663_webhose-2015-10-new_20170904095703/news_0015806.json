According to information from UC San Diego, it will increase research productivity, expand use of large-scale computational modeling, and enable large-scale neuronal modeling using HPC resources. \nThe project proposal was called, \"Seamless Integration of Neuroscience Models and Tools with HPC — Easy Path to Supercomputing for Neuroscience,\" and received three separate funding awards, two from the NSF ( 1458840 and 1458495 ) and one from the BBSRC ( BB/N005236/1 ).
