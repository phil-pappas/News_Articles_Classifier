Do you feel that you simply zoned out? Then don’t blame yourself. You are not one of those irresponsible lazy people. Neuroscience has come to your rescue as MIT neuroscientists have discovered that even if you are awake it is possible your brain may be sleeping in fragments. The neuroscientists used the technique of optogenetics. It is a technique that allows scientists to stimulate or silence neurons with light. They performed this test on mice and found a brain circuit that can trigger small regions of the brain to fall asleep or become less alert, while the rest of the brain remains awake.” Another related research also highlights that the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is responsible for sending signals to the thalamus and the brain’s cortex that slow some brain waves to an appreciable degree leading to a sort of sleep state in parts of the brain even while the rest of the organ is fully functional.
