We want to understand the profitability of the business by customer and by product, so it is very granular. \nWhy were the old systems unsuitable? \nWe were using spreadsheets to first of all drive sales forecasting, which went into our production planning system, and we were using spreadsheets to drive the rolling forecast process. Because of the complexity of the business – we have 750 SKUs (stockkeeping unit), and work with all the major food retailers – the process took days. We would have the sales people fill in the spreadsheets, submit that to the production scheduling team who would consolidate all those, take that data, and load in into our APO. Finance would have to authenticate a copy of that spreadsheet and put it into our financial planning system. If we wanted to make a change, it would take two days to get those changes through and see what the impact was on sales and profitability. \nWhat greater insight do you derive from moving to the cloud? \nWe had an in-house system that allows us to see the past by customer and by SKU. I am more interested in planning. \nBut what does that mean in practice? \nWe have a plastic injection moulding business and we share those moulds through other business units. One of the sales people wanted to run a promotion for B&Q for our slim bin products, which is a new product made at our sister plant in Luxembourg. We weren’t making any money, but when we ran that through our model, we found it was because of the freight and distribution cost. Within a matter of minutes, I was able to calculate that we could save £70,000 by moving production to the UK. \nHave there been any unexpected benefits? \nYou know something is working well when it enthuses people within the company for reasons you didn’t anticipate. I had a marketing manager come and say, ‘Can you produce a report that filters revenues being forecast for sales of less than 1,000 units over 12 months? I can use that to reduce the number of SKUs we have.’ We could get rid of inefficient runs. ■ \n\nIvan Higgs, financial controller at Story Homes, tells Richard Crump how moving its ERP to the cloud is supporting its move to become a national house builder \nWhat challenges did your reporting processes pose to the business? \nWe were quite a small business and had no real reporting. We had the quality in place but didn’t have the reporting to get to the level wanted. We had lots of different spreadsheets here and there that weren’t giving us what we needed. \nWhy didn’t they give you what you needed? \nThe big problem with having lots of different spreadsheets is having lots of different users and then lots of formulas that don’t flow through properly. Some people like to show how clever they are and you start wondering – while the spreadsheet looks great, it doesn’t actually mean anything. \nHow did moving to the cloud change this? \nIt allowed us to create a fast, dynamic set of reporting that we could continuously change, amend and update as the business grew. We have grown from 152 houses a year to 550. What we needed was fluid updated reports. Now we only have one set of formulas, one data entry point. We can manipulate that data and report it from one data source and that’s the best thing about it. It’s Excel on steroids in that it allows you to have extra control while having the flexibility of Excel. \nWhat do you use it for? \nWe use it for our weekly sales reporting, where we are with the build of those products, and we also use it for our month end and management accounting reports. We import the data from our core finance system into the system and get our set of management reports from there. From there, we start our KPIs – things like payment percentages – and go into further details of what our sales were for the month compared to our business plan. \nWe also generate a big sales build tracker, which has all the plots for a particular site, where the current build stage is, where we are with planning and – on completion – whether the plot has been built on time. We have also started using it to find out how much we are expecting to pay in commission for a sales executive.Where do you go from here? \nWe are going to start regionalising the business so that we can become a national house builder. That means we need a bit more structure so we can have lots of different finance managers in each region who can plug into that particular region and roll up to the group financial controller. ■ \nCurvey and Story Homes are both Anaplan clients Related topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:48:43.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
