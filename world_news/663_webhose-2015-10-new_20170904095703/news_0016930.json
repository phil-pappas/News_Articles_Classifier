That critical window lapses at 0400 GMT Monday. \n- 'There was nothing' - \nThe destruction was sudden and decisive. \n\"I went on an errand for my mother and when I returned there was nothing,\" said Carlos Ac, 17. He was still waiting for word about his missing mother and seven siblings. \nIn gray denim trousers and a black coat -- now the only clothes he has -- Ac said his family had come from the city of Quetzaltenango, approximately 200 kilometers to the west of the capital, to sell tortillas. \nAlex Lopez, 44, called his ex-wife and daughters as soon as he heard of the landslide. \"It rang. But there was no answer,\" he told AFP. \nDesperate families have reported receiving text messages from people they believed to still be trapped. \nOfficials said the impact of the heavy rain was exacerbated by a nearby river, and that municipal authorities had recommended the community relocate last year. \nEight people had already died in previous weather-related events tied to Guatemala's rainy season, which lasts from May to November, according to government data. \nLast year's rainy season was tied to 29 deaths and damage to more than 9,000 homes. \nMore than 53 percent Guatemala's population of 16 million lives in poverty. And the scars from a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996 are still fresh. \nBesides grinding poverty and corruption, Guatemalans endure horrific crime rates and powerful, vicious street gangs blamed for giving their country one of the world's highest murder rates. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:33:50.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
