(NYSE:LXFT), a leading provider of software development services and innovative IT solutions to a global client base, today announced the expansion of their Network Function Virtualization (NFV) orchestration platform, SuperCloud . The platform can now be adapted to work within the NFV ecosystem in both the lab and the network. \nTo conduct a successful demonstration of the platform, Luxoft has collaborated with premier enterprises include a leading Tier I European telecommunications provider, a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) tool vendor, and a prominent encryption tool vendor. SuperCloud demo is taking place at Luxoft’s booth during Software-Defined Network (SDN) and OpenFlow World Congress in Düsseldorf, Germany on October 12 – 16, 2015. \nThe demonstration will show the “set up and tear down” of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) enriched by multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNF), while maintaining end-to-end service level agreements (SLA). The demonstration will be performed using the operator’s NFV infrastructure to show how SuperCloud can adapt to different NFV environments. It will show how Luxoft, working with partners, can fully orchestrate and automate the entire lifecycle of VNFs. Orchestration and lifecycle management of VNFs is of paramount importance in enabling faster time to revenue and reducing operational overhead. \n“We’re making a strategic expansion of our SuperCloud platform to address the real pain points of our customers and potential customers within the NFV ecosystem,” said Vasiliy Suvorov, Luxoft’s Vice President for Technology Strategy. “Our successful launch of SuperCloud as an orchestration platform not only demonstrates our ability to provide a flexible platform targeted towards this industry, but more importantly, it shows how Luxoft can rapidly build and interface with many different building blocks within this dynamic ecosystem.” \nFor all those attending SDN World Congress, please contact Luxoft’s Executive Director for Business Development and Network Architecture, Tomy Issa, for any questions at TIssa@Luxoft.com . \nAbout Luxoft \nLuxoft Holding, Inc.
