Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA) today announced a collaboration with Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN ) to allow users of Nuance PowerScribe 360 to easily import patient radiology dosimetry data from the Philips DoseWise Portal . As new Joint Commission standards and state laws continue to drive improved tracking and reporting of radiation exposure from imaging scans, this integration will enable radiologists, imaging centers and healthcare facilities using Nuance PowerScribe 360 to leverage Philips' dose management solution to gain new visibility into exposure levels that help protect patients and clinicians. \"Healthcare providers and radiologists today are under increasing pressure to meet new radiation dose standards, track ongoing exposure and ensure the safety of patients and staff, but many don't know where to start,\" said Dominic Siewko , director of clinical dose management at Philips. \"By combining the Philips DoseWise Portal with Nuance PowerScribe, the industry's most widely used real-time radiology reporting solution; we're aiming to put the best radiation dose management tools into the hands of thousands of clinicians. By integrating advanced technology with improved processes, we're helping radiology transform its care practice.\" The Philips DoseWise Portal is a comprehensive radiation dose management software solution that monitors radiation exposure for patients and clinicians. It allows providers to proactively record, analyze and monitor imaging radiation dose for patients and clinicians across multiple diagnostic settings, facilitating compliance with reform and accreditation requirements. The standard for radiology reporting for health systems around the world, Nuance PowerScribe 360 processes 264 million exams a year, enabling rapid, efficient generation of high-quality actionable reports that support continuous quality improvement, rapid turnaround times and streamlined communication throughout the healthcare enterprise. The combined solution will enable health systems to seamlessly incorporate patient radiation dosage from CT and PET scanners and X-ray systems into radiology reports that can be viewed through Radiology Information Systems (RIS) and other electronic health record systems. By automatically recording dose within a patient's electronic medical records and within their natural workflow, radiologists can eliminate the risk of transcription errors. \"Radiation exposure is an increasing concern to patients and clinicians, and Nuance is helping customers drive continuous quality improvements with the right radiation dose management strategy,\" said Karen Holtzberger , vice president and general manager of diagnostics, Nuance Communications. \"Together with Philips DoseWise, Nuance PowerScribe 360 is empowering health systems to address these challenges, and remain a step ahead by delivering the information they need when they need it most to provide the best care for the patient.\" The Philips DoseWise Portal will be showcased at booth #6736 of the upcoming Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting , Nov. 29 - Dec. 4 , in Chicago, Ill.
