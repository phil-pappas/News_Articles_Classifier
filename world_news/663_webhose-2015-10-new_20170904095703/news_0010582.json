CONNECTExplorer is a web-based application that allows users to view and analyze their physical environment without having to leave the office. \nBuilding on Pictometry’s CONNECT platform – a visualization, analytical and delivery platform for utilizing and interacting with Pictometry Intelligent Imagery – CONNECTExplorer adds improved functionality and ease of use. As the dominant product within the CONNECT platform, CONNECTExplorer provides a consistent user experience across the entire CONNECT family of applications. \nThe software also provides users with the experience of viewing all types of Pictometry imagery including obliques, standard and AccuPLUS orthomosaics, EarlyAccess imagery as well as third- party mosaics. Developed for scalability, CONNECTExplorer offers the ability to bring in several types of imagery and data with intent for the future ability to import and analyze UAS or drone imagery and 3D models. \n“The release of CONNECTExplorer demonstrates our commitment to be on the forefront of the latest image deployment and analytical platform technologies,” said Frank Giuffrida, EVP Engineering. “With imagery collection moving beyond traditional aircraft platforms combined with the demand for access to more immediate information CONNECTExplorer is the key to continued success in deriving data and answers from imagery.” \nAccess to CONNECTExplorer is administered through a clean rights management interface called CONNECTAdmin, allowing administrators to easily manage and deploy CONNECT on various levels, from departmental to individual settings. Leading GIS layer publishing and subscription tools as well as enhanced query and search options provide administrators with an easy and streamlined interface that simplifies the management of GIS layers for multiple users. \nSign up to our weekly newsletter to get articles like this sent directly to your inbox.
