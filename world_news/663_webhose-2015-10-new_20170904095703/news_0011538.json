The demonstration highlights Broadcom , NXP and Realtek 100BASE-T1 physical layer transceivers (PHYs) working together in a single platform. The demonstration will take place at the 2015 OPEN all member meeting October 26 and the IEEE Ethernet & IP @ Automotive Tech Day, Booth #C3, October 27 - 28 in Yokohama, Japan. \nThe OPEN Alliance SIG was established in the fall of 2011. Since that time, OPEN members have worked tirelessly to enable interoperability in a multi-vendor environment, a key element for specification based development of communication technologies. The demonstration includes PHYs from Broadcom, NXP and Realtek communicating over OPEN Alliance compliant cable assemblies made by Delphi , Molex , TE Connectivity and Yazaki . \nThe demonstration, coordinated by the C&S Group , shows PHY and switch products interconnected using a variety of cables and inline-connectors in a switched architecture, simultaneously transferring HD video stream over the network. \n\"Today's interoperability demonstration reflects the hard work and commitment of the OPEN Alliance in establishing 100 Mbps BroadR-ReachÂ® single pair automotive Ethernet technology as an open industry standard,\" said Natalie A. Wienckowski, Strategy Lead, Core Hardware Team at General Motors and Chair for the OPEN Alliance SIG. \"We are thrilled to share this major milestone at the annual IEEE Ethernet & IP @ Automotive Tech Day, the premier venue to learn about the evolution of Ethernet standards, technologies and applications in the automotive environment.\" \nAbout the Technology The Open Alliance automotive Ethernet standard delivers high-performance bandwidth of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) per port while dramatically reducing connectivity costs and cabling weight. The fully automotive-qualified technology integrates specialized, separate systems into a centralized, secure platform, allowing multiple end points to simultaneously access and communicate information with a single protocol for data transfer. \nLeveraging the performance and cost advantages of the automotive-qualified technology, automakers can easily deploy advanced infotainment and driver assistance features, such as surround-view parking, lane-departure warning and collision avoidance systems, across a broader range of vehicles. Visit www.opensig.org for more information. \nThe OPEN Alliance has worked closely with IEEE in order to drive further innovation and standardization. The specification of a BroadR-Reach compliant IEEE standard is about to be finalized as IEEE 100BASE-T1 . The release of a next generation IEEE 1000BASE-T1 technology is expected in early 2016. \nAbout the OPEN Alliance SIG The OPEN Alliance (One-Pair Ether-Net) Special Interest Group (SIG) is a non-profit, open industry alliance of mainly automotive industry and technology providers collaborating to encourage wide scale adoption of Ethernet-based networks as the standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception, the OPEN Alliance SIG has surged to nearly 300 members strong.
