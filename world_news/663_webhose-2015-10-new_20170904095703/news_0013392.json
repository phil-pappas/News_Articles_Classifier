ETCIO | 13 October 2015, 3:23 PM IST By Ashwani Mishra Terror groups are showing their ability to adapt their strategy to technology's fast-paced evolution. They are only not only using sophisticated weaponry but are also showing their comfort with modern technology.Pakistani terror outfit, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has created a mobile app for its operatives in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts to ensure a secure communication, as reported by HT .The application was specially developed to allow LeT terror operatives to make phone calls and send text messages to other members who have the same application installed on their devices.The HT report stated that LeT terrorist Mohammad Naveed, who was arrested in Udhampur on August 5 after an attack on a BSF convoy, told interrogators that his commander was using an app on his mobile to stay in touch with his handlers and other operatives. LeT's mobile app could be running on an exclusive server that could be installed in Pakistan.During 26/11 Mumbai attacks terrorists were using a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone service. LeT has been increasingly turning tech-savvy. They have been enticing gadget-obsessed youth into their fold and also training recruits in using internet-based tools to hoodwink investigating agencies and ensuring a relatively safe mode of communication for some time now.Other terror groups like the Islamic State, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) have been using new downloadable apps that keep conversations private and, in so doing, avoid being detected by security services.ISIS also uses bitcoin for anonymous fund transfers as these transactions are untraceable and cannot be reversed.Last year, Recorded Future, a threat intelligence company had reported that terrorist group Al-Qaeda was using strong encryption techniques in order to bypass the standard cryptographic protections in its various communications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:19:53.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
