Oclaro specifically disclaims any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this press release. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Oclaro provides certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to its investors as a complement to the most comparable GAAP measures. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross margin rate is gross margin rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income/loss and Adjusted EBITDA is operating income/loss. An explanation and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information is set forth below. \nOclaro believes that providing these non-GAAP measures to its investors, in addition to corresponding income statement measures, provides investors the benefit of viewing Oclaro's performance using the same financial metrics that the management team uses in making many key decisions and evaluating how Oclaro's \"core operating performance\" and its results of operations may look in the future. Oclaro defines \"core operating performance\" as its ongoing performance in the ordinary course of its operations. Items that are non-recurring or do not involve cash expenditures, such as impairment charges, income taxes, restructuring and severance programs, costs relating to specific major projects (such as acquisitions), non-cash compensation related to stock and options and certain income, purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair market value of acquired inventories, costs to outsource our back-end manufacturing activities, write-offs and expenses related to flooding in Thailand, including advance payments received from insurers, impairment of fixed assets and inventory and related expenses, are not included in Oclaro's view of \"core operating performance.\" Management does not believe these items are reflective of Oclaro's ongoing core operations and accordingly excludes those items from non-GAAP gross margin rate, non-GAAP operating income/loss, non-GAAP net income/loss and Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, each non-GAAP measure has historically been presented by Oclaro as a complement to its most comparable GAAP measure, and Oclaro believes that the continuation of this practice increases the consistency and comparability of Oclaro's earnings releases. \nNon-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. \nAdjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as operating income/loss excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization, restructuring, acquisition and related costs, non-cash compensation related to stock and options, purchase accounting adjustments related to the fair market value of acquired inventories, impairment of intangible assets and goodwill and certain other one-time charges and credits, including flood related advance payments received from insurers, impairment of fixed assets and inventory and related expenses, specifically identified in the non-GAAP reconciliation schedules set forth below. Oclaro uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating Oclaro's historical and prospective cash usage, as well as its cash usage relative to its competitors. Specifically, management uses this non-GAAP measure to further understand and analyze the cash used in/generated from Oclaro's core operations. Oclaro believes that by excluding these non-cash and non-recurring charges, more accurate expectations of its future cash needs can be assessed in addition to providing a better understanding of the actual cash used in or generated from core operations for the periods presented. Oclaro further believes that providing this information allows Oclaro's investors greater transparency and a better understanding of Oclaro's core cash position. Oclaro, Inc.
