(Nasdaq:ORBC), a global provider of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, today announced that ORBCOMM and SpaceX plan to launch eleven OG2 satellites from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on the next launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket targeted to take place in the next six to eight weeks. \nSpaceX successfully launched ORBCOMM’s first OG2 mission of six satellites on July 14, 2014. This next dedicated launch will mark ORBCOMM’s second and final OG2 mission, completing its next generation satellite constellation. \n“We are excited to launch our eleven OG2 satellites aboard SpaceX’s newly upgraded Falcon 9 rocket and have full confidence in SpaceX and their dedication to this launch,” said Marc Eisenberg, ORBCOMM’s Chief Executive Officer. “We look forward to completing the deployment of our next generation constellation and delivering a higher level of performance, coverage and reliability through our modernized and upgraded OG2 network to our customers around the world.” \nSierra Nevada Corporation, the prime contractor and spacecraft bus manufacturer for ORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites, has completed all factory acceptance testing and is preparing the satellites for shipping to Cape Canaveral at the end of October. \nORBCOMM’s OG2 satellites are far more advanced than its current OG1 satellites and are designed to provide customers with significant enhancements, such as faster message delivery, larger message sizes and better coverage at higher latitudes, while drastically increasing network capacity. In addition, the OG2 satellites are equipped with an Automatic Identification System (AIS) payload to receive and report transmissions from AIS-equipped vessels for ship tracking and other maritime navigational and safety efforts, increasing asset visibility and the probability of detection for ORBCOMM’s AIS customers. \nAbout ORBCOMM Inc. \nORBCOMM Inc.
