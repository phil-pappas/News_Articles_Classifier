This under IEEE-1451.4 defined plug and measure standard contains among others information about the identification number of the sensor, the calibration and the supplier.\nIt enables the flexible, faultless adjustment of the module on new sensor parameters. The Sx-STG detects for example, IEEE-1451.4 Class 2 sensors (multi-wire connections, such as bridge sensors) automatically when putting on and reads the sensor-specific data via the TEDS connection. It is a benefit for the user, in that he/she does not have to enter the scaling data manually. Channel-specific settings such as operation mode, filter, excitation voltage, sampling rate etc. are performed comfortably with the measuring data acquisition software IPEmotion.\n“Everywhere, where complex measurements and measurements with frequently changing measurement setups or many measurement channels are performed, TEDS offers advantages,” explained Harry Stoerzer, leader of application and support at Ipetronik. “Besides the easy and fast setup of measuring chains, the electronic data sheet guarantees dependably correct measuring data at every measurement task. TEDS is suitable for the vehicle development and production as well as for applications onsite at the customer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:14:37.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
