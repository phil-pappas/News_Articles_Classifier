A key to their experiment was a University of Glasgow-made device that separates and combines light's twists as a prism does color. \n\"This development could offer a solution to the insatiable needs of data-driven social media, such as, Facebook and YouTube, which continually push optical fiber data speed limits,\" said Distinguished Professor of Physics Robert R. Alfano. ### \nThe research, supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Army Research Office, and Corning Incorporated, appears in the Nature journal, \" Scientific Reports .\" \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:12:24.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
