Announces Extension of Financial Reporting Deadlines September 30, 2015 06:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time \nLINCOLN, Neb.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Nebraska Book Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTC Pink: NEEB) today announced that a majority of the holders of its senior secured notes have agreed to extend the deadline for delivery of the Company’s fiscal year 2015 audited financial statements to December 31, 2015. In addition, the Company received an extension of the deadline for its first and second quarter fiscal 2016 unaudited financials to December 31, 2015. The Company requested these extensions due to the complexities of the sale of its retail division in June 2015. \n“The sale of our retail division included a significant number of detailed financial components, from stores to personnel,” said Ben Riggsby, interim president and chief executive officer for Nebraska Book Company. “The complexity of these financial actions require additional time to process and report accurately and completely.” \nAbout Nebraska Book Company Nebraska Book Company, which began in 1915 with an independent college bookstore, now represents a key textbook resource with strategic business services and technology partner to strengthen independent college retailers across the United States.
