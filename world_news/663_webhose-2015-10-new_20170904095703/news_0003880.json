October 7, 2015 ATLANTA – Atlanta-based Arrow Exterminators has launched #ArrowCares, a social media campaign to raise money for the National Breast Cancer Foundation. The fundraising campaign will run through the month of October in conjunction with Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Arrow Exterminators Service Professionals will be wearing special pink shoe covers during the month of October. Customers are asked to take a photo of their Service Professional’s pink shoe covers and then post the picture to one or more of their social media accounts using #ArrowCares. Arrow Exterminators will donate $1 to the National Breast Cancer Foundation for each of these posts. Arrow team members will also be wearing pink ribbons to show support to those surviving breast cancer and to remember those who have lost their fight against this disease. “Service and philanthropy play a major role in the culture of our company,” said Emily Thomas Kendrick, President and Chief Executive Officer of Arrow Exterminators. “Just about all of us have been impacted by breast cancer either directly or through a very close loved one, and we felt a call to action to help. We are proud to raise money for this worthy cause and eager to do our part in the battle against breast cancer,” commented Kendrick. The National Breast Cancer Foundation’s mission is to provide help and inspire hope to those affected by breast cancer through early detection, education, and support services.
