David Dierke, President and CEO of AccountMate, announced that, “In the spirit of preparedness, the way you do for other IRS tax deadlines, AccountMate wants to alert clients of the Internal Revenue Service tax reporting requirements that need to be handled by your company’s accounting software this year. Specifically, I am talking about the regulations and timeframes about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) also known as ObamaCare. We will have the process and structures in place to help businesses prepare to meet the deadlines.”\nAlthough the end of the 2015 year filing seems to be some future activity, the preparation for meeting the ACA/ObamaCare IRS requirements means that work by businesses should start relatively soon. AccountMate is updating its Payroll module reporting structure as well as working with its vertical partner Aatrix to assure that their clients will have the means to complete and eFile the IRS reporting requirements in the timeframes spelled out by the IRS in early 2016. Information for this reporting comes from data supplied during the 2015 year.\nAccountMate is so confident of its handling of this ACA reporting in its Payroll module that they are offering prospects using other accounting software systems to switch to the AccountMate system at discounted pricing and be able to install the Payroll module and System Manager in October, 2015. That would allow companies to wrap up end-of-year Payroll tax filing. Then, as their schedules dictate, they can have an AccountMate Solution Provider complete the conversion of data and installation of the remaining modules for a later date.\nNo businesses should ever feel that they are ‘caught unawares’ and without options. In the case of companies needing to comply with ObamaCare, AccountMate Software is poised and able to provide the structure to help clients meet the IRS report filing.\nAbout AccountMate\nFounded in 1984, AccountMate develops and markets fully modifiable business accounting software.
