The sharp fall in panel prices, accompanied by aggressive policy decisions and falling lending rates have brought solar power prices in India to the edge of grid parity.A total of 6,781 MW solar power capacity has been allocated through competitive auctions for feed-in tariffs in India between December 2010 and September 2015. The Indian government has also auctioned projects on the basis of subsidy in capital investment at fixed feed-in tariffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:11:16.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
