As far as large, faceless conglomerates go, they like tossing some interesting PR flavor into the mix every once in awhile. The newest attempt to incept a love for General Electric into your subconscious will be a serialized science fiction podcast, because people at GE also listened to Serial last year. \nGE has always found ways of using “native advertising” to present brand awareness as content or entertainment. Some of their attempts have been more successful and long lasting than others. The television program General Electric Theater , for example, ran from 1953 to 1962 and most notably had Ronald Reagan as a host. That show would adapt other pieces of fiction for TV, but General Electric had been sponsoring entertainment in the form of radio programs since 1923 with General Electric Concerts. \nThe best pieces of leftover General Electric infotainment live on in the form of an old Disneyland ride and two ridiculously entertaining musical presentations, all engineered to promote General Electric and its products. \nIn 1966, GE produced an industrial musical to spread the word about how great the company’s electric power was. An industrial musical was often shown at trade shows or sales conventions as a form of infotainment and boosterism. The 1966 souvenir recording from a utility executives’ conference that General Electric held in Williamsburg, Virginia is called “ Go Fly a Kite ” and has the catchy lead song “ Heaven Out of Hell ,” where the Devil is put out of work because GE turns gas-powered Hell into an electric Hell. \nThe fad was dying out by 1973, but General Electric was still going strong, producing maybe the best industrial musical of their run in terms of lyrics and music. That year’s convention featured “ General Electric Silicone Products Department – Got To Investigate Silicones ” with break out hits like “ Silicones, Silicones ” and “Sand.” Not many GE executives made it through 1973 being unsure about Silicon, I’ll tell you what. \nAs early as 1964, General Electric was finally letting the general public in on the fun, partnering with Walt Disney to create a musical audio animatronic experience at the New York World’s Fair called the Carousel of Progress. This ride would put the audience on a rotating platform that would take them through several eras of life in the average American family home. The Carousel was moved to Disneyland after a successful run at the World’s Fair and stayed there until 1974 when it was moved to Walt Disney World. The ride is probably best remembered for its catchy song “There’s a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow” by Disney songwriters the Sherman Brothers. \nThis Monday, GE will abandon musical theater in a science fiction audio drama. Starting on October 4, the new science fiction podcast by GE and Slate’s podcast network Panoply will release the first of eight episodes . The podcast will follow the decoding of a (fictional) 70 year-old message from outer space. The (fictional?) cryptologists decoding the message turn to a real ultrasound technology (developed by GE!) to decode the messages. \nThe podcast will air without sponsorship since the whole thing is not-so-secretly a General Electric ad. Then again, all the highlights of musical General Electric mentioned above were very plain about being advertising for GE, so maybe this is a step in the correct clandestine direction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:09:58.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
