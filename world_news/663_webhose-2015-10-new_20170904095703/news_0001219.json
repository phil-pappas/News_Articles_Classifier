Users can instantly secure, control and track the files they upload to the cloud, send via email, or store on their devices. Fydis allows users to control who can access a file, and even restrict access to a specific time, device, or location. The application keeps a full audit trail of every interaction with a file, and alerts the user of any unauthorised or suspicious access attempts.\nUnlike other file security solutions, which allow the file encryption process to be reversed, Fydis is the first solution with no built-in decryption. This means that once a file is protected, it’s protected forever.\nPeter Barbas, Founder of Fydis says: “Every morning, over 117,000 people wake up to find that their financial information, personal data, intellectual property or work files have been hacked, stolen or leaked. That’s over twice the number of people that fit into the Yankee Stadium having their private information stolen and used for malicious purposes every day. Given how advanced data security technology is today, this is not an acceptable number.”\nPeter adds “Malicious file hacking costs the world economy over $300bn each year. We believe that Fydis’ technology can solve this problem, but the technology is just one piece of the puzzle. To solve a challenge of this scale, we need every bit of support we can get. That’s why we decided to launch Fydis on Indiegogo.”\nThe crowdfunding campaign, which launches on Indiegogo today, offers backers the opportunity to be the first to protect their digital information with Fydis. The funds raised from the campaign will be used to scale Fydis’ operations by increasing its secure server infrastructure, and investing in back-end software optimisation, front-end user interface development, customer support, and developing the software’s mobile application.\nFor more information please visit: http://fydis.com\n###\nNotes to editors:\nThe Indiegogo page can be accessed here: http://igg.me/at/fydis/\nThe Indiegogo campaign will launch on October 20th, and run for 50 days until 9th December.", "external_links": ["http://igg.me/at/fydis/", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2lnZy5tZS9hdC9meWRpcy8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2Z5ZGlzLmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:20:35.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
