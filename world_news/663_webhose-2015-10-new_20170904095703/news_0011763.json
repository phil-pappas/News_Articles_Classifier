But new species are still described from time to time, not least by the genetic analysis of populations that anatomists have been unable to separate. So it is with the tortoises of Santa Cruz, second largest of the Galápagos Islands, whose two isolated groups may or may not have been separate species. That they are has just been confirmed, in a paper in PLOS ONE , by Adalgisa Caccone of Yale University and her colleagues. Their study found that the two are at least as genetically distinct as Galápagos tortoise species from different islands. Dr Caccone has dubbed members of the smaller, eastern population Chelonoidis donfaustoi , to distinguish them from Chelonoidis porteri , a name now reserved for tortoises on the island’s west side. She named them after Fausto Llerena Sánchez, a retired park ranger (pictured, with one of the newly described species) who helped preserve the archipelago’s tortoises.
