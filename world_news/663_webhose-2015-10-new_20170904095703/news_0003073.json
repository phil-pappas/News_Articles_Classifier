The implant industry is striving to maximize the efficacy of existing orthopedic, cardiovascular, ophthalmic and orthodontic implants by synthesizing higher quality materials, optimizing design characteristics as well as enhancing biocompatibility, healing and clinical outcomes. \nAnalysis from Frost & Sullivan, Key Material Technologies for Next Generation Implants ( https://www.frost.com/d65d ), finds innovations in materials geared towards performance and lightweight characteristics. The use of novel hybrid materials and polymers, such as stimuli responsive polymers and self-healing materials will further propel invention. \nFor complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://bit.ly/1LPxpqN . \n\"The need for materials with tunable properties, biocompatibility, inertness, and resistance to sterilization is accelerating innovations in materials for implants,\" said Technical Insights Senior Industry Analyst Aarthi Janakiraman . \"Biologics and combination materials are gaining popularity for use in allografts, autografts and demineralized bone matrix in healthcare applications.\" \nHowever, the commercialization of these solutions has been slow due to stringent regulations. In Europe and North America , this forces technology developers to meet both consumer expectations and material specifications. In addition, high costs and the challenges associated with scaling up the production of new materials are curbing adoption. \nImplant manufacturers need to conduct clinical trials to establish the efficiency and functionality of materials obtain regulatory approval and facilitate commercialization. Furthermore, stakeholders must carry out research and clinical studies to validate the safety, effectiveness and suitable usage of biological materials â€“ a potential game changer in the implants space. \n\"Collaborations will be a crucial step to steer advances in material technologies,\" concluded Janakiraman. \"Material developers and medical device manufacturers from across the globe must join hands to design and bring-to-market effective materials to boost the long-term utility of implants.\" \nKey Material Technologies for Next Generation Implants, a part of the TechVision ( http://ww2.frost.com/research/technology/health-wellness ) subscription, identifies and profiles 10 technologies expected to shape the medical device and imaging industry.
