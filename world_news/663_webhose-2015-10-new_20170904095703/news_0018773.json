It would be hubris for us to assume that humanity on Earth would last forever Brian Patrick Green is assistant director of campus ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics and lecturer in the School of Engineering at Santa Clara University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n(CNN) With the recent NASA announcement of liquid water flowing on Mars and the movie \"The Martian\" making a splash at the box office, we might well ask whether humans should go to Mars.\nThere is almost no chance that Mars has intelligent life and for decades we earthlings have dreamed of living on Mars. But let's think about this from an ethical point of view. What is the moral value of native Martian life vs. creating a \"backup Earth\"?\nThe discovery of native life on Mars -- even if it is only the most primitive microbes -- would be one of the most important scientific discoveries in human history. Sound improbable? NASA does not think so ; in fact, determining if life ever arose on Mars is its first goal for Mars exploration.\nBrian Patrick Green NASA has evidence from Earth that life can growth in very extreme conditions. These life forms are called extremophiles, and they can survive under high temperature and pressure, endure intense radiation and cold. Life may have evolved eons ago on Mars, and just been driven underground.\nShould we respect native Martian life forms if we find them? Most likely they would be microscopic. On Earth, we kill microbes all the time. So is it wrong to go to another planet and mess with the natives? After all, if that had happened to Earth in the past, we might not exist.\nRead More 6 photos: NASA orbiter spots real landing sites for fictional astronaut In the novel \"The Martian\" by Andy Weir, stranded astronaut Mark Watney spends most of his time at the fictional Ares 3 site in the real southern Acidalia Planitia. NASA says the region is actually far more interesting and hazardous to drive over than depicted in the novel. This image shows the area close to the Ares 3 landing site. Hide Caption 1 of 6 6 photos: NASA orbiter spots real landing sites for fictional astronaut Weir sent HiRISE mission managers the exact coordinates of the site he wished to use for his fictional landing base for Watney. This is it. The closeup image shows wind-blown deposits inside eroded craters. HiRISE stands for High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, a camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Hide Caption 2 of 6 6 photos: NASA orbiter spots real landing sites for fictional astronaut \"The Martian\" used actual locations on Mars for the landing sites for its Ares 3 and Ares 4 missions. The landing site for Ares 3 -- on a Martian plain named Acidalia Planitia -- is shown in this photo. For Watney, Acidalia Planitia is within driving distance of where NASA's Mars Pathfinder, with its Sojourner rover, landed in 1997. Hide Caption 3 of 6 6 photos: NASA orbiter spots real landing sites for fictional astronaut The base for \"The Martian's\" Ares 4 mission was inside a crater named Schiaparelli, according to NASA. This HiRISE image shows a flat region in the crater. No boulders can be seen, and NASA says the dust is probably at least a meter thick. Hide Caption 4 of 6 6 photos: NASA orbiter spots real landing sites for fictional astronaut Stranded astronaut Watney travels to the rim of Mawrth Crater. This image from the HiRISE camera shows what the terrain really looks like on Mars. According to NASA, the terrain is rolling with small impact craters and wind-blown drifts of sand or dust. Hide Caption 5 of 6 6 photos: NASA orbiter spots real landing sites for fictional astronaut More than 39,000 images have been taken by HiRISE since the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reached Mars in 2006. They are available online for anyone to explore, without having to go to Mars, at http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu . Hide Caption 6 of 6 How thoroughly do we need to search for life forms before we can declare Mars ours? Should we leave the planet as a preserve if there is native life, or settle down and assume that native life will remain relatively unharmed? Should we intentionally restore the Martian climate by warming the planet and adding water so that whatever life is there may better flourish?\nIn the absence of proof of life on Mars, this is a philosophical debate. But we may not have the luxury of an exceedingly thorough search for life before humans start to contaminate the planet with Earth life (humans carry a whole microbiome of organisms, after all). There are humans at this moment planning to go to Mars and permanently settle there.\nSeveral organizations have already stated they are going to Mars as soon as possible, and SpaceX's Elon Musk has been clear on one reason why he thinks it is so important for humans to go to Mars .\nMusk believes that living exclusively on Earth is too risky. Humanity is keeping all of its eggs on one planet, and given the natural and human-made risks in the universe that is simply not safe.\nThe moral value of having a \"backup Earth\" shouldn't be underestimated.\n5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars 5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars Water still flows across the surface of Mars from time to time, NASA scientists said Monday, September 28. In the photo above, dark, narrow streaks called recurring slope lineae are seen flowing downhill on Mars. Scientists have inferred that they were formed by contemporary flowing water. Hide Caption 1 of 5 5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars Recurring slope lineae emanate out of the walls of the Garni crater on Mars. Hide Caption 2 of 5 5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars Recurring slope lineae flow down the west-facing slopes of Coprates Chasma, which is in the equatorial region of Mars. Hide Caption 3 of 5 5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars \"The existence of liquid water, even if it is super salty briny water, gives the possibility that if there's life on Mars, that we have a way to describe how it might survive,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA. Hide Caption 4 of 5 5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars It remains to be seen whether the new discovery improves the odds of life on Mars, but researcher Mary Beth Wilhelm said the results suggest \"more habitable conditions on the near surface of Mars than previously thought.\" Hide Caption 5 of 5 You might think -- what's the chance of humans destroying humanity? Look at how far we've progressed in the last thousands of years. Sure, we have empires rise and fall, but we won't destroy ourselves.\nBut with technological progress making nuclear, biological and chemical weapons easier to obtain (not to mention new risks like artificial intelligence and nanotechnology), and the unintended consequences of climate change, doomsday scenarios are real possibilities in the future. It would be hubris for us to assume that humanity on Earth would last forever.\nNow, consider this scenario: a nuclear war or other disaster hits the Earth and human civilization is destroyed. Everything in history -- all art, progress, science, technology -- is for nothing.\nThen consider if the same thing happens, but a small city full of humans -- perhaps a few thousand in a self-sustaining settlement on Mars -- exists with records of human history, with animals and plants, children and couples.\nIn the second scenario, despite the horrific disaster on Earth, all of human history is not for nothing. There is still human meaning in the universe. That's an incredibly morally valuable thing.\nIt's clear that the backup Earth project should take priority, even if it is potentially damaging to native life on Mars. We could try to settle on the moon or a large asteroid instead, but as things look, Mars is our best option.\nFollow @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard
