RWE is now playing its part as a member of the renowned association and is actively working in the \"Web of Things\" interest group. W3C deals with the standardisation of Internet technologies. The consortium's recommendations set international trends. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276330 ) In late September, RWE presented comprehensive information on the \"Lemonbeat smart Device Language\" (LsDL) language standard. After that, the company shared details on LsDL with the W3C group. \"The response to our communications protocol has been extremely positive\", says Dr. Dietrich Gemmel , Chief Executive Officer of RWE Effizienz GmbH. \"Lemonbeat's wide performance range is being met with enthusiasm.\" The next step will now follow in late October in Sapporo, Japan . At the W3C conference, there will be a live demonstration of Lemonbeat for IT developers from around the world. Prototypes will be used to show how devices can be connected with each other using Lemonbeat and how they integrate themselves into a network fully automatically. The audience will see live how the Lemonbeat application operates internally. Gemmel is certain: \"With this high-performing protocol, we have excellent opportunities. In the context of a global standardisation of the Internet of Things, we can play a key role.\" Lemonbeat is a new communications protocol that makes networking very different devices very easy. It is very compact, but at the same time, it can also be flexibly expanded for use in complex applications. With this, Lemonbeat is meeting the challenges of the Internet of Things particularly effectively. As the provider of the RWE SmartHome home automation system, intelligent device communication is familiar territory for the company. The first B2B pilot customers are already using Lemonbeat.
