It was the second phase of a trial that began on October 5.\nThe jury was considering whether Apple's A7, A8 and A8X processors, found in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, as well as several versions of the iPad, violated the patent.\nWARF sued Apple in January 2014 alleging infringement of its 1998 patent on a \"predictor circuit,\" developed by computer science professor Gurindar Sohi and three of his students.\nMuch of the dispute over damages had to do with whether a certain portion of Apple's chips that were placed in devices sold abroad, rather than in the United States, also violated the WARF patent. The jurors found that they did.\nApple had sought to greatly limit its liability, arguing before jurors that WARF deserved less than even the $110 million the foundation settled with Intel Corp after suing that company in 2008 over the same patent.\nApple had argued that WARF's patent entitled it to as little as 7 cents per device sold, a far cry from the $2.74 that WARF was claiming.\nWARF uses some of the income it generates to support research at the school, doling out more than $58 million in grants last year, according to its website.\nOn Thursday, US District Judge William Conley, who is presiding over the case, ruled that Apple had not willfully infringed WARF's patent, eliminating a chance to triple the damages in the case.\nLast month, WARF launched a second lawsuit against Apple, targeting the company's newest chips and devices, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, and iPad Pro.\nThe case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v Apple Inc, US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, No. 14-cv-62.\n latest apple Also Read Ten market-linked insurance funds beat Nifty on fiscal returns You will soon be able to charge your smartphone within 30 seconds RBI monetary policy fails to meet exporters' expectations Apple confirms $360 mn acquisition of 3-D sensor startup PrimeSense", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151019/technology-latest/article/apple-ordered-pay-234-million-university-infringing-patent", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Apple%20%286%29_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Apple%20%286%29_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:56:37.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
