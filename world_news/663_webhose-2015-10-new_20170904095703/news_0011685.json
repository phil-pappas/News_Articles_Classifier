According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) research, there is now an average of 15.7 carriers providing services to each country’s ports, down from 22.1 in 2004.\nUNCTAD identified 32 countries (mostly small island states) with fewer than four carriers calling at their ports, up from 22 back in 2004.\n“The average vessel size per country will continue to grow and so we expect there will be fewer companies in individual markets, and this is an increasing challenge for the smallest players,” Jan Hoffmann, head of trade facilitation at UNCTAD , told Reuters.\nWhile Drewry agrees with the basic thesis that in general countries will be served by fewer carriers in the future, we disagree with the drivers of this trend as proposed by the UNCTAD report.\nThe rise of the mega-ships does not explain why smaller countries such as Samoa or Iceland are less well served as these ships were never intended to call at these more remote outposts. They simply lack sufficient volumes to attract more than a handful of lines.\nRead: Is Shipping Sailing into a Storm \nFurthermore, as the container carriers first went global and then consolidated many of the smaller North-South carriers (the South American and the African lines in particular) disappeared and were acquired, but they were not replaced by new entrants. The Hapag-Lloyd/CSAV combination is the latest example.\nDrewry states that several carriers are now considering entering the African trades, as volumes increases and as the number of competitors has decreased.\n\nThe move towards big ships has certainly reduced the number of vessel operators in the major deep-sea trades, but the industry nonetheless remains extremely competitive, which has contributed to the downwards trend in freight rates.\nRead a Technical Paper from Drewry's Neil Davidson on the impact mega-ships are having on ports and terminals \nThere are currently 16 vessel operators in the Asia-North Europe trade route where most of the Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULVCs) are deployed, down from 20 in 2009. However, when you add in all of the subsidiary companies and slot charter parties the number of carriers that shippers can approach for business is far higher.\nFor example, Drewry counts around 30 different carriers offering space between Shanghai and Hamburg . Admittedly the number of options will be lower between smaller port pairs.\nPart of the rationale for ordering big ships was to reduce carrier costs, something they have had more success with than raising freight rates. This coping mechanism might have lowered the number of ship operators but as we’ve seen it has not barred smaller lines from entry.\nThe biggest risk to competition within the industry in our opinion comes from the sustained low freight rates that produce extremely thin profit margins and are forcing some carriers to cut their cloth accordingly. Some carriers no longer want to be “global carriers”.\nMost of these were either providers of one or two ships on a joint service or merely slot charterers (therefore doing little to net capacity deployed), but the rise in trade exits has intensified this year as more carriers have decided to get out with no prospect of higher freight rates on the horizon.\nThe Drewry View \nThe trend towards fewer carriers is not a severe threat to competition. Despite prolonged low margins carriers and shipowners have continued to (over)invest in new ships in order to facilitate international trade, all the while giving customers sufficient choice. \nFor more from Drewry, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:55:51.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
