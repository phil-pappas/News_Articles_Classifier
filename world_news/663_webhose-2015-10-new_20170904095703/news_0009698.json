Back to the Future's iconic invention is closer than you think 14:42, 21 Oct 2015 Tech companies are racing to create the iconic hoverboard used by Marty McFly in the classic 80s hit back To the Future - but when will we actually get one?

The 'hover engines' create a magnetic field which lets the board levitate about one inch off the ground - much like the super-fast Maglev trains in Japan. \nThe hoverboard will only work if it is placed on top of some types of metal, including aluminium, copper or stainless steel. Hendo \nThe current models can support the weight of people as heavy as 18 stone while offering about half an inch of hover height. \nSo far, the company has only created prototypes of the tech. It unveiled a new design today to take advantage of Back to the Future day , but there's no telling when it'll actually be available to buy. Arx Pax The updated design of the Hendo hoverboard \nThe worrying news is that, when it does, it's likely to cost a rather hefty $10,000. \nAnother company taking a run at a hoverboard is car manufacturer Lexus. \nEarlier this year, the company showed off a video demo of a working hoverboard that required a special metallic skate park to use. \nLike the Hendo board, it also relied on magnets to create the hover. Check out the video below to see it in action. Video loading Or, be like Doc Brown and build your own! \nIf you can't wait for the companies to get their gear into the shops then there's always the option of a DIY hoverboard. \nTexas inventor Ryan Craven came up with his very own hoverboard – and you can use his design to build one yourself. \nCalled Mr Hoverboard, it’s basically a miniature hovercraft that is propelled by four battery-powered leaf blowers. \nCraven told Crave : \"A skirt fills with air that is released below from strategically placed holes that create a small pocket between Mr Hoverboard and the ground. \n“The skirt alterations were one of the biggest steps I had to keep repeating as there's infinite combinations when trying to achieve proper circulation and balance.” Video loading \nCraven bought his four leaf blowers from Amazon for about $200 (£125) and says that the rest of the parts needed can be sourced by anyone. \nYou’ll need a shower curtain, plywood, tape, staples, some tools and a few other easily-found bits and bobs. \nFor his own Mr Hoverboard, Craven used an old water ski that he found and describes the sensation of riding it like being “submerged in some weightless swimming pool.” \nIt’s also pretty noisy, sounding like a orchestra that’s tuning up, but admit it, you’d want to draw attention to yourself on one of these things, wouldn’t you? Propstore The hoverboard in Back To The Future 2 Hoverboards and hoverbikes \nAnother 80s sci-fi classic, Return of the Jedi, decided we'd be riding hoverbikes rather than hoverboards. \nAnd the good news is that this technology is also being developed - with a tentative release date of 2018. \nCalifornian manufacturer Aerofix has developed the Aero-X hoverbike and it says you'll only need a weekend of training to be able to fly it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:29:04.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
