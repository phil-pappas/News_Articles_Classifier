These systems are used in various industries including public safety, railroad, agriculture, utility, mass transit and defense.\n“In today’s mobile economy, it is important to have the ability to track the movement and status of products and goods. Tracking systems deliver real-time information on the location, activity and inventory of vehicles to improve business performance and reduce costs,” said Ken Burgner, Product Manager. “They can also significantly aid recovery efforts in the event of theft. L-com’s HyperLink® brand HG-PCGM01-03 series GPS/cellular antennas are the key to these tracking systems.”\nThe antennas feature a penta-band cellular and high-LNA gain GPS antenna in one low-profile radome. The integral magnetic base ensures secure mounting to most metal structures. Designed to meet IP65 rating, the antenna’s radomes are manufactured from UV-resistant ABS to enable continuous reliable operation in the harshest of environments.\nInputs for these new antennas are accessed via two 3-meter leads, one for the cellular antenna and one for the GPS antenna. Standard models are terminated with either FAKRA Jack connectors or SMA connectors. Custom connectors are also available.\nFor more information about this release, please contact:\nPeter McNeil, Marketing Manager\n978-682-6936 x1174, mailto:pmcneil(at)l-com(dot)com\nAbout L-com Global Connectivity\nL-com Global Connectivity, a preferred manufacturer of wired and wireless connectivity products, offers a wide range of solutions and unrivaled customer service for the electronics and data communications industries.
