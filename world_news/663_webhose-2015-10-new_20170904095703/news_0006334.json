(NASDAQ: VDSI ), a global leader in authentication, electronic signatures, and identity management, announced today two new solutions targeting the rapidly growing healthcare segment, DIGIPASS Authentication for Epic Hyperspace and DIGIPASS GO 7 hardware authenticator for healthcare. DIGIPASS Authentication for Epic Hyperspace is a plug-in for IDENTIKEY Authentication Server and integrates in Epic Hyperspace, the leading software for electronic health records (EHR). DIGIPASS Authentication for Epic Hyperspace is a client-side .NET module that adds support for two-factor authentication using a DIGIPASS Authenticator. It supports 1-step and 2-step challenge/response and response only authentication. DIGIPASS GO 7 is a one-button hardware authentication device that has recently been validated as FIPS 140-2 Level 2 compliant by the federal National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). DIGIPASS GO 7 complies with all requirements that fall under the federal government mandate. It satisfies the requirements regarding strong, two-factor authentication of healthcare providers from the DEA's Rule for the Electronic Prescription of Controlled Substances (EPCS). DIGIPASS GO 7 is ideal for authentication and e-prescribing with Epic and many other leading EHR solutions Both solutions deliver enhanced security through the support of dynamic one-time passwords (OTP) that provide a unique, non-reusable password for accessing applications, websites and networks. The use of OTPs helps protect against the use of stolen passwords by hackers and allows for the authentication of doctors and other healthcare providers for multiple uses including the electronic prescription of controlled substances in compliance with tighter regulations regarding meaningful use criteria and national laws. \"When dealing with highly sensitive information such as patient data and the prescription of controlled substances, proper IT security is top of mind for every healthcare professional, especially in light of recent breaches,\" stated Frederik Mennes , Senior Manager Market & Security Strategy for VASCO. \"Support of Epic Hyperspace and achieving FIPS 140-2 certification emphasizes VASCO's commitment to exceeding the IT security needs of organizations in the healthcare segment.\" The validation testing for DIGIPASS GO 7 was performed by InfoGard, the first and largest private IT security laboratory accredited by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology. InfoGard is also accredited for certifications in the healthcare market as an approved certifying organization for the DEA EPCS Certification Program.
