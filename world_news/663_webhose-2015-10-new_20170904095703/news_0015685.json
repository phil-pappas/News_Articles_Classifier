Deploying a modernized, enterprise-class inbound contact center foundation in 60 days\n2. Learning the new solution and refining the requirements based on findings\n3. Adapting to current and future needs by expanding the platform with enterprise-class capabilities\nThe keys to this solution is its automated, but flexible deployment approach and its configuration capability, which come from Aria’s pre-tested, pre-built, and pre-validated assets: SWIFT Auto Attendant, SWIFT Routing , and SWIFT Real-Time Reporting. They provide options to meet various contact center requirements, speed up the deployment process, illuminate risks, and allow businesses to retain a complete control over their systems for easy maintenance and support.\n“Many contact center implementations spend more time than desired in analysis paralysis, documenting hundreds of requirements, and customizing while learning a new system. This leads to long implementation times while in reality 80% or more of contact center requirements are the same”, says Kelly Wilson, Aria Solutions’ VP of Client Solutions.\nFast deployment, speed to market and adaptability are key reasons why Aria’s new solution approach is called “Swift” - one of the fastest, most agile and adaptable birds on the planet.\nAbout Aria Solutions:\nAria Solutions has been partnering with Genesys since 1996, successfully executing complete Genesys contact center solutions that include: strategic consulting, professional services, system support, managed services and products. Aria employs 50+ contact center experts who specialize in delivering custom and advanced solutions to help mid-size and large contact centers promote customer engagements, create exceptional customer experiences, and deliver positive business results.
