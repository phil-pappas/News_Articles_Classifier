The main topic to have grabbed the attention of readers relates to mega-ships. These giant vessels, with the largest ships scaling a massive 19,224 TEU in capacity, are causing complications for ports around the world, and as we move deeper into the twenty-first century, these problems are likely to intensify, making it vital for port operators and supply chain experts to collaborate in order to realise the most effective solution.\nHere is the list of the top 10 technical papers so far for 2015:\n10) The Key in Port Optimisation: Linking the Supply Chain \nOne of PTI's latest papers, written by Richard Butcher, Global Head & Director: Port and Terminal Division at Wipro Technologies, details how a Systems Integrator can play an integral role for ensuring that port's make a smooth transition into automation. He says a Systems Integrator would would to achieve better data flows by looking at a problem and address these with a defined and a clear plan in order to achieve a successful ‘Go-Live’.\n9) How to Boost Terminal Operations with TOS Plug-ins \nA Technical Paper by Dr Yvo Saanen, Managing Director and Frieda Zutt, Senior Consultant of TBA discuss the benefits of using TOS plug-ins to ensure that the errors ceated as a result of manual TOS operations are elminated and that the reliance on operators is reduced. The simulation and emulation specialist details four TOS plug-ins that can help to optimise the TOS environment.\n8) Big ships bringing big changes: port industry takes on the challenge \nA key paper written by Dr Noel Hacegaba, CCO of the Port of Long Beach, details the many aspects of mega-ship development which are having an impact on terminals, including vessel-sharing agreements, the evolution of containership size, the emergence of mega shipping alliances and the impacts on ports, as well as what the port industry can do to overcome the strains of the larger class of ships.\nRead Dr Noel Hacegaba's Technical Paper on how the US West Coast beat congestion \n\n(Source: Maersk)\n7) A new concept in handling mega-ships \nThis article examined the possibility of utilising new generation integrated container terminal (NGICT) concept for improving the stack area of a port. The author contends that upgrading berth capacity alone in order to tackle mega-ships will lead to congestion throughout yard facilities, and therefore, more efficient use of quay cranes is the next best solution.\n6) Big Data - The Revolution \nA Technical Paper written by Rodrigo Garro, Project Manager with PTI Preferred Partner Orbita Ports and Terminals details the importance of using Big Data in ports to ensure that port operations remain efficient. The evidence for this can be found in the potential of Big Data to transform port operations through areas such as equipment maintenance, energy consumption forecasts and smart routing for 3PLs.\nView Orbita Ports and Terminals in our Supplier Directory \nThe Rise of Big Data in Ports and Terminals \n5) The Definitive Guide to Terminal Productivity \nAndy Barrons, Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer of PTI Preferred Partner Navis and Oscar Pernia, Senior Director of Product Strategy at Navis discuss how certain areas of a port can be optimised to boost its outcome, including berth productivity and through increased carrier-terminal cooperation and visibility.\nTo read more about Navis in our Supplier Directory, click here \n\n4) ‘Kra’ Canal to alter World’s Busiest Shipping Route? \nA second article by Andy Lane of CTI Consultancy looked at the possibility of a new ‘Kra Canal’ in the region of Thailand for creating a key shipping route that would serve as one of the most crucial lanes for transporting cargo in Asia. This paper analyses its potential impact on cargo flows.\n3) How Terminals can Tackle Mega-ships \nAfter receiving the highest number of downloads on PTI’s website, this Technical Paper, written by Peter Ford of Ports America, looked at alternative ways in which ports and terminals can tackle mega-ships, by utilising methods such as berth productivity incentives, guaranteed capacity contracts and long-term guaranteed volumes to create win-win scenarios for ports and shipping lines.\n2) Implications of Mega-ships on Ports and Terminals \nAs one of the most popular Technical Papers, Neil Davidson of Drewry’s Technical Paper on mega-ship impacts on ports and terminals. He details how ports need to invest in larger cranes as a result of ship sizes increasing across the board and that speed of handling isn’t just an operational issue, but also commercial and poses the question of who will ultimately pay for port and terminal upgrades if shipping lines are the ones making such intense demands.\n1) Container Weight Verification: Opportunities and Challenges \nAt the top of the list is Lars Meurling, Vice President and Marketing Director of Bromma’s paper on the issues and potential solutions relating to the weighing of containers. This issue was recently covered by PTI, as container weight verification is not a simple process when some containers arrive without the correct verification documents . Mr Meurling concludes by saying that certification of the correct container weighing equipment could become a bottleneck unless bigger standards are accepted.\nTo view and download all of PTI's Technical Papers, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:07.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
