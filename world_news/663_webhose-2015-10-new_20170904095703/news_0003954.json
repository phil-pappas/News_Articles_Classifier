And if you require a personal weapon for your safety and protection, so be it.\nAs long as the Constitution allows it and you’re a responsible, Bible-loving human being, you are entitled to “packing heat” in order to counter life-threatening situations.\nIn many cases, the element of surprise plays a major role, and a small concealed gun means you have the upper hand.\nThe less a possible attacker or perpetrator knows about you, the better. In such cases, it’s best you hold a small pistol.\nBig powerful guns are preferable in case of home invasion or direct assault, but they’re nowhere near as easy to carry and conceal like a smaller caliber handgun.\nIn case you have to react fast, just reach for the waste line, under the bed or wherever else in reach you can place the gun holster (or simply the gun).\nDon’t get fooled by the idea of a small caliber. Just because it’s smaller and less dramatic, doesn’t mean it’s not just as efficient.\nSuch an easily concealable small pistol can be just as debilitating or even deadly (if case be) like any other riffle or “massive” caliber hand gun.\nIf you’re a gun enthusiast, you’ll know better than anybody else that when it comes to guns, it’s not about the size, but it’s all about how you use it.\nI’ll walk you through a list of my favorite small caliber concealable handguns that are sturdy, reliable and efficient. Have a look and see, maybe you’ll spot your favorite or discover a “hidden gem”.\nThe Diamond Back 9mm\nThe Diamond Back 9mmThis “pocket cannon” is the smallest 9mm handgun available on the market.\nIt’s excellent for concealed carry and in contrast to the .380, is cheaper and far more available.\nIts plain appearance is similar to the Glock, consisting of many round corners in order to make it easy to draw and maneuver.\nThe magazines pack seven rounds (6 + 1) and it also comes with a Crimson laser grip available.\nThe gun is not perfect, it has its own share of drawbacks (tiny grip, non-existing sights, a snappy recoil and small magazine capacity) but it’s easy to get and use and it’s very accurate at a range of seven yards, making headshots easy.\nThe Glock 26 Gen 3 9mm\nThe Glock 26 Gen 3 9mmThis particular tiny handgun was designed for concealed carry before everything else.\nIt has a small frame and short barrel, which can hold a magazine of 11 rounds (10 + 1). Even though the overall frame was reduced in comparison to the original Glock, this pistol retains the same body with of the original.\nThis makes for better handling and shooting of the firearm.\nThis gun is either produced here, in the US or imported directly from Austria.\nIt’s a very reliable 9mm, easy to carry, shot and reload.\nThe Smith & Wesson’s M&P SHIELD 9mm\nIt’s a striker-powered polymer gun, slim, light and it’s easily concealable due to its one inch profile and optimized 18 degree grip angle.\nThe pistol weighs 19 ounces and it measures a total of 6.1 inches (out of which the barrel measures 3.1 inches). The Smith & Wesson’s M&P SHIELD uses for fast tracking and aiming a standard 5.3 inch site radius and it’s been improved by adding a short and consistent trigger pull.\nIt’s a very reliable hand gun that can shot very accurately multiple rounds, maintaining its accuracy throughout the whole process.\nColt’s Mustang XSP .380Colt’s Mustang XSP .380\nThis tiny pistol is the Colt’s new and improved version of the Mustang, entirely comprised of a polymer frame.\nIt weighs about 12 ounces, which makes it the lightest Mustang model available.\nIt’s has a magazine capacity of 7 rounds (6 + 1) and it can shoot very accurately thanks to the addition of the front and read sights.\nIt has many great features, such as larger side serrations to improve the grip, ambidextrous safety and thumb-rest grip design.\nThe Ruger LCRx .38 Special\nThe Ruger LCRx .38 SpecialThis is the latest Ruger has to offer when it comes to their LCR technology (LCR stands for “Lightweight Carry Revolver”). The entire LCR series cones with Rugers patent-pending trigger system, which is an innovation in the field.\nThe particular and innovative trigger system is uniquely designed to reduce friction and to give the double-action shoot mode a smooth and even trigger pull, meant to greatly improve the accuracy of every shot fired.\nThey made this gun according to public demand, equipping it with an exposed hammer to enables single-action mode.\nIt’s very accurate, reliable and easily concealable.\nThese are my personal favorite small and concealable handguns.\nThey list is not set in order of preference, as I haven’t discovered an absolute favorite yet. But this doesn’t mean you can’t discover yours.\nYou have a few name to start from in case you plan on getting your own small pistol, but I personally recommend going past my recommendation and do more research.\nConsider carefully your options based on size, magazine capacity, grip, feel and of course, price.\nA gun is a very personal possession and you have to get one that fits you like a glove. Because when the stakes get high, your life might just rely on it.\nSource : http://www.myfamilysurvivalplan.com/top-5-easily-concealable-handguns/", "external_links": ["http://www.myfamilysurvivalplan.com/top-5-easily-concealable-handguns/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:58:20.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
