They can sit elsewhere and monitor the condition,\" said Rajasekaran.\n technology Science and Trends latest irrigation Also Read Hotel fined Rs 3.6 crore for blocking guestâ€™s personal Wi-Fi Disinvestment in PSBs in phased manner under consideration: Arun Jaitely HTC One M9 RBI survey sees manufacturing biz outlook improving in Q2", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/farmers_9_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151010/technology-science-and-trends/article/students-develop-device-aid-farmers-water-cultivation", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/farmers_9_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:39:19.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
