The company will also participate in a panel discussing best practices for virtualization. \nThe conference agenda includes speakers who will describe the systems they have developed to take advantage of virtualization. They represent the entertainment industry, design, GIS, gaming, and advanced technology including virtual reality, as well as small- and medium-sized businesses who want to make better use of their IT resources. \nNumecent customer Hexagon® Geospatial will also present at the Virtualize conference on how they have used Numecent's Cloudpaging technology to improve application delivery to their partners. Hexagon Geospatial CTO Brad Skelton will discuss how the company addressed and overcame challenges in delivering native applications to their users. \n\"Numecent provides the only on-demand application delivery solution that addresses the needs of VDI and physical client device users. As desktop environments get more complex using VDI, a seamless solution for application provisioning and delivery is essential. Numecent Cloudpaging technology ensures end users have access to the applications they need while simplifying the IT deployment process,\" said Tom Lagatta, CEO of Numecent. \nCloudpaging brings friction-free application delivery to VDI and non-VDI physical client devices. Applications are first 'cloudified' and abstracted in a pre-virtualized form inside a secure and license controlled container. The container is then demand-paged to the client platform from a central repository and executes inside a secure sandbox without actually requiring any installation. \nA minimal subset of the application container (typically 5%) is needed on initial run, ensuring that even geographically-dispersed users on low-bandwidth links have access to the latest applications on physical client devices. \nComplex GPU applications for engineering, medical and government verticals can leverage Cloudpaging to ensure that VDI users on virtualized or pass-thru GPU's delivered via pixel streaming (as well as physical client device users using local GPU's), have access to the same applications. \nNumecent's Cloudpaging technology helps deliver millions of application sessions annually and delivered more than 10,000 Cloudified applications, including major CAD, CAM, PLM and DCC applications, to many enterprises around the world. \nAbout NumecentNumecent is a fast-growing software and cloud-services company pioneering application delivery.
