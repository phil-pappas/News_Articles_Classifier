By integrating with Linq3’s fuel-pump lottery technology, NCR aims to help its retailers expand their reach and engage with Linq3 to enter this untapped market with a convenient way to play quick pick draw games at the forecourt. \n“Linq3’s technology integrates with existing NCR RPOS solutions,” said Jason Groff, NCR Director of Petroleum and Convenience. “So this represents a new, innovative, and low-risk way for us to help our retailers provide their consumers an extra measure of convenience while giving retailers additional opportunity to drive revenue.” \nTaking convenience to another level, consumers who play at the pump using Linq3’s solution, receive a text message with the numbers played and receive win notifications on to their mobile phone. For winnings valued under $600, Linq3 provides an automatic redemption feature that is credited to the card used for purchase. Additionally, Linq3’s features such as play limits and age verification help ensure responsible play. \n“NCR has a long history of innovation that improves consumer experience while driving retailer revenue. We’ve combined that with Linq3’s proven ability to help lotteries reach more consumers through a very convenient purchase point readily available,” said Daniel Cage, Linq3 CEO. \nNCR will be showcasing Play at the Pump in booth 5126 at the 2015 NACS Show in Las Vegas, Oct. 11-14. \nAbout Linq3 \nLinq3 provides a fast, convenient and secure way to play lottery. Linq3’s innovative technology creates an immediate playing experience that engages the consumer right at the point of sale.
