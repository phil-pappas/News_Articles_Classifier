This prevents it from being dropped. The device ensures that you have a firm grip on the tablet, which makes it easier to use a tablet computer for general purposes. The unit provides added peace of mind. Additionally, it is designed for easy, comfortable use.\nThe original design was submitted to the Long Island office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
