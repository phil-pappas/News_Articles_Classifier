The agreement will extend the reach of AnyClip’s library of licensed content to smartphones, tablets, Smart TVs, and streaming devices. \nOver the past few years, consumers have migrated to a new set of devices for video consumption. The proliferation of quality mobile broadband such as LTE, coupled with improved device capabilities, has lead to an eightfold increase in the number of mobile videos viewed in the past three years. Today nearly half of all online video is consumed via mobile device or tablet, meaning advertisers must identify and implement compelling experiences for handheld devices to retain their share of voice. In addition to smartphones and tablets, analysts such as Parks Associates estimate that around 18 million U.S. households have some form of streaming device and predict the category will grow more than 400% by 2019. \n“LKQD’s innovative team has built the perfect match for us as we expand our efforts to deliver premium, licensed content to advertisers, publishers, and viewers,” said Daryl McNutt, Chief Marketing Officer of AnyClip. “Their mobile platform fits AnyClip’s vision of providing state-of-the-art video and content delivery across all devices. Merging LKQD’s valuable ad serving solution with our licensed content will further benefit our partners and customers.” \nLKQD’s ad serving platform pairs with a feature-rich video player to enable easy set-up and scalability for publishers, enabling them to reach their audience regardless of which screen they’re using. This is achieved through the use of HTML5, which offers the flexibility to deliver device-agnostic viewing experiences. The partnership between AnyClip and LKQD allows publishers to incorporate licensed video clips into their content, while also monetizing through AnyClip’s advertiser relationships and dynamic, in-stream ad capabilities. \n“Advertisers today can be overwhelmed by both the number of video producers creating content and the variety of devices on which those videos will be viewed,” said Brian DeFrancesco, CEO and co-founder of LKQD. “AnyClip’s commitment to premium content and their progressive leadership in programmatic selling makes them an ideal partner for LKQD’s Marketplace and buyers seeking quality programmatic inventory and impactful ways to reach their audience.” \nThe partnership will provide programmatic verification of mobile inventory by industry leading brand analytics partners to ensure brand protection and provide inventory transparency. \nFor more information, visit http://solutions.anyclip.com \nAbout AnyClip \nAnyClip is a content marketing platform that connects top advertisers and publishers through premium video, offering in-stream targeting to create meaningful audience experiences.
