My impression is that the supervisory board and the new CEO know this.\"\nLongtime chief executive Martin Winterkorn resigned after the scandal broke in the U.S. on Sept. 18, and was replaced by Matthias Mueller.\nVolkswagen has suspended four individuals, including three managers who were responsible for engine development, and hired U.S. law firm Jones Day to conduct an investigation. Mueller says VW will have to review its investment plans.\nThe company says a recall of cars with the suspect software could start in Germany in January and last until the end of next year. On Wednesday, Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the automaker said in reply to German authorities' demand for a timetable that there would be a recall for vehicles with 2-liter, 1.6-liter and 1.2-liter engines.\nVW said the 2-liter engines will need a software update that should be ready before the year's end and be installed from the beginning of 2016, according to Dobrindt. He said 1.6-liter vehicles will need \"an engineering modification that according to Volkswagen shouldn't be expected before September 2016.\"\nThere are some 3.6 million 1.6-liter cars in Europe, Dobrindt said. He didn't say what fix 1.2-liter cars will require.\nThe software in question, known as a \"defeat device,\" is capable of turning on pollution controls for lab tests and shutting them off during real-world driving. German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported Thursday that VW apparently used it for that purpose in Europe as well as the U.S.\nVolkswagen said in an emailed response to questions about the report that \"whether and to what extent this software actually intervenes improperly is currently still the object of internal and external tests.\" The company added that it's also not yet clear whether the software was banned under European rules.\nGabriel warned against using the VW scandal to conduct \"a debate about the auto industry and about diesel\" in Germany. He said that more than 70,000 jobs depend on modern diesel technology.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:05:49.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
