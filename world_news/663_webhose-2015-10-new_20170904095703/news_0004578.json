The new prime real estate in Dubai will have a focus on quality not quantity - with a shift away from the 'longest, tallest and biggest' mind frame, at least in the very prime real estate segment.\" \nYolande Barnes, director of Savills world research, added: \"As its market has matured, Dubai has recognised that to ensure sustainable growth it needs to supply a full mix of office space and styles, including space that appeals to a growing number of tech and creative companies. \n\"This requires a completely different type of development mindset and approach to urban planning, which also needs to overcome the unique challenges posed by Dubai's climate.\" \nSavills said Dubai could rise to become a leading tech destination within the region if it addresses the urban planning issues that this implies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:28:20.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
