The mass-market VW brand most implicated in the scandal, saw sales rise 6.6 percent.\nThat compared with an overall increase in car registrations of nearly 10 percent to 1.35 million units across the region.\nThe VW Group, which eclipsed Toyota in the first half of the year to become the world's top-selling car maker, saw its European market share dip to 23.3 percent from 23.6 percent in September 2014. Last September, its sales growth exceeded the market.\nVolkswagen still remains by far the dominant automaker in Europe, well-ahead of second-place PSA Peugeot Citroen with 10 percent of the market.\nVolkswagen's emissions scandal broke in mid-September, when U.S. authorities revealed software that disabled emissions controls except when they were being tested. The company said there are a total of 11 million cars with such software, 8.5 million of which in Europe.\nBecause of the timing of the scandal, any impact on demand for Volkswagen cars would not be reflected entirely in the September sales data.\nSome European countries have suspended the sale of Volkswagen diesel models that contain the cheating software, pending a fix from the company.\nGerman authorities have ordered a recall of all VW cars fitted with the software, affecting all 8.5 million diesel cars across the EU. The company says a fix could stretch through 2016.\nSeptember's rise in EU car sales was the 25th straight monthly increase. While growth this year has been strong, ACEA noted the European market is still far below pre-crisis levels\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:38:51.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
