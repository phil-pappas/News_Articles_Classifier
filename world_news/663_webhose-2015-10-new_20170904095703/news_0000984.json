Ideal for manufacturers, contract manufacturers and private label manufacturers, the system includes workflow driven processes that help streamline operational efficiencies and improve labor productivity.\nThe Datex manufacturing software includes innovative features such as the ability to automatically advance the expiration date of a product based on the time it spends out of optimal storage conditions, ideal for temperature sensitive products and components such as food and pharmaceuticals. The software includes a feature for “material transformation” that facilitates packaging changes from SKU to SKU as well as product changes such as those when products are aged (wine, spirits, cheese, etc.). Datex Manufacturing software can track changes in the product Lot number without losing the historical information of the finished product or its components.\nStandard within the Datex Manufacturing software are features essential for manufacturing including the ability to track and balance raw materials and inventory during production, specification of production lines, temperature capture, calculation of component usage and much more. The Datex MES can handle multiple units of measure and can record up to 8 decimal places.\nThe new Datex manufacturing software is Microsoft-based. In 2015, Datex again attained the high status of Microsoft Gold Partner Competency for Software Application Development, the highest level of partnership in the Microsoft network. This designates companies that have been evaluated to provide the highest levels of technical expertise and ability to meet customer needs. The Microsoft Partner Gold Competency is exclusive, distinguishing the top 1% of the 640,000 Microsoft partners worldwide.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038342.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.datexcorp.com/solutions/wms/manufacturing-software", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038342.htm"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:23:11.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
