For more than 40 years, Ciber has delivered quality IT services to its clients around the world. Ciber was proud to have been selected by HIDOT to implement a system that would have benefitted Hawaii and is extremely disappointed in HIDOT's refusal to honor its contractual obligations and unnecessary waste of taxpayer resources. The Company believes the Court's ruling demonstrates that HIDOT filed its own frivolous lawsuit merely as retaliation after Ciber tried to collect funds due to the Company for the work it had already completed under its contractual obligations.\nAfter HIDOT refused to pay for work performed as contractually agreed, on February 5, 2015 , Ciber filed a claim with HIDOT's Chief Procurement Officer seeking damages, costs and other lawful recoveries arising from HIDOT's breaches of contract. Rather than attempt to address the issues presented by Ciber, on March 9, 2015 , HIDOT inexplicably terminated Ciber for default. After Ciber submitted a claim for wrongful termination, on August 28, 2015 , the Chief Procurement Officer denied Ciber's claims, but noted that the decision could be appealed within six months. Before Ciber had the chance to even file a claim, HIDOT filed its own complaint, making false and harmful allegations about Ciber. As demonstrated by the Court's ruling, HIDOT also ignored the mandatory administrative process required by the procurement code.\nCiber filed a complaint against HIDOT on September 25, 2015 seeking, among other things, an appeal of the termination and damages for wrongful termination and for breach of contract.\nAbout Ciber\nCiber is a global IT consulting company with some 6,500 employees in North America , Europe and Asia/Pacific , and approaching $1 billion in annual business. Ciber partners with organizations to develop technology strategies and solutions that deliver tangible business value. Founded in 1974, the company trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CBR).
