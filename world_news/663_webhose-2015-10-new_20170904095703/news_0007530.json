Baidu will take a 25 percent stake in Ctrip.com.\nCtrip.com has a market valuation of $10.6 billion, while the smaller Qunar is valued at $5.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\"We believe this will create greater value to our customers, partners and shareholders in the future,\" Ctrip.com's chief executive James Liang said in a statement.\nBloomberg had earlier reported the plan to merge, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.\nSuch mergers are becoming increasingly common in China's tech sector as a way of dealing with fierce competition between rival companies.\nEarlier this month, Meituan.com and Dianping Holdings - which provide online reviews and deals for restaurants and retail and leisure businesses - said they would merge after being fierce rivals for years.\nDidi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, two leading taxi-hailing firms, combined in a share swap worth $6 billion earlier this year.\nFour Ctrip.com representatives will join Qunar's board of directors, including CEO Liang and Chief Operating Officer Jane Sun. Baidu's Chief Executive Robin Li and Tony Yip, the firm's head of investments, have been appointed to Ctrip.com's board.\nQunar shares were up 24 percent at $49 in premarket trading in New York, while Ctrip.com shares rose 14.34 percent to $85.\n(Reporting by Paul Carsten; Additional reporting by Beijing Newsroom and Elzio Barreto in Hong Kong; Editing by Jason Subler, William Hardy and Jane Merriman )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:17:33.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
