Reinhart noted distribution centers, order-fulfillment centers, and warehouses have traditionally implemented some combination of three different types of software systems: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); Warehouse Management Systems (WMS); and Warehouse Control Systems (WCS) to manage the facility.\nFrom a high-level view, lines of responsibility typically fall as follows:\n· ERP: Sales; Procurement; Production; Distribution; Accounting; Human Resource; Customer Services; etc.\n· WMS: Transportation; Inbound Processing; Inventory Storage & Management; Order Management & Fulfillment; Shipping; etc.\n· WCS: Automation Control; Order Routing; Quality Control; Statistics Tracking and Monitoring; etc.\nWarehouse Management Systems and Warehouse Control Systems have overlapping components that can be combined to create a customized solution. This practice is also the premise of today’s Warehouse Execution Systems.\nWarehouse Management Systems and Warehouse Controls Systems are not a one-size-fits-all product. WMS and WCS providers should work with users to determine what aspects of the systems are needed for each situation. A Warehouse Control System that controls inventory within a facility is a wonderful concept that a lot of businesses use today. A Warehouse Management System that helps control automation can certainly be called a “Warehouse Execution System,” but really it is a customized integration that was uniquely designed to fit a particular user’s needs.\nTo read the entire article, go to: http://ow.ly/SFUZi\nAbout Bastian Solutions\nBastian Solutions (http://ow.ly/LaOTe), a global material handling systems integrator and expert in e-commerce fulfillment automation is an innovator in the fields of material handling automation, goods-to-person systems, wearable AR technology, supply chain software, and robotics.
