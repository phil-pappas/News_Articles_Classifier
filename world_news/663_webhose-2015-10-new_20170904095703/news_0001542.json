The team used fibroblasts from older people, which were directly converted into induced neurons that kept age-related signatures in the cells. The research could be helpful for studying age-related diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. \nNew Device Quickly Detects Gluten in Your Food Two MIT graduates created a portable sensor that can detect traces of gluten in food in two minutes. The device, called Nima, is the first product from the two year old company, 6SensorLabs. In the future the company hopes to expand to tests that find traces of peanuts and dairy. \nA Look at Landmark NIH Study on Substance Use and the Developing Brain In an exclusive interview with Bioscience Technology , Ian Colrain, Ph.D., executive director for Brain Sciences at SRI International discusses objectives and research methods in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The landmark NIH-funded study will follow 10,000 children over 10 years to observe how substance use affects the brain. \nASHG 2015: Cigarettes, Heavy Alcohol Use Linked to Epigenetic Aging News out of the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2015 Annual Meeting in Baltimore focused on epigenetic aging caused by heavy alcohol use and cigarette smoking. Researchers from the University of Iowa analyzed patterns of DNA methylation and found one to two drinks per day was associated with the healthiest aging. Both very high and low alchol use, along with all levels of tobacco exposure, were correlated with premature aging. \nGene Editing: Research Spurs Debate Over Promise vs. Ethics The final article in our round up this week looks at the potential of gene editing versus ethics surrounding the controversial CRISPR-Cas 9 technology. It can be used to change people’s genes in a way that passes traits to future generations, or to wipe out certain mosquitoes that carry malaria, but should it? Scientists weigh in on striking a balance. Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:57:28.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
