The new website utilizes a safer, more secure SSL Internet connection provided via Norton Secure by Symantec. The new site also includes a knowledge base section to communicate service options to customers and a project section to showcase recent completed projects .\nDTV Installations, founded in 2007, provides a wide range of services to clients, including installations for access control, CCTV security cameras, central vacuum cleaner units, home alarms, home audio systems, home theaters, intercom systems, and shading systems. In addition, DTV also offers smart home automation, TV mounting, and universal remote control programming. The company is an authorized dealer and certified installer for every major video, audio, and security brand.\n“We decided to redesign our website so people looking for installation services could easily see what we offer and what areas of New York we serve,” said John Lysy, DTV business owner and expert smart home automation installer. “We also wanted potential customers to know that we serve all of New York City and the Tri-State area. The new site will also have a mobile version that’s coming soon, so people can find out how we can help right from their mobile devices.”\nDTV’s website includes a contact form that new or existing clients can use to choose a specific service and then leave their contact information; a staff member from DTV then contacts each customer within 24 hours.\nThis commitment to efficient service is not a new concept for DTV Installations; the company has consistently focused on meeting customer needs quickly and effectively since its founding nearly 10 years ago.
