Providers should also check their malpractice insurance coverage to determine whether it includes telemedicine services; most professional liability insurance coverage excludes such coverage. In addition, providers should communicate with patients to ensure they understand risks such as power failure and potential exposure to outside hackers. \n\"Potential telemedicine providers need to understand what legal limits apply,\" according to the article. \"Many states impose requirements on the treatment of patients.
