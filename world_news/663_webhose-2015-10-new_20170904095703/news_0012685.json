As an event sponsor, we will be displaying our unique product line of UV LED Light Engines and Illumination Systems which feature configurable designs and a selection of UV LED wavelengths in single or multiple die combinations. The program, UV LED 2015, will take place October 28 to 29 in Troy, N.Y. and will discuss the latest developments in UV LED curing technology. The conference is organized by RadTech, the Association for Ultraviolet (UV) and Electron Beam (EB) Technology who recognizes the tremendous potential of UV LEDs, as well as the benefits of advancing this leading edge, enabling technology. UV LED technology helps to make manufacturing processes more energy efficient, environmentally friendly and economical.\nKey products on display include the Aurora™ Classic UV Line Sources which span across one direction for web or carriage based process equipment for the photopolymerization of inks, coatings, adhesives and sealants. LumiBright™ 3300B UV-LED Illuminators provide high UV power for Digital Light Processing (DLP®) devices used in 3D printing, maskless lithography, prepress digital imaging, phototherapy, and refractive surgery. LumiBright™ UV Light Engines feature an optical component matched in étendue to butt-couple high power UV into fiberoptic or liquid light guides for spot curing applications. OEM LED Driver/Controllers from Innovations in Optics provide constant current in either continuous, pulsed or PWM modes as well as network and Ethernet connectivity.\nInnovations in Optics, Inc. (IOI), founded in 1993 and located near Boston, offers high power LED light sources for science and industry that provide maximum photon delivery, illumination uniformity, and stable optical power. IOI products offer system-level advantages over lasers and arc lamps in OEM equipment for many applications. LumiBright™ light engines and illumination systems feature patented and patent-pending optics which collect, direct and maximize output efficiency and uniformity, enabling some of today’s most revolutionary solutions in cutting-edge technical applications for LED light sources", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:14:54.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
