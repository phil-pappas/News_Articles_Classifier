On display at booth 2023, the system enables ATT's new T & RH Discovery My test chambers to be managed and monitored from any place at any time, with mobile or desktop devices, using wi-fi, Ethernet or GPRS/UTMS.\nThe MyKratos free app fully controls the chamber via any mobile device and is available in Google Play and the Apple Store. And, as visitors are discovering, since August 2015 MyKratos has also been installed in other products such as vibration, walk‐in, vacuum, thermal shock and battery test chambers. Additional software tools allow easy integration of ATT chambers into customer‐developed serial or Ethernet-based applications (LabVIEW, LabWindows, Micorosft.NET, Visual Basic 6).", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/9273_image_1%202.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:34:57.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
