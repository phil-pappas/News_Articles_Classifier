The laptops are similar to previous versions released by Acer save for an updated sixth-generation quad core i7 processor – specifically the i7-6700HQ – and both models are considered some of the first to boast this sixth-generation processor and the first to implement it in their price range of approximately $1,000. “Experienced gamers know that the three most vital specifications to check on a gaming laptop are its CPU, GPU and RAM,” explains Dougherty. “With the two latest Acer Aspire V Nitro laptops running a powerful i7-6700HQ quad core i7processor and GTX960M, gamers can rest assured their devices are simultaneously running fast, preserving battery life and making their favorite games look even better.” The Aspire V17 Nitro VN7-792G-79LX comes complete with a Windows 10 Home operating system, Intel Core i7-6700HQquad core 2.60 GHz processor, 17.3-inch full high definition (1920 x 1080) widescreen (16:9) display, NVDIA GeForce GTX 960M with four gigabyte dedicated memory, eight gigabytes and one TB HDD. Further, a numeric keypad allows users to enter numbers quickly and easily with fewer errors, while a built-in DVD drive allows playback of content from DVDs or CDs, an Acer DustDefender performs periodic reversing of the cooling fan to expel dust, an IPS (In-Plane Switching) system allows colors to stay true no matter what angle users are viewing the screen from and a USB 3.0 interface easily transfers text and data files, photos and films at 10 times the speed of the USB 2.0 protocol. The Aspire V15 Nitro VN7-592G-71ZL comes with many of the same fetures as the ‘V17 but trades that model’s screen size for a 15.6-inch full HD 16 x 9 widescreen display and cost about 100 dollars less. Other standout elements include a wireless 802.11ac protocol for wireless data transfer rates of up to three times faster than those of 802.11n and the numeric keypad and AcerDust Defender, also found on the ‘V17. In conclusion, Dougherty comments, “Acer has managed a very good compromise of performance and ergonomics with these new models. The laptops have enough computing power for routine tasks while virtually any up-to-date computer game can be rendered smoothly.” # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:32:37.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
