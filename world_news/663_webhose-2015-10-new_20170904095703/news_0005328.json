Apopo prefers the African Giant Pouched Rat, who has a lifespan of about 8 years and is easier to train and be taught repetitive tasks due to its calm and trainable personality. How was this started? Back in 1995, Belgian student Bart Weetjens came across a study where gerbils had been used as scent finders, he came to the understanding that even rats could be trained to solve the global landmine problem, and would also be cheap, easy and smart to acquire. Two decades later, the super rats have helped seven nations get rid of buried threats, that otherwise unactivated, are deadly poisonous. Why rats? Well, in comparison to dogs, these rats only weigh two pounds, which isn’t enough to set off a landmine, so they can detect one easily without danger. These African Native varieties don’t bond with the trainers and are more sustained to survive in harsher climates. Next question, “How can rats be trained to perform such magnitude of important tasks?” Related Posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:51:52.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
