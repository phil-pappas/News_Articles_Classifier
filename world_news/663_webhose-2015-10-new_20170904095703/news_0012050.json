By Jing Cao Bloomberg News \nMicrosoft has the upper hand in its “intense competition” with Amazon.com for talent and is the only company that can compete with Apple over hardware, said former Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. \n“I think they (Amazon) are a place people don’t want to work,” he said in an interview Friday on Bloomberg TV. Anybody who left Microsoft to go to Amazon, “we can count on them coming back within a year or two. It’s just not a great place to do innovative stuff as an engineer.” \nHis comments about Amazon followed an August article in The New York Times that mentions employees crying at their desks and an evaluation process that encourages criticism of co-workers. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos and others at the company have said the article wasn’t accurate. The Seattle-based company didn’t immediately respond to a request for response on Ballmer’s comments. \nMicrosoft, where Ballmer was CEO from 2000 to 2014, is giving Apple “a run for their money,” he said.
