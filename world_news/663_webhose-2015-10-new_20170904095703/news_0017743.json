The award recognizes CISBOT for its ability to efficiently rehabilitate large diameter cast iron gas mains with minimal excavation, minimal disruption to the public and without the need to disrupt gas service to local residents and businesses. ULC is honored and excited to be recognized as one of Robotics Business Review’s Game Changer Award winners,” said Gregory Penza, president and CEO, ULC Robotics, Inc. “With the support of our customers we have been able to make CISBOT a successful commercial operation and we will continue to develop game changing robotic systems to aid in solving difficult operational and environmental challenges facing the natural gas and energy industries.”\nCISBOT operates underground through one small excavation to repair and reinforce joints in cast iron pipelines. CISBOT is revolutionizing the way gas utilities in the US and UK are maintaining these vital assets. The robotic system’s small site footprint and ability to work with virtually no excavation nearly eliminates the public disruption often associated with traditional pipeline repair or replacement. Residential and business gas customers appreciate CISBOT because gas service remains turned on during the procedure.\nCISBOT was chosen as a Game Changer by a panel consisting of Robotics Business Review and Robotics Trends editors as well as by distinguished experts from the International Journal of Advanced Robotics Systems (IJARS). Products were judged based on standout attributes, design, functionality, impact and overall benefit to the robotics industry.\nTo view CISBOT’s Game Changer Award submission and see all Game Changer Award winners please visit http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com\nAbout ULC Robotics, Inc.\nULC Robotics, Inc. is a leader in developing and deploying innovative technology and processes that help pipeline operators and energy companies repair, inspect and assess their infrastructure.
