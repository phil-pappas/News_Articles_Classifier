Designed for centennials and younger millennials, Zapstream makes capturing and sharing live moments more fun and social than other apps by allowing users to do more while streaming. Unlike other streaming apps that are simple camera feeds, Zapstream empowers users to add text, drawings, and visual and aural effects directly to their live video streams in real time. Zapstream’s research determined that most consumers, particularly centennials, don’t want or have the time to watch entire streams after they’re not live. (For example, most Periscope users only spend a very small amount of time watching a tiny fraction of each stream). So Zapstream allows its users to automatically create and share 15-second video stories, called “Zaps,” that memorialize the best moments from their live streams. Zaps can be more easily shared (Facebook, Twitter) and viewed among more people than an entire stream. Users can also create customized Zaps by selecting specific snippets from their stream, or simply “re-zap” until they get a Zap they like the most.\n“Other apps only allow users to see the world through someone else’s eyes,” said AK Sands, CEO and founder of Zapstream. “That’s a decent start, but it’s not very fun or engaging for centennials. So we built an app that allows these users to do more and create the most fun and engaging live streaming experiences for both creators and viewers. ”\nZapstream – Do More. See More.\nZapstream can be used anywhere when someone wants to share live moments, such as school dances, trips, sporting events, parties, concerts, family BBQs, weddings, and more.\nZapstream allows users to do more directly within their live streams. Users can draw or “doodle” on a friend they’re recording, add text like a witty remark, or change the pitch of their voice to sound like a chipmunk or a baritone. Users can also add fun filters like bulge, slim or cartoon, and color filters like rainbow, sepia or black-and-white to create different looks for their streams. Creators and viewers can also take photo snapshots of any live stream to share instantly on Twitter and Facebook.\nUsers can choose to share their streams or Zaps publicly with anyone or privately among invited friends. Zaps can be saved directly to users’ iPhones. Users can also choose to get a notification when anyone they follow starts a stream – or let their followers know when they begin a stream by tapping the “promote” icon (a group of people) or using Zapstream to announce it on Facebook or Twitter. Finally, users can ask any follower to start a live stream by tapping the “request” icon on a user’s profile.\nZapstream is available now for download onto iOS devices: http://www.zapstream.me/download . An Android version will be available in a few months.
