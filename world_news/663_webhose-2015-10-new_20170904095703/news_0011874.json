The videos will be distributed to more than 200 planetariums. \nThe university says about 20 million people visit planetariums each year, but most facilities lack the resources to create such videos featuring new discoveries. \nCU-boulder is one of 27 partners selected by NASA to promote science education. \nInformation from: Daily Times-Call, http://timescall.com/ \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:22:44.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
