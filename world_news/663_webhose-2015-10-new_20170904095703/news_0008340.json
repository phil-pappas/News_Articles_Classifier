Data Protection Commissioner (C-362/14), invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor program. \nBackground: EU Data Protection \nWhile the United States has taken a patchwork approach to privacy with laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (for health care entities), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (for financial institutions), as well as various state and federal laws (for employment relationships), the EU has a broad overarching law covering all industry sectors: Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (” \nIn order to facilitate business between the United States and EU, the United States and EU negotiated an agreement whereby U.S. companies wishing to process EU residents’ personal data could do so by qualifying for, and meeting, certain principles and guidelines. These principles and guidelines were set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework (“Safe Harbor). [2] The Safe Harbor required adherence to guidance materials and seven basic principles: notice, choice, onward transfer limitation, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. Companies could self-certify that they were in compliance with the Safe Harbor and process (which, under the Directive, includes transferring) EU data. \nCompanies that did not proceed with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor certification could export personal data from the EU by one of two alternative methods: Model Contract Clauses [3] or Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs). [4] The EU Model Contract Clauses, when inserted in agreements, provide for the collection and processing of personal data in compliance with EU law regarding transfers to third countries. BCRs can be adopted by multinationals or multinational groups of companies to ensure that a company maintains standards compliant with EU data protection rules. \nThe Schrems Case and Ruling \nSchrems raised significant concerns after the leaks from Edward Snowden about the U.S. government’s Prism program revealed the extent to which the U.S. government routinely accesses and processes data from the Internet and from U.S. companies servers. Because the surveillance was sufficiently broad and routine, Schrems contended that it violated EU law. \nSince Facebook’s subsidiary is located in Ireland, Schrems raised his complaint with the Irish Data Protection Authority, and, after appeals through the EU system, the ECJ issued its ruling. The ruling held that the Safe Harbor is incompatible with the Directive and its associated laws and rulings. In addition, the ruling held that national data protection authorities do have the power to investigate complaints regarding the export of data to non-EU countries over violations of EU residents’ rights in those countries. \nImpact of Ruling \nAny company that has been relying on the Safe Harbor certification is affected by this ruling. This could include U.S. companies selling to EU customers if EU customer information is transferred to the United States and companies that may be transferring employee information between the United States and the EU. The ECJ did not offer a grace period for compliance, so affected companies relying on the Safe Harbor must now find alternate methods to demonstrate compliance. To move towards compliance, there are several steps companies can take, including the following: Institute Binding Corporate Rules or Model Contract Clauses Strengthen Privacy Practices Generally \n” With the Schrems ruling, it is likely that the EU will seek to address the gap left behind by the invalidation of the Safe Harbor, either through the GDPR itself or through a side agreement negotiated with the United States. \nThe U.S. Department of Commerce responded to the Schrems decision by stating that a new Safe Harbor Framework has been in negotiations for two years and that the Department of Commerce and the EU will work to finalize the new Framework “as soon as possible. [7] Additional responses from both the Department of Commerce and the EU will likely be forthcoming, [8] potentially including new guidance. We will keep you posted regarding if or when those bodies respond further.
