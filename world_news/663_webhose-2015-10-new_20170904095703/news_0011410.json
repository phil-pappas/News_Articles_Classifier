The Be Instrumental campaign expands the conversation on the fundamental transformation occurring in today's data center, begun with the company's Disk Is Dead and No SSDs conversation launched in May 2015 which achieved over one million impressions in the campaign's first seven weeks and set new lead generation marks for the company. Be Instrumental challenges IT and storage professionals to drive competitive and economic advantages within their companies and by doing so find themselves being truly instrumental to the success of their companies. \nThe new campaign is being launched through all communication channels, including at Oracle OpenWorld, and will initially feature both strategic and technical messages, including, \"It's time to reset the economics in enterprise storage so you can Be Instrumental\" and \"Act like a DBA (Database Administrator). Think Like a CEO. Be Instrumental.\" Each message is designed to spur action within the IT community to look at the advantages of deploying flash at scale, which is supported by IDC's white paper \"Why AFA Architecture Matters as Enterprises Pursue Dense Mixed Workload Consolidation,\" by Eric Burgener, Research Director, Storage. \nTo celebrate the Be Instrumental launch, Violin Memory will have three 49ers Legends, who have each won three Super Bowls and who were all highly instrumental in the success of the 49ers, in its Oracle OpenWorld booth #1531 for meet and greets, photo opportunities and specially designed Violin Memory, as the official data storage provider of Levi's Stadium and the San Francisco 49ers, memorabilia for autographs. Guy McIntyre: Monday from 1:00pm-2:00pm Jerry Rice: Tuesday from 1:30pm-2:30pm Bubba Paris: Wednesday from 1:00pm-2:00pm \n\"The Be Instrumental campaign provides unlimited possibilities for driving thought leadership within the IT industry about the power of vision and action to drive competitive and economic advantage through technology,\" said Amy Love, Chief Marketing Officer for Violin Memory. \"The messaging begins by challenging IT and storage leaders to be instrumental in their companies. As Violin evolves the campaign, we will bring to life a series real world examples of IT professionals who are embracing what it means to be instrumental in the success of their companies.\" \nUnderpinning the importance of leadership, Violin also released today a new IT Insight video series that begins with an interview with the former CTO of Cigna, John DeFeo discussing the fundamental transformation that is occurring in IT. www.violin-memory.com/it-insights-john-defeo \nSaid Ouissal, head of Violin Memory's worldwide field operations said, \"Our customers know that the enterprise data center for tier-one storage is going to all flash. It's not a matter of if, but when. The Violin Flash Storage Platform resets the performance, reliability and economics of data storage that no other vendor can match. Flash is the new imperative and flash provides the opportunity for our customers to be instrumental within their companies to gain a strong competitive edge.\" \nAdditional Activities at Oracle OpenWorld Kevin DeNuccio, CEO Violin Memory, will be interviewed by the Cube Tuesday morning at 9:00am and will be broadcast during the show.
