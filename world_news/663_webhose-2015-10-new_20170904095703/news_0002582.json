This is no different from what YouTube offers its web-only independent creators. \nSome of the companies kicked back at first, arguing for disproportionate share compared to smaller YouTube creators, but YouTube is managing to keep the revenue split terms intact so far. Other companies continue to negotiate the terms of joining up. In the absence of preferred rates, some traditional media companies have been negotiating for extras, “such as guarantees that their content will receive additional promotion on YouTube, to sweeten potential deals,” the WSJ reported. \nYouTube is hoping to launch the service soon at around $10 per month. Google had confirmed in the spring that it was bringing an ad-free YouTube out, likely before year-end. \n“We are progressing according to plan to provide fans with more options in how they enjoy content on YouTube,” Google said. “We have support from the overwhelming majority of our partners, with over 98% of content watched on YouTube covered by agreements, and more in the pipeline about to close.” \nSome media companies felt strong-armed by the company, but went along anyway. \n“I’d rather not have anything to do with it,” one media executive told the WSJ. But the marketing and advertising benefits from being able to have clips up on the site “slightly outweigh the negative.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:44:17.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
