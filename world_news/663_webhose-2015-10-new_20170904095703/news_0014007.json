Because the process of obtaining credit can be confusing, there's no better place for people to start than with the actual credit scores their lenders are using.\" FICO ® Score Open Access, the program that allows lenders to provide FICO ® Scores to consumers for free, has proven beneficial for both consumers and lenders, as described in a new [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQnpPaTh2Y0docGJHRmtaV3h3YUdsaFptVmtMbTl5Wnk4dEwyMWxaR2xoTDJOdmJuTjFiV1Z5TFdOeVpXUnBkQzFoYm1RdGNHRjViV1Z1ZEhNdmNHRjViV1Z1ZEMxallYSmtjeTFqWlc1MFpYSXZjSFZpYkdsallYUnBiMjV6TDJScGMyTjFjM05wYjI0dGNHRndaWEp6THpJd01UVXZaQ1V5TURJd01UVmZZMkZ1TFdOeVpXUnBkQzFqWVhKa2N5MTNhWFJvTFdGalkyVnpjeTV3WkdZL2JHRTlaVzVjSWlCeVpXdzlYQ0p1YjJadmJHeHZkMXdpSUhSaGNtZGxkRDFjSWw5aWJHRnVhMXdpUG5KbGNHOXlkRHd2WVQ0PXw=]] published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Payment Card Center and based on data from Barclaycard, a participant in the FICO program. 1 The report summarizes Barclaycard's experience providing cardholders with regular, free access to their FICO ® Scores through the FICO ® Score Open Access program. Among Barclaycard's findings: 84 percent of enrolled cardholders check their FICO Scores every month Credit card utilization by the riskiest cardholders generally declines after they enroll in the program Delinquency rates of the people enrolled in the program remain below those of their nonparticipating peers for up to nine months after enrollment \"The program aligns with our overall business philosophy of being fair and transparent,\" said Paul Wilmore , Managing Director of Barclaycard. \"We are pleased that the preliminary data shows that cardmembers actively accessing this information are becoming better consumers of credit.\" The success of the FICO program extends beyond the holders of 100 million consumer accounts. FICO ® Score Open Access for Credit & Financial Counseling, launched to help the estimated one million consumers annually who are in need of credit and financial guidance, has signed on more than 30 non-profit credit counseling providers just six months after launching. The program has enabled qualified counselors, like those at New York Legal Assistance Group, to share FICO Scores along with additional credit education materials, so they can have deeper conversations with their clients and help provide a more sustainable path to rebuilding their financial health. \"This tool has provided an unprecedented opportunity for our counseling program, and the low-income, vulnerable populations we serve,\" said Doug Ostrov , director of financial counseling at the New York Legal Assistance Group. \"By accessing individual FICO Scores, these consumers and their financial counselors can have a fruitful conversation about what these scores mean and how they can be improved to enhance a person's overall economic stability. Our clients are eagerly attending workshops where we share FICO Scores. It provides a teaching moment, where clients see for themselves what the problems are and how, together, we can make a plan to fix them. In just a few short months, NYLAG has disclosed FICO Scores to more than 500 clients – and we look forward to working with hundreds more as the program unfolds.\" Eligible organizations interested in participating in the FICO ® Score Open Access for Credit & Financial Counseling program may visit the [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQnpPaTh2WTI5dGJYVnVhWFI1TG1acFkyOHVZMjl0TDJOdmJXMTFibWwwZVM5bWFXTnZMWE5qYjNKbExXOXdaVzR0WVdOalpYTnpMV1p2Y2kxamNtVmthWFF0WVc1a0xXWnBibUZ1WTJsaGJDMWpiM1Z1YzJWc2FXNW5YQ0lnY21Wc1BWd2libTltYjJ4c2IzZGNJaUIwWVhKblpYUTlYQ0pmWW14aGJtdGNJajVHU1VOUElFTnZiVzExYm1sMGVTQm1iM0lnWTNKbFpHbDBJR0Z1WkNCbWFXNWhibU5wWVd3Z1kyOTFibk5sYkdsdVp6d3ZZVDQ9fA==]].
