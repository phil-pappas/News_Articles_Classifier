These orders – from new and existing customers – demonstrate the considerable potential of this unique technology in the global maritime sector,” said Ottonel Popesco , Cavotec CEO. \nWatch: \"Automation is the key to mega-ship handling\" Ottonel Popescu: \n\nIn the largest of these projects, Cavotec is to supply six MoorMaster units for the two locks on the US side of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The units are scheduled for delivery for the first lock in July 2016, and the second lock in April the following year. \nRead a Technical Paper from Cavotec’s Yann Duclot on how the industry needs innovative and integrated ports \nMoorMaster units have been in operation at the Seaway for a number of years, and Cavotec is currently completing installation of 39 MoorMaster MM400L (Lock) units in all 13 of the locks on the Canadian side of the waterway. These specially adapted units hold vessels securely through variations in water level of up to 14m. \nThe St. Lawrence is the world's first inland waterway to introduce automated mooring. Work began on installing the first MoorMaster ™ units at the St. Lawrence, on a trial basis, at two locks in 2007. \n“We have worked closely with the St. Lawrence Seaway for many years, and together we have been able to realise substantial operational efficiencies through the implementation of MoorMaster ,” says Marcelo Gonzalez, Managing Director of Cavotec Canada. \nConsidered to be one of the greatest engineering feats of the 20th century, the 3,700km-long Seaway is an essential trade link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes at the heart of North America. \nAnd in Newfoundland, eastern Canada, Cavotec has won a contract for four MoorMaster MM400E10 units for the Portugal Cove – Bell Island passenger ferry service. Two units will be installed at the Portugal Cove Dock and two at the Bell Island Dock. \nThe third order has been placed by SeaRoad Holdings a leading Australian transport and logistics provider. SeaRoad Holdings has purchased two additional MoorMaster MM400A10 units to supplement their existing installations in Devonport in Melbourne. \nThis brings the mooring capacity to five MM400s at each berth to cater for a larger Ro/Ro vessel being introduced on the route between Melbourne and Tasmania. \nAdditionally, SeaRoad is working with Cavotec’s After Sales and Service department to project manage and overhaul the existing units without disruption to operations. These existing units have been in continuous service since 2003 and have accumulated more than 35,000 hours of mooring at each berth. \nMoorMaster is a vacuum-based automated mooring technology that eliminates the need for conventional mooring lines. Remote controlled vacuum pads recessed in, or mounted on the quayside or pontoons, moor and release vessels in seconds. To date, 200 MoorMaster units are installed at 28 locations around the world and have completed more than 130,000 mooring operations at their Ro/Ro, container and bulk handling and lock applications. \nFact File : Cavotec is a leading global engineering group, developing innovative technologies that enable the maritime, airports, mining and tunnelling, and general industry sectors to operate productively and sustainably.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:37:59.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
