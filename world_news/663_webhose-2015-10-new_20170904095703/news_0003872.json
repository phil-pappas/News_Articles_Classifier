Email address 1: James Rundle 08 October 2015 The European Commission's Capital Markets Union action plan received a mixed reception during a European Parliament debate on October 7, with MEPs expressing their concerns that excessive securitisation could spawn another financial crisis. \nDuring the plenary debate, representatives of the major political groups within the Parliament had up to three minutes each to speak about the CMU, detailed plans for which were released by the European Commission on September 30. \nThe CMU project is an ambitious attempt to reform how companies are funded in Europe. Typically, small to medium-sized enterprises have relied on bank loans as a primary source of capital, but the EC wants this to diversify by removing financial barriers between member states to enable investment by citizens in European companies, and making it easier for firms to list on stock exchanges. \nWhile MEPs hailed the objectives of CMU, they were generally uneasy over an expansion of securitisation, which is the packaging of company assets and debt into tradable instruments. \nMolly Scott Cato, a Green MEP from the UK, said: “For those of us who are not yet ready to forgive and forget the financial crisis of 2008, this sets alarm bells ringing. \n“With securitisation, market traders created a dangerous game of pass the parcel where nobody could be sure whose parcel contained the toxic assets. Securitisation is an attempt to pretend that hiding risk is the same as reducing risk, when it is nothing of the sort.” \nSimilarly, Spanish MEP Miguel Urbán Crespo from the Podemos political party said that CMU could not be a mechanism for creating a “casino economy where the bank always wins”. \nThe Parlianment is not the only institution that has become concerned by the importance that securitisation has for CMU. The European Banking Authority, in its response to the EC's consultation on the project, seemed hesitant to endorse securitisation as a mechanism for capital market growth.
