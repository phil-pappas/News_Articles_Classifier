At Wednesday's event the company appealed to potential advertisers by highlighting Twitter's ability to determine what people are talking about in any given moment, such as a major news event.\nAs part of that effort, Chris Moody, the company's vice president of data strategy, announced two new software tools that should provide deeper insights into how the audience on Twitter is responding to an event and how engaged users are.\nAt the event, the company also described some of the tools developers have access to in order to see who is using their apps, which Twitter said can help programmers improve their products.\nThe company also unveiled more ways for advertisers to use data from the company and more tools to let publishers embed tweets in apps and websites.
