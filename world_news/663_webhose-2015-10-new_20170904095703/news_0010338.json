Owing to this, the space agency, released a report about its progress and plans for the Mars mission. Apart from other long term goals, the agency gave a peek into some amazing technologies, which it plans to develop in coming years, to make the Mars Mission a reality as soon as possible. Here are our favourite five: New spacesuits : The very first thing that comes to mind when talking about a space mission is the spacesuit itself. Today’s spacesuits look more like inflated balloons than proper body hugging smart suits. Considering, astronauts going to Mars will have to spend nearly a year or more on the planet involving moving and roaming around, exploring and collecting data, the suit they wear should be such that it protects them from the damaging radiations of Mars and its cold thin atmosphere while still allowing them to move around freely in order to complete their work. The researchers want to make spacesuits that are easier to get around in. They may also incorporate augmented reality, self-healing materials, and interwoven bio-monitors. NASA plans to test a next-gen spacesuit when it sends astronauts to rendezvous with a boulder during the Asteroid Redirect Mission. Deep Space Habitats: If we look at the mission we really can’t expect the astronauts to go to the Mars in a rocket and cram them in an Orion capsule for three years. So NASA wants a deep space habitat that attaches to the Orion capsule to provide more living space (and a bathroom) for the astronauts on board, as well as a habitat for them to live in on Mars. Such a habitat would need to provide life support, fire prevention, and radiation protection, in addition to giving the astronauts room to exercise and do their work.
