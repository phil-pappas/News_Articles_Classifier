These technologies are designed to help petroleum retailers gain greater efficiencies in handling internal and external processes.\n Business Process Management (BPM): Titan introduces BPM to the retail petroleum industry. Used by Fortune 50-ranking companies for many years, BPM replaces manual workflow and paperwork with customizable, automated processes. Day-to-day challenges faced by operators, such as ATG priority alarm management, can now be modeled, automated, and integrated into the business for an immediate return on investment.\n Perfect Gallon: Titan launches Perfect Gallon version 1.0 wetstock management to its customers, which includes adjusted delivery verification, tank & meter theft detection, meter calibration reporting, and precision fuel variance detection. Going beyond rough ATG values and monthly reports, Perfect Gallon offers real-time, hourly, and shift reporting results to help fuel managers stay on top of risks and optimize in-ground fuel inventory management.\n ATG Console Connect: Based on technician demand, Titan introduces a set of secure, web-based ATG interfaces, beginning with the Veeder-Root TLS-350. This new solution places an ATG console image on a tablet, laptop, or smartphone, and allows certified technicians to program a tank gauge remotely, precisely as they would interface with the physical device on location. Additionally, the technology enables technicians to run commands and execute detailed troubleshooting via any modern browser. This saves time and company resources in the management of ATG networks.\n“We are excited about these latest advancements, driven both by our customers who represent the leading petroleum marketers, and our software engineering team, whose job it is to relentlessly pursue new technology advancements and incorporate best practices into our industry-standard cloud platform,” said Scot Thrash, Chief Operating Officer at Titan Cloud Software.\nTitan continues to enhance its feature-rich solutions providing its retail petroleum customers the software tools they need to better manage risk and fuel profit.\nAbout Titan\nTitan Cloud Software is the fuel industry's leading cloud platform with a comprehensive suite of over 50 modules, apps, and equipment connectors for fuel analytics, environmental compliance, and facility maintenance.
