I have talked about it throughout the years here on Ghacks, the first time back in 2011 and several times since then when important updates were released by the developing company. \nThe program ships with support for local email clients such as Microsoft Outlook or Mozilla Thunderbird that it detects automatically when you make the selection, support for email accounts that you can integrate into the backup program just like you would in desktop or mobile email clients, and support for email files. \nYou may add one or multiple email clients or addresses to MailStore Home to backup all emails they contain whenever the need arises. \nThis process is automated and runs in the background for the most part once you have created a new profile (address, client or files) that you want to back up. You do get options though to configure filters or pick folders that you want included or excluded in the operation but all of that is completely optional. \nWhat I like specifically about the program is that it provides you with search options. You can search across all profiles, read emails offline using the program or open attachments. \nWhile its main purpose is email archiving and making those emails available to the user, it is supporting exporting as well. This means that you can use it to migrate from a client to another using MailStore Home. \nIf you don't run the latest version of the email backup program you will be reminded by it that a new version is available. \nA click on the \"check for updates\" link queries a company server to find out if new versions are available. If that's the case an option to download the latest update is displayed in the interface. This downloads and installs the latest version of the program on your system. \nMailStore Home worked fine on Windows 10 even before the update but this update makes it official. The same is true for the email client Outlook 2016 which Microsoft released recently. \nNew MailStore users may download the most recent free version of the email archiving software from the developer website . MailStore may be installed on the system but can also be run as a portable client instead if that is preferred or desired. (via Caschy ) \nNow You : Do you back up emails?
