Investissement Québec and Montréal International provided help to set up and develop its local operations. \"Greater Montréal has distinct advantages, such as a strategic geographic location and very competitive operating costs that enable it to position itself favourably on the international stage and tap into the potential of big data operations,\" said Élie Farah, Vice President, Investment Greater Montréal, Montréal International. \"In the era of 'big data,' the presence of a major player such as OVH.com definitely strengthens the region's expertise as a data hosting and IT services centre of excellence,\" he added.
