More than 70 worldwide leaders of the tourism and hospitality industry will speak at MR&H, in order to attract investors and developers seeking new opportunities in the Mediterranean.\nThere is tremendous potential for Travel & Tourism expansion in the region and Spain in particular.

In order for the region to continue to meet its growth potential, it must focus further on targeted and smart investment in tourism infrastructure – the building of hotels, expansion of airports and port facilities.\nThe MR&H 2015 programme includes more than 20 conference sessions focused on analyzing the outlook for both the emerging and mature destinations in the Mediterranean. The line-up of distinguished industry experts include, HE Mr. José Manuel Soria, Spanish Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism, speaking on “Challenges & Opportunities – The Mediterranean Tourism Leaders Speak Out”, in which HE Dr. Lahcen Haddad Minister of Tourism of Morocco, and HE Mr. Darko Lorencin, Minister of Tourism of Croatia will also participate.\nThe conference will be introduced by Taleb D.Raifai, General Secretary of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and David Scowsill, President & Chief Executive Officer of the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), organisers of annual Global Summit recently held in Madrid, will conclude the conference introduction.\nDavid Scowsill will represent the voice of the private business whilst addressing the developments of the Travel & Tourism sector in the Mediterranean. Scowsill will discuss the importance of investment in tourism infrastructure and human capital to meet the potential and forecast growth of our sector to create jobs, financial security and economic wealth. Scowsill states that, tourism will continue acting as a driving force for employment: “In 2014, the total contribution of Travel & Tourism to employment, including jobs indirectly supported by the industry, was 11.5% of total employment or 19.6 million jobs. This is expected to rise by 2.9% in 2015 to 20.2 million jobs and rise by 1.8% pa to 24.2 million jobs in 2025 (12.3% of total).”\nFollowing the official welcome, Nenad Pacek, Co-Founder, CEEMEA Business Group President, Global Success Advisors Ltd. will start the conference with his Keynote presentation focusing on the future for Mediterranean countries economies. Nenad has commented: “After many years of shallow recessions or no growth, markets in the European Union are starting to grow again. This should be good news for the tourism industry in the Mediterranean in the coming years. European destinations could benefit more in the coming years from the negative security perceptions regarding parts of North Africa and eastern Mediterranean”.\nThe second Keynote speaker is Daniel Levine, The Avant-Guide Institute Director and global trend expert discussing “What is around the corner and changing our world?”. Levine will explore how the hotel and restaurant investment community can take advantage of social media trends from an innovative point of view, in order to attract guests, generate excitement and increase sales.\nThe MR&H 2015 programme will address the hottest topics in the sector of tourism and investment in hotels throughout its two-day conferences.
