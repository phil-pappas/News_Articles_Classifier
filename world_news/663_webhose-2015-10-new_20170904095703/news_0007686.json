Urban driving now has an option for smarter mobility, thanks to Ford’s MoDe: Flex, the most versatile eBike yet.\nAs part of their Smart Mobility plan, Ford has been developing three ebikes: “MoDe: Flex,” “MoDe: Me,” and “MoDe: Pro.”\nThe “MoDe: Flex” is the latest of the introduced lineup that focuses on the unification of smart technology into the eBike. It features a a vibrating handlebar that warns its riders if another vehicle is passing through. It also tells the riders when to turn while using its navigation system.\nThe Flex eBike can be detached into two parts, making both pieces small enough to be stored inside vehicles. This seems to be a move by Ford to merge driving and commute. The idea here, is drive toward the destination, park somewhere, take out the Flex ebike and pedal the rest of the way.\nThis is truly convenient in bustling cities such as Makati, Global City, and Ortigas, where it is commonplace to find the nearest parking spot to work (which can still be pretty a far walking distance).\nThis is where the “no sweat” mode kicks it. It’s an interesting idea where the Flex will detect the rider’s heart rate and activate the electric assist, which is basically a “cruise control,” allowing riders to simply focus on nagivation.\n“MoDe: Pro” is designed for commercial use. These are geared up for couriers and deliveries. Combine that with the idea of having zero carbon emissions, the “MoDe: Pro” sounds like a novel thing. It has a 25km/h at top speed, and that’s not a bad thing considering it would be much faster than taking the traffic head-on. It’s also lighter, which makes it easier to carry around when needed.\n“MoDe: Me” is more for urban commuters, and shorter rides around the corner.\nBut wait, there’s more.\n“MoDe: Link” is a smartphone app that informs the rider about the weather, routes, and other hazards along the road. This sounds like a spectacular companion to have while “eBiking”, particularly MoDe-ing along the unpredictable urban landscapes of the Philippines.\nCompared to other eBikes around, Ford has the best looking ones, modern and stylish. And in this time of digitalization, where everything can be customized, we can bet that farther down the line more stylish eBikes will start rolling out.\nWhile a full-on adoption of eBikes is a long road ahead of us, Ford is taking every step to bring it down to a way where everyone will be able to put one into their own homes.\nThe fact that laws are being mandated specifically for eBikes shows that this is going down the lane in the long run. E-Bikes, they say, helps you get around faster, maintains health, and eliminates carbon emissions. All in line with Ford’s principles of producing something efficient, smart, and green.\nSo, it is only natural for Ford to drive forward into re-developing older technologies into a fresh and modern perspective.\nJust because Ford has specialized in putting together cars and SUVs for over a century, does not mean they do not understand how bikes work. The two-whelled wonder, in fact, is the father of the four-wheelers.\nAnd staying true to their principles in building green and smart technologies, Ford is not only looking after to lessen carbon emissions from vehicles, but also the noise pollution from other motor-powered bikes.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:55:48.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
