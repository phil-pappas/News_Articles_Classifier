The US office brings the French company closer to the North American epicenter of Android development and innovation and comes in response to the growing demand for local expertise and support for enterprise-grade Android applications and purpose-built versions of the Android operating system (OS). \nThe decision to establish a presence in the US comes in the wake of rapid adoption of the Android OS in the workplace: In 2015 Android moved ahead of iOS for the first time in high-tech sectors, (increasing to 53 percent) and saw significant gains in energy (48 percent) and manufacturing (42 percent).[1] The company has been at the forefront of building and securing some of the largest Android deployments and enterprise grade OS development in the world since its founding in 2011. \n\"Android has become unstoppable in the enterprise, and some of our most innovative global customers are in the Bay Area,\" said Arnaud Dupuis, co-founder and co-CEO at Genymobile. \"Since releasing our flagship product Genymotion as an open-source project, the adoption went viral and we knew we needed to move closer to the more than 200 customers we have in the US, and so far the response has been tremendous. Our recent growth in enterprise licenses is a clear indicator that it was the right time to expand here.\" \nThe newly established Genyhouse is located in the Presidio neighborhood of San Francisco and provides both a unique collaboration space as well as lodging for traveling employees; more a community of enthusiasts and experts than a typical office space. The decision to establish this non-traditional presence was also driven by the desire to build a space in which developers from around the Android community can meet for scheduled learning and networking sessions. Collaboration is a core element of Genymobile and the company offers many perks and unique access to leadership, including: Genydaily: Daily video conference meetings for everyone to connect on projects, business priorities and keeping the global team connected Genyadvocate program: Gives employees the chance to represent the company at industry events and conferences all over the world Genyboardingpass: Offers employees the opportunity to work abroad in one of its offices Genytalk: Where employees can talk and present on various subjects they're passionate about \n\"The decision to go with a mixed work and life space is aligned with our core cultural philosophy,\" said Angélique Zettor, co-founder and co-CEO at Genymobile. \"We are people, first and foremost, and the collaborative management approach we embrace keeps people at the center of the decisions we make. Our new location will be both nerve center and heart of the company in the US, and we look forward to organizing our first event for members of our user community.\" \nGenymobile boasts over 4.5 million users worldwide and 10,000 customers including Facebook, eBay, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Samsung. The company's flagship product, Genymotion, is a fully featured Android emulator, which allows developers to perform real-world testing on Android applications to ensure better performance, stability and user experience.
