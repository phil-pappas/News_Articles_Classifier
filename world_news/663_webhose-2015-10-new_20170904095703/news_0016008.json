It can either give you hints for ideal planning or build routes for you automatically. Our dynamic scheduling system also calculates ETAs and can automatically send email or SMS notifications to your clients.\nThe latest iteration has an improved procedure for SMS resending to a client in case of failure. Maxoptra will now automatically make three attempts to resend the SMS every minute to ensure it is received. The platform automatically revises the ETA calculation if a driver violates the planned order sequence by the time of the first stop.\nAnother added benefit is that you can now select several orders on the map at once. Just press the CMD button (for Apple Macintosh) or the CTRL button (for Windows) and select all the orders you want to assign. This will save time and reduce the risk of human error.\nAll in all, this latest release has been designed to make Maxoptra easier to use and understand.\nAbout Maxoptra\nMaxoptra is a dynamic scheduling and route optimization software platform designed to enable fast and efficient decision-making, in real-time, within ever-changing operational environments, particularly service management, supply chain, distribution and home delivery.\nEasy to use, affordable and highly customizable, Maxoptra helps companies to do more business with the same resources at a lower operational cost and having an open API is an ideal complement to any telematics, WMS and CRM solution.
