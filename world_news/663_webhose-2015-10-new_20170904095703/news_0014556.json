That was in line with an average analyst estimate of $14.8 billion.\nThe Santa Clara chipmaker is benefiting as companies that provide cloud-computing services over the Internet snap up servers with the latest Intel chips. A new range of processors from Intel and the rollout of Windows 10 software from Microsoft Corp. are also encouraging some PC makers to replenish depleted stockpiles of components in anticipation of improved demand at year’s end and into 2016.\n“It’s more favorable than what we had in the first half of the year,” said Craig Ellis , an analyst at B. Riley & Co. in San Francisco. He recommends buying Intel stock. “It does suggest that we’re back to subsistence level, installed-base replacement level.”\nIntel shares, down 12 percent this year, rose as much as 3.2 percent in extended trading after the announcement. They had declined less than 1 percent to $32.04 at the close in New York.\nThird-quarter net income fell to $3.11 billion, or 64 cents a share, from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents, in the same period last year. Revenue was little changed at $14.5 billion. On average, analysts had projected earnings of 59 cents on sales of $14.2 billion.\nGross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting cost of production, was 63 percent in the third quarter. That measure, the only indicator of profit that Intel predicts, will be about 62 percent this quarter.\nIntel’s processors power more than 80 percent of PCs sold, making its results a harbinger of demand across the computer industry. The chipmaker’s report leads off several weeks of earnings announcements by the largest technology companies.\nWhile Intel still gets the majority of its revenue from selling PC chips, its data-center group provides the biggest portion of its profits. That change has been driven by Intel’s 99 percent market share in server chips and the surging demand for the machines from operators of data centers, such as Amazon.com Inc. and Google, which are building up their capacity to provide computing power, storage and services via the Internet.\nGlobal PC shipments fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter, hurt by slower desktop sales and higher dollar-based prices, Gartner Inc. said last week. PC manufacturers shipped 73.7 million units, compared with 79.8 million a year earlier, the market researcher said.\nIan King is a Bloomberg writer.
