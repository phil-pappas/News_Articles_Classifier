The Pedal Lock , currently looking for funding on Kickstarter, is a simple lock that's built right into — you guessed it — a pedal.\nRelated: GPS-Equipped Bike Light Tracks Rides — and Thieves\nIt's no more robust than a $10 cable lock, but you can't forget this one at home, nor does it clutter up your pocket, backpack or frame. When you want to park your bike, just pull the cable out of the pedal, loop it around the pole or lockup pipe, and plug it back in. Unlocking is done with a 3-digit dial — don't worry, the pedal naturally rotates when unlocked so the dial is on the bottom, so you won't stomp grime into it.\nWhen locked, the pedal will emit a loud alarm if it's jostled too much, only turning off when you input your combination. This might be irritating to bystanders, but it might also prevent thieves from walking off with your bike and others nearby.\nadvertisement Related: Carbon Fiber, Sonar, Wireless - Is This The Smartest Bike Ever Made?\nAt $50 it's at the high end for casual bicyclists, but if you value convenience above all else (or tend to forget your lock at home) it could be a good investment.", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pedallock/pedal-lock-built-in-bicycle-security", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_40/1246046/f16540dffb23fd98e9814f8b370974d7_original_51c0dff1f22fd023886e047f9afbd645.nbcnews-fp-360-360.png", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_40/1246046/f16540dffb23fd98e9814f8b370974d7_original_51c0dff1f22fd023886e047f9afbd645.nbcnews-ux-600-480.png", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_40/1246046/f16540dffb23fd98e9814f8b370974d7_original_51c0dff1f22fd023886e047f9afbd645.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.png"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:45:05.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
