The gift represents nearly one-third of the stock Dorsey owns in the San Francisco company.\n\"I'd rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small,\" Dorsey tweeted about surrendering some of his stock. \"I'm confident we can make Twitter big!\"\nTwitter said Dorsey's shares will be earmarked for stock issued to employees next year under the company's incentive plan.\nDorsey will still own 15 million Twitter shares worth about $460 million, based on Twitter's current market value.\nTwitter's stock gained $1.13, or nearly 4 percent, to close Friday at $30.28.\nThe shares have declined by 40 percent in the past six months amid concerns about Twitter's slowing user growth and inability to make money.\nTwitter Inc. brought back Dorsey, one of its co-founders, as its CEO in hopes that he can figure out a way to make the messaging service more appealing beyond its core audience of about 300 million users. By comparison, Facebook's social networking service has 1.5 billion users, even though it is only two years older than Twitter.\nDorsey was Twitter's original CEO, but was ousted because the company's board didn't think he was the right leader at that time.\nWhile he tries to re-tool Twitter, Dorsey is also serving as CEO of Square, a payment processor that is preparing to price an initial public offering of its stock.\nDorsey has given back nearly 15.1 million shares of Square stock during the past two years, too, according to Square's IPO documents. He remains by far Square's largest shareholder with a 24 percent stake in that San Francisco company, which is located a block away from Twitter's headquarters.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:59:50.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
