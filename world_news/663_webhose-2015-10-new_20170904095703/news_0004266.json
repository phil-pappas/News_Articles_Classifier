Markets had been little changed heading into the ECB's news conference.\nThe gains followed comments from European Central Bank head Mario Draghi that indicated the central bank would take another look at further stimulus measures at its December meeting. The comments sent the US dollar soaring against the euro, with the single currency down 1.8 per cent to $US1.1135.\nMany economists have predicted an expansion of the ECB's bond-purchasing program before the end of the year to combat sagging inflation. Monetary stimulus programs and low interest rates have helped fuel the years-long rally in stocks around the world.\n\"It's always good to have them saying good things about the market,\" Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird, said. But \"there is only so much they can do...policy mistakes are a huge worry of the market.\"\nThe S&P 500 index gained 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.7 per cent.\nMr Draghi said that \"the degree of monetary policy accommodation [from the ECB] will need to be re-examined\" at the bank's December meeting. Mr Draghi said officials discussed lowering the rate the ECB pays on deposits at the central bank, which is already in negative territory.\n\"Draghi is pulling no punches it seems,\" Crédit Agricole currency strategist Valentin Marinov said. The euro has fallen even though many investors had already priced in expectations of further easing, according to Mr Marinov.\nIn earnings news, a number of large US bellwethers reported results.\nCaterpillar shares rose 1.8 per cent even after the industrial equipment maker, closely watched as a gauge of global manufacturing, cut its profit guidance for the year.\nMcDonald's reported a rise in global sales after several years of persistent declines, lifting shares by 8.1 per cent.\nShares of Dow Chemical gained 5.1 per cent after the chemical maker reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.\nTech giants Alphabet, Google's parent company, Amazon.com and Microsoft are due to report after the close.\nConsumer prices in the eurozone fell in September from a year before for the first time since the launch of the ECB's €60 billion-a-month public sector bond-buying program in March. The ECB has previously said the program will continue at least until September 2016.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly to 2.038 per cent.\nIn Europe, a strengthening euro in recent months has put pressure on the ECB to act. The central bank says that it doesn't target the exchange rate, but a weaker euro has boosted the competitiveness of Europe's exporters this year, and investors believe it is one of the principal benefits of the program.\nWhile the euro is down nearly 12 per cent against the US dollar from a year ago, it has strengthened 4 per cent over the past six months. Investors say the US Federal Reserve delaying its rate rise has put upward pressure on the euro, by dimming the appeal of the dollar.\n\"QE is working, but it is potentially not working as rapidly as they expected,\" Sanjay Joshi, head of fixed income at London & Capital, said.\nMr Joshi said that the central bank pumping more money into the system will be \"good for risky assets in Europe.\" He has bought European investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds which, he believes, should perform strongly under this scenario, as well as German government bonds.\nThe yield on 10-year German government bonds dropped by around 0.05 percentage points after Mr Draghi began speaking to 0.522 per cent. Yields fall as prices rise.\nAsian markets were mixed. Chinese stocks rose after the People's Bank of China said late Wednesday it had pumped liquidity into the market. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.5 per cent Thursday after losing 3.1 per cent in the previous session.\nJapan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.6 per cent, having risen nearly 2 per cent Wednesday on expectations of further central-bank stimulus.
