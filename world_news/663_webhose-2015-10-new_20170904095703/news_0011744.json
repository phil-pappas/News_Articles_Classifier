However, advancement in the technology led to development of automated microscopies to monitor molecular, and cellular events. Automated microscopy is an advance monitoring technique that enhances the enlarging capacity of biological specimen which gives more clear view of sample. Automated microscopy is majorly used at hospitals, diagnostic clinics, research facility centers, and at medical equipment leasing companies. In pathology laboratory it is used for cellular observation of samples, protein expression, and cell signaling which help for the diagnosis of diseases. Hence, use of automated microscopy is reaching maturity level for its clinical and research use. Advantages associated with the automated microscopy over a conventional microscopy are higher sensitivity, reproducibility, less time consuming and more precise results. Browse the full report at :http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/automated-microscopy-market.htmlGlobal automated microscopy market is segmented by product type, and by application. Product type global market can be segmented into fluorescence microscope, electron microscope, inverted microscope, scanning probe microscope, optical microscope, and other. By considering the application of automated microscope the global automated microscopy market segmented into medical diagnostics, nanotechnology, material science, life science monitoring, semiconductors, and others. Geographically, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and North Africa, and rest of the world. Rest of the World majorly includes Russia, South Africa, and Israel. By product type, optical automated microscopy accounted largest share of the market due to high resolution, and more economical as compared to other advanced microscope. By considering applications, nanotechnology is a faster growing segment during the forecast period as increasing recent trends in Nano technological area. In 2014, North America accounted largest share of the market followed by Europe due to high adoption to newer technology, government and private funding for research, coupled with more economical capability. However, Asia Pacific is expected to grow at higher rate due to huge investment opportunities for research and developement in this region. Japan, China, India, and Australia are the key countries in the Asia Pacific automated microscopy market. The global automated microscopy market is fuel by development of less complex, and user friendly microscopes. Additionally, rising focus on nano technological research, and favorable government and industry funding and coordination such as National Technology Initiative (NTI), a U.S. federal research and development program that coordinates 20 departmental and agency units to advance nanotechnology knowledge could help to drive the market growth. However, cost required for digital set up is a key restraint of the global automated microscopy market.Hence, lower cost of the conventional microscopy is acting as a competitor for automated high cost microscopy. The cost for average automated microscopes ranges from $5,000 - $15,000. The high cost of automated microscope is majorly due to implementation of excise tax by U.S. government, and heavy custom duty on medical devices. However, continuous technological advancements will affect the price of automated microscopy set in near future. Some of the key company profiles included in the global automated microscopy market are Olympus Corporation, Hitachi High Technologies Ltd., Nikon Corporation, Fei Company, Agilent Technologies Inc., Carl Zeiss India Private Limited, Bruker Corporation, and Asylum Research.
