Teradata's latest release empowers marketers to truly individualize their marketing and connect one-to-one with customers by unifying customer-interaction data across paid, earned and owned channels, at scale. Now, from campaign inception through every customer interaction and response, Teradata provides marketers the most agile and comprehensive integrated data-driven marketing platform available on the market. Marketers today have access to more customer data and more digital and offline channels for brand engagement than ever before. As a result, both the process and technology of modern marketing have advanced ¾ from an advertising-driven mix of TV, print, radio, direct mail, and programmatic marketing ¾ to today's data-driven environment with the Internet of Things (IoT), new devices, and new channels including search, social media, email, mobile, web and more. This added complexity puts marketers in critical need of a Data Management Platform (DMP) to collect and integrate all of this data for use across all channel opportunities. To help marketers meet this need, Teradata has acquired FLXone, a next-generation DMP provider based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The transaction closed September 30 . FLXone's DMP forms the data foundation for the Teradata Integrated Marketing Cloud, making Teradata the first company to bring online advertising and customer marketing data together to drive real-time interactions across all channels and provide integrated, individualized insights directly to marketing. FLXone also brings an extensive partner ecosystem with more than 40 leading advertisers, publishers, agencies, and media trading desks, including AppNexus, Google DoubleClick, MediaMath and many others. These partnerships will enable customers to quickly integrate their data and applications with the Teradata Integrated Marketing Cloud, so they can leverage data in real-time, across all channels, to provide a consistent customer-engagement experience. In commenting on Teradata's latest release, Brian O'Kelley , CEO, AppNexus said, \"We're excited about the potential this unique offering brings. By bridging advertising and marketing technology, we see an ever expanding market that further drives a vibrant partner ecosystem.\" New Release Highlights: Unifying Interactions and Data Teradata Integrated Marketing Cloud is a fully integrated platform comprising solutions for Marketing Resource Management, Omni-Channel Marketing, Marketing Analytics and Digital Marketing. Unlike any other offering, Teradata's platform unifies interactions across outbound, real-time, and audience marketing, and unifies data across anonymous and known customers – all on a single modular platform. Teradata's solution will also connect to proprietary data stored in an Integrated Data Warehouse (IDW), directly integrate to email and mobile response data through Teradata Digital Marketing Center (DMC), and offer native integration with other Teradata solutions. For marketers, all of this new capability means they now have proven solutions for: Aligning advertising with customer marketing. Driving agility in the marketing process. Making upgrades a thing of the past. Visualizing real-time interactions. Hyper-personalizing mobile and social interactions. Extending a marketer's social reach.

By drilling into campaign results, marketers can quickly understand, plan and adjust campaigns to optimize spend and maximize return on marketing investment, all while building stronger customer relationships. New Marketing Analytics features in Teradata Integrated Marketing Cloud include: Data Management Platform (DMP) that permits marketers to collect online and offline data across all channels – paid, earned and owned – into a single solution that tracks the entire customer journey. With this, marketers and their agencies can now merge the worlds of known and anonymous customers and prospects, and drive both advertising and customer marketing using a single cloud-based SaaS solution. Unified Interaction Management , meaning Teradata Integrated Marketing Cloud now includes ad impression data from search and display advertising; web behavioral data (such as content viewed and conversion tracking), and digital marketing data from email, social, and mobile channels. All of this data can be used to individualize the customer experience across every channel – paid, earned, and owned – via outbound, real-time and audience marketing programs. Digital Marketing Teradata's Digital Marketing solution incorporates email, mobile, social, web, app and micro-location marketing, advertising, segmentation and analytics. It helps marketers engage with individuals across paid, earned and owned channels through an open, integrated platform to identify each individual and deliver the right message at the best time through the preferred channel.

Micro-Location Marketing bridges online and offline worlds via iBeacon support technology and drives cross-channel experiences in real-time with responsive relevance for each individual customer. Instagram Integration extends marketing management capabilities within DMC by monitoring, engaging, and measuring social interactions across Instagram, along with existing DMC-supported social properties such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Expanded Mobile Push capabilities like extended send-out customization and A/B Split Testing.
