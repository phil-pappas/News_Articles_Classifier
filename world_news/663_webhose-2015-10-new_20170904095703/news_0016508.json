Tweet This: tekVizion achieves Microsoft Gold Communications competency status once again! http://bit.ly/1Pu7A12 #tekvizionverified\nTo earn a Microsoft gold competency, partners must successfully complete exams (resulting in Microsoft Certified Professionals) to prove their level of technology expertise, and then designate these certified professionals uniquely to one Microsoft competency, ensuring a certain level of staffing capacity. They also must submit customer references that demonstrate successful projects (along with implementing a yearly customer satisfaction study), meet a revenue commitment (for most gold competencies), and pass technology and/or sales assessments.\nFor over a decade, Equipment Manufacturers, ISVs and Service Providers have relied upon tekVizion to accelerate VoIP, SIP Trunking and Unified Communications implementations. As an independent testing and certification lab, tekVizion tests over 400 products and applications yearly.
