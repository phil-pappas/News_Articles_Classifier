On Thursday the SCA ruled her findings could not be ignored and Motsoeneng should be suspended for 60 days while a disciplinary hearing into his alleged malfeasance was conducted.\nThe SCA said \"this watchdog should not be muzzled\" and \"an individual or body affected by any finding, decision or remedial action taken by the public protector is not entitled to embark on a parallel investigation process to that of the public protector and adopt the position that the outcome of that parallel process trumps the findings, decision or remedial action taken by the public protector\".", "external_links": ["http://whoswho.co.za/thulisile-madonsela-9068", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=9068", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=627451", "http://whoswho.co.za/hlaudi-motsoeneng-627451"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:04:19.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
