Teva provided two Paragraph IV notices for ANDA submissions Nos. 205299 and 205806 in October 2014. Indivior commenced litigation asserting three Orange Book-listed patents and two process patents against Teva in December 2014. Without addressing the 30-month stay of FDA approval for Teva's ANDA No. 205299, the District Court's ruling permits Indivior to amend its complaint to add specific references to that ANDA. \n\"We remain steadfast in our belief in the strength and enforceability of our intellectual property for SUBOXONE Film,\" said Javier Rodriguez , Chief Legal Officer of Indivior, PLC. \"And, we are pleased that the court granted the Company's motion to amend the complaint against Teva Pharmaceuticals to specifically refer to Abbreviated New Drug Application No. 205299.\" \nIndication SUBOXONE ® (buprenorphine and naloxone) Sublingual Film (CIII) is a prescription medicine indicated for treatment of opioid dependence and should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support. \nTreatment should be initiated under the direction of physicians qualified under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act. \nImportant Safety Information Do not take SUBOXONE Film if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious negative effects, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported. \nSUBOXONE Film can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. \nSUBOXONE Film contains buprenorphine, an opioid that can cause physical dependence with chronic use. Physical dependence is not the same as addiction. Your doctor can tell you more about the difference between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not stop taking SUBOXONE Film suddenly without talking to your doctor. You could become sick with uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms because your body has become used to this medicine. \nSUBOXONE Film can cause serious life-threatening breathing problems, overdose and death, particularly when taken by the intravenous (IV) route in combination with benzodiazepines or other medications that act on the nervous system (ie, sedatives, tranquilizers, or alcohol). It is extremely dangerous to take nonprescribed benzodiazepines or other medications that act on the nervous system while taking SUBOXONE Film. \nYou should not drink alcohol while taking SUBOXONE Film, as this can lead to loss of consciousness or even death. \nDeath has been reported in those who are not opioid dependent. Your doctor may monitor liver function before and during treatment. \nSUBOXONE Film is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. However, SUBOXONE Film may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. \nKeep SUBOXONE Film out of the sight and reach of children. Accidental or deliberate ingestion of SUBOXONE Film by a child can cause severe breathing problems and death. \nDo not take SUBOXONE Film before the effects of other opioids (eg, heroin, hydrocodone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone) have subsided as you may experience withdrawal symptoms. \nInjecting SUBOXONE may cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as pain, cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, sleep problems, and cravings. \nBefore taking SUBOXONE Film, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking SUBOXONE Film, alert your doctor immediately and you should report it using the contact information provided below.* \nNeonatal withdrawal has been reported following the use of buprenorphine by the mother during pregnancy. \nBefore taking SUBOXONE Film, talk to your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed your baby. SUBOXONE can pass into your breast milk. You and your doctor should consider the development and health benefits of breastfeeding along with your clinical need for SUBOXONE Film and should also consider any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. \nDo not drive, operate heavy machinery, or perform any other dangerous activities until you know how SUBOXONE Film affects you. Buprenorphine in SUBOXONE Film can cause drowsiness and slow reaction times during dose-adjustment periods. \nCommon side effects of SUBOXONE Film include nausea, vomiting, drug withdrawal syndrome, headache, sweating, numb mouth, constipation, painful tongue, redness of the mouth, intoxication (feeling lightheaded or drunk), disturbance in attention, irregular heartbeat, decrease in sleep, blurred vision, back pain, fainting, dizziness, and sleepiness. \nThis is not a complete list of potential adverse events associated with SUBOXONE Film. Please see full Prescribing Information for a complete list. \n*To report negative side effects associated with taking SUBOXONE Film, please call 1-877-782-6966. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. \nFor more information about SUBOXONE Film, SUBOXONE ® (buprenorphine and naloxone) Sublingual Tablets (CIII), or SUBUTEX ® (buprenorphine) Sublingual Tablets (CIII), please see the respective full Prescribing Information and Medication Guide at www.RBPREMS.com . \nAbout Indivior Indivior is a global specialty pharmaceutical company with a 20-year legacy of leadership in patient advocacy, health policy and evidence-based best practice models that have revolutionized modern addiction treatment.
