Taylor Pittman Voices Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/26/2015 11:07 AM EDT \nA new initiative from Instagram will highlight women who are using the platform to tell their inspiring stories -- and challenging gender roles along the way. \nInstagram's #MyStory initiative will launch with a photo exhibit featuring 28 women shattering stereotypes and using their voices on the platform in a positive way. The women being highlighted include model Tess Holliday, who promotes body positivity on Instagram, female firefighter Alli Meade, and artist Tatyana Fazlalizadeh, the woman behind the anti-street harassment campaign Stop Telling Women To Smile . The exhibit, which was curated by journalist Jessica Bennett , will be presented in Los Angeles on Oct. 26 at an event hosted by actress Rowan Blanchard and Instagram COO Marne Levine . \nBlanchard, who has used Instagram to encourage intersectionality in feminism and raise awareness about campus sexual assault , stressed the importance of women sharing their stories. \n\"My Instagram is my platform to share and spread creativity and individuality,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"I use it to tell my story and also to be inspired by others. I am especially excited that Instagram is highlighting women's voices and letting people know they have stories that need to be heard.\" \nNo woman's story is the same, but they are all worth hearing. Below are the 28 game-changing women featured in the #MyStory exhibit: Petra Collins A photo posted by Petra Collins (@petrafcollins) on Jun 3, 2015 at 3:59pm PDT \"I’m a 22-year-old artist living in NYC. Shooting from the age of 15, my images are fueled with self-discovery and femininity that explore the complex intersection of life as a young woman online and off.\" Mehgan Heaney-Grier A photo posted by Mehgan Heaney-Grier (@freediver_mhg) on Oct 2, 2015 at 2:51pm PDT \"As a life-long adventurer with a big passion for sharks, marine conservation, and all things water, I crave wild things and wild places. I strive to do what I can to ensure that my kids -- that all kids, get the chance to experience these wilds too.\" Sarah Bloom A photo posted by Sarah Bloom (@sarahrbloom) on Sep 16, 2015 at 8:03am PDT \"I’m a 46-year-old freelance photographer and have been taking self-portraits as my primary form of artistic expression since 2006. The exploration of identity as a woman entering middle age has emerged as a persistent theme in my work. I identify with the buildings I photograph in a personal sense as I struggle with getting older and the feeling that I'm running out of time; in a broader sense I extrapolate that to women in society and how we (generally) are treated as we age - as damaged goods and something to be left behind for a newer model. This image is a self-portrait taken in the former J.W. Cooper School in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania.\" Shantell Martin A photo posted by Shantell Martin (@shantell_martin) on Jul 21, 2015 at 9:04am PDT \"Sometimes I have to remind myself to get out of the box, to draw outside the lines to create my own new stories.\" Alli Meade A photo posted by Alli Meade (@oldsoulstudio) on Jan 18, 2013 at 4:33am PST \"I’m a 29-year-old female firefighter with a passion for welding and art.

There are beautiful, exciting, glamorous moments that I savor, but most of it is working alone in the studio, figuring things out. I like to demystify this idea that being a working artist today is a romantic vocation. It's a job that requires a lot of time and effort, like all others. Eureka moments don't happen often; usually it's the day-to-day decisions and actions that are the most important.\" Kim Meinelt A photo posted by kim meinelt photography (@kimmibird) on Sep 22, 2015 at 4:59am PDT \"I have been at Eileen Fisher for 20 years, where I am a Visual Concept Director. An artist and curator of things I love, photography has become my passion of expressing the visual world inside my head. As if listening to old scratchy records, the images bring an era of the past to the present.\" Laura Johannet A photo posted by lauraj (@codergirl_) on Sep 15, 2015 at 3:38pm PDT \"I am a 24-year-old female software engineer. I use photography to capture the humor, challenges and excitement in my industry.
