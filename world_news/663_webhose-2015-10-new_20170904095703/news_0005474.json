(REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni)\nYour smartphone, tablet, laptop and even smartwatch may all have their own SIM card or LTE-connection, but when it comes to calls, trying to manage your phone number and apps on each device can be kind of a mess. However, with AT&T’s NumberSync, these headaches may soon be a thing of the past.\nIt’s not quite ready yet, but AT&T’s new NumberSync service will let all of your wireless devices share a single number. So, if you want to go for a run and leave your phone behind, you can simply strap on your SIM-equipped smartwatch (like the upcoming LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition ), and be confident that you won’t miss any calls.\nMORE: The Best Phone Carriers Ranked\nThis eliminates the need to remember a different number for every device, although you will have to fork over about $5-$10 per device monthly for the convenience. Thankfully, there won’t be additional data charges, as NumberSync draws from your existing data pool. Also, because all the devices are connected, if you check a message on one device, it won't show up as unread on all the others.\nAT&T also said that it plans to expand NumberSync to connected cars in the future, which would make it even easier to avoid texting while driving.\nThe one thing NumberSync can’t do is link multiple phones together. The service is designed to link one phone with a host of secondary connected devices, so you’ll still need a service like Google Voice to get multi-phone call forwarding.\nNumberSync should start rolling out to select devices sometimes later this month, with wider adoption continuing on through the holidays.\nBest Smartphones\nOur Favorite Smartwatches\nLaptop Mag's Top Tablets\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.tomsguide.com/us/watch-urbane-2-hands-on,news-21656.html", "http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-smartphones,review-2223.html", "http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-phone-carriers,review-3066.html", "https://www.facebook.com/FoxNewsSciTech", "http://blogs.att.net/consumerblog/story/a7799556", "http://www.tomsguide.com/", "http://www.laptopmag.com/best-tablets", "http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-smartwatches,review-2156.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:33:28.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
