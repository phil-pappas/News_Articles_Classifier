Nittany was an enormous acquisition as Hi-Tech gained 200,000 square feet total in September 2012. Hi-Tech's desire to acquire iForce is part of Hi-Tech's strategy to capitalize on its increased manufacturing capacity. Recently, Hi-Tech completed its 40,000 state-of- the-art facility in Suwanee, Georgia and added 42,000 square feet to its warehousing capacity to bring the total square footage in Georgia to 190,000 bringing Hi-Tech to a total of 390,000 square feet, which brings Hi-Tech to the very top of the supplement industry! \nHi-Tech's recent acquisition of Nittany Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of OTC and prescription drugs, energy shots, and premium shelf stable beverages made with hot fill and aseptic technology allowed Hi-Tech to enter the liquid manufacturing business immediately. This also allows Hi-Tech to diversify into OTC and Prescription drugs in the future. The RTD business and shot business will enhance Hi-Techs' capabilities in the rapidly growing area of nutritional beverages and energy shots. In recent years, Hi-Tech established itself as a turnkey nutritional supplement development partner with several companies. The acquisition of Nittany Pharmaceuticals expanded Hi-Tech's capabilities in the beverage area, fitting well with Hi-Tech's core strengths in providing value added solutions to its customers and positioning the company to deliver new and innovative products in emerging and high growth markets. \n\"The acquisition of Nittany Pharmaceuticals expanded our ability grow the Hi-Tech and iForce brands with the addition of liquid products, and to serve our private label customers with end to end solutions, from concept to formulation to end product manufacture of beverages,\" said Steve Smith , Senior Vice President of Hi-Tech. \"With this new capability, along with our extensive portfolio of nutritional products, manufacturing expertise and reputation for, we are well positioned to help our customers grow and expand their business.
