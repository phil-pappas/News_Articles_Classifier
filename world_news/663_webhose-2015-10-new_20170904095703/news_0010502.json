We are empowering our doctors to provide the best treatment regime, in context, at the lowest cost. Ultimately benefitting both our providers and the patients they serve.\" \nThe Edifecs Population Payment solution delivers performance transparency and user-friendly dashboards that are easily readable for all stakeholders. These dashboards will provide a combined administrative and clinical view of patient utilization patterns and costs at a glance. With this visibility, providers can manage patient expectation, observe utilization patterns and better understand how patient care treatment recommendations align with KPIs and performance expectations. \nWith the rapidly increasing shift from volume-based healthcare to value-based reimbursement and care delivery models, health plans face challenges at every turn. Edifecs' solution will help Optima Health promote provider buy-in by ensuring stakeholder visibility, measuring performance and analyzing the impacts of shifts in reimbursement models. \n\"We believe the work we are doing with Optima Health and Sentara will change the dynamic of the traditional payer-provider relationship,\" said Sunny Singh, CEO of Edifecs. \"Offering its network of providers this kind of transparency and visibility will drive tremendous value for the patients it serves and position the organization as a pioneer in the industry.\" \nEdifecs Population Payment \nThe Edifecs Population Payment solution delivers an integrated, automated approach to solving the most pervasive challenges health plans encounter with their value-based reimbursement and care delivery initiatives.
