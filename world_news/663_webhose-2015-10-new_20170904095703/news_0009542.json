Until the launch of Dateafied. \nBusinesses have the Better Business Bureau to vet them, and colleges can receive an accreditation for excellence, so Dateafied is like the BBB of dating. Its a way for a guy to say Im a catch, I am who I am, I dont have a criminal past and Im safe to meet up. - Greg Aronoff, founder of Dateafied. \nBesides a tool for how to attract women, Dateafied would also like to eradicate online dating scams and catfishing. \nIn 2011, there was a collective loss of $50.4 million due to catfish scams. We do everything online and online dating will only continue to grow, which means the number of scams will also continue to go up unless we stand up together and do something about it. Aronoff said. \nWhen someone signs up with Dateafied, an accurate background check is then performed, which utilizes a national criminal database containing over 200 million records as well as a national sex offender list. \nAronoff got the idea for Dateafied when he and his wife were looking at a friends online matches. She was disheartened as she just scrolled and scrolled and said how are you supposed to know the good ones from the creepers. \nAronoff added: I met my wife on eHarmony, so I know how great online dating can be. And I know how hard it can be for some guys to get noticed among the avalanche of responses. \nFor more information, check out www.dateafied.com . \nAbout Dateafied: Dateafied is a new online dating resource that allows someone to verify their own identity and accurate background for dating and social media sites. The goal is to help someone date more, simply by being themselves. \n# # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:06:42.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
