The Seattle company recently hired more than 25,000 people for regular, full-time positions. It hired 80,000 workers last year for the holidays.\nAmazon stands out among retailers, with holiday hiring expected to remain largely unchanged, according to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nIt used to be that most people hired for the holidays would be for positions on the sales floor and behind the cash register, said CEO said John Challenger . “These extra workers would also help pick up the slack in the backroom, helping to receive and stock increased deliveries. Now, as more and more shopping is completed online, the holiday hiring is shifting away from stores and into the warehouses.”\nA mixed hiring picture from retailers is emerging during a dicey period for the United States.\nThe Labor Department reported this month that a sharp slowdown in hiring occurred in September. Average hourly wages slipped by a penny and have risen a tepid 2.2 percent in the past year.\nMeek wages and weak hiring may take a toll on consumer spending.\nThe National Retail Federation predicted this month that holiday spending, including online sales, will rise 3.7 percent to $630.5 billion, which is slower than the 4.1 percent increase last year in November and December. The trade group does expect online spending to increase 6 to 8 percent to $105 billion. Online sales grew 5.8 percent during last year’s holiday season.\nIn that environment, Walmart is hiring 60,000 holiday employees, Target about 70,000 and Macy’s 85,000, which are all about the same as their holiday hiring last year. Kohl’s is hiring about 2,000 people, a 2 percent increase, and GameStop plans to bump up hiring by about 12 percent. J.C. Penney and Toys R Us are hiring fewer people.\nBut the shift to online shopping is also being seen at traditional retailers, and they are hiring workers at warehouses devoted to online orders. Many major retailers, including Walmart, Macy’s and Target, have been adding large e-commerce centers to speed up orders as they play catch-up with Amazon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:08:28.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
