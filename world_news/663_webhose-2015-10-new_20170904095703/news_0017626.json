With significant R&D work underway by stakeholders across various segments, commercialization of new materials and coatings is expected across industries, especially in healthcare, electronics and energy. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275497 \nRecent analysis from Frost & Sullivan, 2015 Top Technologies in Materials & Coatings ( http://www.frost.com/d68a ), identifies the following as key technologies that are likely to have a high impact in 2015: -- carbon fibers -- polymer chameleons -- lightweight composites -- anti-corrosion coatings -- polymeric catalysts -- bio-based materials -- nanomaterials -- membrane separation technologies -- algal bioprocessing -- biochemicals \nFurther, innovations in the materials and coatings sector will focus on multi-functionality and high performance attributes. Although cost-effective technologies that offer value for money are still prominent, technologies that reduce raw material use and promote energy-efficiency are gaining prominence. \nFor complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://bit.ly/1N2gEqF \n\"Regulations, which vary by country and stringent laws especially in Europe and North America act as major drivers for material and coating innovations, especially in the industrial and transportation sectors,\" noted Frost & Sullivan TechVision Senior Industry Analyst, Aarthi Janakiraman . \"Innovations in lightweight materials, anti-corrosion coatings and carbon fibers, in particular, have received a huge boost due to regulatory pressures.\" \nLightweight composites are established in the aerospace and automotive industries, and have been used primarily for increasing fuel efficiency. However, in recent times, they are also finding applications in sectors such as offshore, marine, oil and gas, and construction. Due to their use as reinforcement materials and the expansion of production facilities, lightweight, high-strength composites, especially carbon fibers, will witness increased adoption in the next three years. \n\"Anti-corrosion coatings too will continue to see substantial growth in the next five years as companies comply with strict regulations requiring the use of materials and products that ensure long-lasting protection from environmental damage,\" highlighted Janakiraman . \"Along with these trends, the growing demand for novel materials such as stimuli-responsive polymers will help drive the materials industry.\" \nOn the downside, difficulties in scaling up new materials to the commercial level, cost of implementation, and long-term durability issues could hinder the adoption of innovative coatings and materials for varied industrial and consumer applications. \nMarket participants must invest in more research initiatives to address these challenges. Developing self-healing structures and capitalizing on the need for materials with tunable properties and strong functionalities in sectors such as healthcare and electronics will help in further growth and adoption of materials and coatings technologies. \n2015 Top Technologies in Materials & Coatings , a part of the TechVision ( http://ww2.frost.com/research/technology/materials-coatings ) subscription, analyzes key past, current and emerging trends, drivers and challenges faced by stakeholders in the materials and coatings industry. The study also provides a comprehensive overview of the top 10 material and coating technologies selected by Technical Insights . The profiled technologies were selected after much in-depth primary and secondary research obtained from diverse participants in the technology ecosystem, including technology developers, funders, innovators, universities, research and development institutions and governmental R&D bodies. Our global analysts evaluated over 100 technologies in the materials and coatings sphere across significant metrics such as global R&D footprint, year of impact, global IP patenting activity, private and public funding, current and emerging applications, potential adoption rate, and market potential. The 10 top rated technologies, which we believe have the most potential to spawn innovative products, services and business models, have subsequently been profiled in this research service. \nFrost & Sullivan's global TechVision practice is focused on innovation, disruption and convergence that provides a variety of technology based alerts, newsletters and research services as well as growth consulting services. Its premier offering, the TechVision program, identifies and evaluates the most valuable emerging and disruptive technologies enabling products with near-term potential. A unique feature of the TechVision program is an annual selection of 50 technologies that can generate convergence scenarios, possibly disrupt the innovation landscape, and drive transformational growth.
