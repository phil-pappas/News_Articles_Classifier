Sudhakshina | October 18, 2015, 23.45 pm Representational image Recent smartphone launches in India have seen makers trying to woo selfie lovers with some special photo-enhancing features. Micromax has launched a Canvas Selfie Lens smartphone with a clip-on 0.4X wide angle lens to capture the widest image, with a ‘face beauty’ feature added, that allows you to smoothen the skin, enlarge eyes, even remove blemishes — all with pre-sets. (Rs 8, 299)\nNow, the Gionee Elife E7 mini takes its camera features to a next level by sporting a 13-megapixel rotating camera that lets you take pictures by just twisting the camera swivel, front and back. So, instead of turning the entire phone, you just need to turn the phone’s camera. The Elife E7 mini also offers various editing options such as smile detection, gesture shot, etc. (Rs 25,999). Although, the front camera of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is just 5 megapixels, it comes with some impressive selfie features. The camera boasts a 120-degree wide angle and also features Samsung’s ‘Advanced Selfie Technology’ with image stabilization, HD recording and an f 1.9 aperture that produces sharp photos. (Rs 53,900)\nMeanwhile, the Asus ZenFone ‘Selfie’ (Rs 15,999) has done the inevitable — providing two cameras — in the front and rear with the same resolution. Both cameras come equipped with dual-colour, dual-LED flash and laser auto-focus. Asus has also included “skin treatment” to make you look better.\n— IndiaTechOnline.com\n mobiles selfie Micromax Also Read This cut and paste tattoo monitors health 24x7 9 paid Windows Phone apps that are available for free Watch the launch event of the Amazon Fire Beyond 'Like': 6 ways you might soon emote on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/phone-cosmetics", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Selfie_2_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Selfie_2_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:53:14.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
