The Japanese tech giant received negative feedback for the available storage on its 8GB model, and decided to give users more space to store media and other content. The update is for the dual-SIM version as well. \nThe company on its support page states that the latest software update v26.1.A.2.167 would be removing a list of apps - Books, CloudPrint, FaceLock, GoogleTTS, Keep, Newsstand, NewsWeather, PlayGames, PlusOne and Talkback. However, Sony also said that if any of these apps have been updated even once, they would remain in the device. All apps except Facelock can be downloaded from Google Play if users ever need them. Users can check for the software version by navigating inside the smartphone's Settings > About Phone > Build number/version. \nAs per a breakdown done by Xperiablog website, the 8GB base model of Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and Xperia M4 Aqua Dual only leaves 1.25GB free for users. While Android 5.0 Lollipop consumes 4GB of space, 2GB is taken by the pre-installed apps on the handset. \nMeanwhile in India, Sony launched the Xperia Z5 Dual and Xperia Z5 Premium Dual smartphones priced at Rs. 52,990 and Rs. 62,990 respectively. Both smartphones come with 16GB of built-in storage, with support for expandability via microSD card (up to 2TB). The highlight of the new flagship smartphones from Sony is the improved camera. Both feature a new 1/2.3-inch Exmor RS for mobile 23-megapixel sensor and F/2.0 G lens. Sony's Xperia Z5 Premium, on the other hand, is the 'world's first smartphone featuring a 4K display' as touted by the company. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:34:39.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
