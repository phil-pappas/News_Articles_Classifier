The plant will have a processing capacity of 49 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year. \nDesigned to extract important components from natural gas, the gas processing plant is a valuable link in the process of supplying natural gas to China through the eastern route. \nGazprom Pererabotka Blagoveshchensk, a part of Gazprom Group, and NIPIGAZ formed a partnership in July 2015 for designing, coordinating equipment and material supplies and construction management of the Amur Gas Processing Plant. \nConstruction on the RUB791bn ($12.7bn) project commenced in October 2015. The plant is expected to employ 15,000 people during construction phase and another 3,000 upon completion. \nThe Kollsnes gas processing plant, which became operational in October 1996, processes natural gas from the Troll, Kvitebj√∏rn and Visund fields owned by StatoilHydro in the North Sea. Details of Amur gas processing plant \nThe Amur gas processing plant is touted to be Russia's biggest gas processing facility and also one of the world's major gas processing facilities, upon completion. A helium production block with an annual capacity of 60 million cubic metres (mcm) will also be a part of the gas processing plant. \nThe plant will extract ethane, propane, butane, pentane-hexane fraction and helium from natural gas and process it for shipment to China. It will produce 49bcm of processed gas, 3.4 million tonne (mt) of ethane, 2mt of liquefied petroleum gas and 60mcm of helium. Ethane produced at the plant will be transferred to SIBUR gas chemical facility to be used for producing polyethene. \nA state-of-the-art training centre will also be opened as part of the project to prepare staff for the management of the processing facility and helium complex. Scheduled to begin operation in 2015, the training centre will be equipped with technology from Schneider Electric and Invensys. \"Feed gas to the plant will be supplied from the Yakutia and Irkutsk gas production centres through the Power of Siberia gas pipeline.\" Related Suppliers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:57:48.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
