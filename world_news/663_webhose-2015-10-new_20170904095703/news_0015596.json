Source: Supplied\nNetflix and other online streaming video services haven’t quite solved Australia’s internet movie piracy problem, according to the entertainment industry’s peak copyright advocacy body.\nThe Intellectual Property Awareness Foundation said although there were encouraging signs online piracy was declining in Australia, seasoned illegal downloaders were yet to be seduced by legal streaming services.\nThat’s one of the key findings of IPAF’s seventh and most recent tranche of research released today at the Australian International Movie Convention on the Gold Coast.\nAccording to the research, while new streaming services and legal efforts to combat piracy appear to have reduced the frequency and incidence of piracy, 40 per cent of persistent pirates are downloading more illegal content than they were 12 months ago.\nIPAF executive director Lori Flekser urged the government to remain vigilant in its efforts to stamp out piracy.\n“I have always been very cautious about this idea that streaming services like Netflix are the panacea to piracy because we know from our research … that the principal reason that people pirate is that it’s free. There’s no price that’s too expensive,” Ms Flekser told The Australian.\nShe also said that research into piracy habits conducted outside periods when download activity tended to ramp up, such as when new seasons of popular television series became available, should be treated with caution.\nHowever, IPAF conceded that rapid growth in streaming ser­vices in Australia was making ­piracy “less the norm”.\nNetflix’s paid subscriber base in August was close to one million customers, according to research released by Citi Equities.\nThe same research found that Fairfax and Nine Entertainment Co’s online streaming joint venture Stan had about 153,000 paying subscribers, while Foxtel’s Presto service had about 80,000 subscribers.\nIPAF’s survey also reveals that the proportion of consumers using streaming services grew from 26 per cent last year to 32 per cent this year.\nOf those, 33 per cent were taking advantage of some form of free trial and 66 per cent planned to pay for the service after their trial expired.\nThat has helped drive down the proportion of consumers aged 18 to 24 engaged in piracy, from 54 per cent last year to 46 per cent this year.\nFor consumers aged 25 to 34 the rate has fallen from 48 per cent to 40 per cent. Piracy rates for consumers aged 35 to 49 remain steady.\nOverall, piracy rates across all age groups have fallen from 29 per cent to 25 per cent.\nAbout a third of those pirating less frequently said it was due to the emergence of legal alternatives. About 16 per cent said it was because they feared getting caught or downloading a computer virus.\nMs Flekser warned that the biggest challenge continued to be a lack of education and unwillingness by some consumers to perceive online piracy as theft.\nHowever, she said recent changes to the legal and regulatory environment around online piracy were starting to have an impact on consumer perceptions.\nMs Flekser was referring to the court bid by the film studio behind Dallas Buyers Club to force iiNet to reveal the identities of alleged infringers and new federal laws allowing copyright holders to apply for court orders to block websites promoting copyright infringement.\n“What we would hope is that the government continues to keep an eye on legislation to make sure it keeps pace with technology but also that there is a greater emphasis on education, especially in our schools,” she said.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/12/1227566/546140-b22108e2-705d-11e5-9eda-7a08ca7db548.jpg", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/netflix-no-panacea-to-piracy-ipaf/story-e6frgakx-1227566545891"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:13:16.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
