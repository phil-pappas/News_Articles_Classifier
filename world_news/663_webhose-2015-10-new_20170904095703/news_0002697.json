In the second match of the World Cup, Australia made 270/6 in 50 overs on the basis of an opening stand of 110 between Geoff Marsh (110) and David Boon (48).\nIndia, with eight wickets in hand, needed roughly 70 off the last 15 overs. Craig McDermott, who had bled 31 from his first four overs, came back to take out the middle order. Still, India needed only 15 from four overs with four wickets remaining. Somehow they contrived to leave themselves eight to get from the final over, with the last man, Maninder Singh, to face Steve Waugh.\nKiran More ran himself out, Maninder pinched two doubles, but he was bowled on the final ball with India two runs short. In the end, a call taken earlier in the day proved heart-breaking: one of Dean Jones' two sixes had been signalled as four by the match referee Intikhab Alam; but during the innings break Kapil Dev sportingly concurred with Australia's insistence that the ball had crossed the ropes. Thus India's target was increased by two runs.\nAustralia were no stranger to close matches, and this game demonstrated that they were able to hold their nerve in tight situations. That victory was a sign of things to come; Australia eventually won the tournament by beating England by a mere seven runs in the final.
