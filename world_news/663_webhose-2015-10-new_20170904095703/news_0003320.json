The company will exhibit in the NFV pavilion at booth NFV 3068. The case study is available at the Cloudify website .\nThe integration between Cloudify and VMware provides an open NFV orchestration service through its Open Service Blueprinting, using TOSCA, as well as open infrastructure supporting both OpenStack and vCloud, enabling real world hybrid environments.\nCase Study Overview\nAt both telcos featured in the case study, the process of onboarding their VNF applications was largely manual, taking months or even years to implement and introducing the risk of human error. One telco was seeking a single orchestration platform to manage all their core network services such as LDAP and IMS on top of OpenStack infrastructure and IPv6. The other was looking for an open orchestration platform that would work across existing VMware infrastructure as well as their new OpenStack infrastructure.\nBoth companies looked to other powerful orchestrators common to the telco data center, from OSS/BSS orchestration and network orchestration to OpenStack HEAT and others. Ultimately, both chose Cloudify because it is the only orchestration service that supports IPv6, and it comes with native support for OpenStack and VMware, coupled with additional support for TOSCA and YANG. This makes Cloudify a true open and mature NFV Orchestration, which was another key selection criteria.\nAbout GigaSpaces\nGigaSpaces Technologies provides software for cloud application orchestration and scaling of mission-critical applications on cloud environments.
