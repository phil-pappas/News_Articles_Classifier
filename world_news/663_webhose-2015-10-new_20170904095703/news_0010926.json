The sterilization aspect of the process halts the breeding cycle and leads to further long-term reductions in the number of cats living outdoors. Alley Cat Rescue says all of its programs follow the no-kill philosophy, where euthanasia is only an option for cats who are sick, injured or suffering, and who cannot be treated.\nSwarm, a location-based social mobile app, also brought in internet sensation Grumpy Cat to assist with the campaign. Swarm users can now earn a special Grumpy Cat sticker when they check in, but only until the 15th. “Our partnership with Swarm and Grumpy Cat has helped us to spread our message of humane care for all cats in an amazing way. Users are checking in and sharing our message, and it’s all on behalf of cats,” says Maggie Funkhouser, Director of Communications and Development for ACR. “We’re hearing from people around the world on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram who we may not have been able to reach in another way. We’re excited to see so much support for our efforts to reduce the killing of healthy and adoptable cats through robust rescue, adoption, and Trap-Neuter-Return programs for outdoor cats,” Funkhouser added.\nAlley Cat Rescue was founded in 1997 and has been awarded the Independent Charities of America’s “Best in America” Seal of Approval. Their newsletter has won several awards from the Cat Writers’ Association, and their annual event, Feral Cat Spay Day, has helped spay or neuter more than 9,500 cats, preventing an estimated 20,000 unwanted births.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3NhdmVhY2F0Lm9yZy8="], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:35:18.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
