The latest contract is an expansion of that pilot program, the person familiar with the matter said.\nDivisions across the SEC are working on the effort to search huge volumes of data for potential violations, such as insider trading, pyramid schemes and \"pump and dump\" attempts in penny stocks, the person said.\nClosely held Palantir, based in Palo Alto, California, was co-founded by Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech mogul who also co-founded PayPal Holdings Inc.\nThe source did not specify what information would be harnessed by the platform under the current deal. In the past, Palantir has helped the SEC compare trading records to personal information from other databases to understand the relationships among those trading in the same stock.
