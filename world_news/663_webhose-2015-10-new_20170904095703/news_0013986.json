(NYSE: TDC ), the big data analytics and marketing applications company, today announced a collaboration with two major health plans for the upcoming launch of the Innovation for Discovery Analytics Community Site, powered by Teradata Aster . The Community site is designed to promote the value of data analytics among analytic professionals in healthcare. The analytics site will be generally available November 15 .\nThis announcement is being made in anticipation of the 2015 Information Management Symposium in Amelia Island, Florida , which runs September 20 through September 23 .\nThe goal of the Discovery Analytics Community Site is to enhance dialogue among data scientists and analytics professionals. This is expected to raise the bar for the use of discovery analytics and improve the quality of healthcare. The site offers a basic learning experience using Teradata Aster Analytic functions and an opportunity to collaborate with peers. Initially, access to the new site is immediate for Aster users, who will also have access to a set of pre-defined analytic functions in the Teradata Aster AppCenter.\nThe Teradata Aster AppCenter is a secured publishing portal that enables users to share \"big data analytics\" for selective collaboration and insight. This supports the efficient and effective use of big data while accelerating cross-organization adoption and collaboration. As a result, development costs can be reduced and valuable insights shared and re-used.\nThe Innovation for Discovery Analytics Community Site is designed to bring benefits across healthcare organizations, according to the initiative's executive sponsors.\n\"We are always looking for ways to unlock the power and value of big data and analytics through a more collaborative approach,\" said Jason Cooper , executive sponsor, Vice President and Chief Analytics Officer, Horizon Healthcare Services, Inc., New Jersey's largest health insurer. \"The new discovery site will enable us to share algorithms, insights and solutions with other health plans, ultimately working to benefit our members.\"\n\"Teradata Aster's unique analytic capabilities on our Community Site will provide the winning combination we have needed,\" said Chuck Martel , vice president, Data Analytics, BCBS Minnesota, also an executive sponsor. \"We expect enormous benefits from member collaboration on advanced analytics. We look forward to the use of repeatable applications to accelerate big data insights that will improve the member experience and reduce the cost of care across the entire network.\"\nThe Teradata Aster AppCenter includes a set of pre-defined analytics which provide participating organizations with the ability to store the most valuable analytics workflows as applications, execute them with ease, visualize the results, and share the insights with others.\nAt this point, eight applications have been created for sharing and collaboration, and are in production: 1) HL7 Parser (HL7 is a messaging format for medical information systems); 2) Patient Affinity and Length of Stay, 3) Patient Comparison, 4) Admission Diagnosis Procedure Paths, 5) Path to Surgery, 6) Diabetes Patient Readmission, 7) Drug Affinity Analysis, and 8) Impact Analysis. The type and functionality of the analytics available will expand over time.\nUnlike other analytic community sites that are limited to specific analytic techniques, the Discovery Analytics Community site, based on the Teradata Aster Discovery Platform, will support a variety of analytic techniques and languages to support analytic skills across a number of health plans.\nTo meet with Teradata at the IM Symposium, please visit booth space #9.
