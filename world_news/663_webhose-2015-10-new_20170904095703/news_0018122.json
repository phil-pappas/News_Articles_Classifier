The software that the company admitted using to get around government emissions limits allowed VWs to spew enough pollution to cause somewhere between 16 and 94 deaths over seven years, with the annual count increasing more recently as more of the diesels were on the road. The total cost has been well over $100 million. That's just in the United States. Engineers say, it's likely far deadlier and costlier in Europe, where more VW diesels were sold. Scientists and experts said the death toll in Europe could be as high as hundreds each year, though they caution that it is hard to take American health and air quality computer models and translate them to a more densely populated Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:09:09.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
