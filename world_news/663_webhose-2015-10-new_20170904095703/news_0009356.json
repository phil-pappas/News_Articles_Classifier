ID: 7115859 Bill Cosby has been hit with yet another lawsuit by a woman who claims he sexually assaulted her. Renita Hill, who has previously detailed her allegations in a television interview, is now suing Cosby for defamation, portraying her in a false light, and for infliction of emotional distress after the comedian and his representatives made comments in the media discrediting her account. Hill is seeking a jury trial. Hill’s lawyer, George Kontos, told BuzzFeed News Thursday that his client filed the lawsuit because “Cosby put forth a concerted effort through his business manager and his attorneys” to say his client “was an extortionist and she was just out to get him for money.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:41:40.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
