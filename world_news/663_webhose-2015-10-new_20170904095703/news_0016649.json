It paves the way for predicting the location, numbers, and even the amount of ion currents flowing through all 40 million synapses,” said Markram.\nOnce the reconstruction was complete, the investigators used powerful supercomputers to simulate the behaviour of neurons under different conditions.\nResearchers found that, by slightly adjusting just one parameter, the level of calcium ions, they could produce broader patterns of circuit-level activity that could not be predicted based on features of the individual neurons.\nFor instance, slow synchronous waves of neuronal activity, which have been observed in the brain during sleep, were triggered in their simulations, suggesting that neural circuits may be able to switch into different “states” that could underlie important behaviours.\nThe research was published in the journal Cell.\n 11, 2015 3:13 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:37:58.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
