Bharara said on Monday he expects a \"small subset\" of additional cases to be affected, though 90 percent of the convictions would survive. \nIn the ruling reversing the convictions of Newman and Chiasson, a three-judge panel held that prosecutors must prove that a trader knew a tip's source received something in exchange. \nThat court also narrowly defined what constituted a benefit to the tipper by saying it could not be just be a friendship but had to be of \"some consequence.\" \nIn his petition to the Supreme Court, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli sought to overturn the 2nd Circuit's narrow definition of what amounts to an illegal benefit. \nVerrilli said in the petition the appeals court decision would \"hurt market participants, disadvantage scrupulous market analysts, and impair the government's ability to protect the fairness and integrity of the securities markets.\" \nThe high court's action could encourage other insider trading defendants to seek dismissal of charges against them. \nAmong those who could benefit from the ruling is Michael Steinberg, a portfolio manager at SAC Capital sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison after his 2013 conviction for engaging in the same alleged conspiracy as Newman and Chiasson. \nBarry Berke, his lawyer, said the Supreme Court's decision \"will now require that Michael Steinberg's conviction be thrown out as well since it confirms he did not commit any crime.\" \nThe Supreme Court's action could renew calls for Congress to pass legislation clearly spelling out what constitutes insider trading, a crime that largely had been left to the court and U.S. regulators to define. \nThe SEC could also potentially adopt new regulations, something Chairwoman Mary Jo White in June said \"merits close consideration.\" \n\"Anything that could bring further clarity, whether a Supreme Court decision or a statute, I think reasonable people would think that's not a bad thing,\" Bharara said. \nThe case is U.S. v. Newman, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 15-137. (Editing by Will Dunham ) \nOur top photos from the month of September.
