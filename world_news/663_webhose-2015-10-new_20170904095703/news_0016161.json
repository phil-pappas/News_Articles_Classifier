Bangkok Mini Maker Faire was open to the public free of charge on September 26-27, in front of Hard Rock Café, Siam Square. Pairoj Kaweeyanun, Chevron Thailand president said, \"The Bangkok Mini Maker Faire is part of the five-year 'Enjoy Science' program aimed to inspire the general public, including children and parents, to see the four STEM subjects as interesting and relevant in everyday life. Chevron and NSTDA both realize that in an era of digital economy and innovation, the country's competitiveness relies greatly on the capability of the people to innovate, whether innovations are in the form of inventions, handicrafts, or technology-related entrepreneurship. Innovations should not be restricted within academic or specialist area. We believe that the maker movement is one of the fundamental components that can help leverage Thailand's competitiveness. It is our goal to support and raise more awareness of the maker culture among Thai people and to inspire them to become a maker.\" Thaweesak Koanantakool, NSTDA president said, \"Being a maker is far more than just a hobby. Their inventions can be the foundation of thriving businesses that are uniquely capable of tailoring their products to match the needs of each individual customer in a way that traditional mass production simply cannot compete. Therefore, it is important that we support the maker movement which can spark innovations and drive economic growth in the digital era - an age in which technology and innovation are always in demand. A strong maker culture can make significant and sustainable contributions to the nation's scientific and technological competitiveness.\" Sharnon Tulabadi, CEO and founder of Gravitech Thai and Home of Maker who represents makers at the event said, \"In Thailand, the maker movement continues to expand as seen by the increase in number of maker spaces, workshops and other activities in Bangkok and other provinces. Maker space like Home of Makers functions as a co-working space for makers to exchange knowledge and ideas and further improve their work. However, the maker concept is not yet well known among the public and we are glad that Chevron and NSTDA joined forces to create awareness of the maker culture through Bangkok Mini Maker Faire. At the fair, makers will have the opportunity to showcase their works and exchange knowledge and ideas with other makers while inspiring and sparking creativity for the public, further garnering attention for the maker culture. \" \"In fact, Thai people have always been makers in their own right. Local wisdom is a great example of how local people adapt things around them to use in their daily lives. We believe that if the maker culture becomes widely known and the public are introduced to maker's technologies such as 3D printers or laser cutters, we will be seeing a lot more innovations by Thai people. This will help effectively and sustainably increase Thailand's competitiveness in science and technology, which is exactly what Enjoy Science project is all about\", Pairoj added. Bangkok Mini Maker Faire showcases creations from makers from across the country and offers a variety of workshops which include demonstrations on how to make a 3D printer from leftover materials, a robot contest for dummies or \"Hebocon\" as well as inspirational talks. Makers from across the country participated in the event namely Maker Zoo, Home of Maker, PINN Creative Space, Fab Café, TRIBES, Ne8T, Maker Asia, iNex, Chiang Mai Maker Club, Phuket Maker club and many more. Chevron and NSTDA jointly announced the results of 3D printing contest Enjoy Science: Let's Print the World and showcased the finalists' works from the contest. Miss Sirilak Sangwarnworawut won the first prize in the student category with her 3D printed 'artificial coral reef' and Ms Saowakont Pummalee won the first prize in the general public category with her 3D printed 'Tossakan' . Each received a set of 3D printer & Scanner worth 100,000 baht and a round trip ticket to Maker Faire Berlin in October this year to be introduced to innovations created by world-class makers and to inspire them to apply their newfound experiences to the development of 3D printing in Thailand, as well as motivating the next generation of Thai innovators. 191 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:17:44.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
