As such, it attaches easily to a bar or counter top without drilling or damage to the surface. As a result, it improves customer service and stimulates business in bars and restaurants. Besides that, it keeps the area neat and organized. Not only is it suitable for a variety of public areas and places of business, it is also designed for home use. It is also compact, effective and attractive styled. In addition, it is convenient, user friendly and cost effective. The idea is patent pending.\nThe inventor’s personal experience inspired the idea. “After seeing drawers full of outdated chargers in bars, I decided to pursue the idea of a universal charger that would require minimal space but would meet customers’ needs for charging their electronic devices,” he said.\nThe original design was submitted to the Washington, DC office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
