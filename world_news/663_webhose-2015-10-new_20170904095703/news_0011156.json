We are delighted to be certified and we highly recommend the EcoPorts approach to our fellow ports.” \nMathias Guerin (Project Manager, Nantes-St-Nazaire, said: “Besides the usefulness of PERS as the only port-sector specific standard, the real added-value of EcoPorts is the network itself. It is great to be able to work and share experiences with fellow port professionals.” \nBoth ports get certified for the first time and ESPO is delighted to congratulate them for this achievement and to welcome them to the distinguished network of PERS-certificate holders. \nThe Ports of Le Havre previously received PERS certification in early 2015 for its efforts for being an environmentally-friendly port. \nFact File: PERS is the only port-sector specific environmental management standard. It is the flagship product of the EcoPorts network and is offered as part of ESPO services to its members through the EcoPorts website. Compliance with the PERS standard is independently assessed by Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance and the certificate has a validity of two years. There are currently 20 ports in Europe that hold a valid PERS certificate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:30:26.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
