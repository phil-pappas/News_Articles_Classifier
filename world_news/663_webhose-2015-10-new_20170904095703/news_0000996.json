The two companies share a common vision for enabling research and business development through mentorship, and are working together to make this vision a reality. \nThe support agreement includes details of the goods and services that NEB will provide to LabCentral and LabCentral-resident companies, including 24/7 access to many of NEB's products via its new on-site NEBnow® freezer unit. This automated \"kiosk\" allows the researchers at LabCentral to advance their studies when they need to, not having to wait for the required laboratory reagents to be shipped and delivered the following day or later. \n\"Our corporate mission has always been to support life science research, and as a first-of-a-kind shared laboratory space, LabCentral has become a global model in how to create the next generation of powerhouse life science companies. By supporting LabCentral and its resident companies, we're hoping to further support the development of the life sciences community in the Greater Boston Area ,\" explained Andy Bertera , Executive Director of Marketing at NEB. \"Many of these companies, with guidance and good science, plus a little good fortune, have the potential to make a mark on the global scene in short order.\" \nIn return for the financial and promotional support, LabCentral will allow NEB to conduct scientific presentations, as well as provide technical support to the LabCentral residents, directly at the LabCentral facility. NEB's access to the LabCentral facility will enable NEB to be closer to its customers in the Boston / Cambridge biotech hub, making customer interaction and information exchange possible on a deeper, more personal level. \n\"We are pleased that NEB has extended its sponsorship of LabCentral, and are excited to have been early users of the NEBnow kiosk,\" said LabCentral President and Cofounder Johannes Fruehauf, M.D., Ph.D. \"Thanks to sponsors like NEB, our residents have access to the latest, most-sophisticated analytical instruments and discovery tools, enabling them to take their research further and faster -- while preserving precious startup dollars.\" \nAbout New England BiolabsEstablished in the mid 1970's, New England Biolabs, Inc.
