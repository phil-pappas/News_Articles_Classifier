Sock's big forehand kept Nadal under pressure throughout the set which he ultimately yielded with a double-fault.\nBut the 14-time Grand Slam-winner hit back by breaking first-up in the second set, and he gave a fist-pump of relief and satisfaction when he eventually levelled the match 6-4.\nThey slugged it out to 3-3 in the third until Sock blinked first, handing Nadal three break points, and for once the American's forehand misfired as he shanked a routine shot high into the stands.\nAnd it was another miscued forehand which settled the quarter-final as Sock, serving to stay in it, hit one long to hand victory to Nadal on his first match point.\nAmong the later quarter-finals, Beijing's unbeaten five-time champion Novak Djokovic, the world number one from Serbia, is in action against another powerful American, John Isner.
