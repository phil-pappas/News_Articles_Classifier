In his debut article posted to PR Newswire's Small Business PR Toolkit, Rich Kahn, founder and CEO of eZanga.com provides five ways you can raise awareness for your brand, and not break the bank. To gain visibility on a budget consider the following: -- Thought leadership. Invest in writing about thoughts on your industry, unique trends and interesting observations. Kahn sites an example of River Pool and Spas, who during the economic recession in 2009 began answering questions that his potential customers would type into a search engine. His blog posts began to rank organically showing authority in his industry and his sales increased as a result. -- College connection. Working with a local college or university can benefit both small businesses and students alike. Students looking for internships can gain a unique perspective on what it's like to work in their chosen field, and you can gain a unique perspective from someone who may or may not understand your industry. These students can assist you with your PR efforts with a fairly minimal financial commitment. -- Co-brand with clients. A case study is an excellent way to share your client's success and leverage your own. These joint efforts make for excellent press releases and strong end-of-the-funnel sales content as well. Once completed, both companies can use this case study to solicit new customers and reach out to the media as well. \nFor discussion on the remaining budget-friendly public relations tactics, read the complete article here: http://bit.ly/1GhDdb9 . \nPR Newswire's Small Business PR Toolkit is a comprehensive resource that provides small businesses and entrepreneurs the tools to develop an affordable public relations and marketing plan that helps generate interest from potential customers, engage with key audiences and grow their businesses.
