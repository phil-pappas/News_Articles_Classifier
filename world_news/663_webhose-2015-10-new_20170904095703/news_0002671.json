Along with Cavotec, the Port of Oslo is also partnering on the project, together with Enova, a technology- and data analytics-driven online lending company, which is contributing almost half of the project’s total budget.\nReCharge will review the practicalities of expanding the availability of shore power at Norway’s ports, and research different power systems, such as battery-powered vessels and hybrids.\nShore power, or cold ironing, is the process of connecting ships in port to the electrical grid and switching off their engines. This reduces emissions of NOx, SOx, and particulate matter.\nCavotec has extensive experience of the design, manufacture and installation of high and low voltage ship-based, shore-based, and mobile shore power, or Alternative Maritime Power (AMP) systems. The group first started working with AMP in the 1980s in Sweden, and has since supported customers worldwide with the technology.\nThe group also developed the world’s first combined Cavotec MoorMaster™ automated mooring and AMP system for two passenger ferry berths in the Norwegian fjords.\nRead a Technical Paper from Cavotec on the MoorMaster \n“Charging options are critically important for battery-powered ships and plug-in hybrid vessels. Shore power will therefore play an increasingly important role in port infrastructure of the future,” says Project Leader Hans Anton Tvete, DNV GL.\nAccording to DNV GL, some 40 hybrid ships are on order for Norwegian shipping lines, with a similar number of plug-in hybrid vessels also due to enter service in the coming years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:39:59.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
