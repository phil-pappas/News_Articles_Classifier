Jesse Marlow by Tim Binsted Leadership instability continues at insurance comparison website iSelect with chief executive Alex Stevens resigning as the board entertains a takeover offer.\nThe company said on Tuesday that Mr Stevens, who became CEO in March 2014 , \"has chosen to pursue new career opportunities outside of iSelect and has resigned from iSelect effective immediately\".\nMr Stevens replaced Matt McCann, who also departed the CEO role unexpectedly.\nMr McCann stepped down in October 2013, just four months after iSelect listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and in the wake of a revenue downgrade, due to a disagreement with the board over strategy.\nThe company also lost its chief financial officer David Chalmers in June last year. Mr Chalmers departed after five months as interim chief executive and was replaced by former Morgan Stanley investment banker Paul McCarthy.\nCommercial director Scott Wilson has been appointed as CEO.\n\"We are delighted that Scott has accepted the role to take iSelect to its next stage of development as Australia's leading multi-channel comparison service,\" iSelect chairman Chris Knoblanche said in a statement.\n\"Alex will help to ensure there is a smooth transition of leadership to Scott. We thank Alex for the important role he has played in laying a number of foundations for iSelect and the completion of several strategic projects during his tenure.\"\n Mr Wilson will be paid a fixed salary of $500,000 and a maximum total remuneration of $750,000 if performance targets are met.\nThe iSelect board also revealed that the $400 million company has received a \"confidential, indicative, non-binding and conditional\" takeover offer from an unnamed private equity firm.\nThis \"well credentialed international private equity firm\" has made a proposal to acquire all of the shares of iSelect via a scheme of arrangement.\nMr Knoblanche and the board have agreed to grant the private equity firm \"preliminary\" due diligence and access to senior management.\nThe process is expected to take several weeks.\nSources told The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column that the bidder is US private equity firm Providence Equity Partners .\nThe bid price is said to be below $2.00 a share.\nIn the event the takeover offer does not proceed, iSelect said that the board intends to implement \"a range of capital management initiatives\" including an on-market share buyback.\nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been appointed as financial advisers to iSelect and Gilbert and Tobin is acting as legal adviser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:17:47.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
