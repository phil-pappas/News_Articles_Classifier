Safe Harbor program, which allowed for trans-Atlantic data transfers between the United States and European Economic Area (EEA), is invalid effective immediately and without a transition period. The Safe Harbor program enabled companies to legally transfer data between the EEA and the United States in compliance with the European Data Protection Directive (the \"Directive\"), which generally prohibits transfer of personal data outside of the EEA. Currently, more than 4,000 companies are members of the now-defunct Safe Harbor program. \nPlease see full Advisory below for more information. \nFirefox recommends the PDF Plugin for Mac OS X for viewing PDF documents in your browser. \nWe can also show you Legal Updates using the Google Viewer; however, you will need to be logged into Google Docs to view them. \nPlease choose one of the above to proceed! \nLOADING PDF: If there are any problems, click here to download the file. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP …\" By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy Policy.
