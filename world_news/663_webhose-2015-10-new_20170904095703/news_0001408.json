In their response to the report, officials said they plan to develop an accurate inventory of system hardware and software, scan all components of the system for vulnerabilities, update the scanning tool regularly, ensure system patches are clearly documented, use credentials for scanning and frequently review reports. \nIn a memo included with the report, Eric Hirschhorn, undersecretary of Commerce for industry and security, wrote that since reviewing the recommendations, the bureau has centralized the monitoring of agency systems and configurations under one individual, who reports directly to Acting CIO Eddie Donnell. A final report on the bureau's cybersecurity is due by the end of the year. About the Author \nBianca Spinosa is an FCW editorial fellow.
