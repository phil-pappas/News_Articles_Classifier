The Angel Eye system enables parents of NICU babies to see and talk to their kids anytime , 24/7, from a mobile phone or computer. And with the proper security credentials provided by parents, other family members and friends can view the babies as well. \n\"I think it’s going to be a great help for the family as a unit to stay involved with the baby and stay involved with each other during this time,\" said Dr. Jim Moore, medical director at Connecticut Children's, in a news release. \nHe said the university plans to outfit all NICU beds in Hartford and Farmington with Angel Eye systems. \nEarlier this year, Angel Eye installed 52 cameras in two Massachusetts hospitals. By the end of fall, it plans to have 88 cameras installed at NICU units in Arkansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New York, Texas, Massachusetts and Connecticut, including 26 at UAMS alone. Installations are also pending at hospitals in Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:07:51.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
