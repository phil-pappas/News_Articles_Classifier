Could not subscribe, try again later Getty Eye scan: Cash machines could scan your retina before handing over cash \nA new cash machine dishes out your money only when you look at it. \nCustomers select the amount they want by smartphone and the machine scans their retina to identify them when they arrive. \nCitigroup bank is testing the devices. They no not need plastic cards or PINs, which are open to fraud. \nCitigroup said the retina scans would take 15 seconds to complete compared to 45 seconds for traditional transactions. \nIt would be more secure and would mean that cards could never be skimmed at an ATM again, making life harder for criminals and identity thieves. PA Eye spy: Citigroup hope it will cut fraud \nThe Wall St Journal reported that Citigroup had not set a date for when the retina scanners would be introduced. \nThe bank will also have to overcome privacy issues as some customers may be uncomfortable giving their biometric data to such an institution. \nCitigroup has been working with cash machine manufacturer Diebold on the retina scans and that tests have been carried out on 30 consumers in a laboratory at it head office in New York. \nThe test cash machines do not even have a screen or a touchpad and all the information is put on on the app ahead of time. Getty Eye eye: The customer will use an app and then their eye will be scanned \nCitigroup is not the only financial institution testing out cardless cash machines and in the US JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America are working on similar technology. \nThey are acting because in the US credit scoring firm FICO said that in May the number of attacks on debit cards used at ATMs had reached its highest level in 20 years. \nIn the UK criminals have become increasingly crafty at getting consumers' pin codes from ATMs including installing tiny cameras to record the moment they type the information in. \nStatistics show that credit and debit card fraud is also a serious problem in Britain. Getty Fraud: Citigroup hope it will cut crime \nFraud on lost or stolen cards in the first six months of last year reached £29.2 million, up three per cent from the same period in 2013. \nThe cost of counterfeit fraud - cards that are cloned - increased by four per cent to £24.2million, up from £23.3 million. \nPolice have advised consumers to be on their guard when drawing out cash and watch out for people who get too close to them. \nA common tactic is distraction and criminals engage somebody in conversation just as their card is being taken out, allowing them to steal it. \nUsers should also cover the keypad with their hand when they type in their pin code in case there is a hidden camera.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:07:29.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
