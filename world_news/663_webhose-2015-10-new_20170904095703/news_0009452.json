Snakes use venom to protect themselves and for hunting – so they conserve their venom and use it in times of need.\" This video is not supported by your browser at this time. \nCleopatra is strongly associated with snakes, like many ancient Egyptian kings and queens of Egypt. In addition, Cleopatra also believed she was the embodiment of the Goddess Isis, who can take on the form of a snake. \nDr Tyldesley, whose book \"Cleopatra: Egypt's Last Queen\" was a BBC Radio 4 book of the week, says one aspect of the accounts has proved to be correct. The ancient Egyptians believed snakes were good mothers. \n\"Very few snakes have a maternal instinct. However, the cobra is an exception: They sit on the nest and protect them until they hatch. So in this case, it seems the Egyptians were right,\" agrees Dr Gray.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:32:28.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
