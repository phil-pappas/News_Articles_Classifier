For many New Yorkers, especially those in Manhattan, owning a car is onerous because parking is limited and very expensive. They rely instead on cabs, the subway or ride-hailing services such as Uber.\nIf the program works, GM may expand it; there already are plans to try the service in another U.S. city that the company didn’t identify. GM also has a pilot program with its Opel brand in Germany.\n“We view evolving consumer preferences, such as car-sharing, as real business opportunities,” President Dan Ammann said.\nLet’s Drive NYC, as the program is called, starts today and serves only the 479-unit Ritz Plaza, which is on West 48th Street. GM’s rates are undercutting what Avis Budget Group Inc.’s Zipcar unit charges. Zipcar charges $12.75 an hour during the week and $94 for a day and more on weekends, according to its website; GM will charge $10 an hour and $75 for the day. As residents make lease payments, they’ll get credits for three hours of rental a month.\nRitz Plaza residents can rent a Chevrolet Trax compact sport utility vehicle or Chevy Equinox small SUV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:08:29.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
