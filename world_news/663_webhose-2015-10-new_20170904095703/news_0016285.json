R.L. Stine has been recognized as one of the bestselling children's authors in history. Now, the literary phenomenon is coming to the big screen in 3D, just in time for Halloween. In Goosebumps , teenager Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette), upset about moving from a big city to a small town, finds a silver lining when he meets the beautiful girl, Hannah (Odeya Rush), living right next door, and makes a quick friend in Champ (Ryan Lee). But every silver lining has a cloud, and Zach's comes when he learns that Hannah's mysterious dad is in fact R.L. Stine (Jack Black), the author of the bestselling Goosebumps series. As Zach starts learning about the strange family next door, he soon discovers that Stine holds a dangerous secret: the creatures that his stories made famous are real, and Stine protects his readers by keeping them locked up in their books. When Stine's creations are unintentionally released from their manuscripts, Zach's life takes a turn for the weird. In a crazy night of adventure, it's up to Zach, Hannah, Champ, and Stine to team up and get all of these figments of Stine's imagination - including Slappy the Dummy, the girl with the haunted mask, the gnomes and many more - back in the books where they belong to save the town. Directed by Rob Letterman, the screenplay is by Darren Lemke with a story by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, based on the Goosebumps book series published by Scholastic and written by R.L. Stine. The film is produced by Deborah Forte and Neal H. Moritz. \nAbout Sony Pictures Entertainment Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment Inc., a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Sony Corporation.
