Belying its relative nascence, Decawave has broken new ground in the real-time location systems (RTLS) and indoor positioning systems (IPS) markets with its unique ultra-wideband (UWB) technology-based DW1000 chip. The DW1000 chip, which is a part of Decawave's seek-control-execute-network-sense-obey-respond (ScenSor) product family, has first-mover advantage in the semiconductor space. It boasts distinctive features that include compliance with IEEE 802.15.4-2011 standards and the ability to locate any object within a 10 centimetre radius even in harsh indoor environments. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151016/277871LOGO \nIn addition to technological finesse, the DW1000 chip facilitates effective data rate communications of up to 6.8 Mb/s in wireless sensor networks (WSN); and its capability to operate even in low-power situations prevents batteries from dying quickly. Available in a 6x6 mm 48-pin quad flat no-leads (QFN) package, this chip is fabricated in standard 90 nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), making the performance of its technology accessible to a broad set of applications. \n\"In line with evolving customer requirements, Decawave has invested considerable resources in developing innovative products and redefining existing ones,\" said Frost & Sullivan Program Manager Olga Yashkova. \"The DW1000 chip, developed after a decade of research, is truly compact and cost efficient, which widens its application scope to cover both indoor and outdoor usage.\" \nDecawave also developed the DWM1000 module to help lower the development cost and risks associated with the radio-frequency (RF) design. The module has made the most of the market potential by being integrated in user applications as a simple plug-and-play solution. \nOwing to its high price-performance value, the chip is popular among developers of real-time location and indoor positioning systems, location-based services, Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks. This already translates to wide adoption across verticals such as agriculture, building control, factory automation, healthcare, safety and security, warehouse and logistics. \nThe enthusiastic market acceptance is going beyond industrial markets and Decawave plans to enhance the production volume of the DW1000 chip that will further reduce the cost of its solution and offer an enriched ownership experience to customers in market verticals such as automotive, portable consumer, PC, gateways and connected home. \nAlready present in the US, Europe, Korea and China, Decawave also aims to expand its global footprint in 2016 by by increasing its workforce in the regions. In 2015 Decawave also launched a program of qualified partners capable to deliver HW, SW, design services to facilitate the adoption of its technology by end customers. \n\"The key to the long-term success of any company is its ability to continuously nurture and enhance the value of its products and/or services to its customers. As such, Frost & Sullivan is excited to recognize Decawave for its industry-leading focus on improving customer value for its products in the real-time location systems market,\" said Frost & Sullivan Global President & Managing Partner Krishna Srinivasan. \nEach year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in implementing strategies that proactively create value for its customers with a focus on improving the return on the investment that customers make in its services or products. The award recognizes the company's inordinate focus on enhancing the value that its customers receive, beyond simply good customer service, leading to improved customer retention and, ultimately, customer base expansion. \nFrost & Sullivan Best Practices Awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service and strategic product development. Industry analysts compare market participants and measure performance through in-depth interviews, analysis and extensive secondary research to identify best practices in the industry. \nAbout Decawave Decawave is a fabless semiconductor company developing a family of integrated circuit compliant to the IEEE802.15.4a standard, which can identify the specific location of any object, person or thing at very competitive cost, very low power and with a required level of precision and reliability never achieved before (+/-10cm). In addition, the data communication capability of the chip makes it a perfect fit for IOT applications and other low-power wireless network applications. http://www.decawave.com \nAbout Frost & Sullivan Frost & Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants. \nOur \"Growth Partnership\" supports clients by addressing these opportunities and incorporating two key elements driving visionary innovation: The Integrated Value Proposition and The Partnership Infrastructure. -- The Integrated Value Proposition provides support to our clients throughout all phases of their journey to visionary innovation including: research, analysis, strategy, vision, innovation and implementation. -- The Partnership Infrastructure is entirely unique as it constructs the foundation upon which visionary innovation becomes possible.
