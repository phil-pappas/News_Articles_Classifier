Many have reported that the iPhone randomly shuts down without warning. Some have reported that the phone even shuts down while charging. Users have to hard reset the device to regain usability.\nA report by The Telegraph mentions that owners of the iPhone 6s are reporting their new devices turning off at random intervals, even if they were fully charged. The issue was reported by dozens of users on Reddit and Apple forums. MacRumors forums has seen that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are specifically the ones in trouble.\nThe issue could be related to a software bug in the recently released iOS 9.0.1.\nApple has already released a new bug fix iOS 9.0.2. The bug fix also eliminates the issue that allows anyone to bypass the lockscreen to access the photos and contacts on the device. Sadly, The Telegraph also reported that the new bug fix iOS 9.0.2 does not mention anything about the random turning off of the new smartphones.\nWhat is even interesting is that some iPhone users have also reported that their iPhoneâ€™s Home button would be unusually hot when they turned the device on again.\nApple has not yet confirmed anything on this case.\n technology latest Mobiles and tabs iPhone iOS apple Also Read BlackBerry teases new device plans as turnaround takes shape Infosys global sales head quits iPhone 'threat to national security': Chinese media New batteries will last longer: scientists", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151003/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/ios-901-your-iphone-randomly-turning-too", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/iPhone%206S_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/iPhone%206S_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/iphone/11906158/iPhone-6s-owners-are-seeing-their-new-phones-randomly-turning-off.html", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-04T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:54:12.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
