Morgan Chase's head of China health care and Bank of America Merrill Lynch's head of Asia TMT have all left for Chinese tech companies. In the U.S., high-ranking Wall Street executives who have moved to Silicon Valley include Ruth Porat, who earlier this year left Morgan Stanley , where she was chief financial officer, to take the same role at Google Inc., and Anthony Noto, who as a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker led the initial public offering of Twitter Inc., and who last year became Twitter's finance chief.\nCatherine Liu, who recently left Credit Suisse--where she was a director and head of China technology coverage--has joined U.S.-listed Chinese internet-services provider Qihoo 360 Technology Co. as its chief strategy officer, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe hiring followed Qihoo's announcement in June that it had received a buyout offer valuing the company at $9.01 billion, in a deal that would have been the largest of recent offers to take U.S.-traded Chinese companies private. The Wall Street Journal reported in August that the investor group was considering cutting its offer after China's stock-market rout lowered valuations.\nLing Zhang, most recently a managing director and head of China health care at J.P. Morgan, left banking at the end of August to join Shenzhen-based biotechnology company BGI Genomics as its chief operating officer, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Zhang had joined J.P. Morgan in June from Citigroup Inc., where he also worked on health-care investment-banking deals.\nOther similar moves include Winston Cheng's August departure from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, where he headed Asia technology media and telecommunications, for Chinese online video provider Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp. Mr. Cheng will be in charge of investment, financing and acquisitions at LeTV, a company representative confirmed.\nA combination of increased regulation, cost controls and lower compensation--the result of banks' need to raise returns on capital--is making banking jobs less attractive for some, said Robert Grandy, regional head of financial services for Asia Pacific at executive search firm Korn Ferry.\n\"Things like compensation aren't as favorable when you compare them to corporates as they may have been a few years ago and cost controls have made things a little tougher,\" said Mr. Grandy. \"People being asked to fly economy, cutting back on their entertainment expenses and other resources has been a problem. With low interest rates and slow activity, the opportunities for bankers to do deals are less.\"\nAt Chinese technology companies, by contrast, billions of dollars in venture capital have led to soaring valuations and cash-rich balance sheets. Many of these companies are now looking to put excess capital to work by making acquisitions at home and abroad, which creates roles for people with banking experience.\n\"The areas where I think the corporates will be hiring are going to be the same areas that are busy with banks, so right now it's probably health care, technology and insurance,\" Mr. Grandy said. \"The bankers will look at opportunities where they have a chance to really do well, which is going into a startup situation or a company that's in growth mode, and try to grow along with that company.\"\nWei Gu contributed to this article.\nWrite to Alec Macfarlane at alec.macfarlane@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 09:42 ET (13:42 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:42:49.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
