The organization translates more than 8 million words a year for humanitarian development, responds immediately to crises using Rapid Response Teams and trains translators in under-resourced languages.\n\"From the very start, Lionbridge has been a leader in helping us increase access to knowledge around the world and advocate for translation as a strategic humanitarian tool,\" said Andrew Bredenkamp , Board Chair of Translators without Borders. \"We are thrilled that they are taking the step to greater support, setting an example for others in the industry.\"\nTWB's sponsors, coupled with its thousands of volunteers, have been the engine that has propelled the organization to success. The more than 50 TWB sponsors from the translation industry, stand with the charity in telling the world that #TranslationMatters and #LanguageMatters.\nPaula Shannon , CSO and Senior Vice President of Lionbridge, was a founding board member of TWB and continues in the capacity of advisor.

Our participation and support has been a consistent point of pride for our employees and partners. As a global leader, it is unique and rewarding to connect our professional mission and translation expertise with a charitable endeavor.\"\nThe support provided by sponsors is critical to sustaining and growing the organization, particularly in building a long-term governance structure that supports key programs.\nAbout Translators without Borders\nTranslators without Borders envisions a world where knowledge knows no language barriers.
