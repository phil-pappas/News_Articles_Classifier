The AMOS-6 is built by Israeli satellite operator Spacecom. Facebook and Eutelsat said they have an agreement with Spacecom to use its broadband capacity.\nEutelsat said it is forming a new company in London to lead its African broadband business. Zuckerberg said Facebook will team up with with local partners \"to help communities begin accessing Internet services provided through satellite.\"\n\"This is just one of the innovations we're working on to achieve our mission with Internet.org,\" Zuckerberg said.\nIn a statement, Chris Daniels, vice president of Internet.org, said satellites will play an \"important\" role in addressing the \"significant barriers that exist in connecting the people of Africa.\"\nInternet.org has come under fire, especially in India and Indonesia.
