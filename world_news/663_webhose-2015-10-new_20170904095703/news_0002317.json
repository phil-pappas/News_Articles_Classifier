Download our app from the App Store to read the latest issue and browse our back issues. \nThe US Army's recent Jade Helm exercise, which included special forces training to work covertly on US soil, stoked controversy and enraged conspiracy theorists. Looking beyond the paranoia, we investigate what the reaction to the exercise tells us about the militarisation of the domestic space and the government's relationship with the governed. \nWe also take a look at the contenders for the US Long Range Strike Bomber programme to find out which company is best placed to meet the air force's requirements, explore the potential of hydrogen energy as an alternative power source for UAVs, and ask how the UK Dstl and Qintiq are collaborating to tackle health risks faced by jet pilots. Moreover, we review the highlights from this year's DSEI exhibition, take a look behind the scenes at the British Forces Broadcasting Service and check in on the roll-out of the US Navy's Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air system. \nRead the issue for free on your iPad through our app, or if you're on a desktop computer you can also read it in our web viewer.

Next issue preview \nThe merger of Nexter and KMW has been described a game-changer for the armoured vehicle sector in Europe, creating a Franco-German armoured systems giant with revenues of around €2bn per year. With interest in armoured vehicles picking up again in Europe in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, and new markets in Asia Pacific, South America, the Middle East and North Africa offering new growth opportunities, we ask how the deal will position the new giant to compete in the global market and what the impact will be on its European rivals. \nWe also investigate how the US military will keep up with the US Pentagon's plan to increase the number of ISR drone flights by almost 50% by 2019 at a time when fleets and operators are already stretched, and take a look back at the rise and fall of the Humvee as Oshkosh gears up to replace the US Army's iconic vehicle. Moreover, we review Australia's 20-year plan to save its shipbuilding industry with a $89bn investment in domestically built naval ships and submarines, and take a look at a range of futuristic designs unveiled in the UK that show how the Royal Navy could sail in 2050.
