The salary range will be £33,353 - £40,313 per annum, inclusive of London Allowance. \nApplications are invited for a Research Associate in the Division of Infection and Immunity. \nThe successful applicant will join the laboratory of Dr Clare Jolly investigating the HIV infection of T cells and the immunological consequences for T cell function. \nA Wellcome Trust Investigator Award that aims to understand the biology of HIV infection in T cells funds the post. Our current focus is to determine how HIV manipulates normal T cell biology to drive successful viral replication and spread, and to define the consequences for T cell function. \nThe successful candidate will perform research to define how HIV-1-induced modulation of T cell signalling / activation shapes pathogenesis and immunological dysfunction. \nThe position would ideally suit a motivated postdoctoral scientist who wishes to develop their career and pursue opportunities for career development fellowships. \nThe position is available for three years in the first instance. Further funding to support the post may be available. \nThe postholder will have a PhD or equivalent qualification in a relevant subject area (preferably cellular or molecular immunology) and experience of research in cellular or molecular immunology. \nPrevious experience of research in T cell activation and/or T cell signalling as as well as experience of confocal immunofluorescence microscopy is desirable. \nThe successful candidate must be highly-motivated, able to communicate effectively and have experience of drafting and submitting academic papers for publication. \nUCL Reference: 1505317 \nApplicants should apply online.
