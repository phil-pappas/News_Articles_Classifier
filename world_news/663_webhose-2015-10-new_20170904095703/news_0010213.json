(Pros might use Liquify to alter a person’s waistline, for example.)\nRecommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know It also includes tools to adjust the lighting, color, smoothness, and focus of parts of a particular image – for example, adding natural-looking lighting to an area that was partially obscured by shadow when the picture was taken.\n40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Photos Photoshop Fix also includes a feature that doesn’t appear in the desktop version of Photoshop: a tool to automatically identify and adjust faces in photos. The tool can zero in on a person’s eyes, nose, chin, and mouth, and subtly adjust their size or angle. Adobe gave a sneak preview of this feature during the Apple iPad Pro demonstration last month, though some attendees found it a little bit creepy . Overuse the tool, and you risk entering the “ uncanny valley ” – the effect produced by an image that looks almost, but not quite enough, like a real person.\nAdobe says Photoshop Fix doesn’t require a subscription to Creative Cloud, the company’s pay-by-the-month subscription service for Photoshop and other Creative Suite software. That said, if you do have a Creative Cloud subscription, you’ll be able to move edited images back and forth between Photoshop Fix and the full desktop version of Photoshop.\nAdobe announced that it would eventually release an Android version of Photoshop Fix, as well.\nThis isn’t the first time Adobe has taken features from its desktop software and broken them into a simpler standalone program. In April 2014, the company released Lightroom Mobile, an iPad version of its desktop photo editing and organizing program. And last October, it introduced Premiere Clip, a stripped-down version of the widely-used video editing program. Premiere Clip allows iPhone and iPad users to trim shots and arrange them in sequence, as well as apply transitions between them and add a few effects. Like Photoshop Fix, Lightroom Mobile and Premiere Clip allow Creative Cloud subscribers to send their work back over to the desktop for further refinement.", "external_links": ["http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9296051/apple-adobe-ipad-pro-woman-smile", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop-fix/id1033713849?mt=8"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:13:21.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
