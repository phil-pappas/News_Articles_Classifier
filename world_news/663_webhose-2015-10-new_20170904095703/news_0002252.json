Identifying the application input requirements allows the designer to work more effectively with the motor manufacturer to obtain the best motor for the application, allowing the engineer to choose the optimal design and have a successful product launch.\nSioux Center, Iowa (PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nGroschopp, Inc.’s whitepaper How to Test & Evaluate Fractional Horsepower Motors in Your Application discusses the specifications and processes needed to properly determine the optimal fractional horsepower motor for an application by knowing the application inputs and testing the application to obtain actual performance requirements.\nUnderstanding the Application Input\nInput Power Load & Speed Load Profile Packaging & Environment\nTesting the Application\nEstimate the Application Loads Determine the Actual Loads Establish the Specification Optimize the Design\nThis whitepaper focuses on what testing and evaluations can be done to understand if a selected electric motor is best for the application. This is important because a system with too small of motor may not be able to perform the intended task or may not meet the life requirements; a system with too large of motor may add too much weight, size, or cost to the system. A good understanding of the application and how to evaluate the motor in that application will allow for optimized results.\nWebsite: http://www.groschopp.com/whitepaper/how-to-test-evaluate-fractional-horsepower-motors-in-your-application/\n# # #\nFor over 80 years, Groschopp Inc. has delivered expert technical assistance, superior product performance, quality-honed workmanship and industry experience in the manufacture of highly engineered fractional horsepower electric motors and gear motors for OEM and distribution products.
