DX Engineering supplied the TX3X team with components, now available to Amateur Radio operators in the new DX Engineering TX3X Chesterfield Islands DXpedition Combo .\nThe Chesterfield Islands are currently number 22 on the DXCC “Most Wanted” list, making it a prized DXCC contact for DX operators. Largely uninhabited, the Chesterfield Islands have been the site of biological studies, makeshift military bases and temporary weather stations. Though beautiful, the coral reefs surrounding the islands are home to several significant shipwrecks—something the DXpedition team is acutely aware of. You can follow the adventure by reading the frequent updates at TX3X.com.\nDX Engineering supplied the TX3X team with its Hexx Beam because of the antenna’s 20-10 meter versatility, compact size and ease-of-use. The team also received a matching DX Engineering Maxi-Core® choke and mounting kit. The stations used a Samlex Switching Power Supply to provide the necessary 13.8 Vdc. To ensure excellent reception, DX Engineering donated an InLogis Active Magnetic Loop Antenna. A Rohn Telescoping Mast helped put the antennas in the air.\nDX Engineering TX3X Chesterfield Islands DXpedition Combo (DXE-TX3X-DXP)\nDXE-HEXX-1HBP DX Engineering Hexx Beam Hub\nDXE-HEXX-1SCP-2 DX Engineering Hexx Beam Spreader and Center Point\nDXE-HEXX-5FFP DX Engineering Hexx Beam 5-Band Rigid Balanced Feeder\nDXE-HEXX-5WRP-2 DX Engineering Hexx Beam 5-Band Wire Element and Guide\nDXE-HEXXBEAM-INS DX Engineering Hexx Beam Instruction Manual\nDXE-FCC050-H05-A DX Engineering Maxi-Core® Feedline Current Choke\nDXE-BMB-1P DX Engineering Balun Mounting Bracket Kit\nSXA-03435 Samlex Desktop Switching Power Supply\nROH-H50 Rohn Telescoping Mast\nINS-RF-PRO-1B InLogis Active Magnetic Loop Antenna\nLearn more about 2015 TX3X DXpedition at its official website.\nDX Engineering\nhttp://www.DXEngineering.com\n1-800-770-0703\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13015119.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.tx3x.com/", "http://www.dxengineering.com/parts/dxe-tx3x-dxp", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13015119.htm"], "published": "2015-10-10T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:36:59.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
