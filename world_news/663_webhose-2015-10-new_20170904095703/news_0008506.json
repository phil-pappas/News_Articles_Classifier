IDology has also integrated the Payfone solution as part of its ExpectID Mobile \nSolution to better reduce risk associated with mobile devices and improve the mobile commerce \nexperience. \n“IDology is a leading solutions platform for identity verification and fraud prevention that assists \ncustomers with account origination and step-up authentication,” said John Dancu, chief executive officer \nof IDology. “Our partnership with Payfone strengthens our identity verification and fraud prevention \nprocess and also enables IDology to provide network authentication and transaction monitoring for \nongoing transactions. Payfone will be a key partner with us in the advancement of solutions for the \nmobile environment. Our decision to invest in Payfone’s business stems from our commitment to enable \nmobile solutions that strike a balance between convenience and security and deliver personal, secure \nand frictionless access to products and services.” \nIDology will combine its multi-layered ID verification and fraud prevention platform with Payfone’s \nunparalleled mobile security services. The result is a powerful mobile security solution, ExpectID Mobile. \nNow, customers using IDology’s ExpectID Mobile solution can seamlessly establish, maintain and trust a \nmobile identity associated with a legitimate consumer. \n“IDology is an excellent strategic partner for Payfone as we continue to develop solutions that help \nbusinesses fight mobile fraud,” said Rodger Desai, chief executive officer of Payfone. “Payfone already \nexclusively serves as a critical ingredient to the bank consortium that helps traditional banks and FSOs \nfight fraud, with this new partnership, we are excited to bring capabilities to additional markets such \nalternative finance and payment gateways, healthcare, medical and retail through IDology. Through \nIDology integrating Payfone’s services as part of their mobile solution these businesses will be now be \nable to better to serve legitimate customers and also understand the risks they face on mobile. \n“Establishing a mobile identity is a complex challenge,” said Dancu. “This is due to a number of reasons \nsuch as the rise in mobile account takeovers, improved mobile spoofing technology and the millions of \nchange events that occur with mobile devices such as a consumer porting a device between carriers. \nExpectID Mobile allows organizations to establish a mobile identity for a consumer that is persistent \nthrough numerous different life cycle change events and is resistant to mobile fraud tactics. When a \ncustomer signs up for an account on a mobile device, the IDology solution first verifies the consumer’s \nidentity and ensures that there are no fraud flags associated with it. Then, ExpectID Mobile is able to \ncreate a mobile bind, or persistent identity, for that consumer. This mobile identity can be used to \nstreamline ongoing transactions and ensures the legitimate user is performing the action, instead of a \nfraudster. The persistent mobile identity can also be created independent of an identity verification.” \nExpectID Mobile operates seamlessly within IDology’s platform, allowing organizations to verify that the \nconsumer is who they say they are, bind them to a trusted mobile identity, confirm this mobile identity \nbind upon customer log-in and escalate to a higher level of verification only when needed. This is all \ndelivered in an on-demand technology platform that enables businesses to determine their own \nbusiness rules based on their own specific requirements. \nAbout IDology, Inc. \nIDology, Inc. provides real-time technology solutions that verify an individual’s identity and age for \nanyone conducting business in a consumer-not-present environment to help drive revenue, decrease \ncosts, prevent fraud and meet compliance regulations.
