Intrapreneurs are a key to solving some of our most pressing societal issues...The LOI can be instrumental to them by providing much needed support, networks, tools and insights. — Friedrich Blase, Global Director, Thomson Reuters TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA, October 1,   Toronto, ON, October 1, 2015– Social entrepreneurship is becoming an increasingly mainstream concept in Canada, but unless social entrepreneurs can find common cause with social intrapreneurs, their impact will be limited. Enter the League of Intrapreneurs. The League began as a global movement a year ago in Berlin, and we are pleased to announce its expansion with the formation of the League of Intrapreneurs (LOI) Canada. “Intrapreneurs are a key to solving some of our most pressing societal issues at a global, regional and local scale. The LOI can be instrumental to them by providing much needed support, networks, tools and insights.” Friedrich Blase, Global Director, Thomson Reuters, and LOI Canada inaugural member The goal of LOI Canada is to amplify the voice and increase the visibility of Canadian intrapreneurs and to that end we have sent three Canadian delegates to the 2nd Global Social Intrapreneurship Summit currently underway in Mexico. These three representatives will not only play a key role in the summit, they will also take forward our recommendations to the global community. In addition, over the next three days, the League will be inviting fellow Canadians to join this growing global community through regional and virtual activities across the country. Social intrapreneurship is an emerging concept that has grown out of the wildly popular social entrepreneurship movement. While social entrepreneurship and creative destruction are required, we also believe that change will originate from within existing institutions. Key to this change is proactive risk-taking by social intrapreneurs applying the assets of their organizations to solve our most pressing global challenges. Alongside social entrepreneurs and other changemakers, intrapreneurs are key to a sustainable, and socially inclusive Canada. LOI Canada was born in early September 2015 when 24 inspiring social change leaders from BC to the Maritimes came together to amplify the voice and increase the visibility of Canadian intrapreneurs. Originating in some of Canada’s major corporate, government, non-profit, and academic institutions, the attendees of this gathering resolved to launch the first Canadian circle of the League of Intrapreneurs, a global community of institutional changemakers. Members of the League are innovating creative solutions to societal and environmental problems within the workplace, while also meeting their employers’ needs. The informal and relaxed gathering was convened by the School for Social Entrepreneurs (SSE), the BMW Foundation, and the Breuninger Foundation, and held at the peaceful retreat centre of Wasan Island, located on famed Lake Rosseau, in Muskoka, Ontario, We are now announcing the outcome of this gathering and the creation of the League of Intrapreneurs Canada to a wider audience. SSE’s Managing Director, Marjorie Brans, is the Canadian ambassador for the League, and explains that social intrapreneurs have much in common with social entrepreneurs. Together they can be far more effective by working together. “As the head of a school for social entrepreneurs, I take inspiration from the unconventional thinking of intrapreneurs working within society’s established nodes of power. These high-minded individuals are pointing toward new ways of organizing our businesses, government agencies, and communities. The League of Intrapreneurs Canada convenes leading intrapreneurs and helps increase their ability to inspire institutions to create progress and opportunity for everyone.” Marjorie Brans, Managing Director, School for Social Entrepreneurs Ontario What our members say: “For me, the League really represents a community .... A collective of people all over Canada (and the world) desiring real, positive, and influential change, using the organizations in which they work to do so. They seek new ways of working and new ideas to advance, using their influence from within their respective organizations to bring about change, incremental or revolutionary in nature. We can continue to learn from one another, share our commitment and energy, and advance a much larger international community that will change the world together.” Ian Howatt, Director, Strategic Leadership at City of Edmonton, and LOI Canada inaugural member\"Social intrapreneurs are demonstrating to the world how business can be a force for good.\" Richard Branson, Founder, Virgin Group Please stay tuned for more exciting news about the League.

With endorsements from leading CEOs like Virgin’s Richard Branson and GlaxoSmithKline’s Andrew Witty, the League has mobilized powerful actors across five continents. The School for Social Entrepreneurs (SSE) Ontario is a project of Tides Canada Initiatives Society (TCI), a Canadian charity. SSE came to Canada in 2012 and is a member of a thriving international network of 20 SSE schools across four continents. Originally founded in London in 1997, SSE assists everyday people in launching a social purpose business, non-profit organization, cooperative, or social venture for the benefit of their community. SSE believes that the success of social entrepreneurs and a more inclusive economy is interdependent with the success of social intrapreneurs. SSE is committed to supporting corporate and institutional changemakers in Canada and is launching a program of robust support for these trailblazers. BMW Foundation is a strategic global partner to LOI in Germany and abroad. As a lead actor in the LOI movement, it has played co-host to the League’s global summits in Berlin and Mexico City and continues to foster deeper ties between German social change-makers and other trailblazers around the globe. The Foundation brings together leaders from across communities, cultures and countries to drive Social Innovation, promote Global Dialogue, and encourage Responsible Leadership. The Breuninger Foundation works at a local, national, and international level with people who have set out to foster integrated, sustainable and interconnected ways of thinking and acting. The Foundation invests in civil society’s ability to learn, to cooperate, and to lead. Acting on the principle of philanthropy of place, Breuninger offers a retreat like Wasan Island, embedded in nature, to facilitate creative discussions, deep-going thoughts, and long-lasting action.
