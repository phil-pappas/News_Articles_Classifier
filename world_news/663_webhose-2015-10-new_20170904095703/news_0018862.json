The knitted textile based on the polymeric composite fibers, produced at the Australian National Fabrication Facility, are highly sensitive, stable and able to detect a wide range of human movement.\nThe team demonstrated a working device with remote sensing capabilities using a knee sleeve prototype of the fabric that ‘talks’ to a commercial wireless receiver. Researcher Dr. Shayan Seyedin said that this was the real breakthrough.\n“We built these textile sensors from the individual fibers produced using the technology that we established recently,” he said.\n“These advanced functional fibers are not only stretchable but also conduct electricity. This combination of outstanding properties allows the fibers to respond to any type of deformation by changing their electrical response.”\nDr. Seyedin said wearable smart clothing was the team’s next target.\nACES Director Gordon Wallace said an interdisciplinary approach to the research was crucial to the team’s success.\n“These advances are made possible by the combination of skills that ARC Centres of Excellence bring together to tackle challenging areas,” he said. “We are able to take fundamental advances in materials science and engineering and to realize wearable structures for use in sports training and rehabilitation applications.”\nA paper detailing the work, 'Knitted Strain Sensor Textiles of Highly Conductive All Polymeric Fibers', was recently published in Applied Materials and Interfaces .", "external_links": ["http://www.electromaterials.edu.au/", "http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.5b04892", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/97TRYwNXezA"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:19:27.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
