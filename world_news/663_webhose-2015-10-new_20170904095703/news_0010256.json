TUNE, a software startup that provides technology for marketers, is paying the rent for the house with the goal of creating a supportive community for UW women interested in computer science and technology. Women make up more than half of the nation's workforce, but they still play a small role in inventing technology, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology. Women-only training programs such as Hackbright Academy in San Francisco and Ada Developers Academy in Seattle are also teaching women coding and other technical skills. UW, which is not involved in TUNE's housing program, has been closing the gender gap in its computer science program. While she found some women to talk to, she's looking forward to having a built-in network of mentors and women who share her interests in computer science.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:31:01.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
