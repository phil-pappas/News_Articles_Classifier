While Samsung hasn’t released usage numbers, “Samsung Pay is off to an amazing start,” the blog said. Older mobile-payment services, such as Google Wallet and Apple Pay, have struggled to reach mainstream adoption.\nAfter targeting retailers like Target Corp., more recently hackers have been targeting health-care companies and even credit-tracking firm Experian Plc. Because mobile payment services can be connected to consumers’ credit, debit and rewards cards, they represent a wealth of information that could be valuable to hackers.\n“Samsung is extremely committed to securing and protecting user data to the highest industry standards,” Darlene Cedres, Samsung’s chief privacy officer, said in the statement.\nThe attack was first reported by the New York Times .", "external_links": ["http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/samsung-pay-is-safe-secure-and-works-almost-anywhere-you-can-swipe-or-tap-a-card-today/\\", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/technology/chinese-hackers-breached-looppay-a-contributor-to-samsung-pay.html\\"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:08:34.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
