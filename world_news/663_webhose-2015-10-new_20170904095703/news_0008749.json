The hacker claims he posed as a Verizon employee and tricked another employee into revealing Brennan's personal information. \nIt was not immediately clear whether any national security information was compromised in the release of the clearance application, which includes his wife's Social Security number and the names of people Brennan worked with over a long prior career at the CIA. The application predated his job as White House counter terrorism adviser. \nThink your friends should see this? Share it with them! \nStory copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
