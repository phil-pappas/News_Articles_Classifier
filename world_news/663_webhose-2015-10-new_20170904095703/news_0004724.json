The 3PL is one of only a half dozen companies on the 2015 list, dubbed The North Carolina 100: Top Private Companies, with annual gross revenues of more than $750 million. Transportation Insight attributes its success in the logistics industry, the second-largest sector of the U.S. economy, to its appealing co-managed business model that empowers more than 1,000 clients to increase their own enterprise value through improved supply chain performance. \n\"Transportation Insight is extremely fortunate to be recognized as one of the largest private companies in North Carolina ,\" says Transportation Insight Founder and Chairman Paul Thompson , the visionary behind the 3PL's creation in 1999 and an EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 速 2015 finalist. \"With the tools, technology and talent that we have in place, we intend to maintain our aggressive growth trajectory and remain the leading provider of value-based logistics in North America , helping as many companies as possible achieve long-term success through the power of strategic partnership.\" \nTransportation Insight has been nationally recognized for its ability to help clients solve their complex, global supply chain challenges by developing and executing supply chain solutions specifically tailored to each client's needs. Its Tier One logistics solutions in all modes of transportation help companies reduce logistics-related costs and operate more efficiently. User-friendly technology such as Insight TMS 速 drives tactical process automation and improved supply chain visibility. Proprietary freight invoice audit and payment solutions simplify complex accounting processes. Comprehensive best-in-class reporting and analytics available through Insight Fusion 速 , the 3PL's interactive business intelligence portal, shed light on enterprise successes and opportunities for tactical improvement and strategic development. \nTransportation Insight's climb to the top level of The North Carolina 100 is further evidence of the lead logistics provider's commitment to deliver on its Vision 20/20 growth plans, a strategic blueprint launched in early 2014 to triple the size of its business by January 1, 2020. The 3PL recently completed a key component of its growth strategy by moving its headquarters to the Transportation Insight Global Building, a 1930s-era hosiery mill on the National Register of Historic Places that serves as the centerpiece of a new 11-acre Corporate Campus in downtown Hickory . \nDesigned to bring an unprecedented level of lifestyle opportunities for its associates, the company is currently building out additional phases of the facility, including office space in the soon to open Transportation Insight Americas Building, athletic fields, outdoor basketball courts, significant green space and a full service cafeteria with a chef specializing in healthy cuisine. Transportation Insight will conduct a formal, public grand opening of the campus in early 2016. \n\"Our core advantage in the logistics marketplace is our people,\" continues Thompson. \"Their passion for seeing our clients and our company succeed has furthered our reputation as an essential strategic partner that drives enterprise improvement while operating with complete transparency and at the highest level of integrity.\" \nWhile Transportation Insight's diverse client base is spread across North America , more than 80 of those clients are either headquartered or have strategic locations in North Carolina . Furthermore, several Transportation Insight clients appear alongside the 3PL in The North Carolina 100. \nSince 1984, Grant Thornton LLP has compiled The North Carolina 100 by ranking businesses headquartered in North Carolina based on revenue from the most recent fiscal year. \nAbout Grant Thornton LLPGrant Thornton LLP is the U.S. member firm of Grant Thornton International Ltd.
