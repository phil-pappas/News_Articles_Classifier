Recently, the Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has raided 27 online pharmacies located in Mumbai, Thane and Pune and seized drugs worth crores.\n\"We feel that opening of doors to internet for e-pharmacy in India cannot be compared with the developed countries. Drugs are sold online in developed countries, but it cannot replicate in India,\" he said.\n\"At present, online pharmacy business is going on illegally and authorities are not taking any actions against them for the complaints made by us\", Shinde alleged.\nHe further claimed the internet online pharmacies are supplying all products including I-pill, anti-depression, codeine cough syrups without confirming the authenticity of prescription and patients.\nAccording to him, over 55,000 chemists from Maharashtra participate in the strike and at the protest to be held at Azad Maidan here.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:52:20.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
