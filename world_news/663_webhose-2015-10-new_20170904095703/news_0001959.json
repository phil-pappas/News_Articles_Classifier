After concluding a partnership with the 2015 Pan Am/Parapan Am Games , Cisco Canada will be implementing technology used during the games as a means of promoting innovation and economic development within the province. “It was always our intention to leave behind a legacy that will continue to benefit Ontario and the rest of Canada long after the Games are over,” says Willa Black, vice president of corporate affairs at Cisco Canada. “This was a landmark event in the history of the GTA and we were proud to have delivered the most digital games ever.” Technology including wired and wireless networks, datacentre infrastructure, security, and collaboration tools will be available for use by select schools, sporting venues and non-profit organizations. “Patrons can continue to enjoy Wi-Fi and other technology features within sporting venues,” explains Black. “Teachers and students can use advanced collaboration tools to broaden education; and not for profit organizations can benefit from tools and equipment they otherwise wouldn’t have access to help them extend their reach, more cost effectively.” Related When we think of elite athletes, the first image that comes to mind isn’t usually technology.

In terms of non-profit organizations, Cisco has developed a matching process based on available equipment. The process is still underway, and Cisco will be making an announcement regarding the recipients shortly. Cisco has sponsored the Rogers Cup in the past, but the size and volume of the Pan Am games far surpassed any Canadian event Cisco had previously been a part of. Overall, Cisco hopes to foster a culture of excellence in communities through its various donations. Black outlined their main goals as: 1. Supporting the workforce of the future through donations to Networking Academies. 2. Promoting sports and athletic excellence through donations in selected sports venues. 3. Encouraging capacity building in the non-profit sector by selecting organizations across areas including the arts, community building, environment, education, innovation, and international relief.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:35:47.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
