Net profit rose to GBP85.9 million from GBP64.8 million.\nARM said 3.6 billion of its chips were shipped during the period, up 20% from the same period the previous year. The company said it expects group dollar revenue for the full-year to be in line with market expectations.\n\"Q3 has been another strong quarter for royalty revenue growth, driven by premium chip pricing and elevated royalty percentages from recently introduced ARMv8-A based chips,\" said Chief Executive Simon Segar.\n\"These new chips are now shipping in a wide range of devices including smartphones, enterprise equipment such as base stations and servers, and consumer electronics such as digital TVs,\" he added.\nARM's technology is used in 95% of smartphones, 80% of digital cameras, and 35% of all electronic devices, according to its website.\nWrite to Rory Gallivan at rory.gallivan@wsj.com; Twitter: @RoryGallivan\n 21, 2015 02:42 ET (06:42 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:01:37.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
