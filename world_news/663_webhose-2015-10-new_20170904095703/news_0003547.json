This webinar will provide exclusive insight into the current state of pricing analytics and the tools retailers and brands have at their disposal to realize a highly-responsive, intelligence-driven pricing program. In a live discussion with RetailWire BrainTrust panelists, this webinar will explore the strategic use of pricing to enhance market image, be more responsive to shopper needs, and infuse excitement into the customer experience. The webinar will also highlight the critical linkage between retailer pricing and market image – each serving to reinforce the other.\n“A low price leader and luxury retailer have very different pricing strategies, yet both use price strategically to reinforce their desired image and associated value proposition with their target shoppers,” said Alexander Rink, CEO, 360pi. “Effective data driven pricing starts with understanding your desired market perception to deliver the right price to the right consumer at the right time.”\nIn a price transparent age, it is important for retailers to know and stay within the acceptable target price range for a specific product, but equally important to look for ways to deliver incremental value to shoppers and margin to their bottom line; all the while staying true to their desired market image. In this panel, Alexander will explore the role data driven pricing plays in supporting an integrated competitive retail strategy.\nRegister here for the webinar.\nAbout 360pi\n360pi derives profitable insights from product and pricing big data to help leading omnichannel retailers, etailers, and brand manufacturers compete and win with shoppers. 360pi’s customer base accounts for over $US200 billion in annual product sales and includes Ace Hardware, Build.com, and Overstock.com, along with several Fortune 500 consumer products companies.
