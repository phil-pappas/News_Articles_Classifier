Vodacom and MTN's services get's a knock, especially the Data side. Contact Vodacom and they fix it in a week.\nPhone MTN's service desk and the support staff says they know about it and it'll be fixed, and she put the phone down.\nJune nothing changed, Phone again, Support answers, hear problem and rudely say it's being fixed and slams the phone down.\nJuly nothing changed. Phone again, get a reference number. Two weeks later phone again, support has no knowledge of the reference number. Email Support and open support ticket.\nAugust, Suppot answers back on email, and ask if it's just me, tells no, two weeks later get the next email, they want to know where the small town is where I live, Give them the GPS location, get email back they don't understand the GPS and give directions to a site they understand.\nSeptember comes along, still no real Data usage on MTN. get told someone will phone me in 96 work hours. Well that was almost a month ago.\nSending a whattsapp photo takes anything from 40 minutes to two days. MTN airtime sales are almost non existent. Cell C and Vodacom Airtime sales are up between 40-50% at our shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:08:07.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
