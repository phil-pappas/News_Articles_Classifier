The S60 Plus action camera has all the advanced features consumers expect, with all the bells and whistles they wish for at the wallet-friendly price of $250. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275779 \nUnlike most comparable action camera bundles on the market, each S60 Plus box comes packed with accessories, including a waterproof housing and various mounts, which are additional purchases for other popular action cameras. The $250 price point is truly all-inclusive. \nCreated for adventurers, hikers, and active sports enthusiasts alike, the S60 Plus features a detachable thin-film transistor (TFT) screen for composing shots and accessing the menu. The S60 Plus captures full HD 1080p at up to 60 frames per second (fps). There are a number of other options for frame rates and resolutions as well, including single, burst and continuous. \nThe AEE S60 Plus can double as a high-end DSLR. It can also take 16-megapixel stills as individual shots in up to 30 second intervals for stitching together time-lapse movies, or in momentary bursts of up to 8 photos per second - the latter helping ensure you catch fast action at just the right moment. Whether you are hiking your local trails or jumping out of an airplane at 30,000 feet, the AEE S60 Plus is the ultimate accessory for capturing life. \nThe S60 Plus also syncs to a coordinating iOS or Android app which remotely controls the device from up to 328 feet via Wi-Fi. The long lasting battery life lets users capture up to 180 minutes of video and up to 300 minutes of audio, all while being housed in a tiny 2.56 ounce unit. \nThe demand for action cameras is at an all-time high, with 5.5 million units being shipped worldwide in 2014, up from 3.3 million in 2013. Technology forecasters are expecting this demand to rise to 9 million units by 2018. GoPro's recent IPO has further brought attention to the surging category. AEE is a major player in the already booming Asian and European markets, with global revenues topping $55 million in 2014. Now, AEE hopes to conquer the North American markets and win a place in the backpacks of adventurers and casual users alike. \nFeatures include: -- 1080p/60 fps -- High resolution 16mp -- Built in 1250 mAh lithium battery -- 130 degree viewing angle -- 2\" detachable screen -- Wi-Fi connectable and controlled from mobile phone app -- One year warranty -- Waterproof housing for dives up to 130 feet \nThe camera also uses a microSD 64GB card and is Windows XP SP2/Vista/Win 7 or above and Mac OS compatible. \nThe S60 Plus is compatible with over 40 AEE accessories, but every package includes: -- LCD Display - 2 inch detachable screen -- Waterproof Housing -- Waterproof Housing Rear Case -- Flat Adhesive Mount -- Quick Release Mount -- Micro USB Data Cable -- Plug Bracket Unit -- Tether and Anti-Fog Insert -- Curved Adhesive Mount \n\"The S60 Plus is an all-inclusive camera,\" says USA Branch Office Director David Deng. \"It is the perfect camera for novices and professionals, offering all the capabilities as other popular action camera brands, but with more added features and accessories that people wouldn't expect to come standard. Our goal is to continue to exceed the expectations of what consumers have come to expect from an action camera package.\" \nThe camera is available for purchase directly through AEE at www.aeeusa.com or from Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/AEE-Technology-Inc/pages/default?pageId=TO15Z9TUBKP3XYB \nAbout AEE \nEstablished in 1999, AEE Technology Inc. has been dedicated to develop and manufacture professional, advanced and reliable recording equipment's, which includes action camera MagiCam models, police recording equipment's, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) system and aerial photography devices.
