Lucasfilm\nHold on to your lightsabers, because the official movie poster for \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" was posted Sunday morning on StarWars.com by Disney and Lucasfilm.\nWhile the poster looks like one of the iconic posters created by artist Drew Struzan for the original Star Wars movies, the new poster was not actually designed him, just inspired by his previous efforts, Lucasfilm confirmed .\nBut in the grand tradition of Star Wars, all the epic space battles you would expect are in the poster, including the Millennium Falcon, X-Wings and Star Destroyers, and oh hey, is that a new kind of Death Star in the top right corner?\nWhile there aren't any huge plot points being spoiled on the poster, the characters on the poster and the various sizes they appear in might hint at their importance in the film itself.\nThere's Han Solo (Harrison Ford) with his trusty blaster at the ready and a Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with a new signature hair style.\nChewbacca (Peter Mayhew) has his bowcaster out too. And yes, there's a tiny C-3PO, R2-D2 and even the newest droid BB-8.\nCuriously enough, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) seems to be missing from the poster, unless he's hidden behind a droid or in disguise as one of the new troopers like he was during his rescue of Princess Leia in \"A New Hope.\"\nWe already knew much of the \"Star Wars\" Original Trilogy (or as Disney now wants everyone to call it \"Star Wars\" Saga) cast would be returning to the new movie.\nBut we also spot new characters Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) prominently displayed on the poster, which implies that they might be stealing the spotlight from the original trio of Han, Luke and Leia.\nAlso getting plenty of the poster's spotlight is the new mysteriously cloaked villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).\nNow if we really want to nitpick the poster like a proper fan would, it's interesting to note that other characters we were hoping would be a big deal in the film are barely visible on the poster.\nYou almost have to squint to notice Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) on the poster.\nThough, these new characters weren't featured prominently on the new \"Star Wars\" stamps from Royal Mail , so that could have been our first clue that those characters may not be showing up much in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\nAnd Chewbacca isn't that quick to find on the poster either. It's almost like that new \"Star Wars\" kids book, \" Where's the Wookiee? \"\n\"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" opens in theaters in Europe and Australia on Dec. 17 and on Dec. 18 in the US.", "external_links": ["http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-force-awakens-theatrical-poster-first-look-in-theater-exclusives-and-more", "http://screenrant.com/star-wars-force-awakens-official-poster-drew-struzan/", "http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/19/c2b92684-92cb-4fb1-9a77-8b767f73d7ec/resize/970x546/dc9a693c84abf79226842859f2fc02bb/starwarsposter.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:10:29.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
