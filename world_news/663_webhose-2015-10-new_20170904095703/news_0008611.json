CampusTours Events Integration Examples: (more coming soon)\n The George Washington University AnyTour: http://virtualtour.gwu.edu EXAMPLE EVENTS FEED FOR GWU LIBRARY: http://tinyurl.com/gwu-gelman-events\nThe CampusTours AnyMap & AnyTour integration with ActiveData Calendar products allows CampusTours clients to easily integrate events feeds into their interactive map panels for each building, as well as facilities or room panels within buildings. Events integration means that interactive maps may include information about what’s happening at a location now and in the future, instead of only containing a record of the location’s past in photos and videos.\n\"Visitors benefit when event information is available within the interactive map and virtual tour,\" says CampusTours President Chris Carson. \"Organizations use their virtual tours and interactive maps to tell their stories to various audiences, and communicating the upcoming events for locations helps visitors understand and appreciate the dynamic nature of their communities.\"\n“We’re changing the way people think about calendar software,” states Susan Yee, Active Data CEO. “Our event solution, working in concert with CampusTours AnyMap, offers a unique and engaging user experience that helps visitors determine, not only where to go, but what they can do when they get there.”\nAbout CampusTours Inc.\nCampusTours Inc. is an interactive media and software company specializing in meeting the marketing, Web and multimedia needs of academic, non-profit and government organizations.
