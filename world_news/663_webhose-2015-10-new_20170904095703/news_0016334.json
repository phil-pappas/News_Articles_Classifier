We outline six important reasons why organisations have this preference, from innovation right through to resolutions. \nA single cloud services provider can: 1. Free up your IT department to increase innovation \nOne of the advantages of the cloud is that it unburdens your IT department from managing hardware and lets them focus on directly contributing to business value. Worse than hardware troubles is having to deal with multiple SLAs from multiple vendors, each of which are using different technologies, interfaces and jargon. Recommended for You \nThat is where the cloud stops being a boon and becomes a bane. A single cloud service partner saves you the headache of multiple vendor management and frees up your IT department’s ability to innovate. 2. Ease responsibility away from a single employee \nYou can have the best portfolio of cloud providers in the world, but if something goes wrong with your network, do they care? And what about infrastructure-wide concerns, such as disaster recovery (DR)? With multiple providers do you have a DR plan for each, or try to synthesize them all into one? \nUnless integration – and accountability – are consistent across your whole system, you can always run into problems. A single provider that takes full responsibility for both hosting and networking can guarantee the quality of service across your whole infrastructure. 3. Resolve problems easily \nWith several cloud providers you don’t get a full service wrap – nor the reassurance of end-to-end responsibility. If something goes wrong, who do you go to? The different parts of your cloud are disjointed. With a single service provider, you have a single point of contact at all times – someone who is fully accountable. \nWhether you’re migrating and on-boarding, scaling infrastructure, or managing applications – you know who to turn to. And you even get to avoid all that running around as each provider blames the other! 4. Fluency and interoperability \nCo-ordinating business services and resources is a tightrope walk at the best of times. With different cloud providers there is not necessarily any standardization and no guarantee that their services will easily integrate with each other. \nWhy not guarantee integration capability between the different parts of your infrastructure? This makes it much easier for employees to collaborate, e.g. if your different communications services – email, voice, IM – are all looked after jointly they will sync seamlessly. Not to mention security and compliance concerns when sharing applications and sensitive data across different services. 5. Overall costs are lower \nLet’s get back to basics: it will save you money. It’s cheaper to bundle services from a single provider. Your finance team spends less time reconciling budgets. Your employees are more efficient: they don’t have log-in problems, it’s easier for them to integrate new services as your business grows and they spend less time service managing multiple patches and upgrades across multiple portals. And don’t forget that you also save on staff costs in your IT department. Infrastructure expertise is taken care of by the experts, letting you focus on growing your business. 6. Trust and Reliability \nSometimes commentators justify having a single service provider with the somewhat disconcerting incentive of having a ‘single throat to choke’. But is this really the best we can do? Having a single place to direct your anger?! You need a holistic solution delivered with trust and reliability: from initial consultancy and solution design, to service management, network management and additional services delivered as the cherry on top. Takeaways: \nSingle cloud service providers can offer you a variety of benefits, including: Massive cost efficiencies, as money is saved on cheaper bundles and takes the burden off your IT department Improved interoperability, as a single provider can coordinate your services and synchronize them Opportunities for your IT team to focus on innovating rather than simply keeping the lights on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:51:26.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
