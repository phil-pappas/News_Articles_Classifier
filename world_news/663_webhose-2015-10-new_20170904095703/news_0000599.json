It’s also where, if you look hard enough, you’ll get a glimpse of the innovations that could soon define the way we work.\nRight now, the future is one where workers have more information on everything from the hiring process to day-to-day management. And start-up founders are selling bosses tools to empower employees by letting them weigh in — often anonymously — on company policies, their managers, and the everyday practices that drive them crazy.\nAs companies struggle to find qualified workers, employee satisfaction “is a lightning rod” right now, and they are looking for software to help them diagnose and address problems faster and smarter, says George LaRocque, a human resources technology consultant. Companies are trying “to understand why and where workers are not engaged and then fix that,” he said. (As HR analysts like to say in times like these, “the war for talent is over, and the talent won.”)\nConference organisers singled out one company trying to improve the perennially opaque process of applying for jobs. Great Hires, a “candidate-experience” company out of Oakland, Calif., tries to level elements of the playing field between job candidates and employers with a Web-based tool that gives applicants information about who will interview them, with links to relevant bios, blogs and social-media feeds. Great Hires also provides company information such as annual reports and employee testimonials, and prods candidates to submit feedback about the interview process. The features nod to the fact that hiring is a two-way decision these days.\n“Employees want to have a voice,” says Arnaud Grunwald, co-founder of Hyphen, a start-up that sells itself as an internal version of Glassdoor, a site that crowdsources workers’ reviews of companies. The mobile-only app gives employers a chance to listen in on anonymous conversations among employees to find out how they really feel. In exchange, employers must offer an open, nearly no-holds-barred network (the app bans 3,000 words and lets users flag and take down posts).\nHyphen is founded on a few tenets, said Mr. Grunwald: The network must be employee-driven, anonymous, and mobile-only. It is similar to apps like Memo, which let workers post anonymous information about their employers, except that each Hyphen network is sponsored by the employer and open only to its employees. Posts from executives are tagged as “official” so employees know when a question or response is coming from managers.\nThe system alerts administrators or managers to a thread when something is flagged as inappropriate or when a certain threshold of employees has commented, read, or liked a post.\nIt’s unclear whether large employers really want to hear workers’ unvarnished opinions, though. “A lot of companies aren’t ready” for that level of transparency, said Josh Bersin, head of HR consultancy Bersin by Deloitte. And companies fear that anonymous feedback tools could be poisonous for workplace morale, an issue raised in a recent New York Times article about Amazon.com’s corporate culture.\nSome companies are looking for more passive ways to collect information about workers’ feelings. An approach called sentiment analysis allows companies like International Business Machines and Intel to mine free text from sources such as blog posts and open-ended survey answers to divine how employees feel without asking them directly. Kanjoya, a small San Francisco company selling that method to Intel, among others, generated buzz at the conference and was tapped by organisers as one of a half-dozen HR technology start-ups to watch, along with Great Hires.\nWall Street Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:39:20.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
