However, rather than analyzing network packets, Sagan analyzes “logs” for malicious activity. Due to Sagan's multi-threaded nature, the analysis, detection, and correlation is done in 100% real time. \n“Since June 2010 we have continued to set goals and milestones for our open source Sagan Technology, and after five years of development, we are thrilled to have exceeded the goals we set forth,” expressed Champ Clark III, chief technology officer at Quadrant Information Security. “This release offers more powerful features and stability to our community of users.” \nChamp Clark III and his team have been working hard to develop and support Sagan since 2010 in efforts to release the best open source (GNU/GPLv2) log analysis engine in the space. \nIn addition to the open source platform, Quadrant Information Security utilizes this proprietary Sagan Technology with their commercial clients in conjunction with their 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) and MSSP offerings. \nCheck out Sagan 1.0.0 at sagan.quadrantsec.com . \nAbout Quadrant Information Security \nSpecializing in Enterprise Security consulting, Sagan Technology and Managed Security Services, Quadrant prides itself on delivering a holistic approach to help our customers maintain a secure environment.
