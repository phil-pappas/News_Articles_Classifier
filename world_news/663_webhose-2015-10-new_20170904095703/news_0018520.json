However, its debut in China has not yet been set. \n\"The Martian\" received a strong \"A\" rating from first-night moviegoers on CinemaScore, which suggested that the film would hold up very well throughout the rest weeks of October. Critics gave it as high as 94 percent of approval rating on RottenTomatoes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:06:28.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
