A host of new elements such as the cloud, remote access, data sharing and analytics, and connected and shared networks has fundamentally changed how built environments are being used and operated. Additionally, these elements have thrown open an otherwise closed-loop building architecture into one that necessitates the open access and control of many operators and service providers. The role of these entities is, to a large extent, crucial in reaping the benefits of a converged and connected space. However, buildings are exposed to a new threat that has been downplayed and undervalued for a long time. After witnessing a recent slew of security breaches, stakeholders of the smart buildings industry are recognizing the potential damaging impact cyber threats pose for the industry and its related businesses. \nStrategic Messages for the Industry Through dedicated research and dialogue with industry particiants, Frost & Sullivan concludes the following: - Investigating the issue of cyber threats in smart buildings is timely and pertinent. - While avoidance may not be an option, the ability to minimize the impact of cyber threats needs exploring. - Thought leaders and technology experts must collaborate to address various aspects of cybersecurity.- Evaluating the efficacy of technology solutions pioneered by leading companies at an industry level is important. 9835-19 4 Cybersecurity in Smart Buildings- A well-rounded strategic initiative is necessary to deal with this disruptive trend.- Cyber threats demand the utmost recognition and intervention of administrators and regulators to implement industry-wide changes.Pervasiveness of technology, ubiquitous connectivity, and an increasingly evolving machine-to-machine (M2M) environment will continue to impact and influence how smart buildings are operated, which will raise the need for protection against cyber risks quite significantly. A delayed head start not only poses huge challenges in dealing with this complex issue but undermines the value and adequacy of initiatives that could potentially be used to ward off adversarial impacts. Irrespective of such shortfalls, however, inaction is no longer an option for the smart buildings industry.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03309915-summary/view-report.html About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
