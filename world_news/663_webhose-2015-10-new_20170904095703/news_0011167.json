(AP) -- A $100 million computer system designed to improve record keeping at Washington's community colleges has run into problems and is more than a year behind schedule. \nThe Spokesman-Review says (http://goo.gl/dFiYmZ ) the Community Colleges of Spokane has spent at least $1.3 million in extra staff costs to try to get it and running. Hundreds of students have had problems registering for classes, getting financial aid packages approved or getting money applied to tuition. \nState and college officials say they're working to correct the problems. They note such glitches are common to any major change in computer programs. \nColleges in Spokane and Tacoma are the two test schools. Both are experiencing similar problems and delays. \nBecause of those issues, the state board in charge of the colleges have postponed by a year the date when all 34 Washington community colleges will be running the system. \n___ \nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
