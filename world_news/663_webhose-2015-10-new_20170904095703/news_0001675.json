Originally planned for a 5-year tour, the exhibit, which is owned, operated, and designed by Thinkwell Group, extended its run for an additional five years due to its popularity and finally closed on September 7th after a successful ten-year run.\n\"We are thrilled to have spent the last decade in partnership with Thinkwell to bring unique and engaging health lessons about the body to kids and families through Sesame Street Presents: The Body,” says Scott Chambers, SVP and GM of North American Media and Licensing, Sesame Workshop. “This exhibit naturally complimented our ongoing Healthy Habits For Life curriculum and could not have been a more perfect outlet for Sesame Workshop to deliver upon its mission to help all children grow smarter, stronger and kinder.”\nThe exhibit, which premiered on May 14, 2005 at the Arizona Science Center, traveled over 42,000 miles to 22 venues in the U.S. and Canada over the course of ten years. With three to six month residencies at host museums, the exhibit has educated two million visitors with fun interactives, engaging content, and over 250 appearances by Elmo. The exhibit was in such high demand that it even returned to some museums for a second stint, including to the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, HI and the Discovery Science Center in Santa Ana, CA.\nCreated in partnership with Sesame Workshop, the exhibit launched as a result of Sesame’s Healthy Habits for Life initiative, which was established in response to the childhood obesity crisis in the United States. The interactive exhibit aimed to educate children about the human body in a series of fun and hands-on activities in three zones: Your Outsides, Your Insides, and Staying Healthy. Families were guided through the exhibit by Elmo, Grover, The Count, and many of the other lovable Muppets as they were taught about the benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle beginning at an early age. Because the exhibit offered a unique learning opportunity that included a variety of interactive, multimedia experiences in a recognizable setting, children were encouraged to investigate, explore, and experiment in fun and exciting environments related to the human body.\n\"Our ten-year partnership with Sesame Workshop was a wonderful experience for us and the many museums that have hosted Sesame Street Presents: The Body. All of us at Thinkwell are incredibly proud to have been part of such a successful exhibit that contributed to the education, engagement, and joy of millions of visitors,\" says Joe Zenas, CEO of Thinkwell. After delighting audiences across the continent, the exhibit made its way home to Los Angeles after its final day in Fort Lauderdale.\nAbout Sesame Workshop\nSesame Workshop is the nonprofit educational organization behind Sesame Street, which reaches 156 million children across more than 150 countries.
