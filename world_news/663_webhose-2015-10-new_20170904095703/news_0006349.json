Only one Rule! MONTREAL, Canada - October 19, 2015 - Wars Across the World, (WAW) an exciting, new video game, was recently announced by Strategiae. WAW is a unique game concept that aims at simulating, in one single system, all of the conflicts throughout the world and beyond. From Prehistoric times to nowadays, from grand massive wars to asymmetrical conflicts, this game explores it all. The key is the use of a single system of rules and situations which works in all cases. Why? Because they want players to learn rules only once, get confident with them, and then spend all their time with the titles in the collection in a speedy and effortless manner. For example, the battle screen will be similar throughout the game, and thus will require almost no adaptation for enjoying it in a new game! Wars Around the World has been designed and developed by Strategiae, an independent Franco-Canadian game company from near Saint-Etienne, southeast of France, and Montreal, Quebec. All team members are dedicated longtime players of board games, war games, and video games. They have decided to create their own unique game system that would fill their desire to simulate all the conflicts that they wanted to play. While they were developing and trying the rules, it quickly appeared that they would be easy to adapt to all conflicts that spanned our world through the ages. However, before everyone can enjoy this incredible game, Wars Across the World needs help. Thats why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $15,000 CAD by December 13, 2015. To help bring this innovative game to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between December 2015 and August 2016. Please keep in mind this is an all-or-nothing deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help War Across the Worlds reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:08:08.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
