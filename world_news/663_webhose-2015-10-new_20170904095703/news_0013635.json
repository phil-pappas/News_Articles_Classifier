Additionally, there are a number of completed vessels available for sale. These are, two Stan Tugs 1606, two Stan Tugs 1004, two Stan Tugs 1907, two Stan Pontoons 5213, two Stan Pontoons 3011, a further ASD Tug 3212 and two Stan Launches 1004. \nThe Damen stock vessels are ready for operation, and so can be swiftly delivered to clients upon purchase.

Having arrived in Rotterdam the vessels will receive final touch-ups and cleaning before being delivered, either to clients or to various Damen shipyards. \nHugo Hoekstra, Design Engineer Pontoons & Barges at Damen Shipyards, said: “The main reason for this transport is to bring our stock closer to customers who demand short delivery times.
