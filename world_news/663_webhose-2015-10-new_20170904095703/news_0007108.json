( www.minerscenter.com ), Delaware based cryptocurrency trader announced today that it has put a offer on the table for Bitcoin sellers, as it's revealing its new cryptocurrency investment policy and appetite. The company has launched a market break-through offer on Bitcoin trade, sustaining a buying rate which is 10% higher than market's official rate. \nThe offer has been promoted with no time-frame, although the company explained that, according to its policy and the capacities targeted, it is likely that the offer will be just dropped, with no prior notice, the moment when sales target is reached. \nMiners Center Inc. was founded in July 2014 by former banking professional Emilian Tourey, who has seen the opportunity and future financial market development going on the way of technology, while cryptocurrency will flourish. \"It will eventually go mainstream within the financial system and we're not very far from that point, it's only a matter of few years,\" declared Emilian Tourey, the company's CEO. \nThe company has started as a moderate cryptocurrency buyer and investor, having seen great business opportunity in the emergence of alternative currency markets but with no means of putting uncertainty risk at the core of its business development, up until now. \nMinersCenter has on-going negotiations for becoming the first Bitcoin exchange house serving a couple of major consumer goods online vendors who are now turning their faces and policies towards Bitcoin acceptance. Along with those, discussions are getting close to signing with an important online Casino, also willing to implement Bitcoin use for its services. \nIn this pursuit MinersCenter has developed a purchase strategy aiming to pool all the sellers who want to benefit from the company's latest offer and who are willing to sell their Bitcoin for the best deal available on the market. \nAll the details related to the company's offer and other information, together with the contact details of the Sales Team are available on their website: www.minerscenter.com \n#minerscenter \nMedia Contact: Qamar Zaman, Submit Press Release123, 972.646.2788, reports@oxygengroup123.com \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com \nSOURCE Miners Center Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:38:54.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
