Every November, we present the latest technologies, devices and solutions from the entire WT ecosystem with a focus on health and wellness at our joint booth. In the following weeks, we will shortly introduce some of the topics and the exhibitors we cooperate with in this context. Of course we are happy to welcome you at the WT | Wearable Technologies Show 2015 MEDICA in hall 15 A23 and for the “Wearable Sessions” on Monday morning and Wednesday afternoon in the Connected Healthcare Forum directly next to our booth. \nLike at all WT | Wearable Technologies events, we cooperate with the entire WT value chain. So we are happy to have both familiar and new faces from the Enabling Tech space and Greater WT ecosystem exhibiting with us at MEDICA. Let’s have a look at those first: \nWe all know of the importance of smart energy solutions for wearables. Without juice there is no data. Especially in the healthcare market a constant, convenient energy supply is essential. The tinier the source, the better. And the solution should be eco-friendly, but have a long life circle. So a lot of requirements for something we use every day. \nVARTA Microbattery , one of the world’s leading battery manufactures, will showcase high-quality battery solutions for all major electrochemical systems and cell geometries. Their CoinPower button cells with lithium-ion technology set energy capacity and performance standards and their Gas Generating Cells are a popular choice for innovative dispensers and portable dosing solutions. \nIf you are looking for customized, printed batteries, you should definitely talk to Enfucell . Their SoftBattery® is a thin, flexible and eco-friendly printed power source. The battery can be utilized optimally in disposable labels and patches (a topic we will touch on later this month), such a skin-based wearables, medical, healthcare, sports and logistics sensors. \nBut how to harvest the data? Right, with sensors – and we cooperate with a bunch of companies dealing with the topic and showing all kinds of different approaches. \nExel will present their wireless (Bluetooth) and waterproof inertial sensors. EXLs3 is composed of a tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope and compass, a 32-bit Cortex microprocessor for data processing and ideal for posture assessment, rehabilitation, gait monitoring, joints’ functionality analysis and activity monitoring. \nIf you need help to bridge the gab between electronics and textiles, you should talk to Clothing+ powered by Jabil . They can basically integrate any kind of sensor in your garment. The company has a long success story, so they already created the first heart rate sensing shirt in 1998 and started mass-producing the world’s first textile heart rate sensor strap. \nShimmer is specialized in creating individualized sensing innovations from sketch to launch and can boast with award winning clinical grade sensor technology. With their know-how you can reduce your cost and time to market by up to 80% and extend to regulatory submission and certification. \nWe are also happy to have our long-term partner AiQ Smart Clothing on board again. The company merges electronics with textiles to create fashionable, functional and comfortable solutions to meet human’s everyday needs. They offer a complete and vertical integration of technology. Their solutions guarantee a comfortable medium for both patients and physicians. \nNot only but especially in the healthcare industry it is extremely important that there are no side effects. You have to identify and eliminate hazardous chemicals in skin contacts as well as lithium hazards in batteries. You must be aware of RF exposure levels, regulatory requirements for electrical safety, energy efficiency, data security and privacy of apps. And that is just the peak of the mountain. TÜV SÜD can help you to eliminate any eventualities. The organization is specialized in testing, inspecting and certifying product safety, quality and usability. With almost 20,000 employees around the world, TÜV SÜD is a trusted partner at every step of the production cycle. \nEveryone who ever tried to create a new product knows that there are many stumbling blocks. IWC can help. They are a link between small and medium-sized enterprises, research institutions and politics. Their network BodyTec is a federation of small and medium-sized enterprises as well as research institutes located in Germany. Their goal is to initiate research projects and acquire public funding in the field of wearables with a focus on “technological innovation” – a great support for companies without own research departments. \nWe warmly invite you to visit our booth at MEDICA in hall 15A23 to talk to our co-exhibitors in person. In Part 1 and 2 of our exhibitor overview we will focus on medical products that easily blend into our everyday lives, new rehabilitation tools for home and clinical treatment, innovative health monitoring and clever first aid and emergency tools. Stay tuned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:12:05.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
