Tomorrow. Stay in your rooms. The ones on the quad are the ones who will go first,\" the message said, according to the station. \nYik Yak allows users to see posts in a radius of up to 8 kilometres. \nThe message was up for only several minutes, but several students saw it and one called 911 emergency services, Emory University said in a statement. \n\"At this time a sophomore student has confessed to sending the message and has been arrested,\" the university told students in an email. \nThe student, who has not been named, is accused of \"making terrorist threats against the university as a result of a social media message that she posted early Sunday morning,\" the university said in a statement. \nThe student was being held in the Newton County jail pending the filing of charges, the university said. \nOn Friday, President Barack Obama met with relatives of victims of the deadly October 1 rampage in Oregon, as shootings on two more school campuses left two people dead and four wounded. \nObama has angrily called on Congress to do more, warning that failure to act on gun control was a \"political decision,\" vowing to keep pushing for reform. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:03:02.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
