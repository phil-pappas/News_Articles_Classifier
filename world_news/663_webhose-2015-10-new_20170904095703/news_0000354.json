Ported by vision industry experts at Sensory, this new technology makes it much easier for mobile designers to lower the power needed for face authentication to unlock a mobile phone, tablet, or their Internet of Things (IoT) device using a standard camera. Sensory's face recognition technology uses a standard mobile phone camera to identify a user and authenticate his or her face to unlock the device. By utilizing the Tensilica Vision P5 DSP and Cadence's extensive imaging/vision software function library, which is optimized to lower processing time by over 8X compared to a standard host CPU, system designers can easily deploy Sensory's robust, secure and extremely quick authentication technology.
