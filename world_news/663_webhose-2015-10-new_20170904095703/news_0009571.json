As the leading cloud-based commerce platform for the mid-market, Bigcommerce stays on top of these trends and translates them into the features and functionality that matter to our merchants,” Mr Bellm said.\n“Bigcommerce’s Twitter Buy Now functionality provides an opportunity for our merchants to significantly boost demand generation and sales for their business.”\nMr Bellm said the tie-up would lead to greatly reduced check-out friction, with users no longer having to go through a separate website to complete a purchase.\nHe said Twitter Buy Now will be available to Bigcommerce merchants within the United States in the coming months with international rollout planned for 2016.\nMr Bellm was appointed Bigcommerce CEO in June, where he joined a high-profile board including ex-employees of Google, Amazon and Twitter.\nThe start-ups, which is eyeing further expansion in the US, provides online stores, website building and marketing services, along with integration with payment platforms. According to the company it now runs more than 95,000 stores including brands such as Samsung, Gibson, Marvel, Cetaphil, Schwinn, Pergo and Enfamil.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/australian-start-up-bigcommerce-partners-with-twitter/story-e6frgakx-1227551984492"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:42:37.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
