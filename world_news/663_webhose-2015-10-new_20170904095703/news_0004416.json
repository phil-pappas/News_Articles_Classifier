As a Foundation member, Iron.io brings its job queuing, scheduling, and processing capabilities to the Cloud Foundry platform, providing developers a domain-specific environment for handling asynchronous workloads at scale within their applications. \n\"Iron.io is excited to formally join the vibrant Cloud Foundry community, and contribute its technologies to the growing cloud native ecosystem,\" said Chad Arimura, Iron.io CEO and Co-Founder. \"We've seen firsthand that the most innovative organizations are adopting the modern Platform-as-a-Service, with Cloud Foundry as the leading technology and community in the space.\" \nBy joining the Cloud Foundry Foundation, Iron.io builds on its existing partnership with Pivotal, where both IronMQ and IronWorker are available within the Pivotal Web Services Marketplace. Both are gaining widespread adoption within Pivotal Cloud Foundry Enterprise deployments on public, private, and hybrid clouds. Iron.io has also recently deployed its products to IBM Bluemix, with CenturyLink Cloud coming soon. Through its continued involvement in the community, Iron.io looks to collaborate with more organizations building systems and applications using Cloud Foundry as the underlying platform. \n\"The applications that enterprises are developing on Cloud Foundry often represent the next generation of digital experiences,\" said Cloud Foundry CEO Sam Ramji. \"Cloud Foundry makes it easy for software teams to build and iterate new services with ease. Iron.io provides an effective way to distribute a wide range of workloads at scale. We're excited to have them on board.\" \nIron.io will propose its service broker as an incubating project in the foundation, to easily provision its services within a Cloud Foundry environment. Future development plans include packaging its products to be deployable via BOSH, and integrating its Docker-native runtime with the next generation Diego runtime. A tighter integration with Cloud Foundry will allow Enterprises to leverage the job-centric capabilities of Iron.io alongside the core app-centric environment, using the same operations and compute resources provisioned by Cloud Foundry. \nAbout Iron.io Iron.io task management platform delivers and processes 100s of millions of messages and tasks. Its asynchronous workloads operate in public and private clouds, on-premises, or hybrid environments. Iron.io is leveraged by some of the world's most innovative companies including HotelTonight, Turner Broadcasting System, Bleacher Report, Twitter, Untappd, and Google.
