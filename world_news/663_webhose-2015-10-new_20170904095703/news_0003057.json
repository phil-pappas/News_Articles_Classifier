We feel we do a good job.\" Louise Kennerley by Shaun Drummond Sarah Thompson Yolanda Redrup Business management software company Reckon could be in play after chief executive Clive Rabie asked Macquarie Capital to consider \"strategic options\" for the company to boost its share price.\nReckon responded to a report in The Australian Financial Review' s Street Talk column on Monday that interested parties were closing in on the firm , confirming it had engaged Macquarie Capital to do a strategic review.\n\"There is a definite difference between the value of our business and the value of the other players out there,\" Mr Rabie told Fairfax Media.\n\"We are performing very, very well. We feel we do a good job, as good as if not better than our competitors.\"\nThe company reported a half-year 2015 net profit after tax of $9.3 million on August 11, down 1 per cent from $9.5 million in the prior corresponding period on revenue that was up 6 per cent to $54 million.\nTwo of its main businesses reported declines in revenue, explained in part by a much bigger push into an online subscription model from the traditional desktop software. This means revenue declines initially because desktop software provides most of the revenue early, and then tails off to support income. Subscriptions are lower initially, but more consistent and sustained.\nIt reported it had 300,000 active users and 30,000 online users.\nProfit up 5 per cent At its 2014 annual results in February, Reckon upped profit by 5 per cent to $17.6 million after stripping out an acquisition in the 2013 year that inflated earnings in that year.\nReckon's share price closed up almost 11 per cent at $2.14 on Monday. It reached a high of $2.25 on June 5.\nIts competitors include MYOB, which closed at $3.40 on Monday after listing on May 4 at $3.65. On August 27, it reported half year 2015 NPAT of $19.8 million, up 40 per cent on the previous corresponding period.\nMYOB said then it had 528,000 paying users and 142,000 small businesses signed up to its cloud based software.\nXero closed trading at $15.10 on Monday, well down on its high of $25 reached in March.\nThe high-profile ASX and NZX listed company reported a net loss after tax of NZ$69.5 million for its 2015 financial year on May 21. Its failure to make a profit has come under fire this year as it has pursued an aggressive growth strategy outside its New Zealand base into Australia, the US and the UK.\nThe online subscription only company reached 400,000 subscribers across Australia and New Zealand in August.\nStreet Talk revealed on Monday that interested parties were closing in on Reckon, tipping Perpetual Investments to be a likely voice in any deal given its 15 per cent stake.\nFund managers also told Fairfax Media the desktop and cloud-based business management software company would attract strong interest .\nMYOB, British technology giant Sage, which considered a $1.35 billion deal to buy MYOB from Archer Capital in 2013, US behemoth Intuit, and Wolters Kluwer's Australian unit CCH would be expected to run the ruler over Reckon. Small-cap private equity firms are also likely to take a look.\n\"The board of Reckon does in the normal course of its business consider opportunities to maximise shareholder value,\" the company said in a statement to the ASX.\n\"At present this process is at a stage which is indefinite and incomplete and there is presently no information which merits disclosure under the listing rules.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:25:15.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
