These dynamics are cited by Parlance Corporation in a new study released today that examines the call handling practices of leading companies in the U.S.\nBased on original research conducted by Walt Tetschner, President of Tern Systems Consulting and Publisher of Automatic Speech Recognition News, the new study summarizes Tetschner’s analysis of more than 2,600 large businesses in the U.S., representing more than 10 major industries.\nKey Finding #1: The majority of businesses in the U.S. are using 1980’s era push button auto attendants to connect 2015 callers.\nThe new study found that DTMF Directed Dialog auto attendants (“Press 1 to reach sales. Press 2 to reach technical support. Press 3 to reach…”) were utilized by the majority of businesses sampled, leading both Live Answer as well as newer and more caller-friendly call handling solutions, such as Speech Recognition Natural Language.\nKey Finding #2: Adoption of the latest call handling technologies will make rapid gains on older push-button technologies over the next 5 years, and organizations making the change earlier than others will have the competitive edge.\nAccording to the research, the caller experience will become an increasingly important component of customer satisfaction programs, leading to increased usage of more caller-friendly technologies to connect callers.\nSummary: Most companies are doing callers a disservice and missing out on an easy customer satisfaction win.\nThe study suggests that the preferences of callers and the preferences of businesses regarding call handling technology are not in alignment. While callers prefer a fast and simple caller experience (live answer, or as close to it as possible), the majority of businesses in the U.S. continue to employ time consuming and frustrating call handling technology (push-button DTMF Directed Dialog) due to ease of management and low costs.\nOrganizations embracing newer and more caller-friendly technologies, however, will enjoy customer satisfaction gains and competitive advantage over those relying on outdated call handling methods. The paper offers several tips on how businesses can focus on call handling to achieve higher customer satisfaction scores and give callers a modern day experience.\n“Frankly, the results of Walt’s study took a lot of us by surprise,” says Mark Bedard, Director of Marketing at Parlance Corporation and co-author of the new paper. “We knew that the caller experience was still lagging behind other customer satisfaction components at large organizations, but the problem is much more widespread than anticipated. The silver lining is that this information can help forward-thinking businesses get an easy customer satisfaction win if they examine their call handling practices and begin looking at things from the caller’s perspective.”\nThe article can be found on the Parlance Blog at http://www.parlancecorp.com/blog/the-caller-experience-a-study.\nAbout the Author\nMark Bedard is Director of Marketing at Parlance, which helps leading healthcare facilities, colleges and universities, and large enterprises deliver a positive caller experience, drive efficient operations, and move beyond yesterday’s call handling practices.\nFor more information, contact:\nMark Bedard, Director of Marketing\nParlance Corporation\n400 W.
