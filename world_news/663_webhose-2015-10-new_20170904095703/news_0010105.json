Company CEO Tim Cook didn't divulge that, but he did say that the auto industry is headed for \"massive change.\"\nSpeaking on Monday at WSJDLive, the Wall Street Journal's technology conference in Laguna Beach, California,, Cook touched on several topics, including Apple Music, privacy issues and the new Apple TV.\nHe didn't exactly quash or encourage chatter that Apple is building a car .\nadvertisement \"We'll see what we do in the future,\" he said, adding \" I do think that industry is at an inflection point for massive change. Not just an evolutionary change.\"\nThat change, he said, includes improved software, autonomous driving, and electric power.\nCook also gave an update on Apple Music . The music-streaming service, which launched in June and costs $9.99 a month, now has 6.5 million paying subscribers. While that puts it firmly behind Spotify's 20 million, Cook called it \"pretty good performance\" and said that it \"implies that around 60 percent of users who trial the service go on to pay for it.\"\nHe also said that the new-and-improved Apple TV will go on sale Monday, October 26, and will ship out to customers later that week. Revealed in September, the latest version of Apple's set-top streaming device includes a touch-sensitive remote, voice search and more for $149.", "external_links": ["http://www.today.com/video/apple-launches-music-streaming-service-473476163581&via=nbcnews", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/Dz_FxwfgRyE7", "http://www.today.com/video/apple-launches-music-streaming-service-473476163581", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/zI8g3m7RKC4p", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/tqpzEZCjYUv8", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.today.com/video/apple-launches-music-streaming-service-473476163581", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_56059137", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/uLBKqYibhATG", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.today.com/video/apple-launches-music-streaming-service-473476163581&t=Apple", "http://on.today.com/1T0L67c", "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/10/19/apple-ceo-tim-cook-talks-new-frontiers-at-wsjdlive-2015-live-blog/", "http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=tdy_or_apple_150630", "http://www.wsj.com/wsjdlive/", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/L7hMQlCnRB5s", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Apple", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/jbgSZLaIFC2z", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/150630/tdy_or_apple_150630.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:26:33.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
