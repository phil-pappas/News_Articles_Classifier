Japanese firms will also build an ammonia and carbamide plant at Uzbek chemical company Navoiazot's site. \nBefore Sunday's deals, Japan had provided a total of around $3.5 billion in development aid and loans to various sectors of Uzbekistan's economy, Karimov said. \nAbe is visiting the five former Soviet nations of Central Asia, the first trip in nine years by a Japanese premier to the region where Japanese companies are active and where both Russia and China are vying for influence. \nUzbekistan is the region's most populous nation with 31 million people and is a major producer of cotton, gold and natural gas. \n\"Today we discussed the three main directions of our cooperation - increasing the partnership of Japanese government organisations with private businesses for the sake of economic restructuring, preparation of highly skilled personnel ... and healthcare,\" Abe told a news briefing. \nIn neighbouring Turkmenistan, which holds the world's fourth-largest natural gas reserves, Abe oversaw on Friday the signing of deals worth over $18 billion, mainly in the chemicals sector and power station construction.
