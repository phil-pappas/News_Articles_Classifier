We must look at why NZ have been such a dominant force in Rugby for the last 8 years:\nNational Pride\nEverything in NZ Rugby revolves around the National team, not the franchises. If it is in the National interest to rest a star player, that player is rested while in SA that player is played to exhaustion for Franchise pride.\nConsistency in coaching staff\nIn 2007 NZ lost to France in a shock result. Rather than fire the coach, they retained him and he could build on what he started. Then in 2011 when he retired, they kept faith in his coaching team and Hansen was appointed to continue building a legendary team. SA seams hell bent on sacking every coach no matter their accomplishments. Look at Mallet and White. Even Snorre had the Boks going somewhere, but he suffered from \"foot in mouth\" and was canned.\nBest available support staff.\nNZ have world leaders available, while when HM was appointed he struggled to get the best talent in SA to support him as the Franchises refused to release some of them while other refused themselves. The Bulls were basically the only Franchise willing to \"play ball\" and release talent, but some of those people were in all honesty not the best in the country and not the first choice candidates.\nI did not agree with everything HM did (I don't think anybody did), but he did show in the games vs AU and NZ in the championship where he wanted to take the Boks.\nWith the old heads gone now we can move forward with the young guns and build for 2019 and beyond. Our new locks are word class, the midfield is solid and combine well with Lambie/Pollard, we have young scrumhalves, wings and loosies. We have it all. We just need courage to back what has been started and give the players the game time required to become world beaters.\nBack the players and back the coach (whoever it is), get the best support staff to shore up some facets of play (especially scrumming).\nIt is all in the hands of SA Rugby now what they decide, but perhaps it is time they make a brave decision and for once back a coach for another tenure? Or at least give the next coach the FULL SUPPORT of the SA Rugby structures and talent so he doesn't have to do things such as focus on getting the players to acceptable fitness levels in the few short weeks he has them for?\nPS: Just as some Bulls supporters had blind loyalty to HM due to \"blue eyelids\", many people had undue hate for HM due to their \"he is a Bull eyelids\". Let us as supporters also start backing the coach, whether we like him or not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:26:19.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
