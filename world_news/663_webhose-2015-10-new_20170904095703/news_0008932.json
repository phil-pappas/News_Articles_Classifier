Big names this week include Amazon.com (AMZN), McDonald's Corp.(MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.(CMG), and General Motors Co.(GM)\nIt will take some of the biggest names in tech like Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and International Business Machines Corp.(IBM), however, to pull that heavily-weighted sector out above its expected 0.1% growth from a year ago.\nMore than 100 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report this week, with 12 of those Dow components.\nDow 30 components reporting earnings this week\nReport date Company/ticker (FactSet EPS / revenue consensus estimate) Mon., Oct. 19 IBM ($3.31 / $19.64 billion) Tues., Oct. 20 United Technologies Corp.

US:PG (95 cents / $17.39 billion)\nSo far, the season is off to a brisk start with actual earnings growth coming in at 7.5% based on the 58 companies that have already reported, with 71% of companies topping consensus earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThat is in line with the recent earnings season trend where companies reporting near the beginning of the season beat their earnings estimates more often than later-reporting companies, according to Pierre Lapointe, head of global strategy and markets at Pavilion Global Markets, in a recent note. However, that is less surprising when one takes into account that energy and materials companies tend to report later in the calendar.\nTen out of the 15 companies in the financial sector that have reported have topped earnings estimates. By contrast, only six out of the 11 consumer-discretionary companies that have reported beat estimates, seven out of 10 industrials have, and eight out of nine tech companies have delivered better-than-expected quarterly results, according to Thomson Reuters.\nWhen taking into account a blended-earnings rate--actual earnings combined with estimates for companies that have yet to report--that is improved the anticipated-earnings decline for the S&P 500 to 4.6%, compared with a 5.5% decline a little over a week ago, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.\nThe relatively strong start to the season, however, needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as the bulk of energy and materials earnings, the biggest expected drag on S&P 500 earnings growth, won't come out in full force until next week.\nOther notable S&P 500 components reporting this week\nReport date Company/ticker (FactSet EPS / revenue consensus estimate) Mon., Oct. 19 Morgan Stanley US:MS (63 cents / $8.53 billion)Halliburton US:HAL (27 cents / $5.65 billion)Hasbro US:HAS ($1.53 / $1.48 billion) Tues., Oct. 20 Chipotle Mexican Grill US:CMG ($4.62 / $1.22 billion) Yahoo US:YHOO (16 cents / $1.02 billion)Lockheed Martin Corp.
