Even still, the FedEx forecast is a bullish one. The National Retail Federation, for example, predicted that online sales in November and December will rise by between 6 percent and 8 percent over late 2014. \nPlanning for holiday demand can be treacherous for the delivery giants. After being caught off-guard by a late surge in shipping during 2013, they greatly increased their seasonal work forces last year. The heavy spending pulled down earnings at UPS, although FedEx profit rose. \nFedEx and UPS now talk to retailers throughout the year to plan for the spike in holiday shipping. Much of the surge is driven by retailers that promise free shipping even in the last days of the gift-sending season. \n\"We need to make sure that if they are looking at moves like that, they need to understand what our capacity is,\" said FedEx senior vice president Patrick Fitzgerald. \"We do limit some delivery commitment to customers where necessary. That's not very common.\" \nFree-shipping promotions aren't likely to disappear: Nearly half of shoppers surveyed by the retail federation said free shipping is an important factor in their buying. \nFedEx said that the busiest shipping days will be the Monday after Thanksgiving and the first two Mondays in December. \nThe first big test for the delivery companies will come on Monday, Nov. 30, so-called Cyber Monday, when FedEx expects to handle at least 20 million packages or double the daily average during the holiday season. \nFedEx gets a break, however, Fitzgerald said: More online shoppers now get started early, spreading those orders and shipments over the Thanksgiving weekend instead of waiting for Monday.
