A chinese-language spec-sheet has surfaced which shows the alleged specs for the device which, if true, is likely a part of some sort of brand deal. \nThe sheet reveals that the Pepsi P1 is set to come with a 5.5 inch display with a resolution of 1,080×1,920. It’ll be powered by a MediaTek MT6592 processor with 2GB RAM. It’ll come with 16GB of onboard storage, a 13 megapixel rear and 5 megapixel front camera, Android 5.1 and 3,000mAh battery pack, which isn’t actually that bad. \nThe device is expected to be unveiled on October 20 and will sell for about $210 in China. It’s entirely possible that this is some sort of partnership with a Chinese OEM and the use of the “P1” term suggests that it could be Huawei , though it could just be a coincidence and merely mean the first Pepsi smartphone. \nWe’ll know for sure when or if Pepsi unveil their smartphone next week.
