Whether the company's primary objective is exonerating drivers from frivolous claims, protecting every driver by capturing and coaching risk or preventing collisions with 360 degree visibility to risk, SmartDrive's SmartChoice Program offers a product line to meet each fleet's distinct requirements. The newly announced SmartDrive Shield and SmartDrive Defender, in conjunction with SmartDrive Assurance, offer unparalleled flexibility in video-based safety by providing a 'start now, upgrade at any time with existing hardware' program. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140923/148038 \n\"With our SmartDrive SmartChoice Program, we put choice squarely in the hands of our customers, ensuring every fleet now has a better way to protect its drivers with video,\" noted Steve Mitgang, CEO of SmartDrive. \"We understand that a video safety program needs to fit the culture of the individual fleet. With three video-safety product lines and our distinctive open platform, SmartDrive's SmartChoice Program lets fleets decide what they need, how best to deploy video within their operation and when the time is right to scale their investment, by moving up to a more comprehensive solution as their requirements expand.\" \nWith the SmartDrive SmartChoice program, fleets can choose from among three product lines, each with unique capabilities and benefits, as described below: \nSmartDrive Shield --the only true road-facing only camera combined with on-demand video offload and easy-to-use review workflow; SmartDrive Shield is designed for fleets that have owner operators or are not yet ready for integrated coaching, and are focused on capturing every collision, exonerating when not at fault and providing drivers the ability to record issues on the road, such as delivery verification and security incidents \nSmartDrive Defender-- up to two camera configuration offers road-facing and cab views, with automatic video offload, risk scoring and integrated coaching; SmartDrive Defender is designed for fleets that want to protect every driver by identifying high-risk incidents--including speeding, lane departure, hard braking and collisions--and provide proactive coaching to reduce collision frequency, improve safety and reinforce good driving skills \nSmartDrive Assurance-- deployment of up to four cameras enables a 360 degree view of the vehicle and insight to the most frequent causes of collisions--such as U-turns, backing, unintended lane changes, roll-overs and close following--delivering an unprecedented level of coverage and complete visibility to risk; SmartDrive Assurance is designed for fleets focused on maximum protection and prevention of safety and compliance-related incidents \n\"SmartDrive is the only provider that gives fleets the freedom to choose a video safety program on their terms,\" added Mitgang. \"The SmartChoice Program is another example of SmartDrive's proven, market-leading innovation, which has long helped fleets improve safety by identifying and mitigating distracted and drowsy driving. From the development of our open platform designed to accommodate our industry's rapid technology evolution to our integration, three years ago, with leading active safety solutions from partners including Meritor Wabco and the creation of our advanced analytics platform, our leadership track record is clearly unmatched and encapsulated in the commitment we make to customers every day in our SmartDrive Promise.\" \nSmartDrive is the industry's only multi-tiered video-based safety program that identifies unsafe driving with an extensible platform, integrating video, vehicle data, audio and driving data for a unified and comprehensive view of risk. The SmartDrive SmartChoice Program offers unmatched flexibility for fleets with a wide range of priorities, while ensuring that companies' investments in video solutions are protected and can evolve as their operational needs change and technology advances. Fleets that previously felt video safety didn't fit their driver or operational environment now have an option with SmartDrive Shield, a no-coaching, road-facing only solution focused on exonerating drivers in not-at-fault collisions. When ready for an integrated safety program, fleets can easily move to SmartDrive Defender or SmartDrive Assurance, leveraging the same flexible video analytics platform. \n\"With our SmartChoice Program, it's all about letting fleets decide what's best for them, in terms of onboard system integration, how many cameras they incorporate, what type of risk they want to measure, and how or if coaching is part of their operations,\" emphasized Mitgang. \"SmartDrive Shield, Defender and Assurance not only reduce collisions, but also save fleets time and resources, which can then be focused on delivering increased value to their customers through on-time delivery, accuracy and better overall service.\" \nAbout SmartDrive Systems SmartDrive Systems, the recipient of Frost & Sullivan's Customer Value Leadership Award for Video Safety Solutions, gives fleets and drivers unprecedented driving performance insight and analysis, helping save fuel, expenses and lives.
