Jim Drury reports.   \nDfree is designed to reduce the problem of incontinence among the elderly. It was unveiled by Triple W Japan at last week's CEATEC fair, outside Tokyo. SOUNDBITE (Japanese) TRIPLE W INC, SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT, RYOHEI OCHIAI, SAYING: \"This device predicts faecal excretion. The device goes on your stomach and uses ultrasonic waves to monitor your internal organs and sends the data to smartphones to be displayed.\" The firm says letting the device tell users when it's time for a bathroom break will reduce the anxiety of those suffering from incontinence. Dfree fits on the user's underwear, but before it goes on sale next Spring some tweeking is necessary. SOUNDBITE (Japanese) TRIPLE W INC, SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT, RYOHEI OCHIAI, SAYING: \"We are still in the process of looking at whether to use tape or belts to secure the device to the stomach. However, many elderly people are concerned about skin chafing. So we are looking at how to secure the device safely and solidly.\" By 2060, 40 percent of Japanese will be pensioners, so Triple W thinks Dfree has much potential. It also wants to develop a similar system to alert parents to their toddler's future bowel movements, and think it could be useful for toilet training.  //reut.rs/1ZxZOa3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:15:09.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
