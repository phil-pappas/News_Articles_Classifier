And, it appears that even LG is keen on it as the LG G4 Stylus is the second successive phone the brand has launched with it.\n\nThe G4 Stylus has an all plastic back but has a textured design, which gives it a slightly classy look. Though if plastic isn't what you look for in your phone, you wouldn't be impressed by its looks. The rear key and volume rocker give the phone a spotless look and make it an impressive looking device.\n\nOnce you switch on the device, you will be in for a disappointment. The 5.7-inch display packs in a 720pHD display and the results are pretty average. The colours aren't vibrant and when you're spending over Rs 20,000 you expect better display quality.\n\nThe 13-megapixel (MP) camera delivers good quality images and for the selfie brigade, the 8MP front camera will be a big draw.\n\nThe G4 stylus runs on the Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 (1.2GHz quad-core) processor and has surprisingly only 1GB of RAM. But much to our delight - and surprise - the phone doesn't slow down even while multi-tasking despite having less RAM on board.\n\nThe Stylus - the apparent USP - has limited use and comes with only one built-in app to make use of it. You can doodle, make notes but there isn't anything extra, which makes the stylus a clincher on this phone. The battery life of the G4 Stylus is by far its best feature and even under heavy usage the battery lasts for a long time.\n\nPriced at Rs 21,000, it frankly doesn't justify the moolah it demands. Poor display quality, insufficient RAM and a stylus that doesn't do much, the G4 Stylus is a phone that could've been better priced. Still, if a stylus is what you're looking for and don't want to spend too much, this is a decent option to consider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:25:12.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
