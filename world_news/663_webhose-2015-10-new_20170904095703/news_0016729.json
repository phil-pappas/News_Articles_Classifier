Users also now have the option of using Deeper Crawl, a feature that provides ranking results for all website content regardless of its ranking on search engines or for targeted keywords.\nSan Francisco, CA (PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nGinzaMetrics, a SaaS provider of marketing intelligence, has announced a unique all-in-one solution for users needing more granular, location specific data. Using these two features, Local Search and Deeper Crawl, marketers and SEOs get a more well-rounded view of their search performance. GinzaMetrics is the first platform provider to offer local search ranking as part of existing plans and not as an add-on or separately paid feature.\nWith GinzaMetrics Local Search feature, users can view local search performance across unlimited keywords and locations without the data volume restrictions of other solutions. Users can specify multiple instances of a keyword per location using the same root keyword and a list of set locations directly within their GinzaMetrics dashboard.\nDeeper Crawl allows brands to see ranking results for all site content, whether or not it’s currently ranking on search engines or for targeted keywords. GinzaMetrics users will gain deep insights into on-site and page optimization factors. This is especially important for ecommerce and large sites with hundreds of thousands or millions of pages - as non-ranking pages are often missed by analytics tools and optimization recommendations are not delivered to the teams responsible for increasing traffic for this content.\nUtilizing GinzaMetrics Local and Deeper Crawl features within their dashboards, users can see recommendations for improved performance for all content and locations.\nThe Local Search feature is the first in a suite of local tools planned for roll out by GinzaMetrics over the next several months. Coupled with additional upcoming releases, GinzaMetrics will deliver a comprehensive search and content intelligence dashboard that will increase the findability of brands and sites globally.\n“We chose to develop the Local Search feature as an integrated part of our existing platform because we feel it’s important to get local search ranking data as part of the overall marketing intelligence picture that includes competitor insights, keyword data, and content recommendations and not as another standalone tool,” states Ray Grieselhuber, Founder & CEO GinzaMetrics.\nGinzaMetrics’ Local Search feature allows users to track their own content and competitor content grouped by location or by competitor. Local Search is now part of GinzaMetrics’ comprehensive suite of competitor analysis tools which include Competitor Discovery, Audience Insights, Competitor Ranking, and Competitor Insights. Users can now compare local results versus their competitors.\nDeeper Crawl features granular recommendations for users who want complex indexing for large page volumes and need to filter through data quickly. The feature is scalable and customizable based on the user’s current plan, needs, and individual budget.\n“Using both Local Search and Deeper Crawl, marketers and SEOs can get the granular data they need to make decisions about what content is working, where it’s working, and how audiences are finding it online,” notes Erin Robbins O’Brien, COO GinzaMetrics.\nGinzametrics is a multi-national company pioneering the science of findability. Designed to meet the needs of any size organization, GinzaMetrics’ SaaS platform provides marketing intelligence and reporting, while delivering the tactical tools needed to implement strategic recommendations and optimize content. Their software solution delivers daily updates and recommendations that go beyond web presence management to help companies and individuals meet marketing and business goals.
