A customer holds a new iPhone 6. \nUsing scissors, rulers and notebooks have been bugbears for many left-handers. But now it seems even some hi-tech gadgets are not designed with them in mind. \nLeft-handed Apple fans have complained that the newest iPhones – the 6 and the 6s – favour right-handed users. \nThe ‘dock’, an area where owners organise three or four of their most-used apps, sits on the far right when the phone is in landscape mode, infuriating left-handers. Since the iPhone 6s models were launched on Friday, lefties have said the feature makes the pricey phone – costing upwards of R11,000 – difficult to use. \nHowever, this is not a new problem. Complaints have raged since the iPhone 4 model was found to lose signal when held in the left hand. \nAnd now a left-handed user holding the latest phone in their dominant hand has to control the ‘dock’ with their weaker hand. One user complained online: ‘Shouldn’t my iPhone have user settings for us left-handed people? #feelingleftout’, while another added, ‘What if I’m left handed? The new multitasking doesn’t work so well, I should be able to switch it.’ \nApple’s Accessibility menu helps people use their iPhones if they have limited mobility, for example, or need speech-to-text controls. However, there is no way of enabling a left-handed mode. – Daily Mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:25:03.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
