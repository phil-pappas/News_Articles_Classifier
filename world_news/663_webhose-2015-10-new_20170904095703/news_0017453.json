Enters the $250 Billion IT-Dotcom Sphere EdTech.Now to bring global education visionaries under one roof China’s Lenovo Group, the world’s biggest personal computer maker is transforming itself into a major player in mobile technology. Keen to grab a larger slice of the Indian mobile phone market, it has even announced plans to establish a smartphone assembly unit in India, becoming the biggest Chinese company so far to respond to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s campaign to turn the country into a manufacturing powerhouse. “India is one of the most strategic markets. China and Japan have been our strengths, and since China is slowing down, all eyes are on India,” says Rahul Agarwal, the newly appointed India managing director for Lenovo. An MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Rahul is a veteran at Lenovo/IBM and has held several leadership positions within Lenovo. In a recent interaction, he talks to Sudhir Chowdhary about his plans for leading the brand to its next phase of growth, diversifying in smart connected devices while maintaining a strong PC and server focus. Excerpts:\nLenovo is rapidly transforming from a pure PC vendor to PC Plus company. Give us a sense of the big story emerging out of Lenovo.\nTransformation has several layers to it. The new branding, to some extent, is the skin of the change that we are trying to make, however, what’s more important is what is beneath that. At some level, branding means change of the logo, colour, brand personality as it appears, but today, you can’t be selling the same product for decades, sustainability is extremely essential.\nMarket sentiments keep oscillating—PCs are declining, smartphones are going up, tablets keeps fluctuating, nobody knows which way the trend is headed. The whole business model is transforming. Two to three years ago, we had 85-90% of PC market but today, we are only 64% and still the No. 1 player. Our market share is 64% in PCs, about 25% in smartphones and 10% in servers which implies we are keeping pace with the market. Our focus is being a hardware company, whether it’s the device or infrastructure, data centres or storage. So if a customer wants to buy phones, tablets, PCs, laptops, server, storage, workstation, we have it all. So that’s the second level of transformation.\nThird would be more behaviour-related, the way consumers are evaluating the brands, especially on social media. On social media, even the smallest voice is loud. We are becoming far more customer-centric and alert, if somebody has a problem, how can we reach out to them the quickest. We have observed that the younger generation is becoming more relevant for the category. We are looking at ways to appear younger and more contemporary.\nAs the new MD, what will be high on your agenda?\nAs the MD, I tell myself that I shouldn’t over analyse. To a large extent, the agenda of a CEO has an element of something which is not variable: which is growth and market share. This never changes, but what is different sometimes is the style and the priorities. While our market share is around 20% in India, which is same globally, we are still not No. 1. Hence, accelerated growth and gaining the top slot is my foremost priority.\nNext, is the SMB space, where we believe that our market share is lower than what it should be, how can we really advance because our growth there is No. 2 on my list. Parallel to this is driving an informal culture in the organisation, this is something that is very close to my heart. A culture where everyone feels free to challenge their managers and not just agree with the majority.\nHow is Lenovo performing in India? How does the senior management view the Indian market?\nUndoubtedly, India is one of the most strategic markets. China and Japan have been our strengths, and since China is slowing down, all eyes are on India. Hence, I feel the added pressure to make sure that we are No. 1 here. Currently, our growth is much more stable than any other BRIC country, our export dependence is low so if the world is looking at a possible recession, we will get affected the least. In light of the macro-economic factors and potential size, there is a degree of optimism that the government is still able to maintain. India is certainly looking quite attractive to us.\nAre you satisfied with the growth trajectory in India?\nWe have done well, but in the corporate world, one is never satisfied. Last year we gained 3-4% market share and became a much stronger brand. Today, in the youth segment we are No. 2 on consideration. Our premium products are selling very well which means people look at Lenovo as an organisation that can offer innovative, high-end products.\nWhat initiatives is Lenovo putting in place to gain customer traction in India?\nIf you look at consumer retail, we have more than 1,000 exclusive outlets and we are present in more than 500 cities. We want to take a leaf from what we did in China, that is, Lenovo’s rural presence, which we want to keep expanding. Secondly, we want to take a larger role in the category choice. For people who have never bought a PC, we would like to educate them through drives and campaigns as to why they should buy a PC and not a tablet or some other device.\nOur growth has been spectacular in the smartphone segment. Both Lenovo and Motorola have products that cover the entire spectrum, from premium to mid-range and entry-level products.\nThere are numerous mobile brands present in the market. What is the technology differentiator that Lenovo brings to the table?\nThe answer lies in model to model specification. At a broad level, our value is reliable products. The kind of after-sales support that people look for, we clearly fare much better than the rest. Many of our models have stood out in built quality and battery. Phones today are sold, not due to breakthrough technologies, but because of minor innovations.\nDo you keep a market like India in mind while designing an entry-level device?\nAbsolutely. In fact, not just India, but all the emerging countries. Many of our entry-level products are there because India asked for it and then other countries joined the bandwagon.\n 05, 2015 12:13 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:52:48.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
