(NYSE: QTM ) today announced that Ovation Data Services Inc. (OvationData), a leading provider of data management solutions specializing in the oil and gas market, is building its new private cloud storage-as-a-service offering on the Quantum StorNext ® scale-out storage platform. As a result, OvationData will be able to provide an end-to-end data management solution that delivers high-performance storage, shared access and the scale its customers need to maximize the value of their data. [Tweet this: OvationData chooses @QuantumCorp tiered storage platform for its storage-as-a-service offering http://qntm.co/1Rb62Xd #bigdata] \nExtracting Value From Old and New Data \nOvationData helps organizations preserve their data -- which may be recorded on everything from paper and tape to hard disk drives -- and extract actionable insights from that data by converting it into a format for ready access and analysis. Recently, the company decided that it wanted to do more for its customers: enable them to store their data in a more cost-effective, turnkey manner that wouldn't require additional help from in-house IT personnel. It then selected Quantum to provide the storage infrastructure and expertise to launch a private cloud, storage-as-a-service offering.\nEnabling Cost-Effective Data Preservation and Ready Access \nOvationData chose to build its new cloud service on Quantum's StorNext scale-out storage platform, using a multitier architecture featuring a combination of StorNext QXS high-speed disk, next-generation Lattus™ Object Storage and StorNext AEL tape archive. By leveraging the data management features of StorNext -- including its automated, policy-driven tiering software -- OvationData can apply the right storage technology at the right time. Archiving data on disk, object storage or tape will allow OvationData's customers to control costs and scale to meet data growth demands:\nStorNext QXS disk storage delivers the high bandwidth and low latency often needed to support seismic analysis on extremely large datasets. StorNext's automated tiering capabilities accelerate the process of moving data into and out of archive storage. Customers can also perform this task manually through StorNext's APIs, which allow for rapid data retrieval, even if the data is stored offline. Lattus Object Storage enables users to extend online storage with a massively scalable online tier and spread data across different geographic locations to protect it in the event of a disaster. The Extended Data Life Management (EDLM) feature of the StorNext AEL system economically preserves data integrity for long-term data retention. Supporting Quotes \nGregory G. Servos, President and CEO, OvationData \n\"The Quantum StorNext platform gives us the extreme scale needed to accommodate our customers' ever-increasing data growth. We will now be able to preserve data and enable customers to derive new value from that data -- no matter how large their capacity needs become.\"\nGeoff Stedman , Senior Vice President, StorNext Solutions, Quantum \n\"OvationData's private cloud offering demonstrates the value a multitier storage architecture can deliver, particularly where historic data continues to generate long-term strategic value. It also shows that companies don't need to compromise affordability for data access.\"\nAdditional Resources \nRead the OvationData case study: www.quantum.com/customerstories/ovationdata/index.aspx Learn more about StorNext 5 scale-out storage: www.quantum.com/stornext About Quantum \nQuantum is a leading expert in scale-out storage, archive and data protection, providing solutions for capturing, sharing and preserving digital assets over the entire data lifecycle.
