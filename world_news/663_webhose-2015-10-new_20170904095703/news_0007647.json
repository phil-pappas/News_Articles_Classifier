The Australian Industry Group recently found that 86 per cent of business leaders believe innovation to be crucial for economic advantage, and that innovation was directly linked with employees who had Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills.\nHowever finding employees who have these skills is one of the biggest recruitment headaches for Australian companies, and the rate of students completing STEM courses is actually falling instead of rising.\nSo what are we doing to fix it?\nChristopher Pyne, the new Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science has already announced one large step in the right direction.\nOne of Mr Pyne’s final acts as Minister for Education and Training on Friday was to announce significant changes to the national curriculum that will see school students learn coding, programming and technical skills from an early age.\nThese changes will be crucial for giving the next generation of Australians the skills they need to succeed in the workforce of the future which will be waiting for them after school.\nIn the coming decades, coding and programming knowledge will become just as important as learning to read and write in terms of life skills.\nTeaching coding to young children also has broader benefits. It can help them to develop strong problem-solving skills, learn to collaborate with each other and navigate technology with confidence.\nIn recent years, not-for-profit organisations like Code Club have been trying to bridge the gap in the curriculum by teaching coding skills to students in after-school classes.\nPowered by the Telstra Foundation, the Code Club program is already running in more than 200 schools across the country with teachers and volunteers showing students the basics of coding all the way up to more advanced programming languages like Python.\nHowever one of the most common pieces of feedback Code Club hears from teachers is that while they would love to teach coding skills to their students, they often don’t know where to start.\nTeachers themselves need to be taught strong coding and programming skills in order to pass them onto their students. This will be one of the biggest challenges facing the implementation of the new digital technologies curriculum.\nAustralian educators need help not only to embrace technological creativity like Ahmed’s clock, but also how to demonstrate and teach the skills required to fulfil it.\nAs Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg put it: “Having the skill and ambition to build something cool should lead to applause, not arrest. The future belongs to people like Ahmed.”\nWe need to encourage both teachers and students to embrace STEM skills to ensure Australia remains creative, innovative and economically competitive in the future.\nThe first step is the adoption of the digital technologies curriculum. The next step could be introducing a “build your own clock” day.\nDan Siepen is the Director of Growth and Product Strategy at Titan Vine, and a volunteer with the Code Club Australia program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:41:30.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
