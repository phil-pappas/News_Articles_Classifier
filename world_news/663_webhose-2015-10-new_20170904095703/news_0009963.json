Air India will offer free return tickets under the “Web Loyalty Bonus” scheme to be launched from October 15 to December 31, 2015. The offer will be available exclusively for bookings made on Air India and Alliance Air domestic flights, through the airline’s website www.airindia.in. Bookings made in both Business and Economy Class will be eligible for free tickets on the domestic network of Air India and Alliance Air.\nUnder the scheme, a passenger buying tickets for travel in Business Class on six sectors (eg.
