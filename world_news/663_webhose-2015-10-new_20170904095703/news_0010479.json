Sides said that this figure might be a little lower than some analysts expected, but it reflects the way customers shift between online and brick-and-mortar shopping. Many shoppers, for example, are taking advantage of “buy online, pick up in store” options, while plenty of others are researching a purchase online but actually buy it later in the store.\n“We’re finding that those lines are blurring, and I think this is just now retail business as normal,” Sides said.\nSo while the digital channel continues to be of critical importance to retailers, the number of shoppers actually closing the deal online might not be growing as rapidly as expected.\nIn recent years, the holiday season has featured a seemingly endless parade of profit-eating promotions. But as the economy has become less gloomy, some retailers have tried to put the brakes on such offers this year. Sides predicts, however, that promotions will be as plentiful as ever this year, and will probably start early.\n“We learned our lesson a couple of years ago, in that we had some really bad weather just before the holidays,” Sides said. “So I think that’s also what pushed folks to driving promotions earlier in the cycle.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:21:57.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
