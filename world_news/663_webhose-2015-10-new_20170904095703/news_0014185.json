Fifty have ratified it so far, out of 161 current WTO members.\nThe report used two main models for estimating the gains from the agreement: a \"computable general equilibrium\" (CGE) simulation - which makes assumptions about \"what if\" certain barriers are removed - and a \"gravity model\", based on historical evidence of removal of trade barriers.\nThe CGE model predicts exports will rise by at least $750 billion to well over $1 trillion per year, adding 0.34 to 0.54 percentage points to annual global economic growth, it said.\nGravity model estimates put the annual export gains at $1.1 trillion to $3.6 trillion, the report said. It did not estimate the impact on GDP under the gravity model.
