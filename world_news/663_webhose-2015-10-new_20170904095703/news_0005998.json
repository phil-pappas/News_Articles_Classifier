Compact 7- and 8-inch models, as well as full-size 9- and 10-inchers, are, with few exceptions, all leaning in the same direction. Playing music and digital videos is the order of the day with today’s mainstream tablets, and most models are priced to match those basic expectations. \nWith most gaming on Android tablets dominated by casual titles, Android tablet makers haven’t seen fit to outfit their tabs with the extra oomph it takes to become graphics standouts. Only a few, notably Nvidia’s Shield Tablet (based on its own Tegra silicon), are strong gaming devices. Just like mainstream Windows tablets and 2-in-1 convertibles, most Android tablets are designed for sending and receiving e-mail, browsing the Web, interacting with social-media sites, and perhaps listening to music on headphones—you get the idea. \nTwo recent mainstream tablets that fit that description are Lenovo’s $249.99-list Tab 2 A8 , a compact model we reviewed a few weeks before this review, as well as the next model up, the Tab 2 A10-70, a full-size version of that tablet (and the topic of this review). Much like the Tab 2 A8, which was outfitted with an above-average Dolby-enhanced sound system and speakers, as well as a good-looking screen, the Tab 2 A10 comes with similar accoutrements, both improvements over last year’s Tab A10. In the case of the Tab 2 A10, the audio is the most notable upgrade, with significantly upgraded speakers—a design approaching a miniature sound bar, if you will—that surprised us in a budget tablet. This Lenovo Tab also comes with a better, higher-resolution (1,920×1,200-pixel) screen, which we’ll discuss in the some detail later on. \nThe Tab 2 A10 comes in three possible configurations, available when we wrote this in mid-September 2015 direct from Lenovo. Two of them cost $249.99 list, with direct pricing varying a little day to day. Our tested review unit is one of these, the Tab 2 model A10-70-ZA 9US. It comes in a duotone of dark blue (back) and black (front bezel), and it’s outfitted with 16GB of internal flash storage and a MediaTek ARM CPU. After that comes the $249.99-list Tab 2 A10-70-ZA000038US. It’s identical to our blue review model, except that it’s in white on both sides. \nA step up from those two units is the $279.99-list Tab 2 A10-70-ZA000086US, which is also blue-backed and very similar to our review unit, except that it has 32GB of internal storage, instead of the 16GB of the other two. Furthermore, at the time of this writing, all three models were on sale, with the two 16GB models at $50 off ($199.99), and the 32GB tablet at $60 off ($219.99), all sold straight from Lenovo’s online store. Lenovo’s direct pricing tends to fluctuate often; your mileage may vary when you check. \nAs we pointed out in our review of the Tab 2 A8 a couple of weeks before this review, most full-size tablets these days are, in terms of design and performance, premium models (Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and its new Galaxy Tab S2 counterpart, as well as Dell’s Venue 10 7000 , all around $500, come to mind). Hence, when we see a relatively inexpensive full-size model like this one come around, we sit up and take notice. So it was especially refreshing that, for the most part, we found little to quibble about in its design or execution. \n  Computer Shopper \n 43  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:54:35.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
