You can get it for R1 099 prepaid or for R89 per month on a uChoose Flexi 55 contract. Prepaid customers will receive an additional 100MB data x 6 months. This data will be automatically allocated from October 15. \nThe second smartphone on offer is the Vodacom Smart Speed, a 4.5-inch device with a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels and also running Android 5.1 Lollipop. It’s got a 5MP rear camera and you’ll be able to share your pics faster than with almost any other phone in this price bracket because it’ll connect to Vodacom’s high-speed LTE network. \nSpeaking of price, the Smart Speed will set you back just R1 299 or R99 per month on a uChoose Flexi 55 contract. Prepaid customers will receive an additional 500MB data x 3 months. \nIf you’re feeling a bit more flush, you should take a look at the Vodacom Smart Ultra 6. Clearly aimed at the mid range market, it runs Android 5.1, sports a 5.5-inch HD display with a 13MP rear facing camera and a 5MP front-facing “selfie” snapper. \nThe Smart Ultra costs R3 199 on prepaid or R199 per month on a uChoose Flexi 110 contract. Prepaid customers will get an additional 500MB data x 3 months. \nThen there’s Vodacom’s new tablet, the Power Tab. It’s not the first own-brand tablet the company has sold, but it’s their first 10.1-inch slate. Like the new smartphones, it runs Android 5.1. The tablet also features 10 point multi-touch and will retail for R1 799 or R99 per month on the 250MB Data Price contract plan. Prepaid customers will receive an additional 200MB data x 6 months. As with the other data bundles, it will be automatically allocated from October 15. \nBarnwell showed off all four devices briefly at a media conference in Durban recently and my initial impressions are very favourable. They look and feel well made and if their performance lives up to their specification sheets, they’ll be excellent value for money. \nWatch this space for an in depth review once I have had a chance to properly test them out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:14:41.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
