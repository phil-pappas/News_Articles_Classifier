Analytica Limited, the company behind the new PeriCoach® System – a pelvic floor muscle training device + smart phone app – hopes to change that. Their new campaign called #kegelface encourages women to post their \"Kegel faces\" on social media to demonstrate they are taking back control of their pelvic floors through regular and smart Kegel exercises. \nKegels are pelvic floor muscle training exercises and considered first line treatment for urinary incontinence (UI). About one in three women will experience UI at some point in their lives, typically after childbirth and around menopause. \n\"We know that pelvic floor muscle training is very effective for reducing or eliminating urine leakage, but like any exercise program, women have to be inspired to take that first step and start a daily regimen of exercise to see results,\" said Leslie M. Rickey , MD, Departments of Urology and Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine. \"As physicians, we struggle with ensuring patient engagement with their pelvic floor health once they leave the office. #kegelface is a way for women to stay connected with these important exercises and also unites the millions suffering from bladder control issues.\" \nCleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration and available by prescription, PeriCoach, made by Australian company, Analytica, is designed to take the frustration out of a regular program of pelvic muscle floor training. PeriCoach provides real-time feedback that is beamed to a smartphone so women and their clinicians can track progress. \nAs part of #kegelface, PeriCoach will donate to the National Association for Continence and Voices for PFD (Pelvic Floor Disorders), part of the American Urogynecological Society (AUGS). \n\"It's exciting to be part of a campaign designed to help empower women to manage the health of their pelvic floor,\" said Steven G Gregg, Ph.D., Executive Director of the National Association For Continence. \"Many women want to take control of their health and performing Kegel exercises properly is certainly one way in which they can make a difference.\" \n\"AUGS is pleased be a partner in #kegelface. It is a fun way to raise awareness and get women reengaged in this important exercise that if done right can make a difference,\" said Michelle Zinnert , Executive Director, Voices for PFD. \nIn appreciation of participation, the company will offer women who post their \"Kegelface\" to their Instagram, Facebook or Twitter accounts along with hashtag #kegelface a discount code for purchase of the PeriCoach. A downloadable Rx form for signature by a clinician is available from www.pericoach.com . \nThe #Kegelface campaign follows \"Leakers Anonymous,\" an internet campaign PeriCoach introduced earlier this summer and viewed by hundreds of thousands around the world.
