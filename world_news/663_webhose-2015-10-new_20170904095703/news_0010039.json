The deployment is Paratus' first offering of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networking for connectivity services in Windhoek, Namibia's capital city. The Infinera TM-Series enables Paratus to deliver multi-service transport services with low power, high density and bandwidth scalability. This increase in bandwidth is expected to bring better access to information for businesses and consumers alike. According to TeleGeography, bandwidth growth in Africa has grown 51 percent compounded annually over the last five years, faster than any other continent. \nParatus Telecom is a leading telecommunications operator in Namibia and offers services under its fully comprehensive telecommunications service license. With its acquisition of a local voice company in 2014, Paratus Telecom has experienced immense growth in converged data traffic requiring next-generation network technology built on an advanced fiber-optic infrastructure. \nThe Infinera TM-Series packet-optical platform provides multi-service capabilities including MEF 2.0 certified Ethernet services, multi-protocol label switching -- transport profile (MPLS-TP) and Optical Transport Network (OTN) aggregation engineered for enterprise services, mobile fronthaul and metro aggregation applications. The Infinera TM-Series provides Paratus with an optimized 10 gigabit per second (Gb/s) transport solution upgradeable to 100 Gb/s. Infinera worked with local partner Adcomtec on Paratus' network upgrade, collaborating to supply the network solution and ongoing maintenance services. \n\"The Infinera TM-Series packet-optical network solution effectively addresses our bandwidth requirements to keep up with the rapid growth in converged network services,\" said Samantha Geyser, Executive of Planning. \"Built with the operator in mind, the TM-Series increases bandwidth, flexibility and functionality of our new metro WDM transport network. This allows Paratus to take advantage of cost efficient Ethernet services, ultra-low latency and low power consumption.\" \n\"Infinera is pleased to provide Paratus a scalable packet-optical solution that supports a wide range of applications,\" said Nick Walden, senior vice president, EMEA sales at Infinera. \"The Infinera TM-Series enables Paratus to deploy multi-service transport services to its customers with speed and bandwidth scalability.\" \nFor more information about the Infinera TM-Series, visit www.infinera.com . \nAbout Infinera Infinera (NASDAQ: INFN) provides Intelligent Transport Networks, enabling carriers, cloud operators, governments and enterprises to scale network bandwidth, accelerate service innovation and simplify optical network operations.
