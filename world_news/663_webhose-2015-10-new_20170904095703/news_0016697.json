We are pleased the robust body of evidence in support of this technology continues to grow as seen by the depth and breadth of data being presented this year at ASRM by our partner clinics,” said Gina Bartasi, Chief Executive Officer. “Our company is dedicated to helping patients achieve the best possible outcomes and advancing the IVF field through innovative and proprietary clinical solutions.” A total of twelve presentations from Eeva partner clinics will be presented throughout the conference. The Eeva™ Test is the first and only FDA cleared non-invasive prognostic test to aid in embryo selection. The proprietary, automated Eeva Test helps IVF clinicians optimize their treatment for patients undergoing IVF procedures. Progyny received a CE mark for the Eeva™ Test in July 2012 and FDA clearance in June 2014. For more information on the Eeva Test and Progyny, visit booth #706 at ASRM.
