RMX-1000 FOR IPAD IN DETAIL A host of high-quality FX for limitless creativity The four FX areas mirror the layout of the original RMX-1000, for intuitive, tactile control. Scene FX Build up and break down tracks by combining ten types of FX – and manipulate the wet/dry, time and resonance parameters for even more character. Isolator FX Alter the rhythm and timbre of the music by adjusting the Hi/Mid/Low frequencies, and add three types of FX: Cut/Add, Trans/Roll and Gate/Drive. X-PAD FX Trigger pre-assigned samples in time with the BPM and use the X-PAD to repeat samples at different speeds. Kick, Snare, Clap and Hi-hat are pre-assigned, or producers can customise using other on-board samples. Release FX Elegantly exit complex FX combinations and return to the original track using Back Spin, Vinyl Brake and Echo – or return to the music instantly. PLUS – the parameters of many of the FX can be customised so producers can create unique sounds and experiment with their own style. 2. Supports Audiobus and Inter-App Audio to become a full-blown music production tool The RMX-1000 for iPad can be linked to the Audiobus app and Inter-App Audio, which provides one interface for producers to create and record music using DAW, FX and instrument apps.
