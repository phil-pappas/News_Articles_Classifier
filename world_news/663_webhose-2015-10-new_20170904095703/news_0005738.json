However, Gartner pointed out that such devices were not widely available across the Emea region in the quarter. \nThe decline could also be a result of Microsoft's decision to make the operating system available as a free download. From a hardware perspective, existing PCs should be able to run the new operating system, so IT departments may not see the need to upgrade PC hardware. \nThe popularity of tablet devices could also be behind the fall in sales. From a desktop IT perspective, the humble PC is just one of many devices people use in business to access corporate systems. \nThe availability of Android and iOS versions of Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync and Office 365 means people generally do not require a Windows laptop for basic office productivity tools. Furtermore, software-as-a-service applications such as Salesforce, Concur and Workday are also multi-platform, which means people no longer run them solely on Windows. \nBut, while tablets have shrunk the PC market, Atwal said he believes those users in business still using PCs are the people who really need them and PCs are still the core device in business. \nHe added that he expects PC makers will release a range of thin and light devices over the coming months. \nAt the same time, as more applications migrate to the cloud, less desktop software needs to be managed by the IT department. \"Instead of managing 100% of applications, over time that is going down from 100% to 90 or 80%,\" said Atwal. This could help prolong the life of Windows-based PCs in business.
