(Photo: AT&T)\n13 CONNECT 25 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEW YORK— AT&T is teaming up with Uber on a promotion targeted at college football fans. It's all part of AT&T’s push to take “TV Everywhere.”\nUber riders in four major college football markets will be able to watch live games from the backseat while en route to their final destination.\nThe promotion kicks off for one day this Saturday in Detroit and Nashville, followed by Houston on Oct. 24, and Atlanta on Nov. 14, also one day affairs.\nThese aren’t regular Uber vehicles or, for that matter, regular Uber drivers, since the person at the wheel will be hired by AT&T.\nThe carrier has equipped 10 GM Tahoes with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and four tablets capable of streaming football via the AT&T U-verse app. Two wireless headphones will also be in the vehicles, which are plastered with AT&T and Uber branding.\n“We’re showcasing how AT&T is putting TV Everywhere with the strength of our 4G LTE network and future of connected cars,” says Ryan Luckey, AT&T’s assistant vice president of corporate sponsorships. Adds Amy Friedlander Hoffman, the head of experiential marketing at Uber, \"We're thrilled to offer this one-of-a-kind experience with AT&T. Now on game day, football fans can easily stay connected to the action in their Ubers while they are on the go.\"\nFans in the select markets can request an “UberCONNECT powered by AT&T” vehicle when they arrange a pickup through the regular Uber app but it’ll be the luck of the draw whether they actually get to ride in one—there are only 10 such vehicles on the road. There is no extra cost above the regular fare to ride in the car.\nRiders will be able to choose the game or games that they want to watch, assuming, of course, that more than one game is on. And how much of the action they'll actually get to see depends of course on the length of the trip.\nAs an added element of surprise, one vehicle in each market will feature a former football star who will ride along with the passenger: Herman Moore in Detroit, Frank Wycheck in Nashville, Jerome Bettis and Dat Nguyen in Houston and an as yet unnamed player in Atlanta. Such cars will have GoPro cameras so the moment that the passenger gets in the car can be captured.\nIn many ways this is an experiment for AT&T and for Uber.\n“We’ve focused on areas of high traffic to accommodate as many people as possible,” Luckey says. “We wish we could put more in each market. If we succeed here, we might do that for future events.”\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter.\n13 CONNECT 25 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1LxHd7X TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1LxHd7X", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LxHd7X&text=Ride%20an%20Uber.%20Watch%20college%20football.&via=usatoday", "http://twitter.com/edbaig", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LxHd7X&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b3116f2580309e2ddc46802b146028c2c275de8/c=156-0-868-535&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805901663965826-AT-T-College-Football-Everywhere---Outside.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1719cd16af333fd6e0af57e4546ada413acd242/r=500x261/local/-/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805901663965826-AT-T-College-Football-Everywhere---Outside.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805901663965826-AT-T-College-Football-Everywhere---Outside.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:12:53.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
