Supplied Mini or compact versions of top of the line phones are a bit of a niche these days. Samsung always stick theirs with inferior specs to their \"normal sized\" Galaxy S flagships. Sony's mobile boss for Oceania, John Featherstone, told me sales of his Japanese employer's last smaller handset, the Z3 Compact, \"compared favourably\" to those of its bigger brothers, particularly in Asia. Huge phablets sell extremely well there too, so it seems many of my small-handed Asian brethren are happy to use both hands for a lot of their phone duties.\nFor those who prefer doing as many phone tasks as possible without having to go through the enormous effort of lifting a second arm, the Z5 Compact is a very decent choice, though probably only for Android fans. I actually find the iPhone 6 as easy to wrap my hand around because despite being about a centimetre longer than the Sony, at 6.9mm it's noticeably thinner.\nAt a chunky 8.6mm, the Z5 compact is actually thicker than the new Microsoft Surface Pro 4, a 12-inch tablet with an Intel Core i7 PC processor. Sliding it into a pants' pocket is easy, though its girth and hard edges means it bulges out a little more than a larger but thinner handset with soft edges like the iPhone 6.\nThe Z5 Compact's shortness, however, definitely makes it easier to stab at the top of the screen. A lot happens at the north pole of a smartphone. It's where you go on the homescreen for notifications and shortcuts such as your torch, and where major Android apps such as Gmail, Messaging, Twitter and Facebook put some, if not all of their controls in a bar at the top.\n Not an iPhone problem It's worth nothing this isn't a significant problem for iPhone 6 users, because the same apps in iOS often cleverly position controls at the bottom, Apple's flagship is also shorter than most Androids and double tapping the home button cleverly drops the top half of the screen within thumb reach. But if you're an Android fan who prizes using a premium phone one handed, the Z5 Compact is the only contender.\nThe camera is the same snapper as the bigger Xperia Z5 and Z5 Premium, and while we think the 23 megapixels is an overkill move that just eats up memory, the Z5 Compact's image quality is quite decent. Sony trumpets tech normally found in fancier dedicated cameras, such as a \"back illuminated sensor\" and \"contrast and phase detect\" autofocus, but in real life the photos and autofocus speed seemed on par with an iPhone 6, though that certainly isn't a bad thing.\nThe camera itself takes a few seconds to load, however, which can mean missing a few spontaneous moments. Other apps such as Facebook can also take a few seconds to load, and while it's smooth sailing once they're running in the background, you can't help but wonder if the Compact has been a little short changed because Sony has given it less RAM and processor power than the larger Z5.\nSpeaking of what's under the bonnet, we were pretty happy with the Z5 Compact's battery life, which safely got us through a full day and night, except when we hit it particularly hard, such as leaning on the GPS to get us back from a South Coast trip.\nIf \"pretty happy\" sounds like faint praise, keep in mind the iPhone 6 generally needs a mid-afternoon top-up to survive till bedtime. A bit like a frustrated basketball player in the office who didn't quite make the big time because of his small hands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:27:29.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
