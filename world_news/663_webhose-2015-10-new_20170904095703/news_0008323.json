When they get excited through light they re-release light, \" according to Green. He says the signs and firefighter bands are recharged throughout the day with natural light and \"We're seeing afterglow of up to 80 hours on some of our materials from just a couple seconds of light.\" \nThere are three types of luminescence: Chemical (the \"glow in the dark\" necklaces) Photo Bio (fireflies and fish) \nGreen says more than 60,000 firefighters in 25 countries are using his products. \nWyoming Fire Chief Steve Owens is singing the praises of the photoluminescence bands. \"It not only helps us see tools and see each other, it can actually illuminate a small area where we can look under beds, look in closets and have a little illumination while we do that.\" \nThe technology is even lighting up steps at sports stadiums. The latest one is The Bank of Kentucky Center. \nThis story originally aired March 9, 2015.
