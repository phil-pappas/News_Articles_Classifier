The Quarterly IoT Buyers' Index from the IoT M2M Council, which counts over 12,000 OEMs, enterprise users, and apps developers that deploy the technology as members, shows growth in the number of IoT deployments for the coming year, but an actual decrease in deployments over the next six months. The survey asked executives to outline their buying plans in 6-month intervals, and compares the relative results with previous quarters. \"We see an increase of 11.6% in the percentage of IoT Adopters looking to start projects in the next 12 months, but a small decrease of around 4% in those looking to do so in the next six months,\" said Alex Brisbourne , Chairman of the IMC and CEO of KORE Wireless, a managed connectivity provider for the IoT, \"This could be due to the inconsistent economic picture globally, but time will tell.\" \nThe survey does show strong growth in the number of larger IoT deployments (over 1,000 devices) and for those that use long-range wireless connectivity, such as cellular or satellite. The survey also shows that enterprise users appear more bullish in the short term than do OEMs or developers, and the energy sector stands out as the vertical market most ready to start projects now. The next Quarterly IoT Buyers' Index (QIBI) will become available in January of 2016.\n\"We think that the QIBI will establish itself as a unique table of leading indicators in the field of IoT/M2M,\" said Brisbourne. The IMC has been averaging over 300 new members from around the globe weekly, and expects to have registered more than 15,000 IoT Adopters by year's end. The group has established an IoT Content Library that contains over 100 case studies and a Membership Directory that allows for direct communication between IMC members. \nAbout IOT M2M Council \nThe London -based IMC is the largest and fastest-growing trade association dedicated to the global IoT/M2M sector â€“ with over 12,000 members joining since 2014.
