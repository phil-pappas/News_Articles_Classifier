So with this newfangled shaving technology, why do some of the founding team still sport beards? \"We look more manly that way … right?\" they write in the FAQs.\n(You shouldn't shave every place on your body, apparently).\nThis article originally appeared on Newser: Kickstarter's New $4M Darling: The Laser Razor\nMore From Newser Bad News for 1 in 5 Americans: No COLA Next Year", "external_links": ["http://groundswell.org/2-billion-tossed-per-year-whats-the-most-wasteful-bathroom-product/", "http://www.newser.com/story/214256/bad-news-for-1-in-5-americans-no-cola-next-year.html?utm_source=part&utm_medium=foxnews&utm_campaign=rss_tech_rel", "http://www.newser.com/story/151712/we-need-to-stop-shaving-ahem-down-there.html", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skarp/the-skarp-laser-razor-21st-century-shaving/posts/1376323", "http://www.newser.com/story/214284/kickstarters-new-4m-darling-the-laser-razor.html?utm_source=part&utm_medium=foxnews&utm_campaign=rss_tech_syn", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skarp/the-skarp-laser-razor-21st-century-shaving/description", "http://www.businessinsider.com/laser-razor-raises-4-million-on-kickstarter-2015-10"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:47:42.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
