This new system will allow DART customers the flexibility to pay via NFC-enabled smartphones, third party or agency-issued transit cards, or use EMV contactless cards.\n“The partnership with Vix Technology will put our region on the map with some of the most advanced fare collection systems in the world, providing a seamless and more user-friendly experience,” said DART’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Leininger.\nOpen architecture fare collection systems are rapidly becoming a focus in large urban cities with growing public transportation needs due to scalability, ease of integration with other systems already in place, and the opportunity to add surrounding regional transit partners.\nDoug Thomas, General Manager of Vix Americas said, “The introduction of a new contactless fare collection system that maximizes convenience for riders in Dallas is a sign that transit operators are embracing innovative ways to improve customer experience and drive increased ridership.”\nForward-thinking transit agencies like DART recognize that account-based systems are the new standard for modern fare collection as they provide flexibility and ensure future-proof solutions that reduce costs.\nUnlike card-based systems of the past, account-based systems allow riders to use the type of payment that is most convenient for them, including traditional agency-issued transit cards, EMV contactless bank cards, and NFC-enabled smartphone payments such as Apple Pay and Android Pay. This approach expands the available forms of fare payment media and also provides flexibility to implement complex fare policies since fare calculation and settlement occurs in the back office.\nSteve Gallagher, CEO Vix Technology, said, “We couldn’t be happier with the positive feedback and the growing, global customer base that is moving to implement our eO product. The system we are delivering in Dallas will allow DART to spend more resources in developing and improving their transportation network and less time on payment collection and processing. Account-based systems are the way forward and we are excited to be with DART on this project.”\nVix has a strong and proud history of playing an innovative role within the global fare collection market and is at the forefront of implementing the latest transportation technology. Most recently, Vix was awarded a contract by the Malaysian Government’s public transport regulator to unify payments for the country’s multiple transit operators under a single transport ticketing system.\n##\nAbout Vix Technology\nVix Technology is a leading provider and integrator of access management, transit ticketing, payments and account-based solutions for large-scale transit networks in more than 200 regions, including Stockholm, Rome, Seattle, Bangkok and Beijing.
