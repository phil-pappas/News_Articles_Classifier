Said results showed lateral and down dip extensions on several of the mineralized horizons with an updated resource estimates to be completed sometime in 2016.\nThese results included 13.18 grams per tonne gold over 1.80 metres at V6-15-01, 32.15 g/t gold over 1.69 metres at V6-15-05, 22.64 g/t gold over 2.59 metres at V6-15-11 and 11.95 g/t gold over 4.80 metres at V6-15-21.\nCompany President and CEO, Stephen de Jong, commented, “What is especially intriguing about the results announced today is the discovery of previously unknown intrusive units in areas that have seen very limited work apart from Integra's grassroots drill program that focused on geophysical targets. The new gold mineralization, which is spatially associated to those intrusive units, show all the characteristics of other significant intrusive deposits on the property, including quartz veining with tourmaline and sulfides.”\nHe continued, “Thus far, drilling has been very limited on the new discoveries, and using the Triangle Zone as a potential analogue, additional drilling laterally and at depth is required to better understand the significance and impact of these results.”\nThen he went on to explain, “Drill permits are now in place and we will prioritize follow up drilling to fully assess the potential of these new zones which will commence as soon as access is available, likely in January 2016. The discovery of these new Triangle analogues creates yet another series of high priority targets for Integra as it pushes forward with one of the most aggressive exploration campaigns in the mining industry, with over 90,000 meters targeted for this year and more than 100,000 meters of diamond drilling planned for 2016.”\nAnd finally he summed up, “There are currently five diamond drill rigs in operation on the Lamaque South Project and we are planning to increase the number of active rigs as we move into the winter period.”\nIntegra Gold was in the news recently when the Vancouver-based junior miner announced six judges for the Gold Rush Challenge just over a week ago .\nShares are up 5.26% in the wake of this news to $0.30 per share.\nCurrently there are 349.2m outstanding shares with a market cap of $104.8 million.\nFULL DISCLOSURE: Integra Gold is a Stockhouse Publishing client.\nTags: GOLD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:56:32.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
