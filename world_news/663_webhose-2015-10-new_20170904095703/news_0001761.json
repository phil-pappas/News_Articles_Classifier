But military leaders have said the Afghans need more support from the US to fight the Taliban and maintain gains made during the past 14 years.\nClinton, who served as Obama's secretary of state during his first term, said the US wants to bring its troops home and \"we certainly don't want them engaged in on-the-ground combat. We want them to help support and train the Afghan army.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:27:21.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
