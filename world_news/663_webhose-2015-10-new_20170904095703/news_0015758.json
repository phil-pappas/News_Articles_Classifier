It’s a game-changer,” Mr. Petch said.\n“Professor Gandhi’s discovery will mean patients get access to the best treatment for them, first time, every time.\n“It will significantly reduce relapse rates and have a significant impact on how drugs are funded and delivered into the healthcare system.\n“The implications for this country’s health economics are enormous but, most importantly, patients will get access to the best treatments more quickly.\n“If this test can then translate to other medicines and blood cancers, it could open the door to new drugs from overseas by shedding more light on their potential here in Australia.”\nProfessor Gandhi said this type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma was the sixth most common form of cancer, with up to 2000 Australians are diagnosed each year.\n“It can be fast growing and aggressive, so early diagnosis is vital, as is swift treatment,” he said.\n“Fortunately, the majority of cases respond very well to the current first line treatment, which is a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n“However, some patients do not respond, and for these people the prognosis is poor.”\n“The test will allow clinicians like myself to determine which patients are unlikely to respond well to standard treatment, thus avoiding ineffective and unnecessary chemotherapy and prompting consideration of other treatment options.”\nThe Leukaemia Foundation Queensland partly funded the research, which is published in the prestigious Lancet Haematology journal .\nResearchers are seeking a provisional patent for the test and are working with commercial partners to develop the technology further.", "external_links": ["http://www.di.uq.edu.au/professor-maher-gandhi", "http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhae/article/PIIS2352-3026(15)00150-7/fulltext"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:51:03.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
