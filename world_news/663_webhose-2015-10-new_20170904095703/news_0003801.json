He added that assistance from Russia, Malaysia and Japan are in progress. He said three planes were expected to arrive Thursday.\n\"We hope the assistance will accelerate the efforts to put out the forest fires on the peat land, which need very different treatment than regular forest fires,\" he said. \"We need aircraft that are able to carry12 to 15 tons of waters, not only up to three tons.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:06:15.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
