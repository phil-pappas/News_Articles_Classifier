Her new company, Jewelbots, sells programmable friendship bracelets for girls ages 9 to 14. \nOut of the box, each Bluetooth-powered Jewelbot allows its wearer to use a smartphone app to set the bracelet’s flower-shaped charm to buzz when friends are nearby or light up when she gets a new Instagram follower. More-advanced kids can use open-source software to program their bracelets. \n“One thing I kept hearing from Girl Develop It students was that they wished they had even thought of engineering as a field they could get into when they were younger,” said Ms. Chipps, who is 34 but was 12 when she began learning to code. She went on to study computer science at Penn State University. \nMs. Chipps said her bracelets remind her of the reason she got into computers: because she wanted to make friends. As a child, she connected with people via bulletin-board services—pre-Internet servers that featured message boards and games. \nToday, Jewelbots capitalizes on a growing movement to introduce girls to the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields early on. \n“We’ve hosted two hackathons so far, and these 8- and 9-year-old girls really get into it,” said Ms. Chipps. “They’re not intimidated.” \nWhen the Lower East Side-based company launched its Kickstarter campaign in July, it sold 1,600 units in 10 days. Single bracelets cost $59, and a pair go for $89. The campaign generated $166,945, far surpassing its $30,000 goal. An additional $440,000 was garnered through investors. \nMs. Chipps expects manufacturing to begin this year. The first bracelets will be shipped by spring.
