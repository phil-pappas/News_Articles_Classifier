The board has approved the deal.\nJim Hart, CEO of Senn Delaney, which advises companies on how to shape their cultures, said Dorsey was using his shares to essentially ask key employees \"to stay the course with me.\"\nHe cautioned the extra stock would not take the place of Twitter fixing the company's business model, and if the shares decline, the gesture could fall flat.\nThat said, the extra cache of stock should prevent Twitter from having to issue new stock to hand out as options to employees, and thereby prevent the dilution of investors' stockholdings.\nHanold said Dorsey's stake would likely not be distributed among all staff, but rather to employees being wooed elsewhere.\nTwitter said in July that monthly user growth was the slowest since the company went public in 2013.\nSince Dorsey's return the company has unveiled several new initiatives. On Friday it announced that its new 'Moments' feature, which organizes what it considers the day's best tweets about key events, will have its first advertisers this weekend.\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage and Deborah Todd; Editing by Bill Rigby )\nJack Dorsey, interim CEO of Twitter and CEO of Square, goes for a walk on the first day of the annual Allen and Co. media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho July 8, 2015.
