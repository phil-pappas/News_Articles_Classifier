The second addresses a piece of code that caused a phone's processor to work harder than it had to. Quick Clicks Facebook puts its search tool on steroids \nPreviously, if you watched a video on the app and switched to another app to do something else, the audio component of the video sometimes continued to run. \nMusic apps typically work like this, so that you can listen to music in the background while multitasking. But in this case, nothing actually plays. The app just stayed awake, using up power. \n\"Our fixes will solve this audio issue and remove background audio completely,\" Ari Grant, a Facebook mobile engineer, said in a post. \nThe other problem had to do with code that caused the app to continuously ping Facebook's main network. \n\"A CPU spin is like a child in a car asking, 'Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?' with the question not resulting in any progress to reaching the destination,\" Grant explained. \"This repeated processing causes our app to use more battery than intended. The version released [Thursday] has some improvements that should start making this better.\" \nFacebook says it made both changes in response to a bevy of complaints that began shortly after Apple launched iOS 9. \nThe latest mobile operating system features a new \"battery\" setting that tracks how much power apps are using. Many people noticed that Facebook was often the worst offender. \nSome thought the issue was due to location tracking, but Grant said that wasn't the problem at all. \nAlong with the explanations, Grant also apologized for \"any inconvenience this has caused.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:59:50.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
