This blatant attempt is probably to equate the phone makers devices being just as good as any Samsung flagship, after all OnePlus does claim to be a flagship killer. Not entirely malice, the traded Samsung phones will be donated to Hope Phones a non profit organisation that recycles mobile phones and use the funds for medical programs in Africa, Asia and Latin America. \nTrade-in deals are not new, with Samsung themselves offer owners of Apple phones cash upfront as sweeteners to buy their latest Galaxy phones instead. As for OnePlus there is a price difference on the devices, and this promo will only interest those who were disappointed on the smartphone they bought or for those looking at contributing for a good cause. Interested? Log on to OnePlus site fill up some forms and you can be part of this program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:58:34.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
