Alphabet was designed to break apart Google’s holdings into businesses that each focus on different areas of technological advancement. \nSpeaking on behalf of Google, CEO Sundar Pinchai placed a lot of emphasis on mobile. “If you’re looking for info that lives within an app, we’ll surface the result and even give you an install link,” he said. He also cited the upcoming release of YouTube Red, a premium subscription where users can pay $10 per month to use YouTube in the background, offline and without ads. \nLast quarter Alphabet’s new CFO Ruth Porat impressed investors with her promise to become more transparent. Google on that day added $65 billion in market value, the largest one-day increase in the history of any stock market. \nPaid clicks grew 23% and cost per click dropped 11%year over year. Porat said the drop in cost per click is a result of increased views on YouTube, where clicks are less expensive. \nHere’s proof that Alphabet is run by a team of super nerds.
