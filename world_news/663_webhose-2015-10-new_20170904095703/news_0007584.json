Half of the 10 most-valuable U.S. public companies now are tech companies, led by Apple Inc., Alphabet and Microsoft. On their heels are Facebook Inc., which is No. 7 and close in value to General Electric Co., and Amazon.com.\nApple and Alphabet each exceed $400 billion in market value, and Microsoft is just behind them at almost $384 billion. Gains in the five top tech firms account for 15% of the rise in the broad S&P 500 index this month.\nThe tech-stock surge is the latest product of a roaring October stock-market rally that has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a gain of 8.4%, reversing the losses suffered in a late-summer swoon.\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 turned positive for the year.\nMany investors say they are buying into the companies in part because the outlook for risky assets has improved with the adoption of fresh central-bank stimulus in China and expectations the European Central Bank will do the same later this year.\nThe staggering valuations, industry executives say, represent a new belief among investors that a few tech giants are building virtually unassailable franchises that are best positioned to benefit from the growth in the tech sector in coming years.\nThe biggest driver is the rise of the cloud, the shift of a steadily growing proportion of computing operations to online services.\n\"We've hit a psychological tipping point,\" said Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com Inc., a cloud pioneer. \"This is the biggest revolution in computing that we've seen in decades.\"\nMicrosoft on Friday rose 10%, its largest gain since October 2000, after the Redmond, Wash., firm posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings a day earlier. Alphabet, the owner of Internet-search leader Google, gained 7.7% following a quarterly profit that featured big gains in mobile-phone search and tight expense controls. Amazon, the Internet retailer, added 6.2% after posting its second straight quarterly profit on a 23% sales gain.\nOnline advertising leader Google is worth almost $500 billion, software giant Microsoft is worth $382 billion on signs of strength for its online franchise and Amazon has become a retail powerhouse worth $264 billion.\nShares of a fourth Internet juggernaut, Facebook, also rose Friday, taking the company's value above $282 billion.\nAnd Apple remains at the top of the heap of the most valuable companies, with a market capitalization above $660 billion.\nThe upsurge contrasts with some less-rosy signs for tech startups hoping to disrupt the giants, many of whom have recently boasted billion-dollar valuations as private companies.\nSome mutual funds that invest in large private companies have begun marking down their valuations.\nAs of Oct. 16, at least 11 of 49 venture-capital-backed U.S. technology companies with IPOs since the start of 2014 traded below the per-share value where they last raised money as a private company, a recent analysis of stock-sale documents by The Wall Street Journal showed.\nAnd going public is getting harder. Just 14% of IPOs in the U.S. were held by technology companies so far this year, the lowest threshold in more than 20 years, according to deal tracker Dealogic.\nSome investors are beginning to believe that big public companies deserve higher prices, especially those that are delivering solid growth.\n\"I think there is a huge premium, when you are a large-cap player and you can actually show growth,\" said Scott Kupor, a managing partner with venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \"There's just a scarcity of opportunities.\"\nThe winners in the sector all benefit from the growth of the cloud and other aspects of the Internet economy.\nGoogle picks up pennies every time users view Web pages and click on ads.\nAmazon takes its slice when products and services are purchased online.\nMicrosoft grabs dollars when employees work in increasingly connected offices. They've also proven nimble enough to either buy competitors or build compelling new offerings at a breakneck pace while building new billion-dollar businesses.\nMoreover, they've treated Internet computing as a strategic asset, and they have spent billions of dollars building out global networks of data centers designed not only to power their own operations but to help other companies run online businesses.\nOnce widely viewed as an afterthought by Amazon followers, the online retailer's Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business has grown into a multibillion-dollar giant with an annual growth rate of 78%, according to the company's most-recent earnings.\nMicrosoft's competing Azure service grew more than 100% year on year, and the company's combined cloud businesses generated nearly $5.9 billion in revenue during its most-recent quarter and grew at an 8% annual clip.\nScott Raney, a partner at the venture-capital firm Redpoint Ventures, said the latest numbers from Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft suggest that they are building positions that make them increasingly hard to defeat. For one thing, they can buy computers and operate data centers at scales that give them decisive cost advantages over rivals.\nFor another, he said, they are gathering massive volumes of data that can allow them to make product innovations that others also can't match.\nMr. Raney said Facebook and Amazon, for example, can use information about customers to tailor advertising and product offers that are more effective than rival offerings.\n\"All of these companies have a corpus of data that no one can compete with,\" Mr. Raney said.\nRobert McMillan, Alistair Barr and Greg Bensinger contributed to this article.\n 23, 2015 19:49 ET (23:49 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:51:52.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
