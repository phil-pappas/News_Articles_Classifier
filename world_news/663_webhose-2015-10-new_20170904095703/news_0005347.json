(\"Match Group\") announced today that it will be consolidating the roles of Chairman and CEO by the end of 2015 and that the position will be held by Greg Blatt, the current Chairman. Sam Yagan will continue to serve as CEO until that time and is expected to continue to serve as a senior leader of the Company thereafter. \n\"Greg and I have enjoyed a great partnership in a number of different configurations over the last five years,\" said Mr. Yagan. \"Seeking to optimize our leadership structure, we've decided that at this moment in the Company's evolution, it is best that the senior executive function be held by a single person, and that, given Greg's history with IAC and Match Group, he should fill that role. I take great pride in how much our talented team has accomplished over the last five years and look forward to continuing to help Match Group achieve even more success in the future.\" \n\"Sam has made significant contributions to this company since he joined it at the time of the acquisition of OkCupid in 2011,\" said Mr. Blatt. \"We've seen great expansion during that period, see lots of opportunity ahead, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with Sam as Match Group heads into its next chapter as a public company.\" \nAbout Match Group \nMatch Group is the world's leading provider of dating products.
