By BJ Johnston   12, 2015 \nDo you spend a lot of time building dashboards and reports in Excel?. Do they take a lot of time and effort to repeat the same task over and over again? It sounds like you could really benefit from using Power Query. This article will walk you through this Add In for Excel explaining what it is and what it can do for you to free you to concentrate on analyzing and gaining insights form your data. \nIt is part of Microsoft's Business Intelligence (BI) took kit or their Power BI along with Power Pivot, Power View and also Power Map. This powerful Add In can be used to extract, clean, transform and aggregate data from many data sources. It can load the result of the query directly into the Excel worksheet or load it into the Excel Data Model. \nPower Query needs to be downloaded and installed after Excel has been installed on your machine. If you do not see the Power Query Tab then you may have to manually enable the Add In. \nThere are a few restrictions installing it on your PC. You will need Windows Vista or later if you want to use it on a PC and Windows 2008 or later if installing on a server. Be sure to choose the correct version, 32bit or 64bit depending on which version of Excel you are running and finally you will need.NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 and Internet Explorer 9 or later. You will automatically be notified by the Power Query Tab lighting up if an update or a new version is available for you to download. \nPower Query will be available for you if you have one of the following products \nExcel 2013 standalone version Office 2013 Professional Plus Licence for your desktop An office 365 subscription that give you access to the Office 2013 Professional Plus desktop tools. \nIn essence Power Query allows you to connect to a variety of data sources, extract the data really quick and easily. You then can define a series of repeatable steps to clean and filter the data all before it even gets into Excel. \nThese repeatable steps are the 'query' part of Power Query and are carried out in a specific order. These steps are defined in it's own expression language known as 'M'. This language is nothing like Excel formulas, functions or even VBA, but unless you are a programmer (and interested in the coding) you probably will find you do not have to go near the coding or write any code yourself to carry out any activities in Power Query. \nPower Query will probably be the first component part of the BI suite you use as normally the first part of building reports and dashboards is collecting the data, cleansing and aggregating in readiness for analysis. \nBJ Johnston has been an advanced Excel user for 15 years and is the creator of http://www.howtoexcelatexcel.com a site that shares Excel tips and tricks with it's enthusiastic members.
