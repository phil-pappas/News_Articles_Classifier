This version again offers several new features.Bochum, Germany, October 09, 2015 -- The PDF Xpansion SDK enables software developers to embed PDF, PDF/A and XPS functionality in their applications. It offers features to create and edit PDF, PDF/A and XPS documents, to display them or print to paper, and to convert files between these formats. Finally yet importantly, various options for the export to and for the import from other file formats are available. Soft Xpansion has now released version 11 of the PDF Xpansion SDK. This version again offers several new features: It supports Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Thus, apps that have been created on this platform run on any device that uses Windows 10 as operating system. The second new feature is a XMP programming interface (API). Thirdly, the ZUGFeRD API, which had been introduced in PDF Xpansion SDK 10, has been extended by new functionality. The ZUGFeRD format is a standard that makes it possible to use PDF/A-3 files in electronic invoicing and billing processes. Moreover, version 11 supports dynamic forms (XFA format) and comes with a full PDF editor for the PDF viewer. With this editor implemented into software applications, end users may extensively edit page content in their soft Xpansion PDF viewer. Thanks to the PDF Xpansion SDK 11 functionality, end users do not need any additional programs to create, edit and view PDF, PDF/A or XPS files with their Windows desktop programs, server solutions or apps for mobile devices. The prices for the components of the PDF Xpansion SDK 11 are based on lump sum fees that grant a permanent license. Prices neither depend on the amount of copies of the application, nor on the number of developers. Optionally, PDF Xpansion SDK clients may sign a maintenance contract with a minimum term of one year. This contract entitles the clients to download version updates free and to get extensive product support.
