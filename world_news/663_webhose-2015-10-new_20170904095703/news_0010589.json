That we may – without guilt – decide whose rights we defend and whose we do not.\nThe constitution in South Africa is the envy of the world, enshrined therein is the rights of all people regardless of sexual orientation, ethnicity or faith. Yet the paper is not always reflected by practice.\nStudents we spoke to who are brave enough to be open about their sexuality also open themselves up to harassment and ridicule and report violation against their person or violation of their basic human rights. This puts them even more at risk of physical exposure to HIV and other STI's and deters them – out of fear of repercussion – from asking for sexual health advice because of the external risks i.e. society’s prejudice and ignorance effectively preventing their very existence from being acknowledged.\nPrisoners lose more than their liberty. Prison health is public health, and yet somehow they don’t receive antiretrovirals (ARV's) [the drugs used to suppress the HIV virus] appropriately nor is post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) available to them readily whilst incarcerated. [PEP is an ARV that if administered soon after potential exposure to HIV can dramatically reduce the likelihood of infection.] By denying prisoners the right to access ARV's, they, their families and sexual partners are put at risk upon re-integration back into society.\nUntil organisations start working together and find a holistic approach to tackle issues of gender, sexual orientation, human rights and right to health care violations, there will be an imbalance in the outcome achieved of any project.\nOn World AIDS Day, let’s not forget why we are doing this work since people’s lives depend on our ability to put politics and personal feelings aside and work for the greater good of all those we fight for.", "external_links": ["http://www.vsointernational.org/"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:11:35.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
