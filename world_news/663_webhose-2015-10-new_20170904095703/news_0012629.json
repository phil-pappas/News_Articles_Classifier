It will be exciting to see what innovations emerge in the coming years,\" said Leslie. \n\"The challenge of translating science into effective management remains, as we saw in a number of these cases.\" \nCalifornia's Elkhorn Slough, between Santa Cruz and Monterey, faces many threats but scientists taking part in the EBM effort focused on preventing salt marsh erosion. Honing in on one objective was a key adaptation in this case, the study found. Another was planning the project in an area governed by one organization, rather than several government agencies. \nIn Morro Bay, project leaders integrated two community-based efforts into a more science-driven, multidimensional management effort involving water quality, marine habitats and coastal economies. A problem, the study found, was how to most effectively share local-scale scientific findings with state and federal policymakers. \nIn Palau, a multi-stakeholder EBM coalition sought to mitigate potential erosion from a new 53-mile road around Babeldaob Island. The team realized the need to focus the project geographically and conceptually but faced the challenge of linking science to specific management actions, said Leslie. \nIn the Mexican project focused on the shrimp fishery in the Gulf of California, scientists believed EBM could reduce bycatch of unintended species and resolve conflict between large- and small-scale fishing operations. Mathematical models were utilized to explore management solutions for the overarching government authority to test. As of the end of the study period in 2010, though, the models had not been tested. \nIn the other Mexican project in the northern Gulf, the effort focused on improving sustainability of a diverse fishery of thousands of small-scale fishers pursuing more than 70 species. The team generated scientific data and developed management plans, but struggled to deliver plans to the government in ways that could affect policy. \nIn Fiji, EBM practitioners sought to enhance community-based efforts to sustain the fishery of the more than 300 islands in the archipelago. They first envisioned a national-scale project, but sharpened the focus to two geographically smaller sites. They also adapted the framework to coordinate with existing management efforts. Because local officials could implement policy, the team had better success translating science into action. \nLeila Sievanen, Tara Gancos Crawford, Rebecca Gruby, H. Cristina Villanueva-Aznar and Lisa Campbell co-authored the article. \nLeslie said the study yielded lessons for the management practice in other ocean places. \n\"In the Gulf of Maine, where I live, state and federal governments, working together with stakeholders, have demonstrated a strong commitment to ecosystem-based approaches,\" she said. \nLeslie said she and colleagues in the Gulf of Maine region would have an opportunity to build on this commitment in meetings convened through the Northeast Regional Planning Body as part of the implementation of President Barack Obama's National Ocean Policy.
