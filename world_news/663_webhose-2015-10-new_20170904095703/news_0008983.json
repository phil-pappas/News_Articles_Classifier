HELENA, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--The UC Summit 2015, a unique, invitation-only event being held November 15-18, 2015, at the Estancia La Jolla Hotel and Spa, in La Jolla, California, will feature the most extensive line up of programs dealing with Microsoft’s Skype for Business since Microsoft’s own Ignite Conference earlier this year. As a major sponsor of the UC Summit, Microsoft will be delivering a keynote and vision statement, and Skype for Business will be a key focus in several of the sessions. \nOn Sunday afternoon, UCStrategies expert Kevin Kieller of EnableUC will deliver a session titled “Microsoft UC: What Works and What Doesn't.” This presentation is modeled on Kevin’s well-received Enterprise Connect Skype for Business Road Show. Later that evening Microsoft will kick off the official sessions with its keynote. Microsoft will also participate in a UC&C vendor roundtable co-moderated by Eric Krapf, General Manager of Enterprise Connect and Jim Burton, Producer of the UC Summit, on Monday morning. \nOn Tuesday morning, Kevin Kieller and Blair Pleasant of COMMfusion will run a session titled, “Why Usage and Adoption Trumps Technology,” that will also focus heavily on Skype for Business. \nTuesday afternoon, UCStrategies experts Marty Parker, Blair Pleasant and Dave Michels will do their annual review and assessment of the UC&C Vendor Landscape where Skype for Business will be included and compared with the UC&C portfolios of Cisco, Avaya, Mitel, NEC and the rest of the UC&C providers. Later, Phil Edholm of PKE Consulting and Michael Finneran of dBrn Associates will conduct a session on “Managing Systems and Networks in a Multi-Vendor Environment,” where one of the target deployments will be Skype for Business for IM and presence while utilizing a separate PBX for voice services. \nMicrosoft is looking forward to being a sponsor of the event. “We are excited to be part of UC Summit. This is an interesting time for the industry and us as we are getting closer to general availability of the new Skype for Business services. We look forward to the event as a platform to connect with customers and partners,” said Microsoft’s Niilo Fredrikson, Director of Partner Strategy and Marketing for Skype for Business. \nAll told, the UC Summit will be one of the key learning events for those considering a UC&C deployment and should provide an excellent background on Skype for Business and how it compares with the other UC&C offerings. \nClick this link to begin your application. \nAbout UCStrategies \nFounded in 2006, UCStrategies is an industry resource for unified communications enterprises, communications vendors, system integrators, and anyone interested in the growing unified communications arena. \nA supplier of objective information on unified communications, UCStrategies is supported by an alliance of leading communication industry advisors, analysts, and consultants who have worked in the various segments of unified communications since its inception.
