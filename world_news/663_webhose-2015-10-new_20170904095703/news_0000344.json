Grace into God. Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET\nIt's hard to believe it's been 40 years since we first discovered the Knights of Ni, the Rabbit of Caerbannog and the Legendary Black Beast of ggghhh in the hit 1975 British comedy \" Monty Python and the Holy Grail .\"\nThe film, which came from the demented minds of Monty Python (actors Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin), has been a hit for decades, spawning not only video games but also inspiring the 2005 Tony Award-winning musical \" Spamalot .\"\nBut wait, now there's more! Just when we thought we had seen every possible cut of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" the folks from the Monty Python YouTube channel have posted 14 minutes of lost footage of Gilliam's signature animations to promote the new \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" Limited Edition Castle Catapult Gift Set Blu-ray, which hits stores on October 27.\nThe new video features never-before-seen animations by Gilliam , as well as his hilarious commentary on why certain bits were cut out of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" in the first place.\nEnlarge Image Doodles by bored monks inspired Gilliam's amusing animations. Video screenshot by Bonnie Burton/CNET\n\"This is the only reason to buy this new Blu-ray version of the film for the animation,\" Gilliam says in the video. \"It's old animation, but it's the animation that was cut out by the rather envious members of the group who were trying to restrain a young talented animator. A man who could have gone on to be a great animator, but no, he was forced into live-action filmmaking to cover the scars.\"\nGilliam also talks about where the inspiration for the artwork came from and his creative process in making the labor-intensive animations.\n\"The artwork was inspired by and copied from a book called ' Illustrations in the Margins of Medieval Manuscripts ,'\" Gilliam explains. \"What was interesting about it was that it was all the artwork that the monks had literally drawn around the edges of their illuminated bibles, because clearly they were bored. They filled the margins with all these fantastical little characters and strange beasts and beautiful floral organic shapes, and that's what we used.\"\nGilliam also reminds us of the music by Neil Innes that also didn't make it into the final film release. Plus, there are plenty of new animations and deleted animations of \"The Tale of Sir Robin,\" \"Elephant & Castle,\" \"Run Away!\" \"Meanwhile, King Arthur & Sir Bedevere...\" and \"The Tale of Sir Lancelot.\"\nAnd in classic Gilliam fashion he constantly reminds us that the quality of his commentary is equal to the amount he's being paid to do it.\n\"But remember I'm not getting paid for this commentary so the low quality of information that you're getting is the result of that,\" he says. \"If any of you would like to offer me money directly I could give you a proper commentary. In fact, let me leave you my address and you can send me the money directly. It's, um, oh, I can't do that or else you'll come around stalking me.\"\nIn addition to the new Blu-ray edition of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" and its theatrical re-release, the Monty Python gang has updated the trailer with new voiceovers from Monty Python members Terry Jones and Michael Palin.", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/scD4_ZVDD-8", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/scD4_ZVDD-8", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamalot", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail", "https://youtu.be/1oGpR_TP7ME", "http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/margins_manuscripts/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog", "http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/3fe81d7b-dd04-4ec0-a0f8-f1cc37fcbfc2/resize/570xauto/a1255bb3ca28fe6fec4769e48e5d147c/montypython3.jpg", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/8aa7d560-9f2f-421f-9120-573dc96989c1/resize/570xauto/9c6be4a2d09055012ec9540b5bd2cf9e/montypython2.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1oGpR_TP7ME", "http://smarturl.it/SubscribeToPython"], "published": "2015-10-15T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:14:30.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
