It's also good news for consumers. \n\"This is a further vote in favour of the region's economy, and fits perfectly with investments the port has already made – including plans to deepen the shipping channel for bigger ships – and others which have made in roads and rail to create an efficient transport system in the lower North Island.\" \nCentrePort said it currently had 11 international shipping lines offering services to all parts of the globe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:37:58.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
