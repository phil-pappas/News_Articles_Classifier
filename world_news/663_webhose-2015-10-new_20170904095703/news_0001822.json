The new version, which includes industry firsts, was released today at the annual conference of the Association for Financial Professionals #AFPDenver, where demonstrations are taking place at #Reval booth #1407. \n“Large and mid-size companies are challenged with issues in payments, banking, trading, and compliance, especially as they operate across various jurisdictions. The differences in one country over another may be nuanced, but the cumulative impact can be great without supporting technology,” says Reval Chief Technology Officer Philip Pettinato. “Version 15.1 removes more of the complexities of doing business globally , so that treasury teams can perform more effortlessly in their local markets. At Reval, we take on the hard things so that companies don’t have to.” \nReval continues to deepen its rich foundation of treasury and risk management functionality, investing historically over 30% of its revenue in R&D to meet the needs of companies operating in various markets. In Japan, Reval is the only provider that connects to NTT DATA’s new gateway service. The gateway enables Reval clients to access Japan’s domestic banks through NTT DATA’s eBAgent ® service and over the ANSER and ZENGIN payment networks. With this access and the Reval Cloud Platform’s new support for double-byte characters in the FIDES multi-banking service bureau, Reval clients can experience a unique and unified connectivity solution for global banking. \nCompanies in jurisdictions that can early adopt the IFRS 9 standard for hedge accounting are able to mitigate P&L volatility using Reval’s new IFRS 9 module. Reval is the first global software-as-a-service TRM provider to introduce a module for the new standard. Reval has also added a Monte Carlo-based Expected Exposure (EE) methodology to its Credit Value Adjustments (CVA) module in response to clients in EMEA and APAC facing increasing auditor pressure in accounting for the hedging of non-domestic issuances. Companies can also easily see their total cost of debt issuances or their returns on investments with Reval’s enhanced accrual reports. The new version 15.1 also satisfies the nuanced market conventions for rounding in Japan and Brazil, and adds the Brazilian Taxa Referencial rate (BRLTR, TR) index applied to loan repayments to account for inflation, which reached a 12-year high in Brazil of 9.56 percent in July. \nFor more information about the Reval Cloud Platform and its new and enhanced capabilities, email info@reval.com , and visit www.reval.com . \n*eBAgent is a registered trademark of NTT DATA in Japan.
