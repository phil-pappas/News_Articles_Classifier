Microchip Technology Inc.(NASDAQ: MCHP), a leading provider of microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP solutions, today announced that PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN is networking the coaxial-cable infotainment system of its Aircross SUV concept car using MOST ® technology. Specifically, PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN is utilizing Microchip's OS81110 and OS81118 MOST150 Intelligent Network Interface Controllers (INICs) , which provide 150 Mbps performance and support all MOST network data types. The striking CITROEN Aircross SUV concept car will be shown at the 66th International Motor Show (IAA) Cars in Frankfurt, Germany , from September 17-27, 2015 .\nTo learn more about Microchip's MOST networking products, visit http://www.microchip.com/MOST-091515a .\nCITROEN Aircross occupants benefit from audio spatialization, for peerless acoustic comfort. Each of its four seats is equipped with speakers and a microphone to facilitate dialog between the occupants, or to allow an individual in-cabin experience. Using these \"sound bubbles,\" each passenger can choose who they want to speak to while respecting the relaxation of their fellow travelers, making the journey a time for calm or communication—the choice is theirs.\nTo date, more than 170 million MOST interface controllers have been installed in 184 car models since 2001. All major carmakers have for many years successfully implemented MOST technology in their multi-node infotainment networking systems, as it provides a field-proven, low-risk, whole-system solution. The MOST150 standard also provides Ethernet or Internet Protocol networking capabilities. This latest version of MOST technology continues to predictably and efficiently transport video, audio, packet and control data throughout the vehicle without time-synchronization protocols, using dedicated channels for minimal processor overhead in the main infotainment control unit processors.\n\"We are very grateful that PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN has chosen our MOST150 Coax Technology for the rapid prototyping of its bold Aircross SUV concept car,\" said Dan Termer, Microchip's Automotive vice president.\nMOST150 also provides 150 Mbps performance and proven electromagnetic-compatibility (EMC) behavior. All MOST INICs offer industry-standard hardware interfaces to processor and peripheral devices for the efficient routing of streaming, packet and control data, which greatly simplifies module designs. End users can immediately access the vehicle's infotainment system, due to the MOST INIC's ultra-fast network startup behavior.\nThe MOST Cooperation standards enable automotive OEMs and their Tier 1 suppliers with a proven and well-supported methodology for defining and implementing high-bandwidth infotainment and Advanced Driver Assistance (ADAS) systems, including a standard physical layer and a robust method for system management and control with superior reliability and Quality of Service (QoS). Using MOST technology also results in reduced weight for easier compliance with environmental regulations.\nResources\nHigh-res CITROEN Aircross SUV Exterior Photo: http://www.microchip.com/Exterior-Photo-091515a High-res Interior Photo: http://www.microchip.com/Interior-Photo-091515a Follow Microchip\nRSS Feed for Microchip Product News: http://www.microchip.com/RSS-091515a Twitter: http://www.microchip.com/Twitter-091515a Facebook: http://www.microchip.com/Facebook-091515a YouTube: http://www.microchip.com/YouTube-091515a About Microchip Technology\nMicrochip Technology Inc.
