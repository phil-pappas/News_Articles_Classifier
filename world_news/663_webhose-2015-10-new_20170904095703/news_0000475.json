The Oh-Dometer feature, part of the OhMiBod Remote app, will allow women to track their orgasms, set weekly goals, and see patterns over time. \nThe app can also deliver exciting new alerts to lovers in the form of “instant orgasm notifications,” complete with customizable messages (send a sext along with an orgasm). The update also coincides with OhMiBod’s release of blueMotion® NEX|2, the newest addition to the company’s line of Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi compatible vibrators. \nDo we really need a tracker for our orgasms? According to Suki Dunham, founder of OhMiBod: \nEach day, millions of us use technology to track our general health. We chart our heart rates, caloric intake, steps taken, and activity. Keeping track of our orgasms is another important element of this big picture. \nRegular orgasms also come with a string of potential health benefits , from that happy post-orgasm glow, to stress and pain relief and the ability to sleep better. Will seeing your ample orgasm logged on a chart encourage you to orgasm more? Or is this, like the smart menstrual cup , body analytics we don’t need? \nOne thing you can be more assured of is the privacy of your data. OhBiMod recently moved its accounts to private, secure servers instead of Google+. According to Dunham, \nGving our customers more control over their privacy levels was crucial. So many us love social interactivity, but only with our partners or chosen social circle. The OhMiBod Remote now provides the option for public and private accounts, letting users have ultimate control their privacy. \nThe OhMiBod app has a host of other playful features designed to be used with OhMiBod’s line of vibrators , allowing lovers to take control from afar. App users can create vibration patterns, or use preset patterns and manually control intensity. Users can also create private or public accounts, with the potential send or accept invitations and play with strangers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:49:48.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
