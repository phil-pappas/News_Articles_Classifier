Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, especially in elderly people. Glaucoma is generally categorized as open-angle glaucoma (OAG), angle-closure glaucoma (ACG), secondary glaucoma, and congenital glaucoma. Other less common types of glaucoma include normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, and pigmentary glaucoma (NEI, 2014b). Although there are many types of glaucoma, the two most important types are OAG and ACG, with OAG accounting for about 80-90% of all glaucoma cases (Mayo Clinic, 2014). OAG and ACG can be primary (primary open-angle glaucoma [POAG] and primary angle-closure glaucoma [PACG], respectively) or secondary, depending on the cause. \nThe increase in the number of total prevalent cases of glaucoma in the 7MM can be attributed to changing population demographics in the respective markets. However, further epidemiological research is warranted given that there is a paucity of national and international data evaluating the prevalence and trends of glaucoma worldwide. There is also a need to clearly demarcate the glaucoma population in each clinical type, as currently available epidemiological literature fails to clearly demarcate different glaucoma populations.
