This has been made possible thanks to inTEST Thermal Solutions through its Temptronic ThermoStream temperature forcing system, which automates temperature cycling of power devices by interfacing with a specially designed enclosure from Keysight. Programmable control of ThermoStream systems permit a wide range of temperatures, from -100 to +300°C. With fast thermal cycling rates, the ThermoStream promotes rapid circuit design of power devices such as IGBTs and MOSFETs.\nProgrammable hot and cold thermal cycling adds to the previously announced capability where power devices are in contact with an inTEST Thermal hot plate integrated in the analyzer’s test fixture.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/Thermal-cycling-for-power%20devices-ThermoStream-300dpi.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:04:32.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
