The alliance extends the IQNavigator ecosystem of technology and solution partners, which is focused on aligning the best possible set of solutions to solve complex contingent labor challenges. IQNavigator customers can now leverage Montage’s premier video interviewing & voice interviewing solution that meets the specific needs of contingent worker hiring. The alliance extends the IQNavigator ecosystem of technology and solution partners, which is focused on solving complex contingent labor challenges.\n“Montage offers the most mature and robust video and voice interviewing solution available for engaging talent, and this partnership integrates this valuable solution for the specific needs of hiring non-permanent employees. Together, we’ll help our customers, MSP partners and staffing suppliers fill non-permanent positions faster and with greater confidence,” said Kevin Poll, Vice President of Strategic Alliances at IQNavigator.\n“Too many companies today try to hire contingent workers with a brief phone call or no live interaction—all in the pursuit of speedy hiring—but that can result in the wrong hire. The Montage and IQN solution enables companies to implement thorough interviewing across the total workforce—regardless of whether a potential hire is an FTE or a non-permanent worker,” he continued.\nThis is particularly important for contingent workers, because so many non-permanent workers are highly-skilled, in-demand contractors who have their choice of projects. Montage enables companies to make a smarter decision about which workers to offer contracts, and make the strongest case that the worker should join the team.\n“Contingent workers are a fast growing segment of a company’s workforce. Combining our technology with the IQN platform gives clients the ability to hire the best and brightest candidates while promoting their brand image to highly skilled, in-demand talent. In today’s global war for talent, this is a must-have to achieve strategic business goals,” said Tina Yoder, Vice President of Strategic Alliances at Montage.\nMontage’s video interviewing technology includes both live and on-demand capabilities, providing a seamless addition to any organization’s hiring workflow and leveraging the power of video to get to know candidates in the hiring process. Montage’s voice interviewing technology includes both live and on-demand phone interviewing, creating ease, reach, and flexibility through an audio-driven interviewing technology seamlessly built into the Montage platform. The solution also includes a candidate self-scheduling tool, robust rating and reviewing capabilities and support for live phone and in-person interviews.\nIQNavigator and Montage will discuss this solution at the upcoming HR Technology Conference (HR Tech) on October 18-21 in Las Vegas.
