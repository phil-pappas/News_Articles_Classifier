( www.us.sios.com ), the industry's leading provider of high availability and IT analytics software, today announced that Microsoft Cluster MVP and SIOS Technical Evangelist Dave Bermingham will discuss Windows Azure High Availability options for SQL Server at Pass Summit 2015 October 27-30 in Seattle, WA at the Washington State Convention Center. SIOS will also showcase its SAN and SANLess clustering software in Booth 501, host \"Pass the Bacon: Breakfast Panel\" and sponsor \"Denny Cherry presents SQL Karaoke.\" \nSpeaking Session Titled, \"Understanding Windows Azure High Availability options for SQL Server,\" Dave's session is scheduled for Friday, Oct 30, 3:30 PM. Windows Azure provides an excellent IaaS platform for deploying SQL Server. Although Microsoft is managing the infrastructure, high availability and disaster recovery must still be addressed. In this session, attendees will learn how to leverage Azure Fault Domains, Upgrade Domains and Internal Load Balancers to ensure the high availability of SQL Server deployments within the Azure cloud. SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Cluster Instances deployed in Azure have specific requirements that will be discussed in detail and further illustrated through live demonstrations that will include configuration via both Powershell and the Azure Portal. Hybrid cloud configurations will also be introduced as a disaster recovery solution for SQL Server deployments. On-premise to cloud, cloud to cloud and inter-cloud options will be demonstrated and the benefits of each configuration will be discussed. \nThe SIOS Exhibit In booth #501, SIOS will showcase its products that add real-time block level replication and configuration flexibility in Windows Server Failover Clustering environments. SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition software is an ingredient that integrates seamlessly with Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) to provide SANLess cluster protection where shared storage clusters are either impossible or impractical, such as cloud, virtual and high performance storage environments.
