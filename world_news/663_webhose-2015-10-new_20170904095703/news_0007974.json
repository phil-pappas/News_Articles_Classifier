This partnership allows our management, staff and approach to customers and suppliers to remain unchanged.\" \nAzelis CEO Hans Joachim MÃ¼ller said: \"The specialty chemicals market in North America is extremely important, and the trend of suppliers moving their smaller accounts to specialty chemical distributors will continue for some time. \n\"As we got to know the team at KDG, it became clear that they share our values and we believe that they are an excellent partner to expand our business into the US and build on our existing business in Canada. \n\"Our product portfolios are extremely complementary and demonstrate many synergies with principals, which is a paramount consideration in any acquisition.\" Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:32:45.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
