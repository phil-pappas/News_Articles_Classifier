Photo: Supplied\nBy: Hulab, mapstr.com\nFor: iPhone\nCost: free\nTired of seeing cafes, shops or museums on maps that someone else decided are important? Personalise your own maps by populating them with your favourite places, with the useful option of adding notes. Save places to your map either by using your current location, entering a name or address, or scanning an address using your camera. Scanning an address from a magazine or newspaper works surprisingly well. Use standard tags to identify places, such as shopping or restaurants. There's also a handy option to create your own tags and place icons. Well chosen tags allow you to easily list, say, all cafes or parks. You can also find opening hours and phone numbers.\nWORTH A LOOK\nSalute the Desk (iPhone, $3.79) Stuck at your desk all day?
