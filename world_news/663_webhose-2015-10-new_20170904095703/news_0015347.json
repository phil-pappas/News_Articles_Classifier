The collaboration empowers customers to leverage their investments to better fight crime. Calls for emergency services are managed by CAD and seamlessly integrated with NC4 Street Smart. This allows responding officers to validate the crime inside NC4 Street Smart and immediately begin to fight crime while continuing to report using PremierOne RMS features. This partnership provides a complete end to end view on crime fighting. Current customers can deploy NC4 Street Smart easily with no additional investment to connect the systems. NC4 Street Smart is a state-of-the-art tool that provides real-time crowd-sourcing of crime data within an organization, or across multiple law enforcement groups, to keep officers informed and protected as they patrol our streets. NC4 Street Smart organizes all of the organization's information and delivers it in a simple interface for the frontline officers. It allows agencies to stop fighting crime in email or spreadsheets and organizes both the structured and unstructured data making it easily accessible to the frontline. A quick search of a subject's name crawls all data available to the organization – from traditional sources like CAD and RMS to electronic station log books, bulletins, offender lists and other structured data sources. In addition to structured sources, NC4 Street Smart brings collaborative crowd-sourcing tools, such as blogs, that allow officers to communicate naturally. PremierOne™ CAD helps agencies improve response times, efficiently allocate resources and better inform first responders through better information gathering and situational awareness. It delivers real-time information into the hands who need it most to make better decisions for greater outcomes. \"We are coming together to fight crime and make it easier for law enforcement to solve crimes,\" said Rob Wolf , Vice President of Public Safety for NC4. \"We are excited to formally announce this partnership and execute our shared vision and look forward to what we can build together.\" NC4 plans to continue to explore additional integrations to include better two-way communications across the platforms. NC4 will provide demonstrations of the PremierOne CAD integration with NC4 Street Smart at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference (IACP). Attendees can stop by Booth #5214 to learn more and receive a product demo. About NC4 NC4 delivers safety and security solutions for both business and government organizations.
