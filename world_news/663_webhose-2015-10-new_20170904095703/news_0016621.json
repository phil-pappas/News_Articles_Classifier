The dot-tracking exercise is a test of attention. Courtesy: Insight/SBS October 13th 2015 18 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ \nIT sounds like the sort of gift a superhero might have. Julee-Anne Bell, who is congenitally blind, can “see” more of the world than people with vision. \nBy clicking her tongue and listening to the echoes, she can effectively see through solid objects, identifying whether a wall has another wall behind it, or trees, or a fence. \n“I can hear layers of sound,” she told news.com.au. “The denseness of the wall, the sparseness of the trees behind. I can tell you the shape of a car, whether it’s still, if it’s high or low, long or short, or a four-wheel drive. \n“Everyone uses echolocation. When you walk into a room you can tell if it’s large or small by the sound, but this is an active form. As you activate your perceptional skills, you start to hear light and shade and build a picture of your environment, your brain becomes more attune.” \nJust five years ago, Ms Bell, who appears on tonight’s Insight : Sensational on SBS at 8.30pm, was crippled with anxiety over leaving the house alone. In 2010, she came across a documentary about Daniel Kish from the US, inventor of a sophisticated form of echolocation called FlashSonar. \nUsing palatal, or in some cases, dental clicks, users can listen to variation in sound and build a sonic image of what they’re looking at. Ms Bell, from Brisbane, invited Mr Kish to Australia for a month in 2012, spending $6000 on her own eight days of training and teaching the method to 25 children with impaired vision. She now runs an organisation called World Access For The Blind Australia , and has passed the technique on to around 150 people across the country.
