The work is currently being displayed in Lisbon as part of ICT 2015, a European Commission imitative organised with the Foundation for Science and Technology. \nThe 5-metre tall sculpture is made up of around 300 PLA 3D printed parts and was made possible with support from BEEVERYCREATIVE and 3D Factory. Leonel used eight permanent 3D printers and help from the 3D printing community, including the BEEVERYCREATIVE team, to create the colourful piece in just six months.
