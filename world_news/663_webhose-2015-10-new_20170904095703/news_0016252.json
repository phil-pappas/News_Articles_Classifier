Under a new reseller agreement, Maicore Group will incorporate the Symmetrics Contact Centre Reporting & Analysis Suite into its performance management practice, which spans business intelligence, workforce management, agent training and recruitment.\n“We were impressed by Maicore Group’s long experience in EMEA using business intelligence solutions to help streamline and optimize business processes in the contact centre,” says Richard McElroy, Symmetrics’ president and chief operating officer. “They’re more than just a reseller — they offer their customers a complete blueprint for better performance in the contact centre, and the stakeholder training needed to achieve it. We’re pleased that they have selected Symmetrics Suite as the foundation of that blueprint’s business intelligence and reporting strategy.”\nMaicore Group's chief executive officer Ron Scheufen says Symmetrics Suite offers the depth and breadth his customers need for better contact centre reporting. “Our process improvement blueprints require highly customized key performance indicators that cross several systems and applications in the contact centre, from the ACD and IVR to workforce management systems and customer relationship management applications,” Scheufen says. “Based on our survey of available business intelligence solutions for contact centres, Symmetrics Suite offers the most complete platform to unify the real-time, historical and contact detail data we use to give our customers the exact performance measures they need, when they need them.”\nUnder the agreement, Maicore Group will resell the entire Symmetrics Suite product line, including:\nSymmetrics Data Mart, which consolidates data from multiple contact centre systems and applications and/or multiple call centres into a true data warehouse optimized for reporting and analytics. Symmetrics Info Manager, an intuitive, easy-to-use web-based BI platform to design, access, schedule, manage and interact with all of a contact centre’s relevant real-time, historical and call-detail data. Symmetrics Real Time, a Info Manager module that taps into multiple contact centre systems’ native real-time interfaces and APIs to deliver mission-critical contact centre metrics in true real-time. Symmetrics Contact Detail, a module for analyzing granular, detail-level data generated by contact centre systems. Working in conjunction with the Symmetrics Data Mart, the module opens up call-detail records and event-level data within customer contact segments to help troubleshoot call failures, issues or problems, and to better understand the overall customer experience.\nAbout Symmetrics\nAt Symmetrics, we build, implement and support software that solves the problem of reporting and analyzing real-time, historical and call-detail data from any system or application found in your call centre.
