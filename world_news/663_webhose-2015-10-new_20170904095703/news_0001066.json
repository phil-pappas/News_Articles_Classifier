Newsy is the leading over-the-top video news service that brings context and perspective to a growing millennial audience and is a wholly owned subsidiary of The E.W. Scripps Company (NYSE: SSP ).\n\"Newsy provides a fresh perspective on the day's news, with an editorial focus that is very targeted at — and performs well with — millennials,\" said Joe Fiveash , vice president of digital for Raycom Media. \"We believe that Newsy adds an important layer of national and world news depth to our already robust offerings across Raycom markets. In addition to providing relevant news to our consumers, it provides sought-after video placement opportunities for our advertisers.\"\nAfter a successful trial run on the website of its Memphis -based station, WMC Action News 5 , Raycom sought a larger distribution of Newsy videos across its properties. Now, the agreement secures placement of multiple Newsy videos in the daily video module on each of Raycom's news channels' websites. Raycom Media stations cover 13.1 percent of U.S. television households.   \n\"Raycom Media has a strong reputation for serving consumers and advertisers with relevant content in its local communities,\" said Blake Sabatinelli , general manager of Newsy. \"Partnering with Newsy is a natural next step in delivering the stories that consumers are seeking from today's news providers in a compelling digital experience.\"\nNewsy has made a name for itself as a forward-thinking digital brand built by and for the next generation of media consumers, with offerings that speak to ever-changing content consumption habits. In addition to its deal with Raycom, Newsy has similar distribution across the Scripps station group. \nAbout Newsy\nNewsy is a millennial-focused digital video news service that provides \"news with the why,\" built to inform and engage by delivering today's top stories across platforms.
