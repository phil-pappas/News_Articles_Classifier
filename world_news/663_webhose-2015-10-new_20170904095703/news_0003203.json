Their figures clock in at 5.8 per cent and a measly 1.7 per cent respectively. \nTo put this figure into perspective, Windows 7 currently sits at 56.53 per cent of the global market share among operating systems, way ahead of its closest competitor, Windows XP, at 12.21 per cent. \nAt 6.6 per cent of global market share, Windows 10 is even starting to gain on Windows 8, which currently sits at third place with 10.7 per cent, even though Windows 10 is just over two months old. \nPerhaps also noteworthy is that Windows 10 has surpassed the latest version of Mac OS X, which sits at 4.9 per cent. At least in the desktop space, Windows is winning the OS race. Related News If there's one thing many of us aren't good at, it is change.
