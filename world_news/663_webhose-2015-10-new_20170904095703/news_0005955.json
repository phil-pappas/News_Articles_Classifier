According to information from the company, \"SIPX for MOOCs applies deep geography-based publisher discounts to make content more affordable. It also accelerates course launches by simplifying copyright permissions.\" Coursera partners can also take advantage of a limited time offer from SIPX and Coursera to get their first SIPX MOOC request at no charge. \nKey features of SIPX include: Access to course-relevant content that is available to students at no charge, including open access and library subscriptions; Tools for sharing non-subscribed copyrighted material compliantly; Analytics to monitor student engagement with reading assignments; and Support for integration with existing LMS and teaching platforms. \nAccording to information from the company, SIPX typically saves students 20 to 35 percent in course materials costs by connecting them \"to materials that are open access or already purchased and available to them through their university library.\" \nFurther information about SIPX Central, SIPX Campus and SIPX for MOOCs can be found on the ProQuest SIPX site .
