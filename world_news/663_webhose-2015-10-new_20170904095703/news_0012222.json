The idea started to take off last year.\nAll you really have to do is pack basic bread stuffing into a waffle maker and cook for 10 minutes. You’ll get a stuffing waffle (also known as waffled stuffing) that’s crisp outside and soft inside.\nComplicate things if you must. Some people bind their stuffing with egg, moisten it with stock and warm it up first. One blogger minced leftover turkey in a food processor and mixed it into the stuffing.\nYou can pack the stuffing into the waffle maker by hand or pat it into a ball and let the machine spread things out in a slightly more haphazard shape. Figure out what works best for your machine and your esthetics.\nI used two inexpensive, non-stick waffle makers — an Oster Belgian (round) waffle maker and Salton 3-in-1 grill, sandwich and waffle maker. I didn’t need to use cooking spray or brush the machines with melted butter.\nNow for the toppings. I love how warm cranberry sauce mixed with maple syrup gives this dish a breakfasty feel, but use any combination of maple syrup, cranberry sauce and leftover gravy. Turkey is a bonus, but not necessary. Throw some on your waffle cold, warmed slightly or even griddled in butter until crispy à la Rachael Ray.\nThe final consideration — do you want to turn your waffle into a waffle sandwich? If so, put a layer of mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, turkey and/or cheese between two stuffing waffles and pan fry it like a grilled cheese.\nBonus idea — this doubles as Thanksgiving dinner on the cheap.\nI tested this waffle concept out with two turkey thighs ($10), two boxes of Kraft Stove Top stuffing mix ($1 each), a can of Ocean Spray whole berry cranberry sauce ($2) and a five-pound bag of yellow fleshed potatoes ($5) because I was going to try to make mashed potato waffles. I had maple syrup, milk and butter on hand to pull everything together, but the bulk of the meal cost $20 and could feed four.\nYou can have fun with Thanksgiving and not spend a fortune.\nThanksgiving stuffing waffles\nThese unexpectedly fabulous waffles are more of an idea than a strict recipe. Amounts will vary depending on the size of your waffle maker and whether it makes round or square waffles.\nAbout 1 cup (250 mL) cold, leftover stuffing\nAbout 1/4 cup (60 mL) pure maple syrup\nAbout 2 tbsp (30 mL) whole berry or jellied cranberry sauce\nChopped, shredded or sliced cooked turkey to taste, warmed if desired\nPreheat non-stick waffle maker until ready-to-cook light comes on.\nIf using round waffle maker, pat stuffing into ball and place in centre. If using a square waffle maker, pat stuffing into one side of waffle maker to make a single waffle. Cover, pressing down firmly, but do not lock the handle lock. Process (on medium-high if you can adjust the temperature) for 10 minutes until waffle is golden and crispy. It’s best if you don’t open the lid while cooking.\nCarefully remove waffle with heat-resistant plastic or wood (not metal) utensils, such as a turner/spatula.\nMeanwhile, in small pot combine maple syrup and cranberry sauce and warm over medium heat, breaking up cranberry sauce with wooden spoon if needed. Alternately, place in small bowl and heat in microwave about 30 to 45 seconds or until warm; stir well.\nPlace waffle on plate. Spoon maple cranberry sauce to taste over it. Scatter with turkey, if desired.\nMakes one.\njbain@thestar.ca\nMore on thestar.com\nGiving thanks\nFind a new partner, not a new look: Ellie", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2841138/Stuffing-waffles-two-Thanksgiving-Z-Rachael-Ray-reveals-craft-culinary-masterpiece-holiday-leftovers.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:13:36.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
