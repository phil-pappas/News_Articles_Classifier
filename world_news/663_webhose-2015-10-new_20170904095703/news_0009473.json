But it is difficult to give the clear definition of application performance. It can be explained as the speed of the servers respond or the operation efficiency of the application used by thousands of people at the same time. \nWhat Are Basic Elements of the Appropriate Application Performance? \nUsers of this particular application. Data, which this application contains. Environment of testing. \nThe whole work of software testing company is oriented to user. On the one hand, testers should know well the peculiarities of user's behavior while performing this or that operation. On the other hand, testers should have the idea of app operation itself, before performing software testing. \nCooperation and exchanging of the information are the foundation for a successful software development process. In this case, the key point is metrics of chop and change users' needs. \nNowadays, the data amount is so large that there is a need to manage it. Though, some data is often disregarded and some information is considered to be not essential. For any testing to be effective, for example, system testing, automated testing, multi-platform testing etc., the presence of test data and its amount should be tracked. This principle is also well demonstrated while unit testing, when data is generated to control the validation routines. \nWith the course of time, the applications operate with bigger and bigger amounts of data. But the performance is not developed with the same speed. That is why it is necessary to test application with true-to-life data quantity to know the true app performance. \nWhat is Important for the Effective Application Development? \nData (it is the actual reason for producing the application). Servers. Networks (their types and quality of connection). Clients. \nAs the testing environment equals the half of production amount, testing should not be performed at full load. Some years ago this hypotheses was valid but data amount is constantly increasing and the systems are complicating. That is why this suggestion is no longer effective. \nMaking environment similar to production requires big investment and great efforts. But still, it does not always show all possible mismatches. For this reason mobile application testing should be performed during all process of app development. \nNowadays, almost everyone has a mobile device and uses different applications. As a result, performance testing becomes an essential element of software production. The application should be easily launched by hundreds of mobile users. \nMain Conditions of Effective Performance Testing: \nto be aware of users' needs; the appropriate amount of relevant data; the correlation between testing and production. \nTo perform mobile testing, desktop testing or web site testing efficiently these methods should be adjusted for each company and each project.
