Walsh's session, entitled \"Power Your Data Fabric with Data Orchestration and Automation,\" will demonstrate the impact that Catalogic's software-only copy data management platform can have across a company's IT infrastructure, including both private and public clouds. Catalogic customer Stepphon Gayle of Fairfax County (VA) Public Schools will join Walsh to provide session attendees with a customer view of the benefits of Catalogic's ECX solution in his NetApp storage environment. The session is #3442-2 and will be held on Wednesday, October 14th at 10:30 AM. Conference attendees may view details and pre-register for this session within the Insight online Event Catalog. \nThe Catalogic session will demonstrate how mission-critical functions that run within a \"Data Fabric\" -- a term that refers to the interconnected collection of a company's IT environments inclusive of the cloud -- share a common need for access to copies of production data. Real world examples will be used to show the importance of a robust software-defined copy data management platform within a global Data Fabric. The session will include a live demonstration of Catalogic's flagship copy data management platform, ECX, showing how the platform leverages the NetApp ONTAP solutions that are already deployed in a customer environment, preserving the customer investment and delivering superior ROI. \n\"I'm honored to present again this year at NetApp's Insight conference,\" said Walsh. \"Since last year, we've launched several new versions of ECX, been recognized with several industry awards, and have rapidly grown our installations within the NetApp customer base. This year, we look forward to demonstrating cutting edge functionality that is ideal for NetApp enterprise customers, and discussing real world results with NetApp's customers and channel partners.\" \nStepphon Gayle commented, \"My team supports the IT infrastructure for 35,000 teachers and over 200,000 students, and we rely on both NetApp and Catalogic to get the job done. I'm looking forward to joining Ed on stage at Insight, and sharing my experiences using Catalogic's ECX to enable several key functions that my team is responsible for.\" \nIn addition to Mr. Walsh's session, Catalogic's Technical Manager of Global Alliances, Prashant Jagannathan, has been invited to address NetApp Insight in the NetApp Pavilion for two sessions: Tuesday, October 13 at 12:45 PM and Wednesday, October 14 at 12:15 PM.
