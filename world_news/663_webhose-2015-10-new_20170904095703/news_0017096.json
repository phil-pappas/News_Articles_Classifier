Arasan’s UFS 2.1 IP is available in both a Device Controller IP and Host Controller IP configurations, which incorporates the latest UFS Host Controller Interface (HCI) version 2.1. Arasan’s MIPI M-PHY® HS-G3 v3.1 IP is available in GDSII format for a variety of process technologies. In addition, Arasan’s Hardware Validation Platforms enable early validation of UFS 2.1 specification by emulating either a UFS 2.1 Host or Device systems at the interface protocol level.\nArasan’s UFS Host, Device and MPHY IP’s have been licensed and are in production with leading NAND Flash memory vendors and Application Processor companies. UFS Compliance and Production Testers from leading vendors also use Arasan’s UFS IP in combination with its MPHY operating at Gear 3 speeds. Arasan’s UFS solutions can be found in some of the leading edge smartphones available in the market today.\nFor more information please visit Arasan.com/UFS\nAvailability\nArasan’s UFS 2.0 Total IP solution is available immediately for shipment, including UFS Host Controller, UFS Device Controller IP, Verification IP, Linux OS based Hardware Platform with UFS 2.0 Host Controller implementation, UniPro Link Layer IP and software stack, the MIPI M-PHY GDSII, and all associated documentation.\nAbout Arasan\nArasan is an active contributor to JEDEC® and the MIPI® Alliance. Arasan's UFS Device Controller IP has been licensed by major NAND Flash Memory vendors while the UFS Host Controller IP has been licensed by application processor suppliers, production test equipment suppliers, and emulation platform vendors. This broad adoption of Arasan’s UFS IP promotes compliance and compatibility. Arasan is also the leading provider of IP for eMMC, which can be found on almost all of the Smartphones available in the market today.\nAbout JEDEC\nFor over 50 years, JEDEC has been the global leader in developing open standards and publications for the microelectronics industry.
