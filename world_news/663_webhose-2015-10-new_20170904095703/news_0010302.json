Xbridge’s DataSniff product is tightly integrated with the CorreLog SIEM Agent for z/OS, a mainframe security auditing and compliance software agent that scans RACF, ACF2, Top Secret and DB2 access events related to security, and sends them ready-formatted to CorreLog Visualizer, or other distributed SIEM console in real time. CorreLog Visualizer is a SIEM console with SIEM functionality for mainframe Sysprogs or other enterprise IT resource that is accessed through a standard web browser. The combined solution addresses a security liability for unstructured legacy data and applications found on the IBM z/OS mainframe, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n“Some CISOs don’t even know what legacy data or applications they have on their mainframes because some of the apps were custom built decades ago and a lot of the data is so old and disparate it’s not normalized; this is a major security liability,” said George Faucher, president and CEO of CorreLog. “This technology partnership is special because we are now capable of locating that legacy data and marking it to be “watched” and audited for any activity that might create a vulnerability for the enterprise.”\nThe Xbridge component of the product integration, DataSniff, is an automated mainframe data discovery system used to locate sensitive data as a prerequisite to data classification, database auditing, compliance, data security or IAM initiatives. Both DataSniff and CorreLog’s SIEM Agent for z/OS are critical components of compliance initiatives such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley, IRS Pub. 1075, GLBA and other data standards found in banking, healthcare and Government sectors. CorreLog’s Visualizer is the presentation layer that will bring the components into a standard web browser. The joint solution is seamlessly integrated across Xbridge and CorreLog platforms and the SIEM Agent for z/OS is certified for IBM QRadar SIEM, HP ArcSight SIEM, RSA Security Analytics (EMC), and also has field integrations with all brand-name SIEM systems.\n“We are thrilled with the integration of these remarkable products. The combination of both, empowers our shared customers to drive greater value from these automated platforms,” stated Armando Palomar, chief operating officer for Xbridge Systems Inc. “Our focus is targeted on customer satisfaction and success, and this new integration with Correlog’s SIEM Agent and Xbridge’s DataSniff solidifies our commitment to delivering the first and only top-rated Data Loss Prevention solution for IBM® z/OS Systems®.”\nFor more information on DataSniff, please click here .
