Photo: supplied\nAustralian accessory company STM hails from Bondi Beach, and it shows. Founders Adina Jacobs and Ethan Nyholm left the fashion industry behind to create something other than \"boring black\" for the tech accessory market.\nThey've been making some of the coolest tech accessory gear since 1998: laptop bags, sleeves and phone cases that have put the chic into geek carry cargo.\nNow they're shifting their colourful focus onto women with a range that's absolutely on trend for vintage styling from the 1940s and '50s. Think the Andrews Sisters singing Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy in those darling victory rolls.\nThe collection is called Grace, inspired by tech innovator US Navy Admiral Grace Hopper. Amazing Grace worked on the Harvard Mark I computer in the 1940s, and helped develop the first programming language that led to COBOL. As a curious child, her mother said she once dismantled seven alarm clocks to see how they worked.\nAdvertisement STM says it's the kind of spirit they were looking for in a namesake â€“ a female innovator who continued to work in tech until her death at age 85.\nAlongside the clunky black tech bags currently pervading the market, Grace's bright aqua polka dots, coral, purple and denim contrasts, soft plush fleece lining, and clever compartments are a fresh, smart point of difference.\nThe $69.95 deluxe sleeve comes in either a 13-inch or 15-inch size with a nifty magnetised front flap, and space to fit both a laptop and a tablet with its dual compartments. Short thick handles also make it comfortable to carry on your shoulder.\nThe $29.95 little clutch is the perfect tuck-away for your phone, cables and chargers, small enough to fit into a handbag with solid zips on either end and press studs to hold it in place like a purse. Reckon you could easily bar hop with this one.\nFor working gals toting gadgets who feel like they need all their digital lifelines on hand at any given moment, this range at least makes you look like you have your gear and your workload in the bag.
