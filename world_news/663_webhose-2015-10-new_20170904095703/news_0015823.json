Carpathia's highly compliant infrastructure-as-a-service platform expands QTS' ability to provide cloud enabled managed hosting services as well as develop new hybrid cloud solutions on top of existing colocation infrastructure. \n\"QTS is committed to providing the largest selection of compliance services for our growing enterprise and Federal Government customer base,\" said Peter Weber, Chief Product Officer. \"The new ISO 27001 certification further augments our status as one of the most compliant platforms for delivering flexible and scalable IT infrastructure services globally.\" \nQTS acquired Carpathia in June 2015 and the combined company has oriented its business model around delivering IT infrastructure solutions that meet and exceed commercial, federal civilian, military, and Intelligence Community compliance mandates.
