Following confirmation, orders are immediately sent to the chosen local Starbucks store where baristas begin preparing the order and an approximate collection time is sent to the customer to pick up their order directly from their barista – skipping the queue. \nUsers of the app are also rewarded with exclusive opportunities to earn Stars with the My Starbucks Rewards loyalty programme. \nThe App has received a very positive response from customers in the United States where it has been available since December 2014. According to customer feedback, the App typically saves commuters and working people 10-15 minutes in their day; parents with young children find it easier to order ahead than stand in line, while speech and hearing-impaired customers have hailed the App as a ‘game changer’ in helping them to get their correct order, fast. \nIan Cranna, Vice President Marketing & Category EMEA said, “We Brits are famous for queuing, but in an age of such sophisticated technology ‘why wait?’. With more people leading busier lifestyles than ever, saving minutes can really help, so we are excited to be bringing Mobile Order and Pay to our London customers – the first to have this feature outside of the US. \n“We think the easy-to-use feature will meet our customers’ needs for convenience and customisation at any time of the day.” \nMobile Order & Pay is initially available on iOS in 150 stores in London for the first trial phase of the technology. The launch of the UK trial follows a successful pilot in the US where Mobile Order and Pay surpassed all expectations and has just extended to over 7,000 stores nationwide as well as to the Android platform. *Based on feedback from morning commuter customers in the United States. \nAbout Starbucks Coffee Company \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee.
