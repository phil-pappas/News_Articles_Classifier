Stretch is named as a defendant in addition to Facebook and Zuckerberg.\n\"It clearly exposes plaintiff to hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy because it attacks plaintiff’s integrity, honesty and professionalism as a lawyer and falsely accuses plaintiff of committing a crime and of knowingly perpetrating a fraud on the court,\" Argentieri said Monday in his state court complaint.\nDebbie Frost, a spokeswoman for Facebook, didn’t immediately respond to voicemail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the suit.\nArgentieri, who practiced law as a solo attorney in Hornell, New York, filed the initial complaint against Facebook in 2010. Ceglia claimed 84 percent of Facebook and won a state court order briefly barring the company from transferring any assets. Ceglia later lowered his claim to half the company. Facebook said from the start that the case was fraudulent.\nCeglia was indicted in Manhattan federal court in 2012 on charges of mail fraud and wire fraud. U.S. District Judge Richard Arcara in Buffalo, New York, threw out Ceglia’s civil suit in 2013, finding “clear and convincing” evidence that he’d destroyed and faked evidence.\nArgentieri is the only lawyer to have represented Ceglia throughout the case. At least two dozen lawyers from firms throughout the U.S. represented Ceglia during part of his multibillion-dollar litigation. At least one of the firms that dropped out of the case cited a belief that Ceglia’s claim was fraudulent, according to documents made public in court filings. Argentieri now lives in California.\nStretch’s comment was published in press accounts of a malicious prosecution suit Facebook filed in New York in 2014 against Argentieri and a group of lawyers that included former New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco, New York-based Milberg LLP and DLA Piper LLP, one of the biggest law firms in the U.S. In the suit, Facebook claims the lawyers conspired with Ceglia in pursuing his fraudulent claim.\nU.S. marshals are pursuing Ceglia, who removed an electronic ankle bracelet and fled his Wellsville, New York, home in March, disappearing with his wife, two sons and dog. They remain missing.\nThe case is Argentieri v. Zuckerberg, 15-548503, California Superior Court, San Francisco County (San Francisco).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:45:34.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
