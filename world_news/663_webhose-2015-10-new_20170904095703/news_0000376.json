When you install apps from the Play Store, they will often “demand” access to certain applications that doesn’t seem to have any relation to the app itself. For instance, a game app will demand access to your list of contacts, camera, microphone, and sometimes they will declare sending SMS and make tweets for you. Marshmallow’s App Permissions cuts that, by letting you deny certain permissions. Head over to the “Settings” then hit “Apps,” and “Permissions” should appear, where you can deny each of those permissions that doesn’t sit well with you.\nUSB Type Cs are the future of connection, and while modern technology is making a steady adaption, Marshmallow preps up by supporting Type Cs. It also supports Fingerprint scanner. It won’t be available in older devices due to the lack of hardware features. This means, most, if not all, Android Marshmallow devices will standardize USB Type C and Fingerprint scanners on them. The rest is up to the phone makers. This will also mean fast charging for all Marshmallow devices.\n“Now on Tap” is a fun little add-on feature for Google Now. It scans the screen and will search immediate information about the screen’s contents and show it in a little popup. It’s not perfect, and it’s still going through its rounds of improvement. Nonetheless, this is a cool feature that has a solid potential to become useful and efficient in the coming years. This feature needs to be enabled on Google Now’s Settings menu under “Voice.”\nOn standby mode, Marshmallow kicks up its new battery saving mode called Doze. It extends life of all Android 6 devices by turning off all apps, except alarms and notifications.\nAnd of course there’s the infamous Easter egg – Android’s “Flappy Bird” replica is much more forgiving and less brutal than the Lollipop counterpart. To access this, go to “Settings,” “About Tablet,” and keep pressing the “Android Version” until the Marshmallow logo appear. Tapp this logo several times, long press it once, and several more taps will launch the Easter egg app. Have fun! We didn’t.\nAndroid Marshmallow is currently available on Nexus devices, starting from 5, 6, 7, and 9. It will be readily available on the recent Nexus 5X and 6P.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:49:04.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
