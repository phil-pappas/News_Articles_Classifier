Biogen Chief Executive George A. Scangos on Friday highlighted Mr. Kingsley's role in leading the introduction of the company's new products.\nBiogen, known for its multiple-sclerosis treatments, is considered one of four mainstay biotechnology stocks that are widely owned by large investors, along with Amgen Inc., Celgene Corp. and Gilead Sciences Inc.\nThe drug company's June quarter was a rough one, though, as it reported a sharp slowdown in sales growth for its flagship multiple-sclerosis pill and slashed its earnings outlook. At the time Mr. Scangos said the Cambridge, Mass., company had \"a lot of work ahead\" in turning around its commercial business.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at Ezequiel.Minaya@wsj.com\n 09, 2015 08:32 ET (12:32 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:50:36.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
