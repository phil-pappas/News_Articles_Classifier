The DeLorean car was made famous in the Back To The Future trilogy where it was modified into a time-machine. The project was started in 2013 and was carried out by Stanford's Rev Center with the aim to make an autonomous vehicle that was like no other before, a driverless car that could drift. Chris Gerdes, Stanford Revs Center Director, explained why they built the car to be able to do donuts: “We think automated vehicles should be able to execute any manoeuvre within the physical limits of the vehicle to get out of harm’s way,” Back to the Future's iconic DeLorean was the car of choice as \"It's a car that says 'science project'\" said Mr Gerdes. And as a tribute to the 1985 film, they named the car MARTY, which stands for Multiple Actuator Research Test bed for Yaw control. After building the software to be able to control the car, the team then had to go about modifying it which improved both it's steering, strength and power. Currently MARTY can only carry out donuts, but the aim is it for one day to be pitted against an actual driver on a track under race conditions as this would truly test it's autonomous ability. Watch the video above to see MARTY in action. telegraph.co.uk Follow @Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:09:44.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
