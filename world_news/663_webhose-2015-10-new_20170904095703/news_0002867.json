Revenue from renting space on cell towers and distributed antenna systems was $764.6 million, up from $717.6 million in the third quarter of 2014.\nThe Houston-based company manages wireless infrastructure and has benefitted from the boom in cellular data use as consumers shop, watch TV and do many other things on their smartphones and tablets. Distributed antenna systems - fiber-optic cable that connects systems of antennas, or small cells - are a growing and lucrative part of Crown Castle's market. The technology is used to bolster service in malls, downtown areas and other places with high data demand.\nIn the third quarter, Crown Castle completed the purchase of Sunesys for $1 billion to double its capacity for distributed antenna systems.\n\"All four major U.S. wireless carriers continue to upgrade and enhance their networks to meet ever increasing consumer demand for mobile broadband,\" CEO Ben Moreland said in a statement. \"Our leadership position in U.S. wireless infrastructure and strong balance sheet underscore our confidence that we can achieve our goal of generating compounded annual growth in dividend per share of 6% to 7% over the next several years.\"\nThe company also raised its expectations for earnings next quarter and in 2016. Executives will host a call to discuss the current results on Thursday morning.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/20/8827913/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/20/8827913/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:22:33.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
