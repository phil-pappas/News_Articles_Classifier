Martin noted, “There are many avenues in which an end-user begins to contemplate integrating a robotic cell into his or her facility. It may be an organic conception from a project manager, something that was witnessed in another organization’s facility, a mandate from upper management, or one of many other unmentioned reasons. In its infant stages, a project will typically state the goals before any strategies are set in place to achieve these goals.”\nIn a robotic application, many times these goals are safety, labor cost, throughput, or ergonomically-based. Once the system type is defined, technical requirements are stated, and the goals are established, one of the most crucial ingredients to a successful project is an efficient system layout. There are five separate groups to robotic cell layout development process: Requirements, Concept, Constraints, Strategies, and Results.\nTo read the entire article, go to: http://ow.ly/Todrj\nAbout Bastian Solutions\nBastian Solutions (http://ow.ly/LaOTe), a global material handling systems integrator and expert in e-commerce fulfillment automation is an innovator in the fields of material handling automation, goods-to-person systems, wearable AR technology, supply chain software, and robotics.
