This Business Outlook is directional guidance only as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the mix of domestic and international revenue and expenses can impact our results. \nQlik currently intends to publish, in each quarterly earnings release, certain expectations with respect to future financial performance. Those statements, including the guidance provided above, are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. \nConference Call and Webcast Information \nQlik will host a conference call on Thursday, October 22, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss the company’s third quarter financial results and its business outlook.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measure is presented in the financial tables below under the headings “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP”, “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Revenue to GAAP Revenue” and “Reconciliation of Year-Over-Year Projected Revenue Growth Rate to Year-Over-Year Projected Revenue Growth Rate on a Constant Currency Basis.” Qlik believes that the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release can assist investors in understanding and assessing Qlik’s on-going core operations and prospects for the future and provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing Qlik’s financial results with other companies in Qlik’s industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. In addition, Qlik believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency into the indicators used by management as a basis for its internal budgeting and operational decision making. \nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is determined by taking GAAP loss from operations and adding back stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock transactions, amortization of intangible assets and contingent consideration adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is determined by taking GAAP loss before income taxes and adding back stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock transactions, amortization of intangible assets and contingent consideration adjustments and the result is tax affected at an estimated long-term effective tax rate of 30%. Qlik believes that the effective tax rate used in the non-GAAP net income (loss) and related income (loss) per diluted common share calculations are reasonable estimates of the long-term normalized effective tax rate under its global structure. Qlik believes these adjustments provide useful information to both management and investors due to the following factors: Stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of Qlik’s employees and executives, determining the fair value of the stock-based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock-based compensation is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond Qlik’s control. Management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of Qlik’s core business and to facilitate comparison of its results to those of peer companies. Employer payroll taxes on stock transactions. The amount of employer payroll taxes on stock transactions is dependent on Qlik’s stock price and other factors that are beyond Qlik’s control and do not correlate to the operation of its business. Amortization of intangible assets. A portion of the purchase price of Qlik’s acquisitions is generally allocated to intangible assets, such as intellectual property, and is subject to amortization. However, Qlik does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. Additionally, the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition. Therefore, management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the amortization of intangible assets provides investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. Contingent consideration adjustment. Qlik periodically enters into business combinations which may contain contingent consideration arrangements. At each reporting date, management remeasures these contingent consideration liabilities at fair value until the contingencies are resolved. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, a charge of $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, was recorded related to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and is included in Qlik's consolidated statement of operations. Management believes that these costs are generally non-recurring and do not correlate to the ongoing operation of its business. \nTo determine the revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, revenue from entities reporting in foreign currencies was translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s monthly average foreign currency exchange rates. Qlik reports results in U.S. dollars but does business on a global basis in multiple currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations affect the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency revenue and expenses and may have a significant effect on reported results. The discussion of Qlik’s financial results in this release includes comparisons with the prior year period in constant currency terms. Management believes this information facilitates comparison of underlying results over time. \nThis press release includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures under the heading “Business Outlook”. These non-GAAP financial measures were determined by excluding stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock transactions, amortization of intangible assets and contingent consideration adjustments and assuming an estimated long-term effective tax rate of 30%. We are unable to reconcile this non-GAAP guidance to GAAP because it is difficult to predict the future impact of these adjustments. In addition, these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures assume that foreign currency exchange rates for the fourth quarter 2015 will approximate current foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, Qlik’s expectations of year-over-year projected revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 assume that expected revenue from entities reporting in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s monthly average foreign currency exchange rates. \nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant elements that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Qlik’s consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management of Qlik presents its non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its GAAP results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. As previously mentioned, a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided below. \nAbout Qlik \nQlik (NASDAQ: QLIK) is a leader in visual analytics.
