(NYSE: VRX ) (TSX: VRX) announced today that its Audit and Risk Committee and the full Board of Directors have reviewed the company's accounting for its Philidor arrangement and have confirmed the appropriateness of the company's related revenue recognition and accounting treatment. \nBased on its review conducted to date, Valeant also believes that the company is in compliance with applicable law. In light of the recent allegations made regarding Philidor, however, the Board of Directors has decided to establish an ad hoc committee of the board to review allegations related to the company's business relationship with Philidor and related matters. The committee will be chaired by Robert Ingram , the company's lead outside director. Other members will include Norma Provencio , chairman of the audit and risk committee; Colleen Goggins ; and Mason Morfit , who has been appointed to the Board as an independent director. \n\"As we have said previously, our accounting with respect to the Company's Philidor arrangements is fully compliant with the law,\" J. Michael Pearson , Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Valeant said. \"However, other issues have been raised publicly about Philidor's business practices, and it is appropriate that they be fully reviewed. This decision to create an ad hoc committee of the board, which I fully support, will help free management to focus on continuing to serve doctors and patients and run our business.\" \n\"We operate our business based on the highest standard of ethics, and we are committed to transparency. These values are at the core of our business model, and if we find violations we will take appropriate action,\" Pearson said. \n\"The board has complete confidence in Mike Pearson's performance as CEO and has fully supported the company's specialty pharmacy strategy. Mike operates with the highest degree of ethics, and we believe it is important that he and the management team be allowed to focus their efforts on continuing to serve patients and doctors and create long term value for our thousands of individual and institutional shareholders,\" Ingram said. \nConference Call Information \nThe dial-in number to participate on this call is (877) 876-8393, confirmation code 67537440.
