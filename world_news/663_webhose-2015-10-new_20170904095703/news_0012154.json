Researchers Closing in on Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s Tests Researchers from the Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine, have developed a test that could detect Alzheimer’s before symptoms start by identifying a series of obscure antibodies. Scientists narrowed down the auto-antibodies he was looking at from a sample of nearly 10,000 to just 10. \nEffects of Cancer Drugs Overestimated in Animal Studies The efficacy of the anticancer drug sunitinib has been overestimated by 45 percent in animal studies, according to new research from McGill University. The team analyzed the relationship between preclinical studies and the anticancer effects in all available animal studies, and found a number of issues throughout their investigation. \nRole Found for Critical Gene in 95% of ALS Cynthia Fox interviewed experts about a recent Science study that offered new insight surrounding a protein called TDP-43 in relation to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study found that in 95 percent of ALS cases the protein leaves its home – the nucleus of motor neuron cells – resulting in the creation of improper “cryptic” exons. \nSome Stem Cells Are Rejected, Some Aren’t, Says iPSC Work Scientists weigh in on a new Cell Stem Cell paper, that showed embryonic stem (ES) cell-like stem cells made from adult cells and changed into eye cells, are not rejected by the immune system. The work, done in “humanized mouse” models, found that while eye cells were accepted, smooth muscle cells made from the same iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) may be rejected by the immune system. \nHigh Stress Jobs May be Linked to Increased Stroke Risk The final story in our round up this week takes a look at a new Neurology study, which found there may be a link between high stress jobs and an increased risk for stroke. After analyzing six studies, comprised of a total of 138,782 participants, researchers concluded that people with high stress jobs (such as waitresses and nursing aides) were 58 percent more likely to have an ischemic stroke than those in low stress jobs (such as natural scientists and architects).
