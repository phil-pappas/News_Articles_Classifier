Newspapers are not newspapers of old. Today they have to keep up with blogs, twitter, facebook etc and compete with dozens of equal if not better news feeds from all over the world.\nWithout comments News24 has become average and bland and offers nothing more than a local focal.\nNews 24 was building a strong community which could have been monetised. Donald Trump should have been running the show; I don’t see him bowing to moaning ninnies.\nComments added spice. So what if some comments are offensive. The really bad ones could have been managed and are easily deleted. Trolls will be trolls. Racists will be racist. So what does News24 geniuses do, they throw out the baby with the bath water.\nIt’s time for people to grow up and develop a thick skin. Christians don’t like atheists showing them up for what they are - so what. Incompetent corrupt officials don’t like commentators ranting against their evil ways – of course they don’t and as we all know; evil flourishes under the cover of darkness.\nThis is censorship. This is small mindedness. This is short-sightedness. News 24 has bowed to political and Christian pressure.\nWhat kind of editor does not realise that comments are also content and content is gold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:20:50.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
