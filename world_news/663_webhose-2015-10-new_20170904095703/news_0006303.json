The competition for these would-be do-gooders is fierce. × Photo: Buck Ennis CEO Stephanie Markowitz of real estate company Rutenberg says her top charities don't include the arts \nThe Yellowstone Park Foundation invited several hundred 20- and 30-somethings to its first benefit for young patrons this month. Tickets to support a “national treasure” cost $100—a relative bargain for the opportunity to hobnob at the Bowery Hotel. For the foundation, it was an investment in the future: building relationships with young professionals who could one day become the philanthropic faces of the organization. \nYellowstone Park is just the latest nonprofit making its move on the so-called millennial generation, who at 86 million make up the largest demographic group in the U.S. In the past few years, New York’s charity circuit has been filled with benefits for young patrons on causes ranging from the Audubon Society to the Guggenheim Museum. \n“It’s increasingly competitive,” said Arielle Patrick, a public-relations executive and co-chair of the Yellowstone event. “We need to get these kids in with parties and then eventually get them on the board.” \nNonprofits are scrambling to attract those born between 1980 and 1995. Millennials are perceived as being more concerned with social issues than the “slacker” generation before them and, as architects of the current dot-com boom, are wealthier, too. They are coming of age professionally just as baby boomers retire, and their tastes and actions are set to dictate the future of philanthropy. To reach them, charities are teaming up with trendy brands to create awareness; building volunteer programs to bring underprivileged kids to cultural events and constructing houses in Africa, for example; and delving into social media to connect with millennial donors. At the same time, established charities have to contend with competition from nonprofits started by the millennials themselves. \n“[Cultivating] millennial donors has become a strategic objective for us in the last year,” said Noreen Springstead, executive director of Manhattan-based WhyHunger, a 40-year-old advocacy nonprofit. “If we don’t get a new generation to grow with us, we’re going to have sustainability problems down the road.” \nYet enticing these new donors takes a lot of work. They aren’t interested in philanthropy as a way to climb the social ladder; they want to change the world. Young donors expect the charities they support to run like businesses, and they like to see sophisticated, timely reports on how a charity is functioning and where their dollars are going. \n“The millennials expect engagement from their charities, like how we are going to collaborate together to create something new,” Springstead said. “Our older donors are more like, ‘I’ll write you a check and get a tax receipt for it.’” \nStefani Markowitz, 28, chief executive of Rutenberg, a Manhattan-based real estate company with more than 615 agents, is a budding philanthropist, though she won’t disclose how much she gives. Her top charities don’t include the arts, however. She funds veterans’ assistance group Wounded Warriors, and works with it to help veterans find jobs in her company. She also is a strong supporter of New York City Rescue Mission, which helps homeless people, and donates to Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. \n“The issues I give to are a bit more [serious] than arts and culture, so they hit closer to home for me,” Markowitz said. \nA trend among millennial entrepreneurs has been to integrate charity work into their businesses as a way to burnish their brands. In its first effort at reaching millennials, WhyHunger recently partnered with a young fashion company, Collection 18, that designed a scarf for the charity to sell at its fundraiser last Thanksgiving. The two collaborated on a separate benefit, and WhyHunger found opportunities for employees at Collection 18 to volunteer. The efforts helped raise about $50,000. Now the company is designing a product for the charity to sell. \nThe majority of nonprofits founded by millennials deal with major issues like global poverty, education and the environment. With their slick websites and branding, they pose major competition to long-standing charities. Adam Braun, 31, founded Pencils of Promise in 2006 after working as a consultant at Bain & Co. The nonprofit, which builds schools in the developing world, has raised more than $28 million since its founding. Each school it builds costs only $25,000 and offers a tangible way for donors to connect with the cause. \n“There’s an expectation now that when you make a contribution, you can see the impact you are having,” Braun said. \nTo remain relevant, cultural groups must prove their worth. The Guggenheim Museum, for example, has expanded the reach of its Young Collectors Council. Its members are invited to join the committee that meets twice a year to vote on the works of art the museum should buy for its collection. The number of Young Collectors Council members has jumped 52% in the past two years, to 374, Guggenheim executives said. \nLincoln Center for the Performing Arts, meanwhile, started a group eight years ago for patrons in their 30s. It now has 300 members to whom it offers special performances and events. In the past year, Lincoln Center has offered more volunteer opportunities for these members, such as helping out at performances for underprivileged children.“Young patrons are very concerned about the impact of what they are doing, and we’re trying to address that,” said Kristel Kempin, manager of individual giving at Lincoln Center. \nDespite efforts from nonprofits to attract these donors for the long haul, they are dealing with a fickle cohort. Observers say millennials jump on a project or fundraiser to help out because a friend is involved and later move on to another cause. \nDoug Messer, 22, the co-founder of technology company University Beyond, has hosted fundraisers for Operation Smile, raised money for the Maria Fareri Children’s Hospital in Westchester and volunteered for a trendy new charity, F**k Cancer. Though he would like to join a board in the future, he’s content to dabble among an array of groups. \n“There are so many initiatives out there,” he said. “It’s nice to touch several different causes than be hyperfocused on one.” A version of this article appears in the October 19, 2015, print issue of Crain's New York Business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:12:12.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
