It has a thinner and lighter profile with a new 4:3 aspect ratio, but the specs bump is small and battery life is short. For Verdict \nWhen I first wrote about the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, my dad remarked of the news story , \"So, I heard Samsung is making a new iPad?\" \nThis perfectly sums up how average consumers view tablets as a product category. Apple now makes the Kleenex or, in the UK, Sellotape of tablets, and they're called iPads. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 doesn't do much to differentiate itself, aside from running Android, with two new screen sizes that match the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 in a 4:3 aspect ratio. \nPrices are also identical, at $499 (£399, AU$599) for the 9.7-inch tablet, and $399 (£319, AU$499) for its 8-inch mini equivalent. However, Samsung's devices start at 32GB of space, while Apple's entry-level models are still a paltry 16GB. \nIt's really no wonder as to why there's mainstream confusion. Samsung and Apple are making phones that mirror each other more, if you look at the iPhone 6S and Samsung Galaxy S6 . \nThe good news is that, once I got to hold the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 in my hands, I discovered some differences that favor Samsung's new tablets, and a few that do not. \nWeight, design, and software features make the new Galaxy Tab one of the best tablets to date, even though the slate looks like it's doing its best impression of an iPad and isn't too different from last year's Samsung tablets. Design \nThe Galaxy Tab S2 feels nicer to hold in two hands than the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and its sibling, the Galaxy Tab 8.4. In fact, it's now light enough to comfortably clutch in one hand. \nWeighing just 389g for the 9.7-inch tablet and 265g for the 8-inch version, it sheds the extra weight of last year's models and it's also noticeably lighter than Apple's entire iPad line. \nThat's a big deal, believe it or not, because holding the larger Tab S2 in its ideal position – in bed reading Flipboard while holding the tablet in the air – isn't a strain over long periods of time. \nSimilarly, throwing this tablet in a backpack feels like no extra weight has been added. It's easy to store and effortless hold, even with its near-iPad dimensions. \nIt measures 237 x 169 x 5.6mm for the 9.7-inch version, and 199 x 135 x 5.6mm for the 8-inch model, beating Apple's sub-pencil-thin thickness that has a depth of 6.1 mm. \nThe Samsung Tab S2 is lighter in part because it is backed by a soft touch plastic cover instead of an aluminium shell. Metal edges outline the tablet instead of a plastic frame this time. \nThe entire device may not be metal, but it does feel smooth. It's better than the dimpled plastic of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S, yet remains just as grippy. \nTwo small, springy buttons are embedded into the back of the Tab S2, but they're meant for clipping a cover onto the tablet and aren't releases to pop off the back. It's all sealed shut. \nThere is, however, a microSD card slot on the frame to optionally boost the 32GB and 64GB configurations with an additional 128GB of expandable storage. \nAlongside this same rail are a solid-feeling power button and volume rocker. Stereo speakers, a headphone jack and an off-center micro USB port line the bottom of the tablet. \nThe Tab S2 has a physical, fingerprint-sensing home button in front with the usual oval shape, and two capacitive buttons on either side. These keys light up by default every time the display is touched. \nThe beams of light are a bit distracting when scrolling and reading text near the bottom of the screen, and turning them off in settings doesn't help orient your fingers in the dark. This wider tablet isn't like a narrower phone, where you know the exact location of these keys. \nThe latest Galaxy Tab comes in three colors: Black, White and Gold. Gone are the fancy names like Dazzling White and Titanium Bronze, reflecting Samsung's minimalist design with this year's ultra-thin tablet. Display \nSamsung has the best displays among smartphones with its Galaxy S6 and Note 5 handsets, and the same is mostly true of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. \nIt boasts a bright Super AMOLED screen with vivid colors and a 2,048 x 1,536 resolution that matches the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4. That's good, but not the best from Samsung. \nThe Galaxy Tab S slates had a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600 with more pixels per inch. The Tab S2 is technically a step down, even if you can't notice at first glance. \nWhat happened? While the S1 sported a narrow, movie-friendly 16:9 aspect ratio, the new Tab S2 is wider, with a letter paper-sized 4:3 aspect ratio. It's more suited for web browsing. \nSamsung dialed back the resolution in its rejiggering of the screen, but that the pixel count shouldn't concern you as much as the aspect ratio, especially for widescreen movie watchers. \nThe Galaxy Tab S2 display is still really sharp and vibrant, but has a different objective that's bent on three things: web surfing, Flipboard reading and iPad rivaling. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:28:38.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
