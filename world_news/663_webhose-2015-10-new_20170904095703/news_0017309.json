The company’s freewares RollBack Rx Home Edition and Reboot Restore Rx are also fully compatible, protecting the OS for all users for free. \nOriginally a Windows 10 build was scheduled for January, 2016, but due to popular demand Horizon DataSys shifted its development priorities and worked hard to put out a stable build before the new year. Today this build was made available to the public. \n“This update happened because of our users,” said Lyle Patel, CEO and President of Horizon DataSys. “Without their passion and care for our product to work on their newly updated machines, we would have stuck to our original release date. However, after we saw how much it meant for them to have our software on their Windows 10 PCs, we knew we had to put extra resources into that part of our development.” \nRollBack Rx, the PC time machine , and the company’s restore on reboot software Drive Vaccine, are now able to be installed safely onto the 110 million computers that have already adopted Microsoft’s latest operating system. The company’s Microsoft steadystate alternative Reboot Restore Rx is also ready to be installed on Windows 10 machines, and will soon be followed by our imaging solution Drive Cloner Rx. \nRollBack Rx can take virtually unlimited snapshots of the harddrive covering all data, programs, drivers, and more. Snapshots are stored on the sector-level of the harddrive and protected with 256-bit AES encryption, virtually eliminating the threat of lost or damaged data due to viruses, malware, or ransomware. \nEach snapshot exists outside of Windows, so if the Operating System (OS) itself is corrupted, the snapshots can still be accessed via the software’s own subsystem which boots outside of Windows. \nFor more information, please visit Horizon DataSys online at www.horizondatasys.com , or call in toll-free at 1-800-496-0148. \nTo try the software for free, please follow this link and on the product page click Download Now. \nAbout Horizon DataSys \nHorizon DataSys Corporation is a privately held software company headquartered in Blaine, Washington which develops, publishes, and distributes branded computer software applications specializing in end-point PC management, OS integrity, and instant restore.
