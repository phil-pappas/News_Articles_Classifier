(Nasdaq: MYL ), a leading global pharmaceutical company, will today at 5:00 p.m. ET host a conference call and webcast to review the clear value to be created for Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO ; TASE) shareholders through Mylan's offer to acquire the company. The call will be hosted by Mylan's Executive Chairman Robert J. Coury , CEO Heather Bresch and CFO John Sheehan . \nMylan will review a comprehensive presentation which outlines how Mylan's offer delivers to Perrigo shareholders an attractive premium and immediate accretion, while also immediately achieving Perrigo's stated business strategy and reducing its future performance risk. Mylan shareholders have recognized the value of, and already supported, the combination, so the focus of the presentation is solely on how it benefits Perrigo shareholders. Key highlights from the presentation include: MULTIPLE MATH IS CLEAR AND COMPELLING: Mylan's offer for Perrigo represents a 19-22x multiple to Perrigo's estimated 2015 calendar year adjusted EBITDA[1] using both Mylan's current share price and its share price on April 7, 2015, the day before Mylan first made its offer public. This is at the high end of comparable deals in the sector over the past few years. Mylan believes this fundamental reality is why no other bidder has emerged in the six months since Mylan first announced its proposal to acquire Perrigo. PERRIGO'S STANDALONE SHARE PRICE WOULD LIKELY BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER TODAY ABSENT MYLAN'S BID: As the market and the healthcare sector have shifted, Mylan believes that Perrigo's share price has unquestionably been supported by its offer. Based on comparable companies, Mylan believes that Perrigo's current hypothetical unaffected stock price would be between approximately $117 and $139, with an average of approximately $129[2]. This is $32 lower than Perrigo's current price and $36 lower than Perrigo's price on April 7, 2015. THE OFFER IS SIGNIFICANTLY ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS, GROWTH AND VALUE CREATION FOR PERRIGO SHAREHOLDERS: Using Perrigo's own analysis in its September 2015 presentation to investors, Mylan will demonstrate that its offer is immediately accretive to Perrigo shareholders. The accretion significantly increases if Perrigo shareholders decide to reinvest the $75 per share in cash they will receive back into the combined company. Perrigo's math also shows that a combined Mylan + Perrigo would have higher long-term adjusted diluted EPS growth, as Perrigo's standalone long-term adjusted diluted EPS growth is decelerating. Furthermore, at a range of pro forma P/E Multiples, using Perrigo's math, the transaction results in immediate value creation for Perrigo shareholders – with the value per share increasing over time as synergies are achieved. RECEIVE A PREMIUM OR PAY A PREMIUM: Perrigo shareholders will need to consider the compelling value of the $6.5 billion implied premium[3] being offered in contrast to Perrigo's own uncertain standalone future and stated strategy of delivering a premium to other parties to support its growth going forward. This is exacerbated by the fact that Perrigo's own numbers indicate its organic revenues have turned negative in fiscal year 2015[4], underscoring its need to pursue an uncertain acquisition strategy. PERRIGO EARNINGS DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON A THIRD PARTY ROYALTY, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE UNDER PRESSURE FROM POTENTIAL COMPETING THERAPIES: Concern over Perrigo's core business is only heightened when its reliance on the Tysabri® royalty for its adjusted diluted earnings per share is examined. Mylan estimates that the revenue stream from Perrigo's specialty sciences segment (primarily comprised of the Tysabri® royalty) represents approximately 28% of Perrigo's adjusted diluted EPS for calendar year 2015[5]. This highly priced product in an increasingly competitive therapeutic category is expected to be under pressure from potential competing therapies. On a pro-forma basis, Mylan expects the specialty sciences segment (primarily Tysabri®) to represent less than 10% of the adjusted diluted EPS for the combined company for calendar year 2015[6]. \nMylan's Executive Chairman Robert J. Coury commented, \"We are now entering the final stages of our offer for Perrigo and are confident that Perrigo shareholders will support us by tendering their shares and making this attractive offer a reality. We believe shareholders recognize the compelling value of our offer, which includes a significant cash component, and that they understand the exciting growth potential of the combined company. By using Perrigo's own published numbers from its recent defensive presentations, we demonstrate clearly in our presentation that the offer delivered to Perrigo shareholders is the best available opportunity for value creation, which is why we believe no alternative has been or will be presented from a third party. Further, we believe that our offer is superior to Perrigo's so-called \"base plus, plus, plus\" strategy, given its risks and uncertainties. We very much look forward to speaking with Perrigo's shareholders in these final weeks and, with their support, soon welcoming Perrigo, Omega and their employees to Mylan in November.\" \nUnder the terms of Mylan's offer, Perrigo shareholders will receive $75 in cash and 2.3 Mylan ordinary shares for each Perrigo ordinary share. On September 14, 2015 Mylan officially commenced its formal offer to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of Perrigo. \nThe offer is being made in accordance with Mylan's announcement (dated April 24, 2015 and amended on April 29, 2015 and on August 13, 2015) pursuant to Rule 2.5 of Irish Takeover Rules that set forth Mylan's legally binding commitment to commence an offer and the Offer to Exchange / Prospectus (being the offer document for the purposes of the Irish Takeover Rules) dated September 14, 2015. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire at 1:00 P.M. (Irish time)/8:00 A.M. ( New York City time) on November 13, 2015, unless the offer is extended with the consent of the Irish Takeover Panel. The acceptance condition for the offer requires greater than 50% of Perrigo ordinary shares to have been tendered into the offer. \nA copy of the Offer to Exchange/Prospectus and other related materials have been mailed to Perrigo shareholders and the Offer to Exchange/Prospectus is available at perrigotransaction.mylan.com. \nThe dial-in number to access the call is 800.514.4861 or 678.809.2405 for international callers.

Mylan has mailed the Offer to Exchange/Prospectus to Perrigo shareholders in connection with the Perrigo Proposal. This communication is not intended to be, and is not, a substitute for such filings or for any other document that Mylan may file with the SEC in connection with the Perrigo Proposal.

Such documents will be available free of charge through the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to Mylan at 724-514-1813 or investor.relations@mylan.com . Any materials filed by Mylan with the SEC that are required to be mailed to shareholders of Perrigo and/or Mylan will also be mailed to such shareholders.

Accordingly, copies of this communication are not being, and must not be, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into, or from any such jurisdiction. Therefore, persons who receive this communication (including, without limitation, nominees, trustees and custodians) and are subject to the laws of any such jurisdiction will need to inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable restrictions or requirements. Any failure to do so may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Mylan disclaims any responsibility or liability for the violations of any such restrictions by any person. \nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \nThis communication includes the presentation and discussion of certain financial information that differs from what is reported under GAAP. Mylan's non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"adjusted diluted EPS\"), are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of Mylan's financial performance. Mylan has also presented certain non-GAAP financial measures for Perrigo, including, but not limited to, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, which have been taken from published sources. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for forecasting, budgeting and measuring its operating performance. In addition, primarily due to acquisitions, Mylan believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with GAAP. Also, Mylan has provided below reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, other than Perrigo's 2015E adjusted diluted EPS company guidance and Thomson Reuters consensus estimates of adjusted EBITDA which cannot be reconciled as they are from a third party source. Mylan does not endorse or adopt Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 0 GOOD Related medicine technology :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:57:50.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
