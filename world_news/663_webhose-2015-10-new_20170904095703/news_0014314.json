Those who continue after their trial periods end pay $10 a month for individual accounts or $15 a month for family plans.\nIn August, Apple said 11 million people had tried the service, and trial periods began to expire at the end of September. Since then, the music industry has been eagerly awaiting Apple’s subscriber numbers, while the company’s executives have made various public statements that they were aware of early problems with the service — like jumbled playlists — and were working to resolve them.\nAccording to FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives , Apple Music, which was introduced at the end of June, is off to a “solid start,” and he would “characterize this initial stage of the launch as a ‘triple’ in the streaming ballgame.”\nThe service’s success shouldn’t come as a surprise, though. Any iPhone that was upgraded to iOS 8.4 automatically had Apple Music installed, and the service also comes on all newer iPhones sold in stores. In the first quarter of 2015, the company sold 74.5 million iPhones.\nIn addition to music streaming, Apple Music also offers the Beats 1 around-the-clock radio station, curated playlists and a “connect” feature that lets users follow artists, who then share with fans special content such as new songs and behind-the-scenes photos.\nSpotify last revealed its user numbers in June, when it said it had 20 million paying users around the world and another 55 million who use its advertising-supported free version.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:08:10.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
