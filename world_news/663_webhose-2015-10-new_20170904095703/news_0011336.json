The directed energy weapons market is classified into five major segments, namely, by application, by high energy laser, by product, by end-user, and by technology. \nPune, India - October 16, 2015 /MarketersMedia/ — \nThe world directed energy weapons market size is projected to reach USD 24.3 billion by the end of 2020, at a CAGR of 23.96% from 2015 to 2020.North America is estimated to hold the largest share of the directed energy weapons market, followed by Europe. \nComplete report on Directed Energy Weapons Market spread across 185 pages, profiling 11 companies and supported with 91 tables and 90 figures is now available at http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/directed-energy-weapons-market-by-application-defense-homeland-security-technology-high-energy-laser-high-power-microwave-particle-beam-high-energy-laser-systems-fiber-laser-free-electron-laser-solid-state-laser-chemical-lase-market-report.html . \nIn the Middle East, this market is projected to grow at the highest CAGR of 34.12% from 2015 to 2020.This high growth rate is attributed to the rise in military expenditure and strategic relationships with Latin America. Directed energy weapons emit focused energy on to the target at the speed of light to damage or destroy it. Hi-tech innovations as well as technological advancements are changing the nature of warfare. \nDEW’s are used by the U.S. Navy in maritime operations as well as by warfighters and homeland defenders. Ongoing growth and development in this emerging area strongly highlights the changing battlefield with the introduction of DEW, lethal, and non-lethal weapons. With the proliferation of low power laser weapons, the proliferation of high power or high energy weapons is also expected in coming years. \nToday’s defense forces encounter multiple challenges in diverse operating environments around the globe. The kinetic energy weapons, such as small arms, bombs, shells, missiles, and cluster munitions are costlier and ineffective to employ against asymmetric threats in opposition to DEW. \nThe DEW market comprises a few large players and several small players. Technological advancements, availability of new products, and evolving industry standards are propelling the growth of this market. New product launches was the key growth strategies adopted by players in the DEW market. This strategy was employed by players to widen and strengthen their product portfolio. Acquisitions and collaborations, agreements, and partnerships were other key areas of focus for market players. \nOrder a copy of Directed Energy Weapons Market by Application (Defense, Homeland Security), Technology (High Energy Laser, High Power Microwave, Particle Beam), High Energy Laser Systems (Fiber Laser, Free Electron Laser, Solid-State Laser, Chemical Laser), Product (Lethal, Non-Lethal), End User (Ship-based, Land Vehicles, Airborne, Gun-shot) & Geography - Forecast & Analysis to 2015 – 2020 research report at http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/contacts/purchase?rname=422105 . \nOn a related note, Smart Weapons Market forecasts at a CAGR of around 8.21% from 2014 to 2020 to reach $6.1 billion by 2020 for smart weapons industry.
