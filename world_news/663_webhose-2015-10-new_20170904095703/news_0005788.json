Anirban Sen | 15 October 2015, 9:18 AM IST Share BENGALURU: A few months ago, a top executive from one of the world's largest home improvement companies organised an informal pitching session for startups at the Humming Tree restaurant in the upscale neighborhood of Indiranagar in Bengaluru.Even as the beer flowed, founders of local startups walked up to pitch ideas, amid loud bar music in the background, to this executive who is now working on one of the most important and disruptive bets being undertaken by US-based Lowe's: a next-generation corporate accelerator for Indian startups, right in the heart of Bengaluru.Meet Kyle Nel, who perhaps aptly holds the title of chief disruption officer at the $70-billion Lowe's, possibly the only executive to hold such a title in the corporate world.Nel and his team at Lowe's is currently working on applying concepts in traditional retail that would not be out of place in a Star Trek movie using science fiction to build futuristic home improvement simulators and artificially intelligent robots that will completely eliminate the possibility of human error.\"In an organisation you need to have someone intentionally push that organisation in a different direction, if you believe that you have to change in order to grow,\" said Nel in an interview with ET.\"Because if you don't innovate, you don't exist. If you're lucky you become irrelevant a lot of companies just cease to exist. And it's happening faster and faster.Moore's law does not apply just to semiconductors and chips it applies to other organisations too.\" And for Nel and his team at Lowenvie's Innovation Labs, it is their job to look for ideas and solutions that can potentially disrupt Lowe's in the future.To that end, Nel is reimagining the concept of physical brick-and-mortar stores that can potentially be replaced by virtual-reality stores.\"Take our Holoroom for example nobody had done a virtualreality store or showroom like that before, on that scale. This was years ago and we put it out there to show the outside and startup world that we were in it to do virtual and augmented reality and we call that the Batsignal,\" he said.The company has even hired science-fiction writers to imagine what the future may look like from a retail perspective.\"If you look at all those funny cartoons and comics from the 20s and 30s about what the future would be like, they were way off. We were way off on what 2015 was going to be but they were right on certain things. If you believe you can't accurately predict the future... then you have to actively participate in the future,\" said Nel.\"So we do what we call Science Fiction Prototyping we give all of our marketing research and trend data to professional, publicised fiction writers and they envision probable scenarios it's not predicting the future, it's probable scenarios where tech and people trends might possibly converge,\" he said. \"And that helps us to see a snapshot of what could be and then we can work backwards from that.\"Another project that Lowe's is working on involves HAL 9000-like autonomous robotic systems. \"Autonomous robots sounds like Jetson's sort of crazy stuff, but we co-developed this with a startup out of Singularity University. And it started as a story in January last year and we rolled it out in October last year,\" said Nel.Nel and his team are currently working on several other disruptive moonshots that the company will launch over the next few months. Over the next few days, he will park himself in the front rows of more startup-pitching sessions in Bengaluru, as he hunts for more disruptive ideas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:31:52.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
