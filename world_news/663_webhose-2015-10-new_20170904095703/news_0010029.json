Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) excludes restructuring charges, acquisition related charges, inventory provisions including charges related to purchase accounting, contingency accruals, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of note discounts and deferred financing costs, and certain other adjustments described in the reconciliation table. API has also provided the non-GAAP financial measure for Adjusted EBITDA before corporate overhead, which is the Adjusted EBITDA number less general corporate overhead. Management believes the supplemental non-GAAP presentations provide investors an additional analytical tool for understanding the Company's financial performance by excluding from operating results the impact of items that management believes do not reflect the Company's core operating performance. These are not recognized measures under US GAAP, do not have a standardized meaning, and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Accordingly, investors are cautioned that these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings or loss determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of the financial performance of the Company or as a measure of the Company's liquidity and cash flows. We expect our financial statements to continue to be affected by items similar to those excluded in the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that all such costs are unusual or infrequent. \nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements Except for statements of historical fact, the information presented herein constitutes forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions, including without limitation, reductions in government defense spending; government regulations; our ability to integrate and consolidate our operations; our ability to expand our operations in both new and existing markets; and the ability of our review of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material aspects from those currently anticipated. The forward-looking statements in this news release should be read in conjunction with the more detailed descriptions of the above factors located in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under Part II, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" as well as those additional factors we may describe from time to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
