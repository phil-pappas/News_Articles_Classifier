What good is that?\" Lee said. \"This is a new spin on the lifestyle of being able to go to beach with it or go to the pool. You can do a speakerphone conference right on the water. People can use them in the shower.\"\nMonster's 24 Karat BackFloat Bluetooth speaker. (Photo: Monster)\nThe new headphones, the ROC Sport black platinum over-ear headphones ($329.95), are part of Monster's new premium product line designed for and endorsed by international soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. The company got serious traffic -- more than 30 million views -- this August with an online promotional video showing Ronaldo in disguise as a homeless man kicking a soccer ball in a Madrid, Spain square. \"He’s the megastar of megastars,\" Lee said.\nThe headphones have a \"very rich finish\" and the sound \"is my best work,\" Lee said.\nMonster's ROC Sport Black Platinum headphones. (Photo: Monster)\nIn December, Lee begins filming a six-episode Nickelodeon series called Make It Monster with America's Got Talent host Nick Cannon, who's been a Monster product advisor for years and will be the show's producer. The two will conduct a Shark Tank -like process for young entrepreneurs for kids and teens.\nWanna-be startups can show off their inventions to Lee, Cannon and retailers. \"He and I have always focused on youth,\" Lee said. \"We’ll choose the most innovative invention and we will commit to making it and retail will stock it.\"\nRecording artist Nick Cannon looks at a model wearing a new headphone by Monster during a new conference at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Monday, Jan. 7, 2013. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP)\nMonster Cable, founded by Lee in 1979, originally specialized in high-quality audio and video cables. But it became simply \"Monster\" as its product category expanded over the years.\nMonster co-designed the Beats By Dr. Dre headphones that kickstarted the high-end stylish headphone category in 2008. Earlier this year, Lee filed suit against Beats, which was acquired by Apple in May 2014. Attorneys are still taking depositions, Lee says. \"It's kind of like the calm before the storm,\" he said.\nUSA TODAY\nTech firm Monster sues Beats and founders Dre and Iovine\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LOMV5x TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4f175ec7062100a59ffc8ee3097bd39f3a4800bf/c=164-0-2856-2024&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811068512917613-AP-GADGET-SHOW-MONSTER-53498681.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b79646852281ae634a5c568100c75c1dd6aae74f/c=647-0-3413-2766/local/-/media/2015/01/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635561670589312171-XXX-MONSTER-TECH-HDB229-25279569.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LOMV5x&text=Monster%20sports%20new%20new%20headphones%2C%20Bluetooth%20speaker%20and%20Nickelodeon%20TV%20show&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2d91ae8236323a5b2d566f5289be3ed741d8f40e/c=326-0-5433-3840&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811015654786781-Monster-L10-3452-Noel-Ronaldo-Nike.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/985c55527eefa30429604e5021dd0990b52cd2ee/c=151-0-489-254&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811015534510010-Monster-24K-BackFloat.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811015654786781-Monster-L10-3452-Noel-Ronaldo-Nike.jpeg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LOMV5x&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/MikeSnider", "https://www.videoandaudiocenter.com/articles.asp?ID=310", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811015654786781-Monster-L10-3452-Noel-Ronaldo-Nike.jpeg", "http://usat.ly/1LOMV5x", "http://www.monsterproducts.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/046612fe4058f1dc8d9bbd8742acf6b1b7e88afd/c=0-109-3999-5441&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811019520803563-ROCsport-Black-Platinum-Over-Ear-Headphones-by-Monster-1-.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:09:58.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
