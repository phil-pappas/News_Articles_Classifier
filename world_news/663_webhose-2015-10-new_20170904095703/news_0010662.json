Including the amendment in the legislation would help “remove this roadblock to cyber defense.” \nAt issue is an amendment to the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act offered by Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark. As written, the legislation would provide liability protection only when threats are shared with DHS. Under Cotton’s amendment, the protection would be extended to cover sharing with all three agencies. \n“NRF is leading the fight against data theft because the retailer-consumer relationship depends on trust, and cyberattacks erode that trust,” NRF Senior Vice President for Government Relations David French. “Hackers target a wide variety of businesses, but data thefts committed against retailers draw the most attention because retail stores are names consumers know and places where they shop every day. Retailers are committed to combating this criminal threat to our customers and the industry.” \nNRF has led a sustained campaign over the past decade to address data security and protect retail customers. In addition to advocating for information-sharing legislation like today’s Senate bill, NRF has supported passage of a uniform federal data breach notification law to replace separate laws in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Notification legislation has been a top priority in Congress during 2015, and NRF testified before a Senate hearing in February that a federal law should cover banks, card processors and all entities that handle sensitive consumer data, not just retailers. \nPassage of the information sharing legislation would aid the work of NRF’s Information Technology Security Council , which was established last year to help retailers keep up to date on the latest cyber threat news, information and threats. More than 150 retail companies are actively involved in the council. \nNRF is the world’s largest retail trade association, representing discount and department stores, home goods and specialty stores, Main Street merchants, grocers, wholesalers, chain restaurants and Internet retailers from the United States and more than 45 countries. Retail is the nation’s largest private sector employer, supporting one in four U.S. jobs – 42 million working Americans. Contributing $2.6 trillion to annual GDP, retail is a daily barometer for the nation’s economy. NRF’s This is Retail campaign highlights the industry’s opportunities for life-long careers, how retailers strengthen communities, and the critical role that retail plays in driving innovation.
