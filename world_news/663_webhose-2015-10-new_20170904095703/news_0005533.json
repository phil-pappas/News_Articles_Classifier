The team in Wales carry out ongoing research and development as well as working on deployment. Maintaining and growing the workforce in Cardiff is seen as a long term commitment by Sapiens and of strategic importance to sustain the ongoing development and deployment of the ALIS life and pensions solution.\n\"The life and pensions market has seen fundamental changes in the last few years, particularly in the UK, with more recent legislation giving people more freedom as to what they do with their pension pot. At the same time, people are retiring earlier, but living longer and have differing needs as they progress through the different ages and stages of retirement. The work of the Cardiff office through ALIS helps insurance companies to deploy innovative products that support their customers as they seek new and innovative retirement solutions to fund their retirement,\" says Raj Ghuman VP Business Development - Sapiens UK, Nordics and Africa .\nHe continues, \"Our people at Cardiff office will continue to support both existing and new customer deployments globally for ALIS our life, pensions and annuities solution, but also our broad range of insurance focused solutions. We anticipate continued and rapid growth of the UK workforce, many of whom will be in Cardiff office.\"\nSapiens has had a run of success with new customers for many of its insurance solutions. The company has recently celebrated two customer wins for ALIS. Eurolife in Cyprus is using the solution to support the complete policy lifecycle and replace the company's legacy environment and support all of their investment and health lines of business. ALIS is also being deployed with FNB - a financial institution providing personal, private, business and commercial banking services to millions of customers across South Africa , who has selected Sapiens ALIS for the launch of its new life insurance company.\nSapiens IDIT Software Suite (Sapiens IDIT) was recently chosen by Tradex Insurance Company Ltd., a specialty insurer in all sectors of the motor trade, to modernize and enhance its core insurance processing environment. And earlier this year announced the successful go-live of the Sapiens Reinsurance solution at West Bend Mutual Insurance Company (West Bend), a US-based property and casualty insurer that offers products across the Midwest.
