For the first time, Canon U.S.A., Inc., a leader in digital imaging, today announced it will join Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Printing Applications Laboratory, in offering a streamlined media certification process. This collaboration will help photography, fine art and paper vendors determine and promote compatibility with the imagePROGRAF portfolio, including the newly announced imagePROGRAF PRO-1000. \nAs part of this Canon Alliance Partner Program (CAPP), an initiative that allows third-party suppliers and vendors to align their business goals with Canon products, RIT will test media with imagePROGRAF systems to confirm compatibility. The testing looks into both paper properties and print properties. A few of the attributes tested include grammage, caliper, opacity, registration, line raggedness and optical density, among many others.* Upon passing the test, vendors will receive a certification enabling them to advertise media compatibility with imagePROGRAF systems. \nIn addition to helping photographers identify high-quality media, the certification can also unlock a realm of new possibilities for vendors, including the potential to expand the customer base, opportunities to be included in future imagePROGRAF portfolios, company presence on the Canon U.S.A. website, partnership with Canon for trade shows and access to imagePROGRAF systems. \nRIT’s Printing Applications Lab provides the print industry with empirical approaches to control and improve the quality of their products and expand on the knowledge of industry professionals. From media certification programs to assistance with product development and corporate education programs, RIT’s Printing Applications Lab has the tools to educate industry professionals, and help companies improve existing products. \nFor more information and to apply for the certification, visit www.usa.canon.com/cusa/office/standard_display/alliance_main/alliance_largeformat . \nAbout Canon U.S.A., Inc. \nCanon U.S.A., Inc., is a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business, and industrial digital imaging solutions to the United States and to Latin America and the Caribbean (excluding Mexico) markets.
