While a wave of asset sales in recent years left Vivendi with a roughly €9 billion war chest, Mr. Bolloré has so far made only relatively small purchases, such as buying French online-video firm Dailymotion or building a minority stake in Italian telecommunications company Telecom Italia.\nThe purchase of stakes in two videogame companies marks a contrast with Vivendi's exit two years ago from its controlling stake in U.S.-based videogame giant Activision Blizzard Inc. At the time, Vivendi was under pressure to sell off assets to boost a sagging share price.\nUbisoft is one of the largest videogame makers in the world, known for franchises like Assassin's Creed. Gameloft is a smaller firm that has seen success by making games for mobile phones. Both companies are based in the Paris area.\nWrite to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 13:25 ET (17:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:41:33.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
