(OTCMKS:WEST), a supplier of integrated solar power systems, today announced its second quarter 2015 financial results. Over the past few months it has became clear that it is critical for Andalay to substantially reduce its operating expenses, and that Andalay lacked the scale and resources to continue with the full service distribution business. The future success of the Company rests not just on pursuing a licensing strategy but also to ensure that its operating expenses are as low as possible.\n“We had to make many painful decisions to significantly reduce our expenses and spend time to set up the new relationships with strategic partners, and can now report that our ongoing expense run rate is less than 50% of what it had been in the first half of 2015,” commented Steven Chan, President & CEO. “There have certainly been some transitional issues with migrating to this leaner company structure which we hope to mostly resolve during this quarter.”\nAs part of this cost reduction effort, Andalay closed its in-house product distribution and installation business, and established two initial distribution partners, Magerack Corporation in California ( http://www.magerack.com ) and Rectify Solar in Indiana ( http://www.rectifysolar.com ), from whom existing and prospective customers are now able to purchase both the Andalay mounting hardware as well as the Andalay compatible module produced by Hyundai Heavy Industries Ltd.\nAndalay’s licensing strategy for the future is designed to provide economies of scale to reduce working capital strain and facilitate increased gross margins to enable the Company to more rapidly scale sustainable and accretive growth in revenue, as well as eventual profits. The Company will focus on the initiatives related to this which include partnering with a top 20 residential installer or distributor, partnering with Tier One module companies to license the Andalay technology, including the existing license with Hyundai, and focusing on a scalable and lean go-to-market execution plan.\nThe Company is still working with financial advisors to raise capital and settle past debts and accounts payables. It is critical to Andalay’s future that it successfully does this in order to have the financial strength to be able to execute on the future strategy.\nSecond Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was $342,000, compared to $307,000 in the second quarter of 2014 and $275,000 in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue in the second quarter of 2015 increased by $35,000 or 11.4% compared to the same period in the prior year. The sequential increase in revenue of $67,000 or 24.5% was primarily due to increased distribution sales activities.\nGross loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $456,000 or (133.4%) of revenue, compared to a gross profit of $10,000 or 3.3% of revenue for the second quarter of 2014, and a gross loss of $12,000 or (4.3%) of revenue for the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decrease and sequential decrease in gross margin was due to inventory adjustments taken in the second quarter of 2015. Without the inventory adjustment of $354,000, the gross margin of for the second quarter of 2015 would have been (29.9)%.\nTotal operating expenses in the second quarter of 2015 were $718,000 compared to $613,000 for the same period last year and $792,000 for the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year increase is due to higher general and administrative expenses of $102,000 principally associated with higher professional fees and payroll costs partially offset by lower stock compensation expense. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, total operating expenses decreased $74,000 due principally to general and administrative expense of $82,000 and higher sales and marketing expense of $8,000. The sequential decrease in general and administrative costs was due to lower professional fees, UL testing fees, rent and settlement costs. The sequential increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to travel costs. Stock-based compensation expense included in total operating expenses was $40,000 for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $105,000 for the same period of 2014 and $69,000 in the first quarter of 2015. Cash operating expenses (adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense) were $649,000 for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $476,000 for the same period last year and $694,000 for the first quarter of 2015.\nNet loss was $527,000 compared to a net loss of $631,000 in the same period last year, and a net loss of $825,000 in the first quarter of 2015. The net loss includes a favorable non-cash adjustment for relief of debt of $733,000 in the second quarter of 2015 and a favorable non-cash adjustment to the fair value of embedded derivatives of $85,000 in the same period last year and a favorable non-cash adjustment to the fair value of embedded derivatives of $41,000 in the first quarter of 2015.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders (which includes preferred stock dividends) was $527,000 or $0.00 per share in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $636,000 or $0.00 per share in the second quarter of 2014 and $825,000 or $0.00 per share in the first quarter of 2015.\nAbout Andalay Solar: (OTCQB:WEST)\nFounded in 2001, the Company is a designer and manufacturer of integrated solar power systems.
