The fine ash mixed with snow and sleet to dust the city of Kodiak overnight. Officials Wednesday said there have been no reports that the ash has reached a level where it would affect aviation. The Alaska Volcano Observatory says this happens seasonally in the spring and fall during windy and usually drier conditions. The ash is from the 1912 eruption of Novarupta Volcano on the Alaska Peninsula. It was the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. Ash is still visible in Alaska's Katmai National Park, famous for its brown bear population, and the nearby Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The Katmai region is about 275 miles southwest of Anchorage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:36:02.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
