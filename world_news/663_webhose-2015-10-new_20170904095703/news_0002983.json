Being on the list is proof-positive of increasing online sales and awareness of the new marketing workbook, designed to help small business owners and marketers understand everything from Facebook to Twitter, LinkedIn to YouTube, and Pinterest to Yelp for their marketing needs. The book launch includes a no cost review program and a .99 cent discount program on Amazon, which ends on October 31, 2015. “This is the first edition of the social media book,” explained Dr. McDonald, Director of the JM Internet Group. “To have reached Amazon’s ‘Hot New Release’ status so quickly is really exciting, and shows that there is a market for hands-on, practical guides to social media marketing as opposed to the plethora of hype and pie-in-the-sky books by many authors.”\nTo learn more about the Social Media Marketing Workbook, please visit https://www.jm-seo.org/?p=2667 or on Amazon at http://bit.ly/smmworkbook . To view the ‘Hot New Releases’ list for social media marketing for business, please visit http://www.amazon.com/gp/new-releases/books/6133993011/ .\nIntense Demand for the Social Media Marketing Workbook\nThe new Social Media Marketing Workbook makes it easy to market a business on social media platforms from Facebook to LinkedIn, Twitter to Pinterest, YouTube to Yelp. The reality is that most of the books available on social media hype the utility of the platform, without really explaining the “how to” side of using social media as a business marketing mechanism. The hype and excitement around Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are wonderful, of course, but after reading many of the available books, the reader doesn’t have a clue as to how to start, what to do, or how to be an effective marketing.\nThe new book fits with the JM Internet Group’s philosophy of hands-on, practical marketing for busy marketers and business professionals.\nContents of the Book Include –\nAn overview to social media marketing. A detailed, step-by-step explanation of each of the major social platforms: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and Yelp. Instructions on how to identify companies to emulate on each available platform. Guidance on how to identify the best social media for one’s company, plus step-by-step tactics to set up a social media account and begin posting. No cost social media marketing tools via the companion, Social Media Toolbook.\nUsed by Jason McDonald in his online classes as well as classes in the San Francisco Bay Area, including Stanford Continuing Studies, The Social Media Marketing Workbook will gain a space on the “how to” bookshelf of interested businesses, helping them to master the art and science of marketing via the new, new thing: social media.\nAbout JM Internet Group\nThe JM Internet Group of San Jose, California, provides SEO training online at https://www.jm-seo.org/ as well as courses in social media marketing and Google AdWords as well as consulting services. The classes are hands-on, delivered over the Internet, and available for one year to paid students. Its director, Jason McDonald, is a recognized expert in online marketing, with a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and many of the top selling books on Amazon on the subject.\nMedia Relations, Tel. 800-298-4065", "external_links": ["https://www.jm-seo.org/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/new-releases/books/6133993011/", "https://www.jm-seo.org/?p=2667", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2dwL25ldy1yZWxlYXNlcy9ib29rcy82MTMzOTkzMDExLw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2JpdC5seS9zbW13b3JrYm9vaw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam0tc2VvLm9yZy8/cD0yNjY3", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam0tc2VvLm9yZy8=", "http://bit.ly/smmworkbook"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:49:56.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
