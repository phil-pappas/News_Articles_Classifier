Its algorithms integrate and analyze data from the sensors in real time, reflecting the wearer's position in space, pointing direction, hand posture, voice commands and pressure levels. \n\"Bird redefines the way people interact with digital media,\" said MUV Interactive CEO Rami Parham. \"Our team has put together a miracle of engineering that not only supports today's applications, but pushes the envelope of what is possible in future ones.\" \nUsers can move or click the device, which weighs about two-thirds of an ounce. \nThe Bird's partner app uses several plug-ins that can function as a controller for different devices, such as smart appliances or even drones. It also has a microphone for voice-issued commands and a touch surface controlled by the user's thumb for registering swipes and taps. The Bird is compatible with any computer running on Windows or OS X, including mobile devices. \nIt is not necessarily the first gesture-based input device, but others — such as the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Kinect and the Myo Gesture Control Armband — have primarily focused on gaming functions. Bird is the first one to be marketed as an educational tool. \nOrders are now being accepted at a promotional price of $150. Once in full distribution, the devices will likely retail for $250. \nThe Bird is the first product for MUV Interactive, an Israel-based company founded in 2011.
