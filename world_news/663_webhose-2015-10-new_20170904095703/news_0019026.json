It’s a cracking feature, but for those dedicated to the Google -side of things, it’s just not an option. Fortunately, a new Synaptics controller set to bring 3D Touch to Android . \nThe engineering boffins over at Synaptics have cleverly been able to create a touchscreen controller called the ClearPad 3700, which cleverly mimics the 3D Touch capabilities with “variably force sensing” called ClearForce. \nIf that wasn’t enough, they’ve also created technology called SideTouch, which allows the user to use the bezels of their phone to scroll and select, allowing to to see what’s on screen while scrolling. \nIt’s worth noting though that while this technology now exists, it won’t be going into production until the end of the year, and even then manufacturers looking to use this technology will have to use it in an innovative way unless they want the wrath of Apple coming down on them. \nWe could see devices with this technology by 2016, but I have my doubts.
