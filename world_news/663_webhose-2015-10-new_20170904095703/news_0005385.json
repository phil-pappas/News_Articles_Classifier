The simulator is said to offer exciting virtual environments including the Nürburgring as well as test tracks at Volvo Cars’ own secret testing facility in Sweden.\nIt enables the car maker to conduct extremely early stage development work on high speed stability, balance and individual drive mode settings. The new simulator also means more freedom to innovate in the concept development phase and enables shorter development times.\n“The beauty of the new simulator is that it provides us with the opportunity to physically experience the calculation models and evaluate them using human test drivers, rather than staring at graphs and numbers in a meeting room,” said Stefan Karlsson, manager vehicle dynamics at Volvo Car Group.\n“This is further testament to our commitment to human centric development and a cornerstone of developing a driving experience that is truly ‘designed around you’.”\nFor more information on the VI-grade simulator", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/2_"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:59:30.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
