The partnership offers marketers the powerful combination of DISH’s first-ever impression-by-impression programmatic marketplace for linear TV ad inventory, announced today, with Rocket Fuel’s Moment Scoring™ to reach consumers through their TVs, the most coveted and engaging screen for marketers. \n“With just four percent of TV budgets going to Programmatic TV this year, it’s clear that digital marketers have been waiting for a way to reach consumers in that most critical space -- the living room -- with high-quality inventory and mass exposure,“ said Monte Zweben, Interim CEO at Rocket Fuel. “We’re thrilled about this new partnership with DISH. It’s a new frontier for marketers, who now can not only extend programmatic optimization via Moment Scoring to TV, but also take a holistic multi-channel approach in how they align TV with digital advertising.” \n“By partnering with innovators like Rocket Fuel, we’re offering digital advertisers the opportunity to extend the conversation to their target consumer on the big screen,” said Adam Gaynor, vice president of DISH Media Sales. “Our programmatic marketplace provides brands with the same, in-depth controls they demand across digital devices, and the same control of impression-by-impression purchasing.” \nWith today’s announcement, DISH Media Sales has joined Rocket Fuel’s Partner Program as a Gold level partner. The partnership marks Rocket Fuel’s first in Programmatic TV, with additional partners to be added. \nRocket Fuel’s Programmatic TV extends the company’s desktop, tablet, and mobile phone channels to the much-coveted TV screen. With Rocket Fuel’s first-of-its-kind solution, marketers now have a holistic view across a diversity of devices and screens -- not in silos like other solutions. Rocket Fuel’s Moment Scoring uses sophisticated artificial intelligence and its massive big data architecture to identify influential moments, regardless of channel and device. This means marketers can distribute spend accordingly to the highest performing opportunities. \nRocket Fuel’s Programmatic TV offering is currently in beta with ad inventory from DISH Media Sales available to select Rocket Fuel customers. The platform will launch broadly to Rocket Fuel’s full complement of customers in early 2016. \nAbout Rocket Fuel \nA leading Programmatic Marketing Platform provider, Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ: FUEL) offers brands, agencies, and platform partners managed services, as well as a SaaS-based Data Management Platform (DMP) and Demand Side Platform (DSP), to optimize performance, awareness, and lift across marketing objectives, channels and devices.
