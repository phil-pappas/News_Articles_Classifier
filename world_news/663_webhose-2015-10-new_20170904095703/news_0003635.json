FraudPatrol proactively detects and alerts for suspicious transaction activity by closely monitoring JDE production data.\nAtlanta, GA (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nEmeraldCube Solutions, a Gold level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN), today announced it is launching FraudPatrol for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne. FraudPatrol proactively detects and alerts for suspicious transaction activity by closely monitoring JDE production data. FraudPatrol is the latest addition to the EmeraldPrism platform.\n“Fraud in America is a major concern with over $3.7 trillion dollars lost annually by businesses around the world,” said Marcelo Tamassia, Partner, EmeraldCube Solutions. “Most companies have invested in fraud prevention tools, but few companies have proper fraud detection mechanisms in place. Automated proactive data monitoring and analysis is by far the most effective fraud detection solution. Our FraudPatrol solution focuses on securely detecting issues and notifying designated personnel within the organization when breaches occur, proactively stopping fraudulent activity before it’s too late.”\nEmeraldCube’s FraudPatrol utilizes transaction monitoring and sophisticated pattern analysis techniques, along with log mining, to proactively detect, flag, and notify auditors and controllers of any suspicious business activity. The solution performs real-time analysis of payroll and financial transactions most likely to result in asset misappropriation, which makes up an estimated 85% of corporate fraud activity. In addition to financial transactions, FraudPatrol also monitors closely the activity of JD Edwards and System Administrators (CNC), who typically have unrestricted access to JDE.\n”Our FraudPatrol solution is completely secure and effectively detects potential fraud within the JD Edwards EnterpriseOne environment,” said Tamassia.\nFraudPatrol is available as a standalone product or in conjunction with EmeraldCube’s proactive CNC monitoring and alerting solution, EmeraldPrism.
