This post is part of the multidisciplinary project ONFworking with Dr Niall Mac Dowell. This is an ambitious 3-year project aimed at investigating whether, in order to meet climate goals by 2030, biogenic waste derived fuels (such as wood from demolition sites) should be allowed to be burned in large UK combustion plants, or whether it is necessary that such fuels should be burned in dedicated plants. The role will focus on the development of grey-box models of the power plant and clean-up systems. \nThe post holder will be expected to take on a leadership role within the project, interacting closely with their colleagues in other departments at Imperial College, and other academic institutions in the UK. You will also be responsible for the integration of the outputs of the other work packages. \nYou must have a PhD or equivalent qualification in an appropriate science or engineering subject, and relevant experience working in an allied area. You will have a proven track record in conducting high quality research, as evidenced by innovative publications in peer reviewed journals and experience in using equation orientated process modelling, simulation and optimisation, e.g., gPROMS or ASPEN Custom Modeller. Experience in the application of advanced optimisation techniques to detailed mathematical models and facility to work across a number of consillient science and engineering disciplines is also essential. Expertise in the application of advanced modelling techniques to Chemical and/or Mechanical Engineering processes, and familiarity with the various challenges associated with CCS processes are desirable. \nYou must have experience of working in a team, the ability to develop and apply new concepts and have a creative approach to problem-solving. You must have the ability to express scientific concepts verbally and in writing and be able to organise your own work with minimal supervision and prioritise in response to deadlines. \nThis is a full-time fixed term position available for up to 18 months, starting shortly after 1 January 2016, based at the South Kensington Campus. \nOur preferred method of application is online via our website at http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/job-applicants (please select “Job Search” then enter the job title or vacancy reference number NS 2015 217 LP into “Keywords”).
