Facebook users have complained in the past about having difficulties accessing the site, but the government denied blocking it, though it has tried to block other sites. \nVietnam has a fairly young population with about two-thirds of its 90 million people born after the Vietnam War. Nearly half of Vietnamese are Internet users, according to government figures. \nVietnam has more than 30 million Facebook users with 75 percent of them between ages 18 to 34, according to state-run Vietnam Television.
