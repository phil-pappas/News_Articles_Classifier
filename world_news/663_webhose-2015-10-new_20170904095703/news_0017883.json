The move is part of an attempt by Amazon to promote its own video service and is the latest sign of fractures in the entertainment landscape caused by new forms of video delivery. \nAmazon did not explicitly name Apple and Google but said that it would only sell devices for playing internet video on a TV if they carried its in-house streaming video service, known as Prime Video. The Apple TV and Google’s Chromecast do not carry the service but it is available on the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation games consoles. More Alphabet puzzle is all about perceptions \n“It’s important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion,” the company said. “Roku, Xbox, PlayStation and Fire TV are excellent choices.” \nThe move, which was first reported by Bloomberg, highlights how the tech companies have turned to a variety of tactics, from control of devices, exclusive content deals and retail distribution, to build audiences for their growing digital media empires. \nAmazon, which has included streaming video as part of its flat-rate Prime service for the past three years, won the first official entertainment industry recognition for its original programming recently when Transparent , its show about a transgender father, won five Emmy awards . \nIn a sign of its burgeoning ambitions, it agreed to pay $250m this year to sign up the former presenters of the BBC’s Top Gear show for a three-year period. \nMeanwhile, on Thursday, Google announced that HBO’s “over-the-top” streaming service, called HBO Now, would be available on its Android TV devices. \nThe service was originally available for an exclusive period on Apple TV, which was relaunched last month with a new focus on apps and games. Apple has been seeking a content edge over its tech rivals by putting together a package of mainstream video channels but has yet to persuade content owners to sign up.
