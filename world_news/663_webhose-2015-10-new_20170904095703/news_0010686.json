Mr. Robbins, for example, said he has seen signs that officials there don't want to rely entirely on Huawei.\n\"If the Chinese government wanted us out, we would be out,\" Mr. Robbins said.\nFor Qualcomm, a dominant supplier of chips that provide processing and wireless functions in smartphones, Mr. Mollenkopf said the settlement with the Chinese government improved his company's relationships with companies there that increasingly are Qualcomm customers. That is important because customers Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. continue to rely on internally developed chips where they can.\n\"Our position in China is stronger,\" Mr. Mollenkopf said.\nBoth companies also have a mutual interest in the Internet of Things, a catchall phrase for the addition of sensing, computing and communications capability to all sorts of everyday devices. The trend increases the flow of data, driving demand for Qualcomm wireless chips and Cisco networking devices.\nMr. Mollenkopf argued that some of the biggest benefits of the trend will be in the area of health care--when a wearable device, for example, can detect signs that would indicate that a user should see a doctor immediately. Qualcomm calls such capability a \"digital sixth sense.\"\nDevices will become \"smart in a way that is nontraditional,\" Mr. Mollenkopf said. Qualcomm, a major supplier of both cellular and Wi-Fi technologies, hopes to supply wireless chips for emerging Internet of Things applications.\nMr. Robbins cited the example of Japanese robot maker Fanuc Corp., whose products are used in applications like manufacturing cars. The right combinations of sensors and other devices can help predict when a robot will fail, he said, the kind of problem that can cost a manufacturer $60,000 a minute.\nBefore such technological wizardry is commonplace, however, \"we have to solve the security issue,\" Mr. Robbins said.\nCisco has used acquisitions and internally developed technology to build a sizable security software business, which Mr. Robbins has identified as one of his company's biggest priorities.\nWrite to Don Clark at don.clark@wsj.com\n 20, 2015 17:17 ET (21:17 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:21:15.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
