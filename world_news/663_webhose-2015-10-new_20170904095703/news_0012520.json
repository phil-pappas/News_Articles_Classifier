The Company defines economic fuel expense as raw fuel expense plus /losses realized through actual cash payments to/ hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivatives settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nSource:-Hawaiian Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:03:27.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
