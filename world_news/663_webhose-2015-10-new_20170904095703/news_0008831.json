Australia's S&P ASX 200 was down 0.2%.\nShares of Samsung Electronics Co. are up 5.1% after the company said estimates for third-quarter operating profit likely rose 80% from a year earlier to about 7.3 trillion won ($6.28 billion) on robust sales of chips and displays used in mobile phones and other gadgets. That would be the first year-over-year growth since the third quarter of 2013.\nThe positive guidance from the world's biggest smartphone maker by shipments suggests Samsung's earnings may have bottomed out, ending a nearly two-year decline from tepid sales and deteriorating profit from mobile phones.\nBut sentiment across the region was lackluster after the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it downgraded the 2015 global growth outlook as a slowdown in emerging markets is pushing the world economy into its weakest expansion since the financial crisis.\nStocks also sold off sharply in the U.S. overnight, particularly in the biotechnology sector, with the S&P 500 snapped a five-day winning streak.\nIn recent sessions, uneven U.S. data has clouded the outlook on the Federal Reserve's plan to raise interest rates.

The Bank of Japan concludes its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, though there isn't a set time for the release of its statement.\n\"There has been increased talk of even looser policy in the wake of poor industrial production data and renewed pressure on inflation from weak oil prices,\" said Sean Callow, a currency strategist with Westpac.\nWhile Chinese domestic markets reopen Thursday following a week-long holiday, investors are expecting September reserves data from authorities later Wednesday.\nReserves fell by a record $93.9 billion in August, as China's central bank used its massive war chest to stabilize the yuan after its Aug. 11 devaluation.\n\"China's foreign reserves likely decreased further in September, though at a slower pace,\" wrote Socié té Gé né rale in a research note, which estimates the central bank spent $55 billion to prop up the yuan last month, compared with $110 billion in August.\nThe onshore Chinese yuan recently traded at 6.3559 yuan to the dollar, down 2.5% on year.\nOil prices rose to a one-month high on hopes for falling supply in both the U.S. and global markets.
