Our products range from bulk fuel and water installations for rapid deployment up to and including semi-permanent and permanent solutions, for diesel, petrol, jet fuel and water. The technology provided adopts the use of flexible and containerized solutions for storage tanks and refuelling / water distribution systems. \nOur experience and credibility have been gained over many years in the field of design, manufacture and supply of equipment, enhanced by logistic support. We also provide personnel for the commissioning, training and maintenance of ground and aviation fuel handling and water equipment systems at installations around the globe for numerous peacekeeping and military operations. Diesel and petrol containerized storage and refuelling systems \nAMA's diesel and petrol containerized storage and refuelling systems are a safe and cost effective solution for refuelling vehicles and boats in remote or coastal areas and are available in ISO 20ft or 40ft containers (DROPS) with: Single-wall or double-wall tank with leak detector (according to application/environmental constraints) Tank-loading pump - optional Generator for electrical power supply â€“ optional Single or dual-type dispenser (fiscal/non-fiscal diesel/petrol) All necessary piping, valves, instrumentation and electrical connections for the correct and safe operation of the system \nLocal storage capacity can be increased by connecting containerized storage modules in battery. Jet fuel containerized refuelling systems (JP8, F43 or JET A-1) \nContainerized refuelling systems for jet fuel are available in ISO 20ft or 40ft containers (DROPS) with: Electrical positive displacement pump Positive displacement flow meter with air eliminator Filter water separator and monitor filter with differential pressure gauge Fuel sampling Hose-reel with refuelling hose and under wing / over wing nozzle Explosion-proof electrical control panel Generator for electrical power supply of the system All necessary piping, valves and instrumentation for the correct and safe operation of the system \nLocal storage capacity can be increased by connecting containerized storage modules in battery. Bulk fuel installations for rapid deployment (jet fuel / diesel or petrol) \nPredominantly used but not restricted to remote inaccessible areas, we can provide complete turnkey solutions, consisting of flexible tanks for bulk fuel storage and all necessary pumping, filtration and dispensing equipment. \nThese bulk fuel installations are capable of delivering the complete range of fuel handling requirements: Refuelling of fixed and rotary wing aircraft Fuel receipt from aircraft or bowser Fuel transfer to refuellers or bladders Recirculation within the installations \nFurther enhancing the capability we have a wide range of fuel transfer pumps (FTP) with various flow rates, with or without filtering systems, which can be connected to the bulk fuel installation. Also we can provide kerbside vehicle refuelling stations complete with fiscal or non-fiscal dispensers. Day tanks for continuous generator fuel supply \nDay tanks are an ideal solution to maintain a continuous fuel supply to generator systems. \nThe unit consists of a small diesel tank (day tank) installed into a container in conjunction with the main bulk storage tank. The day tank directly feeds the generator and it is fitted with level sensors. The fuel level in the day tank is constantly monitored and kept at an operational level by means of a level sensor which is connected to the fuel pumps such that when the low level is reached the pump automatically cuts in and draws fuel from the main storage tank and tops up the day tank thus maintaining a constant flow of fuel which negates the need for manual intervention. \nOur services \nOur services include all aspects of technical and operational support through the lifecycle of any project: Site assessment and feasibility studies Installation design and site commissioning On-site staff training and certification Spares provisioning", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:15:23.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
