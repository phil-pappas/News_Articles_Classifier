Answer Might Help Treat Humans The top story this week is an article an article on why elephants, despite having large bodies with many more cells, rarely get cancer. New research found that elephants’ cells contain 20 copies of a major cancer-suppressing gene, compared with just on copy in humans. The finding could have implications for future treatments to protect humans from cancers. \n3 Share Nobel Medicine Prize for New Tools to Kill Parasites The Nobel Prize in medicine was handed out this week to three scientists from the U.S., Japan, and China for discovering drugs to fight tropical diseases, such as malaria and river blindness, that affect hundreds of millions of people each year. \nSingle Injection Could Sterilize Large Invasive Species Populations Ryan Bushey reported on a new vaccine created by scientists from the California Institute of Technology that keeps animal populations in check by targeting the gonadotropin - releasing hormone (GnRH), which causes sperm and eggs to develop. Studies in mice show it took two months for the animals to develop enough antibodies to render them completely infertile. \nStudy Advances Possibility of Mind-Controlled Devices This video post explores a new neural recording device that was surgically implanted in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in the part of the brain in charge of controlling hand function. Participants were able to operate a cursor on a computer through electrical impulses from the brain. \nScientists Identify Key Receptor as Potential Target for Treatment of Autism Researchers focused on the role that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays in the development of social behavior, and used an animal model of mutations in the gen Pten, which is a risk factor in a subgroup of individuals with autism. The study found that targeting one specific serotonin receptor, 5-HT2cR, with a drug that suppresses activity, can reverse social deficits in the mouse model with the autism risk gene.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:12:24.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
