And, from there, they want to be able to initiate targeted and measureable projects that allow them to improve performance and stay ahead of competition,\" explained Klaus Hammer, Commercial Lead for GWS. \nGWS will feature two new and innovative technologies at HR Tech: -- Company Health Index (CHI), an Instant Health Check App, diagnoses company performance and health in 8 key dimensions. It identifies potential areas of weakness, qualifies them and then provides benchmarks to define relative status and to prioritize actions. -- Talent Fit Index (TFI) is an online recruiting assessment that matches ideal profiles with candidates by measuring analytical thinking capability, as well as personality traits and connects them to specific job requirements. TFI provides integrated, instantaneous recommendations on the best applicants for a given position and an objective comparison of candidates. \n\"GWS diagnostics allow me to see, with surgical precision, what needs to be addressed and where in my organization. In this way, I am able to know exactly what I need to do to improve,\" commented a GWS client, who is the global head of HR of a leading pharmaceutical company. \nAttendees of HR Tech can learn more by visiting the GWS booth #1959. \nFor more information, visit the Genioo Workforce Solutions website genioows.com , or contact Klaus Hammer, k.hammer@genioo.com , +41 (0)79 139 03 58, or Rene Limacher at r.limacher@genioo.com , +1 978 457 6888. \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genioo-workforce-solutions-presents-revolutionary-diagnostic-tools-company-health-index-chi-through-its-instant-health-app-and-talent-fit-index-tfi-at-hr-technology-conference--expo-las-vegas-october-18-21-300161332.html \nSOURCE Genioo Workforce Solutions", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:42:41.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
