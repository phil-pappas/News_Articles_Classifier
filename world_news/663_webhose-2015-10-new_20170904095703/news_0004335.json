( Mark Carter ) The CAVE virtual reality system enables researchers to effortlessly determine what can work in specific spaces, one of the technology's multiple uses. ( Mark Carter ) The EAC at UALR helped Southwest Power Pool envision its new west Little Rock headquarters. ( Mark Carter ) < > \nCarolina Cruz-Neira, director of the Emerging Analytics Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, promises a show people will remember when her team hosts an open house on Oct. 16-17 to showcase the latest virtual reality technology. \nCruz-Neira was brought to Little Rock in the summer of 2014 as part of the Arkansas Research Alliance Scholars program to direct the newly opened EAC. Since her arrival, Cruz-Neira has been busy expanding the center and implementing the virtual reality tech that she she invented. The opwen house will showcase the most up-to-date VR as well as hint at what's to come. \nThe VR tech at UALR has multiple applications, from military to health care. The system also boasts applications for local businesses, which will have access to the technology for design and data analytics services. \nThe open house, \"Discover Virtual Reality,\" is free and will include 15 demonstrations of the VR technology. Those interested in attending are asked to make reservations . More information is available at EAC.UALR.edu . \nCruz-Neira has been on the forefront of VR for years. Before joining UALR, she established the Virtual Reality Applications Center at Iowa State University and the Louisiana Immersive Technologies Enterprise at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. \nLater this month, she will present at the Virtual Reality Summit in Santa Clara, California, joining a roster that includes some of the country's most respected VR experts, representing firms like Adobe and schools like the University of Southern California. \nLast year, Cruz-Neira led an EAC contingent to an international VR conference in France where her husband, Dirk Reiners, associate professor of information science at UALR and a member of the EAC team, led a 2-day session on VR software infrastructure. \nThe addition of Cruz-Neira to lead the EAC has placed UALR in position to emerge as a leader in the VR field, and Cruz-Neira is eager to unveil her team's work at the open house. She wants the community to know the unveiling will be worth the wait. \n\"We're looking forward to finally being able to showcase the kinds of things we can do,\" she said. \"My hope is that the open house will help the community to build a little collective ownership in the EAC program, and in UALR. We want the people of Little Rock to have something else in addition to the Razorbacks and sports to be proud of.\" \nThe EAC technology can be used in about 25 disciplines including large-scale, customized systems to \"everyday portable technologies\" such as smart phones, glasses and tablets. \nFriday's sneak peek offered a glimpse into a VR program that enables engineers to equip military aircraft with specific equipment. The technology can also create virtual buildings and a 3D human body that students can walk through. With CAVE, users can be inside their subject matter instead of merely looking at data, renderings or flat images. \nThe open house will represent the culmination of a year's work to get the center ready.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:00:17.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
