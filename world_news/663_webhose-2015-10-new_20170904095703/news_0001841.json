The new offering provides an alternative solution for digital archivists and librarians who have expressed concerns about security, service level, and cost management issues with public cloud offerings for stewardship of digital asset collections. The announcement today of private cloud hosting for the Islandora digital repository system, rounds out Truman Technologies’ SOAR™ solution stack. SOAR™ (Scalable Online Archive and Repository) is a field-proven platform and methodology for preserving and serving digital assets that has been adopted by universities, museums, and cultural heritage institutions.\nMark Jordan, Board Chair at Islandora Foundation said “We are pleased to see the accessibility to Islandora enhanced by this innovative cloud product offering.
