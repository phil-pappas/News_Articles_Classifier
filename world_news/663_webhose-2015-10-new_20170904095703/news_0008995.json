Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ: HEAR ) a leading-edge audio technology company, recently announced it will begin fulfilling initial orders for its breakthrough hearing healthcare device, HyperSound Clear™, in the next several weeks, and that the product will be available to purchase through hearing healthcare providers for a MSRP of $1,675 . HyperSound® technology is a fundamentally new approach to sound delivery that generates a highly directional, narrow beam of audio in the air. Similar to how a flashlight directs a beam of light, HyperSound Clear directs a beam of audio to targeted listeners, which has been shown to significantly improve sound clarity and speech intelligibility in individuals with hearing loss1. HyperSound Clear works in parallel with the audio from the TV or home theater system, so a person with hearing loss will experience immersive, 3D audio when sitting in the HyperSound beam, while everyone else in the room hears audio from the TV speakers or home theater system at a normal volume level. This means that people with hearing loss, along with family members and friends, can once again return to the family room to enjoy the latest home entertainment together.\nWith strong initial pre-orders, Turtle Beach will begin a staged roll-out of the first shipments of HyperSound Clear units to its partners – some of the biggest companies in hearing healthcare, including American Hearing Aid Associates, Audiology Management Group, Inc., Amplified Resource Group, LLC, AuDConnex, Battery Benelux BV, Beltone New England and Fuel Medical Group, LLC. An estimated 360 million people worldwide suffer from some form of hearing loss, and HyperSound Clear is on the verge of offering a new way for people with hearing loss to once again enjoy home entertainment.\nFor a more detailed research report with analyst comments on Turtle Beach Corporation please follow the link.
