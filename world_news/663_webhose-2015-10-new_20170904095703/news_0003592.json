The route travels through Kazakhstan, taking eight days. \nMANP terminal manager Maxim Tyomkin said: \"Customers find this a real advantage because it avoids the time and costs of moving the cargo to another location for customs inspection. \n\"The terminal has a fully equipped container yard, bonded storage and warehouses for container stripping if required. It also has a trucking fleet for on-carriage to end customers. \"The terminal has a fully equipped container yard, bonded storage and warehouses for container stripping if required.\" \n\"We are very pleased that MANP has been chosen to handle this new service. It is currently operating a monthly frequency but there is a likelihood that this will increase as demand for the PVC product rises in this region.\" \nThe MANP terminal is a part of the Global Container Service (GCS) Group, which has been involved in the Russian container market since 1995. \nGCS is owned by Russian transport holding company Delo, which also operates several terminal assets in the port of Novorossiysk. \nThe terminal has its own customs station, Lvovskiy, located on the site, which ensures a more streamlined customs clearance process. \nSince its acquisition of the MANP terminal in 2006, GCS has invested heavily in the site, which is located 45km south-east of Moscow. \nApart from offering regular intermodal services to a range of destinations in inland Russia, including the most remote provinces, the terminal offers a weekly fixed day intermodal service from the port of Vostochniy in the Russian Pacific, operated by sister company Ruscon. \nIt also serves the western Russian gateways of St Petersburg and Novorossiysk. \nImage: Cargo being handled at the MANP terminal near Moscow.
