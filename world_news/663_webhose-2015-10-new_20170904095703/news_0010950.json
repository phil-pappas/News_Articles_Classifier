NBN / YouTube The satellite dubbed \"Sky Muster\" was built over three years by the Californian company, SSL. It was carried through the earth's atmosphere by a 780-tonne Ariane 5 rocket, which was the result of scientific and technical expertise from 10 European countries. The Singaporean-owned Optus will operate Sky Muster once it is in place 36,000 kilometres above the equator in about 10 days time.\nMany would make the obvious point that Australia is a relatively small country that can be excused for not having its own space industry. But Switkowski, who had a PHD in nuclear physics by the age of 24, does not seem convinced by this argument.\nThe former Telstra chief executive notes that the rocket that launched Sky Muster carried another satellite that was made by the Argentine technology company INVAP, which also built the OPAL research nuclear reactor in Sydney's Lucas Heights. Switkowski was appointed chairman of ANSTO, the national body in charge of nuclear research and development, in 2007 when the OPAL facility was about to go online.\nArgentine example \"It makes you reflect, what is about is about Argentina that has produced what is a demonstrably successful space program and also a competitive supplier of research nuclear reactors?\" says Switkowski. \"These are areas that are at the cutting edge of science and the cutting edge of engineering. And a country with 40 million people has done that. We do have to question how they've gone about it and can we learn from that process. And I think we can.\"\nLike most national space programs, Argentina's Comisi√≥n Nacional de Actividades relies heavily on government support. Less than a month away from a general election, President Cristina Fernandez celebrated the country's technology milestone with the Twitter hashtag #satellitesovereignty and promised to invest another $US1 billion in the satellite industry. The government hopes the successful launch of the homemade satellite will prove to be a distraction from Argentina's stagnant economy and rampant inflation.\nBut Switkowski is reluctant to declare large-scale government support is the answer for Australia. \"You've got be a bit hesitant because the system in Argentina has not produced a robust economy so they probably wouldn't say they've got the formula right,\" he says. \"But the access to bright people, the nurturing of talent, their ability to put their talent and aspirations to work in worthwhile national programs around space and around nuclear energy means that all of a sudden they are a feature on the international stage which we are not.\"\nSwitkowski's veiled criticism of the state of innovation in Australia perhaps stems from his past brushes with the space industry. As a Melbourne University undergraduate in the late 1960s, he worked on a project for the now defunct Weapons Research Establishment measuring atmospheric composition by firing off rockets from the Woomera range in South Australia. After he finishing his PhD, Switkowski began postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology where he was \"on the edge\" of a group studying the composition of lunar rocks collected on the Apollo missions and also met celebrated physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking.\nWhether Australia can emulate the likes of Argentina or Israel, with its centralised government support for research and technology, remains to be seen. But Switkowski is hopeful Malcolm Turnbull's accession to the top job will make a difference. Turnbull, who installed Switkowski on the NBN board shortly after he became communications minister in September 2013, has promised to \"embrace the future\" by working \"more agilely, more innovatively\" at a time when many industries are being transformed by new technologies.\n\"He talks the talk and I know he is sincere in his interest in promoting innovation and tapping into the smart people we have and exploiting the intellectual property that we've developed,\" says Switkowski. \"And you can sense already there is a lift in the level of interest and optimism around innovation as a driver of economic growth in the weeks since his accession to the top job.\n\"The expectations of him are high.\"\n* The reporter travelled to French Guiana as a guest of the NBN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:26:40.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
