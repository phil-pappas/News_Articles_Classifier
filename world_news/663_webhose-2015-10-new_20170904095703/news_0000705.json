Cameron noted, “Controlling and monitoring material handling equipment on the floor is key to running an efficient operation. The WCS (warehouse control system) was developed to be a single solution to fill the information gap that existed between a warehouse management system (WMS) or ERP and the material handling equipment. As companies turn to automation solutions to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs, the WCS has grown to become a crucial component in any automated warehouse environment.”\nMore and more, the WCS is the go-to technology for handling and directing order fulfillment operations, acting as the control tower in an automated warehouse. Where it was initially a tool for more basic equipment control, the WCS has evolved into a solution that can handle more advanced order fulfillment functionality. The most advanced WCS solutions are beginning to provide functionality typically found within a WMS. Should this trend continue, direct integrations between an advanced WCS and a host ERP could become a very cost-effective solution for companies leveraging material handling and automation solutions within their supply chain.\nMaking the move to automate warehouse processes and operations is no small decision. There are many factors to consider and plenty of details to iron out before moving forward with implementing a system that might include pick to light, mobile robotics, and miles of conveyor. The benefits, however, often prove worth the effort of making the shift to an automated warehouse.\nTo read the entire article, go to: http://ow.ly/SFUKT\nAbout Bastian Solutions\nBastian Solutions (http://ow.ly/LaOTe), a global material handling systems integrator and expert in e-commerce fulfillment automation is an innovator in the fields of material handling automation, goods-to-person systems, wearable AR technology, supply chain software, and robotics.
