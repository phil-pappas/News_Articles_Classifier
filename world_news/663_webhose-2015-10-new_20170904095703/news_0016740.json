That's a 19 percent premium to EMC's Friday closing price of $27.86. \nCloud computing company VMware Inc., a subsidiary of EMC, will stay an independent, publicly traded company. \nSince going private in 2013, Dell Inc. has been investing in research and development and growing its software and services business as those in the technology industry continue to struggle with soft PC sales. \nThe companies said Monday that the combined business will create the world's biggest privately held integrated technology company. \n\"Our new company will be exceptionally well-positioned for growth in the most strategic areas of next generation IT including digital transformation, software-defined data center, converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud, mobile and security,\" Michael Dell said in a written statement. \nDell will serve as chairman and CEO of the combined company. Joe Tucci, chairman and CEO of EMC, will remain in those roles until the deal is complete. \nDell Inc.'s headquarters will stay in Round Rock, Texas. The combined enterprise systems business headquarters will be in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, where EMC is based. \nThe deal, which was approved by EMC's board, is targeted to close in the second or third quarter of Dell's fiscal year ending Feb. 3, 2017. It still needs approval from EMC shareholders. \nEMC's stock rose more $1.34, or 4.8 percent, to $29.20 in premarket trading about two hours before the market open Monday.
