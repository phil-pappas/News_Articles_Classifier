Currently popular is ARK: Survival Evolved , in which you’re stranded on an island populated by dinosaurs and other prehistoric wildlife. For a more thoughtful, less fantastical experience, try The Long Dark .\nAction Dutch developer Vlambeer is known for action games such as Super Crate Box and more recently shoot-’em-up Luftrausers . Their new game, Nuclear Throne , an action roguelike about mutants fighting to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, is available now.\nRole-playing game Darkest Dungeon is also a roguelike, but in this case a turn-based RPG. You lead a team of heroes through monster-filled dungeons, but the heroes have flaws and can suffer from afflictions such as paranoia and masochism.\nMultiplayer For a fast-paced competitive game, try SpeedRunners , in which you run, jump, and swing through levels while trying to prevent opponents doing the same. For a cooperative experience, Don’t Starve Together is an expansion that lets you try to survive the bizarre islands of Don’t Starve with friends.\nUnique Besiege is a game unlike any other, focused solely on constructing siege engines then using them to destroy buildings. Its complex physics means players learn about effective engineering, which might sound dull but is proving very popular.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:56:15.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
