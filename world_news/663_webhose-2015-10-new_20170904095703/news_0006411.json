Revenues rose 17 percent to 1.55 billion euros.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast net income of 324 million euros on revenues of 1.58 billion euros.\nASML makes lithography systems, machines that cost upward of 100 million euros each and are used by chipmakers to build circuitry.\nCEO Peter Wennink said in a statement that \"compared to three months ago, foundry customers are slightly more cautious with their investment plans.\"\nFoundries make chips to order for tech companies. ASML's foundry customers include the two largest, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and GlobalFoundries.\nNew bookings were 904 million euros, compared with analyst forecasts of 1.04 billion euros. ASML forecast sales of 1.4 billion for the fourth quarter.\nWennink said that while shipments to logic chip makers were down, he expected them to ramp up production in the second quarter of 2016.\nIntel, the biggest logic chip maker, is another important customer for ASML.\nWennink said demand from memory chip makers would continue to be strong well into 2016, though below the level of the first 9 months of 2015.
