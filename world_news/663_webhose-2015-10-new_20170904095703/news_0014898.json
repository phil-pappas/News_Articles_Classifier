Its VINNAPAS dispersions are used as binders in the construction, paints, coatings, and adhesives industries. \nWacker Polymers has production sites in Germany, China, South Korea, and the US, and global sales network and technical centers in all major regions. \nThe company also expanded its Mexico-based technical centre to include dispersion applications this month. \nThe expansion of the Mexico technical centre helps to expand production of VAE dispersions. \nThe company is focusing on expansion activities for the next two years, which includes beginning polysilicon production at the new site in Tennessee, expanding their Burghausen site's capacity of dispersible polymer powders by 50,000t, and other projects. \nImage: WACKER's production facility in Calvert City.
