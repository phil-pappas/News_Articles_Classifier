An electric motor mounted on its steel and aluminium frame allows the car to drive.\nThe car was on show at the Grand Designs Live Show consumer exhibition in Birmingham, UK from 8-11 October.\nEarlier this year Lexus debuted a real-life Back to the Future-style hoverboard , containing a series of magnets and superconductors cooled by liquid nitrogen. It was able to levitate -- not unlike Marty McFly's hoverboard in the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II.", "external_links": ["http://www.lasercutworks.com/", "http://scalesandmodels.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-27T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:23:32.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
