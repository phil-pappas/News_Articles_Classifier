These packages include Artec’s professional grade Eva or recently released Space Spider handheld 3D scanners in addition to 3D Systems’ Geomagic Design X platform and a one-year subscription to Artec Studio 10 . \nThe Artec Eva and Space Spider enable users to easily capture complex objects, particularly those with sharp edges or small parts that may be difficult to capture in any other way, in high resolution and vibrant colour. \n“No 3D scanner, no matter how proficient, can stand alone,” explained, Artyom Yukhin, president and CEO of Artec 3D. “It requires the support of software solutions that are equally as adept to turn captured data and cloud points into a desired object, recreated or newly invented, that can one day be held in your hand. We’re excited to work with 3D Systems in this endeavour by offering designers and engineers the complete package of solutions necessary to further their work and the industry as a whole.” × Expand \nFollowing the 3D scanning process, images can be post-processed to produce a watertight model using Artec’s Studio 10 software. The finished model can then be exported to the Geomagic Design X platform to create feature-based, editable solid models compatible with popular MCAD platforms. \nCalvin Hur, VP, co-COO and Chief Revenue Officer for Software at 3D Systems, added: “Geomagic Design X leads the industry in enabling 3D scan-to-CAD solutions. The 2016 version of our software, when paired with Artec’s high quality scanners, delivers unparalleled performance and streamlined creation of accurate CAD data from real world objects.” \nThe following bundles are now available for purchase: Artec Eva 3D scanner, Geomagic Design X software and one year of Artec Studio Professional ($35,990 USD | 29,900 EUR); Artec Space Spider 3D scanner, Geomagic Design X software and one year of Artec Studio Professional ($43,350 USD | 36,900 EUR); and Artec Eva and Space Spider, Geomagic Design X software and one year of Artec Studio Professional ($55,290 USD | 45,900 EUR).
