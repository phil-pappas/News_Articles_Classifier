Specializing in Sage CRM implementation, training, and support, Azamba engaged Juice Marketing to modernize their aging website to improve search visility, website traffic, visitor engagement, and lead generation.\nPeter Wolf, Founder at Azamba, felt that a website redesign was well overdue. “We wanted a modern-looking and mobile-responsive website built on a content management system so we can easily add new pages and update the site. Because our old site lacked flexibility and control, it had been static for about 5 years which is an eternity in web years.”\nAn important factor in choosing Juice Marketing to lead the web redesign project was the industry-specific experience that the Juice team brings to the table. Peter says, “I’ve known Mark (Juice Marketing Founder) for a long time. He has a great reputation and I know he has done excellent work for other Sage resellers. Juice Marketing is a company we could trust with such an important project.”\nPeter adds, ”We're very happy with the final product and, now that it's a Wordpress site, we can update it ourselves to keep our message fresh and to communicate new benefits and services related to Sage CRM to our customers and prospects.”\nSpeclizing in marketing programs for Sage and Microsoft partners, the Juice Marketing team designs websites for the ERP, CRM, accounting software, and technology industries.\nLearn more the Juice Marketing web design program at http://www.juice-marketing.com/website-design\nVisit http://www.azamba.com to take a look at the new Azamba Consulting Group website.\nAbout Juice Marketing, LLC\nJuice Marketing provides simple and cost-effective channel marketing programs to Sage, Microsoft, and SAP partners and business software providers.
