That means an off-color joke from years ago and the wrong privacy setting could combine to get you in trouble with your employer.\"\nHe added that Facebook could do more to inform its users beyond a blog post that a vast majority likely will not see. \"I think Facebook could do more to communicate to users that they should go back and check what they've shared publicly, run searches on their own name with some offensive terms, and hide anything problematic from the public,\" Constine said.\nWhile the new search function may have the effect of degrading privacy on the site, the company has a broader desire to compete with sites like Google and Twitter in the delivery of news. While it has maintained less appeal to the broader public, Twitter has done more to draw journalists and newsmakers over the last several years, becoming a vehicle for the creation and delivery of news.\nIn addition to its function as a search engine, Google also provides a widely-used news curation service. Facebook has sought to challenge Google on both fronts, but with little success to date.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Romney admits: 'Without Romneycare, I don't think we would have Obamacare' Romney explained that his signature achievement helped pave the way for the Affordable Care Act's passage\nBy Al Weaver • 10/23/15 2:01 PM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:23:12.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
