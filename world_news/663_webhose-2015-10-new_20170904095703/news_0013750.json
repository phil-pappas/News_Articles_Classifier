In turn, being seen with a bottle of water in your hand signified your commitment to healthy living,\" Dr Potter said. \n\"Since then, the rapid expansion of the market has seen the development of prestige brands which seek to place the product as a luxury item. \n\"For example, Claridge's in London has a 'water menu' and a company called 'Bling Water' produces frosted bottles encrusted in Swarovski crystals that retail for over $50 a bottle.\" \nCoca Cola Amatil (CCA), one of the strongest competitors in the crowded bottled water market, features strongly in the book. \n\"The way it pitches bottled water to the market is quite remarkable,\" Dr Potter said. \n\"For example, some observers have argued that CCA rode on the back of the Federal Government's intervention in the Northern Territory in 2007 in order to position bottled water in Indigenous communities. \n\"Religious and evangelical groups have also been known to use bottled water as a tool for infiltrating communities. \n\"Thank You Water is associated with evangelical groups who have been accused of using it as a missionary opportunity in the villages they provide water to.\" \nDr Potter is cautious when it comes to discussing bottled water producers who link themselves with philanthropic groups. \n\"As criticism of the bottled water industry has grown, more companies have sought to create a positive association with their product – for example, Mount Franklin's long-established partnership with The McGrath Foundation,\" Dr Potter said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:13:40.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
