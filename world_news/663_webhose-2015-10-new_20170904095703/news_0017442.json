Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters at the Human Rights Campaign Breakfast in Washington, October 3, 2015. \nHackers tried to gain access to Hillary Clinton’s emails she sent on a private server while she was Secretary of State. \nThe hackers, thought to be Russians, sent five emails disguised as New York state parking tickets which could have taken control of her computer if she had opened them. She does not appear to have done so, but critics claimed it was further evidence that the email system she used was insecure. \nClinton has come under fire after it emerged she installed a private server at her home in Chappaqua, upstate New York, while in office between 2009 to 2013 instead of using her official account. She has handed it to the FBI which is investigating if she breached laws regarding handling of classified material. –Daily Mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:58:33.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
