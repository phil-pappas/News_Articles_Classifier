The system is aesthetically pleasing and able to offset their meter 100% ” — Ross Willilams, H.E.S. Vice President SAN DIEGO, CA, UNITED STATES, October 9, 2015 / EINPresswire.com / -- Home Energy Systems (H.E.S.), San Diego residential and commercial solar energy contactors, designs and installs vanguard zero penetration, commercial solar system in Rancho Bernardo. The system was designed for a office property known as Bernardo View, managed by Navarra Properties, Inc.. This project is ground breaking for Home Energy System’s design and install team, as well as the San Diego commercial solar industry, as the solar panels and the inverters are adhered to the roofs by a ballasting system specifically designed to stand up to environmental and climate challenges. “We chose H.E.S. for our solar installation because we found their technical understanding second to none, and their operational flexibility allowed them to work around the schedules of our office tenants- minimizing interruptions, said Mark Navarra, Operations Manager.” The solar power system spans two buildings of the Bernardo View office complex located at 16880 West Bernardo Drive in Rancho Bernardo. Home Energy Systems custom designed a 320-panel system comprised of SunPower E20 327-COM panels. At the owner’s request, none of the solar electric system is visible from ground level. The system converts DC power to AC power by way of the 3 SMA Tri Power 24kW inverters and one SMA Tri Power 20kW. The roof-mounted inverters were also ballasted and installed with an SMA Ready Rack system. The Unirac Roof Mount racking system used in the Bernardo View project is similar to that used as in the largest rooftop ballasted installation in the United States, the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada and, planned by the same structural engineer, Paul Zacher. Home Energy Systems proposed this forward thinking ballasted install because the client wanted to preserve a Elastomeric sealant, a waterproofing membrane, that covers the roofs of the 2 buildings. Home Energy System’s unique proposal to implement a zero penetration, ballasted installation helped secure the contract among many other bids. A traditional installation of this scale would result in upwards of 500 holes in the roof. Further, as aesthetics were important to the property owners, H.E.S. ran conduit through interior walls and mounted the inverters on the roofs near the panels for a, literally, seamless, aesthetically vacant, high quality solar energy system capable of producing 100% of the energy needed to offset the entire house meter.
