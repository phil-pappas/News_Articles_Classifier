Inspired by their ESPN podcast Capital Games , the duo's new SiriusXM show – The Arena – will invite some of the biggest names from the sports and political worlds to examine how sports-related topics can drive the agenda in D.C. The one-hour weekly series will begin its 6-show run on October 2 nd on SiriusXM's non-partisan political channel, P.O.T.U.S. (124). \nThe Arena 's inaugural guest will be former Gov. Jeb Bush . In a pre-recorded interview set to air on Friday, the presidential candidate sat down with Klein and Katz to discuss the controversy surrounding the Washington Redskins team name and the challenges faced by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell . Highlights from the interview are below, along with audio clips: \nFmr. Gov. Jeb Bush : Washington Redskins shouldn't change its name, not offensive: \n\"I don't think [the team] should change it. But again, I don't think politicians ought to have any say in that to be honest with you. I don't find it offensive. Native American tribes generally don't find it offensive. We had a similar kind of flap with FSU if you recall, the Seminoles, and the Seminole tribe itself kind of came to the defense of the university and it subsided. It's a sport for crying out loud. It's a football team. Washington has a huge fan base…I'm missing something here I guess.\"AUDIO: http://bit.ly/1h7Ai8Y \nBush on Roger Goodell's challenges as NFL Commissioner: \n\"I think that it's a private enterprise and they ought to have as much freedom to do what they want. But good leadership and good management would suggest – and I think Roger understands this – that you have to create support around whatever ideas you have, and the best way to do that is to build support. It can't be done autocratically. I think the owners understand that as well. This is a brand that is hugely powerful, hugely successful, has grown under the tenure of Roger Goodell , but it can be hurt by these incidents – whether it's domestic violence; the concussion issue is a huge legal challenge; Deflategate, I never quite understood what the big fuss was, but nevertheless – all these things matter, so creating a process to show that you're transparent and open, willing to listen to other sides of the story, I think all that's important. It's just part of being a leader.\"AUDIO: http://bit.ly/1FFHB3l \nA veteran of the news industry, Rick Klein is currently ABC News' political director and leads the network's political coverage, frequently appearing on air as a political analyst. Andy Katz is an esteemed sports journalist who is regulary featured on ESPN's award-winning show Outside the Lines , in addition to his main role as lead reporter and at times host for college basketball and NBA Draft programming.
