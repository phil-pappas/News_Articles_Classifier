The key asset is a multi-platform AAA game with 1.8M downloads on its own and a new version that was never released. This key game was a high ranking app (reached #1 overall in 2 countries and Top 10 in 30 countries). Also was featured by Apple a few times (in '' New and Noteworthy'', ''Whats Hot'', ''What We're Playing‚Äù) and the game received app reviews by blogs all over the internet. Growth for this business can come from multiple areas such as: - Codes can be reskinned easily over and over again - As an extra income stream a new owner can sell licenses of the original codes to other app developers at places like Chupamobile.com - Key game (and new version) can be positioned for a publishing deal with a big publisher and could even create merchandise based on the games. This is an opportunity to acquire high quality apps that can be grown in multiple ways by a new owner. NOTE - Revenue number is annualized run rate based on last 6 months average. Valuation is based on the value of the apps/codes and not the revenue.
