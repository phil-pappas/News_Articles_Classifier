When used with Spectroline ® fluorescent dyes, it pinpoints fluid leaks in a wide range of industrial systems such as hydraulic equipment, compressors, engines, gearboxes, fuel systems and much more. TRI-365HB TRITAN 365 hand-held NDT lamp \nThe TRITAN 365 features three ultra-hi-flux UV LEDs for fluorescent leak detection, plus a white light LED for general component inspection in dimly lit areas. The lamp’s broad-beam profile provides extra-wide area coverage -- 45 inch (114 cm) diameter at a 20-foot (6.1 m) distance -- making it ideal for quick leak checking of large surface areas. \nExtremely compact and lightweight, the TRITAN 365 weighs just 16 ounces (454 g). The lamp’s compact head gets into cramped areas larger lamps can’t reach. A three-way rocker switch allows easy control of the light sources and a lightweight, angled lamp body ensures fatigue-free inspections. Instant-on operation allows the lamp to reach full intensity immediately. The lamp provides twice the output of conventional 150-watt lamps and has a 100,000-hour LED service life. \nAlso available is the TRITAN™ 365M (Part No. TRI-365MHB) portable, battery-operated AC/DC lamp kit. Along with the TRITAN 365 UV lamp, the kit includes a rechargeable NiMH battery pack, AC and DC cord sets, a smart AC charger and UV-absorbing glasses. All components are packed in a convenient carrying case. \nHeadquartered in Westbury, New York, Spectronics Corporation invented fluorescent leak detection in 1955, and remains the world’s leading manufacturer of ultraviolet equipment and fluorescent dyes. Spectroline ® cutting-edge, top-quality, industry-awarded lamps, dyes, radiometers and diagnostic tools are built to exacting standards, and are used for literally dozens of markets, some of which include Industrial, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration, Laboratory, Semiconductor, Nondestructive Testing and Forensics. Spectronics Corporation is dedicated to upholding high standards in design manufacturing, ensuring customer satisfaction and developing innovative technologies that make the world a better place.
