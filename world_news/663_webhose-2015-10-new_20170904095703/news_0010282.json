It's important to find new ways to identify women who are most at risk of their cancer spreading to the brain, so that doctors can work out which women might need more intensive or new treatments to try to keep their cancer at bay for longer.\n\"Our study linked a positive score in this test with quicker spread to the brain, and importantly showed the factor we were measuring is providing information on patient outcome independently of other biomarkers already measured in the clinic.\n\"The test needs further development before it will be ready for routine clinical use, but ultimately the first use of this type of test could be to identify opportunities for women with advanced specific types of breast cancer -- such as triple negative -- to enter clinical trials of new treatments.\"\nCanada study leader Professor Torsten Nielsen, Pathologist at the British Columbia Cancer Agency, said:\n\"It has taken us years to assemble the clinical outcome database and tissue samples, generate the immunohistochemical biomarkers, gene expression profiles and analyze the data for this study -- and we were delighted to find a definite link between alpha beta crystallin and breast cancer progression, which we hope will ultimately improve clinical outcomes.\n\"Our study also definitely demonstrates the importance of team science to deliver a study involving international collaborations\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:01:07.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
