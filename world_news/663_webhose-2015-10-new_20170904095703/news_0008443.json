JSW Steel said imports are still high in other types of steel products in the value chain, hurting domestic steelmakers. “It is imperative to also impose appropriate duty on all other steel products in the value chain to stop injury to the industry,” it said.\n 21, 2015 5:24 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:46:14.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
