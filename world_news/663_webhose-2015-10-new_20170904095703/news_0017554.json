Some of problems resulted in liver transplantation or death, the FDA said.\nThe FDA said the more serious problems were reported mostly in patients taking Viekira Pak who had evidence of advanced cirrhosis even before starting treatment with it.\nAbbVie said in a statement it is updating the prescribing labels for the drugs to warn against their use in patients with certain liver diseases. AbbVie said a causal relationship between the treatments and the adverse events hasn't been established.\nThe company's shares fell 10% to $48.43 Thursday after the alert was posted. AbbVie reported $616 million in sales for Viekira Pak in the first six months of 2015. The drug was introduced in December 2014. The FDA approved Technivie to treat a less common type of hepatitis C in July.\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com\n 22, 2015 16:25 ET (20:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:54:08.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
