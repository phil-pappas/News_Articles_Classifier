This includes the ability to send and receive texts, make calendar appointments and use Apple Maps through Siri. Currently only a few models by Ferrari, Skoda, Mitsubishi and Hyundai support CarPlay in Australia. The new Mitsubishi Pajero is one of a handful of cars that supports Apple’s CarPlay. Source: Supplied \nThese latest comments by Cook follow a report by the Wall Street Journal last month that suggested an Apple car, codenamed ‘Titan’, will be ready to go on sale by 2019. \nWhile Apple has never officially confirmed it’s planning to build a car, there are strong indications it’s at least interested in automotive technology. In recent months, Apple has hired a number of engineers with backgrounds in automotive and battery design, especially from electric car maker Tesla. \nApple representatives also met in May with officials at an automotive testing facility located east of San Francisco. Site officials later confirmed to The Associated Press that Apple requested information about using their facility. \nAnd in August, an Apple lawyer met with officials at California’s Department of Motor Vehicles to discuss the state’s regulations for self-driving cars. Google looks to be the closest tech company to launching a car.

Google last month announced that it’s hired former Hyundai US CEO John Krafcik to run its self-driving car program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:16:22.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
