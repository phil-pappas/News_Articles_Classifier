Climate models predict the state will become considerably hotter and drier in the future as greenhouse gas emissions continue to accumulate in our atmosphere. Add to that as many as 9 million more people by 2040, and California’s traditional water supplies will become increasingly taxed and unreliable. Technology will save us…right? \nJoin KPCC and the Milken Institute on Tuesday, October 20 as we explore the potential and possible limitations of technological innovation in maximizing every last drop of existing water supplies while at the same time coming up with new ones. \nWhat can technology offer? And how can it help drive a fundamental rethinking of water pricing, commoditization, and public engineering to address the state’s long-term water infrastructure issues? What about incentives to support their adoption – so they can be applied speedily to urban, rural and agricultural areas? What can be learned from current conservation efforts around the world to help California manage water effectively? \nModerator \nThis program builds on KPCC's special \"Future of Water\" drought coverage.
