It’s completely unacceptable.” \nEbru Pakcan, global head of payments and receivables at Citi, agreed that the need for change was driven by customers’ changing requirements, but cautioned against changing for the sake of it. “There are some good things about correspondent banking that have built up over many years, one of which is trust,” she said. “But some things are there because they have always been there and that is not a good enough reason. We should be leveraging the very resilient infrastructures that we have built, such as local real-time payments.” \nLarry Sobin, head of correspondent banking and USD payment and clearing at BNP Paribas, said banks “have to be attentive to what the consumer wants, but not lose what we are good at – they are not mutually exclusive”. \nNigel Dobson, general manager group payments management at ANZ, said change was inevitable but not necessarily a bad thing. “We have reached a tipping point and we do need to address it, but as a community we can do that,” he said. \nGeorge Doolittle, executive vice-president and head of global payment services at Wells Fargo, picked up on Pakcan’s point about the development of the sector of a long period. “The challenge is that correspondent banking is a tremendously organic animal that has developed over many years,” he said, pointing to examples such as the way free-text fields in payment messages have been used to solve particular problems and developed piecemeal. “We need to go back and unpack a lot of that.” \nWasden said there were lessons to be learned from the Chinese market where technology firms such as Alibaba and WeChat are rapidly becoming financial services providers. “Alibaba provides an Amazon banking experience to consumers and small businesses. They are not starting from a correspondent banking model and they are providing trust,” he said. “They are digital from the ground up and don’t have the legacy infrastructure of financial services.” \nBanks still have a culture of build rather than buy, Wasden said, but the others disagreed. “Banks love new technology and have been good at adopting it,” said Dobson. “We want to bring fintechs in – this is not a walled garden, it is a bunch of people trying to do things better.” David Bannister David Bannister is editor of Banking Technology.
