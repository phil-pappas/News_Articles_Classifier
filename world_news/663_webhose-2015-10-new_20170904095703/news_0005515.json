Australian technology companies like Cohda Wireless provide communication technology to General Motors cars all over the world, while Bosch’s Melbourne-based engineering department develops vehicle systems for carmakers globally.\nHowever, Australia faces tough international competition with countries like the US, Britain, Sweden and Norway all getting a headstart. Japan and Singapore have already progressed beyond the trial stage and are set to kick off driverless taxi services as early as next year.\nWith ARRB running the trials, Mr Waldron said that driverless vehicles could dramatically reduce Australia’s road transport costs.\n“We certainly wouldn’t want to be the last country in the world to adopt driverless vehicles. Let’s get this thing moving, make Australia open for business for driverless vehicles, encourage the manufacturers to bring them here first — not last,” he said.\nRoad crashes cost Australia $27 billion, on top of the lives lost, while road congestion costs the country a further $30 billion per year in lost productivity.\nMr Wall said that the objective of the trials was to prove to policymakers and the public that driverless vehicles were “real, they work and that they are coming”, adding that they will dramatically change business models for carmakers and the insurance industry.\n“Insurance companies are already commissioning their reports that look at what impact driverless cars are going to have on their business. Clearly, it’s going to have less crashes and less private ownership and that’s not a good outlook for the insurance industry.”\nA driverless future could turn carmakers into “mobility companies” as the concept of car ownership is turned on its head.\n“You might have a fleet of 100,000 Volvos and you will have a mobility plan much like your mobile phone plan, where you use the car only when you need it and you will have a contract,” Mr Waldron said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:08:38.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
