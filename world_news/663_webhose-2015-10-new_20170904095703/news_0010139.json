But his wife and two others were wounded. \nFILE - Maldives President Abdulla Yameen, accompanied by his wife Fathimath Ibrahim, arrives in Colombo, Sri Lanka, July 22, 2015. \nOfficials initially blamed the explosion on a mechanical problem, but later said forensics experts found evidence that indicated it was an attempt on the president's life. \nThe Maldives is a world famous tourist site, but has been shaken by the recent arrest and trial of former President Mohamed Nasheed. A court sentenced him to 13 years in prison for ordering the arrest of an allegedly corrupt judge when Nasheed was president three years ago. \nThe United Nations has ruled that the trial was illegal and ordered Nasheed's release.
