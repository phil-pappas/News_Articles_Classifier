The alternative technology, which is not part of its plan to fix cars already in circulation, was rejected by the company at the time as too costly.\nReflecting the scandal’s mounting financial toll, Volkswagen also said Tuesday that it would cut investments at its leading brand by $1.1 billion. That will limit the company’s ability to innovate at a time when carmakers are trying to keep ahead of a rush of new technology.\nVolkswagen, Europe’s leading automaker, was forced to admit that about 11 million of its diesel cars worldwide were equipped with software that allowed it to cheat on tests of noxious gas emissions. The company now faces a raft of investigations in the United States, Europe and China.\nThe change involves adding a tank of a urea-based fluid to clean exhaust and affects only coming models, said Peter Thul , a spokesman for Volkswagen.\n“Diesel vehicles will only be equipped with exhaust emissions systems that use the best environmental technology,” Herbert Diess , chairman of the company’s car brand, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, said in a statement Tuesday. The change will take place “as soon as possible,” according to the statement.\nIt also appears that Volkswagen will be moving away from diesel as its preferred clean technology. Volkswagen said Tuesday that it was pushing ahead with the development of electric and plug-in hybrid cars based on a series of components that can be used in different models.\nExemplifying this shift will be a transformation of the next generation of the company’s luxury Phaeton limousine into an all-electric model, expected to reach showrooms in 2019 or 2020.\nLast week, Volkswagen submitted a detailed proposal to the authorities in Berlin of how it planned to remove from its vehicles in Germany the software used to cheat emissions tests. The Federal Motor Transport Authority is reviewing Volkswagen’s proposal to remedy the issue on its 1.2-, 1.6- and 2-liter diesel engines.\nThe German Transport Ministry has said there will be a recall for affected vehicles, with a software fix for the 2-liter engines expected to be ready early next year. The 1.6-liter motors, however, would require further modifications that cannot be expected before later in 2016. No information has been released regarding a fix for the 1.2-liter engines.\nIn testimony before the U.S. Congress last week and the British Parliament on Monday, Volkswagen officials indicated that fixes would vary by country, given varying emissions standards.\nPaul Willis , general manager of the Volkswagen Group in Britain, said Monday that repairs for diesels sold in Europe would not involve the installation of a new emission filtration system using urea as an additive. But such a remedy is expected in many vehicles in the United States, which has tougher standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides, which have been linked to a host of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.\nFallout from the scandal has ricocheted throughout Germany, Europe’s largest economy, with a benchmark survey released Tuesday showing that economic sentiment dropped more than expected in October, to 1.9 points from 12.1 in September.\n“The emissions scandal at Volkswagen and sluggish growth in emerging markets are dampening the economic outlook for Germany,” said the ZEW research institute, which conducts the monthly survey.\nGermany’s economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel , said Tuesday that he felt confident the problems at Volkswagen, a source of more than 750,000 jobs in the country, would not inflict permanent damage on the national economy.\nLast week, Matthias Mueller , Volkswagen’s new chief executive, said the automaker would require more than the $7.3 billion it had initially set aside to bring vehicles with illegal software into compliance with emissions standards, but he added that it was too soon to provide a new estimate.\nOn Monday, Werner Hoyer , the head of the European Investment Bank, said the institution was checking to see whether Volkswagen had violated its agreements to uphold certain environmental goals.\nSpeaking to the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Hoyer said that he was “very disappointed” by Volkswagen’s actions and that the institute he leads would conduct “very thorough investigations” into how the automaker spent the estimated 4$5.2 billion it borrowed from the bank since 1990 for the development of engines with lower emissions.\nIn case of impropriety, he said, the investment bank would consider demanding that the loans be repaid.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:51:00.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
