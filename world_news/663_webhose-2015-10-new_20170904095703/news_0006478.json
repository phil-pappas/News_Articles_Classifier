FIRs have been lodged against both for the un-parliamentary remarks. Union home minister Rajnath Singh compared grand alliance partners with frogs and BJP leader Sadhvi Niranjana Jyoti called Lalu Prasad a joker.\nVidyarthi, who travelled with Mahatma Gandhi during pre-Independence riots in Bihar, said in 1950s electioneering the fight used to be quite amiable. \"No one hit below the belt. The commentaries were limited to social and political issues,\" he recalled.\nRecalling the decades of 1950s and 1960s, Vidyarthi said that most of the candidates had loudspeakers mounted on bicycles; some also carried loudspeakers dangling from shoulders to talk to a large number of people. The candidates who were rich travelled on bullock-carts. A few cars which carried star campaigners used to draw crowd of children.\n\"The voters used to donate money, grain and vegetables to run the campaign of candidates. Now candidates give money to voters,\" he said.\n\"Almost all of my friends from that period are no more,\" he said at his farm, trying to recall the names.\nAt that time the discussions largely revolved around Gandhi, freedom struggle and how to progress after Independence. People demanded schools, hospitals and the unemployed demanded jobs, he said.\n\"No one was corrupt, so there was no one to point fingers at. The politicians were well connected with voters and they did not need to bribe their way to win elections,\" he said.\nBorn in 1924 in Rajauli, Vidyarthi was CPM MLA from 1977 to 1985 from Nawada assembly segment. He was member of Bihar legislative council from 1990 to 1996. He is among the tallest Left leaders in Bihar.\nBattling poor health, Vidyarthi feels he is too old to contest elections. However, he is observing this year's assembly elections from Nawada and Patna where his family live.\nHe said from 1970s the level of politics started deteriorating. \"Indira Gandhi's opponents used to tell voters that she was of a dubious character,\" he said.
