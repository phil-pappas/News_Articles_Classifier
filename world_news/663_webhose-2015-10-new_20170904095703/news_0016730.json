By Seattle Times staff The Seattle Times \nWhat: Seattle startup Record360, which is in the business of getting rid of those paper documents you fill out when renting a car or apartment and replacing them with digital files. \nWho: Shane Skinner, co-founder and CEO \nAn eternal record: Record360 creates software and a mobile app that can be used to create a digital record of any property before it is rented. Customers and managers can take photos and videos of a rental car, for example, and note any dents or damage before signing off on the rental agreement. The video and photos are stored in the cloud to make sure they cannot be misplaced. \nNo paper scraps: Skinner realized the problem in his years of working at Enterprise Rent-a-Car. Whenever someone rented and returned cars, the company would fill out reports that noted the car’s condition. But sometimes employees missed a new dent or scratch when the car came back in or customers misplaced their original signed condition report. That often led to disputes and lost money.
