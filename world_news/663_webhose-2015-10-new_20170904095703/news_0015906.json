It touches on the research and commercial versions of small-satellite technology. Other domains such as in-orbit debris mitigation and satellite-based internet services have also been covered. The study attempts to identify the differentiating factors and success factors, and estimates the revenue for the small-satellite imaging market. The small-satellite launch forecast for 2015-2020 has also been provided. The study ends with key pointers for capitalizing on this growing market that can benefit suppliers and service providers in the small-satellite imaging market. Key Findings The number of small satellites to be launched between 2015 and 2020 is . More than % of these belong to the micro/mini-satellite segment. - Small satellites lost in launch failures in 2015 will result in an increase in the demand for small-satellite launch services in 2016. OneWeb's satellite constellation will account for % of the total small-satellite launch demand during 2015-2020. - The small-satellite imaging market is estimated to be valued at $ million in 2015 and reach $ million in 2020 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of % from 2015 to 2020. However, this revenue only represents the partial revenue that small-satellite imagery will take away from the existing satellite imaging market. - % of the small satellites to be launched during 2015-2020 will belong to commercial organizations looking to enter the Earth observation/imaging market with diverse imaging data services using cloud/Big Data technologies. - Recent research efforts of Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) have resulted in the successful integration of high-resolution sensors onboard small-satellite platforms.- Although small-satellite imagery data products will compete with existing products, they will account for about % of the existing market in 2020. The evolution of web-based analytics platforms and customized analytics algorithms will bring in new customers that previously had no access to satellite data. - Upcoming dedicated small-satellite launch services will drive the imaging and analytics market owing to the reducing launch costs for small-satellite missions.
