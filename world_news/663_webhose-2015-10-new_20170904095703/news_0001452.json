Yan Novikov, head of the Russian Almaz-Antey concern, speaking at a news conference, did not specify what was in the report and he did not say whether he had been given an advance look.\nThe Malaysian airliner crashed 17 July, 2014, in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine and is widely believed to have been shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Ukraine and Western countries contend the missile was fired by Russian troops or Russian-backed separatists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:08:40.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
