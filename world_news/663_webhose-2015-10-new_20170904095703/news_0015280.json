As evidence of the strong need for change, MemSQL ( www.memsql.com ), the leader in real-time databases for transactions and analytics, has quickly gained momentum as an enterprise alternative to legacy relational database offerings. Gartner placed MemSQL in the Visionaries quadrant of the \"Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems\": http://memsql.com/gartnermq , and Forrester named the company a 'Strong Performer' in its Forrester WaveÂ™: In-Memory Database Platforms, Q3 2015 report http://memsql.com/forrester . \nOracle OpenWorld, taking place in San Francisco on October 25-29, 2015, presents an ideal venue for anyone to see first-hand the unique advantages that MemSQL brings to the market. The company will showcase its leading in-memory database at Booth #501, and demonstrate how to build real-time data pipelines based on real customer use cases. \nVisit MemSQL at #oow15 Booth 501: Learn How to Build Real-Time Data Pipelines - Click to Tweet \n\"Our real-time database offers a distinct approach to process and analyze data concurrently on a cluster of commodity servers. And now there's industry validation by both Gartner and Forrester clearly showing that powerful advantage,\" said Eric Frenkiel, co-founder and CEO, MemSQL. \"When you look at the price performance and innovative features of MemSQL compared to legacy vendors, we're the only ones well positioned to help our customers and partners cost-effectively compete where timeliness of data and analytics is everything.\" \nAccess to new data types and the ability to tap into real-time data flows are proving transformative across all industries and market segments. Retailers are now able to offer a 360 degree customer experience, while today's most in-demand lifestyle and social apps thrive on the speed and exactness of a real-time exchange. Soon every device that comes embedded with a sensor will blend seamlessly into the Internet of Things -- all with a database powering them. \nAddressing the tidal wave of new devices and interconnectivity, and the increasing number of data points being generated, MemSQL launched Streamliner, a one-click integrated solution for Apache Spark that gives customers access to real-time analytics. Streamliner allows users to build real-time data pipelines in minutes. When Streamliner is connected to a distributed message queue like Apache Kafka, concurrent users running analytical queries can reduce data latency from days to hours, or down to zero, and stream data directly into the MemSQL in-memory rowstore or flash and disk-based columnstore. \nTo connect with MemSQL at Oracle OpenWorld visit us at Booth 501, where we will demo Supercar, MemCity, and the Database Speed Test. To schedule an executive briefing onsite at Moscone Center, or at our company headquarters in San Francisco just blocks from the show, reach us at: http://www.memsql.com/oow . \nAbout MemSQL MemSQL is the leader in real-time databases for transactions and analytics.
