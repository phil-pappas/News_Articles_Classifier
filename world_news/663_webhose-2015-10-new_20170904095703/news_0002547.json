(\"the Company\") announced today that it will reorganize its U.S. Commercial organization as it begins to transition from a maturing primary care product portfolio to a differentiated specialty portfolio that will include areas such as cardiovascular, pain management and oncology. \n\"As we face the loss of exclusivity in the coming year of our largest product, we also look ahead to great opportunities with our emerging portfolio in cardiology, oncology, fibromyalgia and pain relief,\" said Ken Keller , President, U.S. Commercial, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. \"This calls for us to restructure our organization into a smaller, highly targeted and efficient operating model, with a greater emphasis on customer-facing roles.\" \nAs part of the reorganization, the Company will reduce expenses, including a reduction in headcount, from its U.S. Commercial operations. The Company expects to eliminate 1,000 to 1,200 positions across the U.S. Commercial function, through voluntary and involuntary displacements as well as eliminating open positions. The eliminated jobs will come from the U.S. Commercial Home Office, located in Parsippany, New Jersey , as well as field-based sales and other positions throughout the country. This reorganization is not focused on U.S.-based R&D functions, which have staff concentrated in Edison, NJ , or its packaging plant in Bethlehem, PA. \n\"Daiichi Sankyo recognizes the macro changes occurring in the U.S. healthcare system that place a greater emphasis on managing the needs of patients with more complex healthcare needs. As a specialty company, we will be positioned to meet those needs and invest in advancing technologies that will make a significant difference in patient lives,\" said Keller. \"While this initiative will place us on the path toward long-term success, it does require us to make some difficult decisions. We are grateful for the contributions of all of our employees and are committed to making this process as easy and streamlined as possible for them through outplacement services and other support.\" \nAbout Daiichi SankyoDaiichi Sankyo Group is dedicated to the creation and supply of innovative pharmaceutical products to address diversified, unmet medical needs of patients in both mature and emerging markets.
