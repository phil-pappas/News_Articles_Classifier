Bull-it Jeans can now be added to that list, but its armored hoodie uses a relatively new material called Covec, which was designed specifically for motorcycle apparel and has abrasion resistance that's better than Kevlar and as good as some leathers. \nAccording to Bull-it Jeans, when compared to regular cotton fabric hoodies, Kevlar-lined hoodies and even some leather jackets, Covec has a higher abrasion resistance, higher cut resistance and lower friction heat transfer. That means that should you leave your motorcycle unexpectedly and slide on, let’s say concrete, a hoodie made with Covec will reduce the chances of your skin coming into contact with the pavement. \nBull-it has gone to great lengths to be sure it can back up its claims. The company tested its products to meet the CE-13595-1 standard for protective clothing, which comprises three tests that grade impact abrasion, cut resistance and burst resistance. As a result of performance in the tests, Bull-it Jeans created its own slide rating system to indicate the amount of time it would take to slide on a hard surface before skin is exposed. For instance, apparel with an SR4 rating would take four seconds, SR6 would take six seconds and VoloCE seven seconds. The Bull-it Jeans hoodie has a rating of SR6. \nWhile six seconds might not sound like a lot, it's a long time to be skidding across a hard surface. Covec also creates a barrier to prevent the transfer of heat during a slide so there’s reduced danger of getting a skin burn on top of road rash. Take a look at what this poor test \"dummy\" had to do to prove it. \nFor the sake of comparison, in a 2011 test by Ride magazine, a pair of Hein Gericke leather pants came lasted 4.74 seconds, a set of Draggin' Kevlar Jeans made it to 3.07 seconds, Rev'It's Textile Trousers managed 0.71 seconds, and a regular pair of Levi's stonewash jeans lasted just 0.56 seconds. \nWith the exception of the hood itself, the entire Bull-It Jeans hoodie is lined with Covec, which in addition to protecting you during a fall and slide, is also claimed to be breathable and create a microclimate around your body to keep you cool in summer and warm in winter. \nIt also comes with a host of other features, including CE 1621 approved protectors in the back, shoulders and elbows, deep front pockets and a separate pocket for your cell phone, and a water-resistant finish to help keep you dry. \nMake no mistake, this is not a four-season, all-purpose jacket. A good long rain might still leave you damp, and you’ll need to wear some base layers underneath when temperatures fall below 60° F (15° C). But at US$289.95 it is a viable alternative to a heavier synthetic jacket or even some thin leather jacket without armor. \nThe following video illustrates the various properties of Covec relative to other materials found in protective gear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:18:18.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
