Play has been slowed down, tackling made easier, and goalkeepers tougher to beat, making it trickier to break down opponents and, somewhat frustrating at first, but ultimately a little more rewarding when goals are scored. \nThe headline new feature is the introduction of 12 international women’s sides. A refreshing inclusion and with a different feel to the men’s game, genuinely playable. A bite-size version of the popular FUT mode is also a welcome addition. \nFifa 16 does not represent a great leap forward, but it’s still as addictive as ever. \n\nGAME: Forza 6 (Xbox One) \nREVIEWER: Charles Reynolds \nRacing on to the Xbox One, Forza 6 is perhaps the best-looking racing game yet. With a likeable combination of stunning visuals and game play adjustable to the ability of almost any player, the game boasts phenomenal attention to detail both in its 450-plus cars and wide variety of courses. \nWet-weather and night-time racing, as well as a huge range of highly enjoyable side challenges help to compensate for a central career mode that can become a little repetitive despite the huge choice of vehicles. Nevertheless, this is a game that will appeal to petrol heads and back-seat drivers alike. –- The Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:21:29.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
