The new FM08 and FM10 feature Intel’s quad-core processor and multiple operating system options ranging from windows CE version 7 to the latest Windows 10. Designed for the supply chain and logistic applications, the rugged vehicle-mount computers fit seamlessly into forklifts, trucks, and various lifts for inventory pickers, to streamline ordering and inventory management, improve operational efficiencies, and improve safety. The industrial-grade FM08 and FM10 were designed for usability in the vehicle with versatility in mounting and the ability to quickly dismount without having to unplug any connectors. The computers also feature a 4-hour back-up battery, multiple I/Os, a unique key-lock feature, and robust processing power from Intel’s 1.91GHz Atom E3845. The 10.4-inch display of the FM10 and 8-inch display of the FM08 offer GFG resistive-touch screens, operable with gloved hands. Built for advanced computing in the supply chain environment, the vehicle-mount computers also offer full QWERTY keyboards, front-facing cameras for face recognition and voice log-in, and multiple operating system options with Windows CE, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.\n“Supply chain environments have unique needs and the right technology will ensure the operational flow runs as efficiently and error-free as possible,” said Khalid Kidari, vice president of Winmate. “The easy and versatile docking options, along with the powerful computing and advanced communication features of the FM08 and FM10 will prove a tremendous asset in any vehicle operating in the supply chain.”\nThe FM08 VMC and FM10 VMC features a u-Blox M8N GPS module, and wireless connectivity with built-in Bluetooth 4.0 and comprehensive 802.11a/b/g/n/ac dual band WiFi.\nThe new Winmate series was also designed with durability and flexibility in mind with a sturdy magnesium housing built to withstand extreme temperatures, shock, vibration and drops. The FM08 and FM10 are also sealed to IP65 for protection against water and dust.\nOn October 28, 2015, Winmate will host a webinar, “How to Choose the Right Warehouse Technology to Increase ROI,” in coordination with Conference-Edge.
