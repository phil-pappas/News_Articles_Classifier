The Express feature set empowers libraries to deliver excellent service in their communities by reaching patrons on the smartphones and tablets they use every day. The new feature set creates a highly engaging digital experience optimized for mobile users.\nPublic Libraries serving communities of less than 25,000 people can now create their own streamlined app, choosing from such popular features as Catalog Search using Smart Prefix search, ILS integration for holds and renewals, Ask A Librarian and more, including Boopsie’s newly introduced Top 20 Books channel and Ratings & Reviews. Each customized app will provide users with seamless access to content as the apps integrate with every major ILS provider and every major eContent provider , from OverDrive to Zinio and EBSCO, as well.\n63% of adult cell phone users access the internet on their phones and a growing segment of young adults, minorities and lower income Americans rely entirely on their phones for internet access . Boopsie’s mobile apps provide a flexible solution to meet the diverse needs of these mobile public library users, from professionals to job seekers and parents to students, and help increase small libraries’ presence to make them a larger part of their communities.\n“Nearly 80% of U.S. libraries are classified as small libraries ,” says Megan Vizzini, Boopsie’s Vice President of Sales, Accounts and Customer Service. “Our new Express offering meets the needs of these small towns and cities where library resources are in demand, but libraries are not staffed with large teams of technology professionals. We’re here to help balance the needs of our library customers to serve geographically dispersed populations and libraries with small budgets.”\n“Oftentimes libraries of our size are overlooked by local and state governments because our needs don’t stack up to those cases presented by libraries that serve a larger audience,” said Jessi Brown, Technical Services Supervisor at Huntington City – Township Public Library. “Companies like Boopsie make a huge difference when they work with us to provide flexible solutions like this. We’re excited to see for ourselves the wraparound support that we’ve heard so much about from other Boopsie customers.”\nThis Express offering saves librarian time by streamlining the implementation and maintenance process. It can also be incorporated into large state-wide and consortium contracts in order to make it more cost-effective and less resource intensive for a large library system to serve more of their state’s population via mobile devices.\nContact Boopsie for an online demo of how the Express feature set can help extend the reach of your small library.\nAbout Boopsie\nBoopsie, Inc. is the industry-leading mobile platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provider for over 4,000 library locations worldwide.
