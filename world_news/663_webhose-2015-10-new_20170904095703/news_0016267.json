As part of a new marketing campaign to celebrate the launch of DEWAR'S Scratched Cask, the brand is unveiling a 360 degree virtual reality experience to highlight the creation of their newest product. National Brand Ambassador Gabriel Cardarella leads viewers through the blustery Scottish highlands to follow the scratching and charring process involved in the creation of DEWAR'S Scratched Cask. Consumers will be able to take part by visiting www.Scratched360.com on their mobile phones, tablets and desktops. To enhance the experience, DEWAR'S will offer customized virtual reality viewers at select retailers across the country as well as shipping directly to consumers- through social media and the website. This allows consumers to feel as if they are in Scotland experiencing the process. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151011/275932 \n\" DEWAR'S is proud of the time and dedication that goes into the creation of our whisky, and we are excited for fans to gain a better understanding of exactly how our products are made,\" said Dan Pilas, VP and Brand Managing Director, DEWAR'S Blended Scotch Whisky Portfolio . \"Virtual reality gives us the unique opportunity to share our passion and give consumers a closer look at our home in Scotland.\" \nDEWAR'S Scratched Cask is a new whisky that uses American white oak barrels from its bourbon counterparts to create a unique, new liquid. The result is surprisingly smooth with a flavorful finish. Viewers of Scratched360 follow the barrels across the Atlantic, then journey to the cooperage and warehouse to see the Scotch making process firsthand. From charring and lightly scratching the barrels to filling them back with the liquid, which will rest for several months so the flavors can mellow, viewers follow Cardarella every step of the way. By the end of the video, they have an in-depth understanding of how this whisky is made. The process \"isn't easy, but if it was, it wouldn't be worth it,\" Cardarella tells viewers as he closes the video with an introduction to the Master Blender and visionary of the product--Stephanie MacLeod. \nDEWAR'S will further bring the new blend to life through events around the country. A custom-built, 10-foot tall replication of an American white oak bourbon barrel brandished with the DEWAR'S logo will travel across the country, starting in Chicago on October 10(th) and continuing on to Louisville, New York City and Miami, throughout the month. Consumers will be invited to step into the barrel for a 360-degree, 4D projection mapping video experience that further illuminates the charring and scratching process. There they will sample the product (according to state regulations) and have an opportunity to test the virtual reality viewers. They will also have the ability to use a \"groover\" tool to graffiti a wall of charred wood and experience the scratching process. With their participation, they will receive sample of DEWAR'S Scratched Cask at an approved local account. Guests are invited to visit DEWAR'S Facebook page at www.facebook.com/DewarsUS to find out more about when and where the barrel will make an appearance in their hometown. \nScratched360 will be amplified with a digital media plan. Media will focus on banner takeovers, sponsored headlines, rich media on mobile platforms as well as homepage takeovers, dedicated email blasts to readers at specific outlets and social media promotion. The brand will utilize YouTube360, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter as unique points of entry, releasing exclusive content and macro-photography to further showcase the DEWAR'S Scratched Cask process. \nAbout DEWAR'S® \nFounded in 1846 by John Dewar, DEWAR'S has grown from a small wine and spirits merchant shop in Scotland, to one of the largest Scotch whisky brands in the world. Best known for its iconic DEWAR'S White Label, the top selling blended Scotch whisky in the USA, it has expanded its family to create a portfolio of premium and super premium whiskies including DEWAR'S 12 Year Old, DEWAR'S 15 Year Old, DEWAR'S 18 Year Old and the exclusive DEWAR'S Signature. These whiskies are crafted using the DEWAR'S oak marrying ageing process. Pioneered by DEWAR'S in 1899, it involves returning the hand-crafted blend to vintage oak casks for further maturation. The result is a smoother taste with a long, lingering finish; a taste that wins medals and applause, making DEWAR'S the world's most awarded Scotch. \nThe DEWAR'S® brand is part of the portfolio of Bacardi Limited, headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda. Bacardi Limited refers to the Bacardi group of companies, including Bacardi International Limited. \nPLEASE DRINK RESPONSIBLY ©2015.
