Dynamic speed adjustments and intricate manual controls enable the user to push the processor and memory further than ever - and that means the highest stability and precision.\n\nMaximus VIII Impact also has exclusive 5-Way Optimization that sorts all the complex settings with a click, for instant, highly-controllable performance boosts. This exclusive technology dynamically optimizes essential aspects of Maximus VIII Impact-based builds by monitoring real-time use, delivering superb CPU performance, everyday energy savings, ultra-stable digital power, cool and quiet fans and even networking and audio settings that are tailored for the apps currently in use. \n\nPro Clock technology is an ASUS-exclusive dedicated base-clock (BCLK) generator designed for 6th-generation Intel processors. It allows Maximus VIII Impact users to overclock base-clock frequencies to 400MHz , or even beyond. This custom solution works in tandem with the ASUS-exclusive TurboV Processing Unit (TPU) to enhance voltage and base-clock overclocking control. Boot times can be reduced, jitter is lowered and stability is increased under heavy overclocking - providing an exciting new way to boost performance to extreme heights.\n\nMaximus VIII Impact users are also able to go faster by fitting the very latest DDR4 memory, and push for extreme overclocked-RAM speeds of 4133MHz and higher.\n\nBest mini-ITX audio: SupremeFX Impact III, illuminated audio jacks and 600ohm Sonic SenseAmp\n\nSupremeFX Impact III represents the pinnacle of mini-ITX audio quality, featuring the best gaming-audio inputs and outputs, color-coded LEDs to guide to the right audio jacks, and a collection of carefully-selected professional-grade audio components, including an ESS ES9023P digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with Hyperstream„ technology, ultra-low-jitter clock, Nichicon capacitors, 2VRMS headphone amp, and Sonic SenseAmp that automatically detects and optimizes any headset between 32 and 600ohms for the purest sound quality.\n\nSupremeFX Impact III also features intuitive Sonic Studio II, making it easy for the listener to apply and enjoy different audio effects for perfect entertainment - plus Perfect Voice noise-cancellation technology for team conversations with total clarity.\n\nBest mini-ITX networking: Intel Gigabit Ethernet, plus exclusive LANGuard and GameFirst\n\nMaximus VIII Impact has the best lag-banishing networking technologies, including the latest Intel Gigabit Ethernet to reduce CPU overhead and deliver exceptionally-high TCP and UDP throughput - freeing up more computing power for gameplay.\n\nASUS-exclusive LANGuard's signal-coupling technology and premium surface-mounted components ensure reliable connections and better throughput.\n\nNew and improved GameFirst technology optimizes network traffic for faster, lag-free online gaming - and now we've added Multi-Gate Teaming, enabling Maximus VIII Impact users to team all their networks for maximum bandwidth and the smoothest-ever gameplay. It also includes all-new Intelligent mode, which automatically compiles a database by parsing new app data to ensure that every game is optimized for the best performance.\n\nBest mini-ITX connectivity: 2x2 802.11ac MU-MIMO Wi-Fi, U.2 and USB 3.1\n\nMaximus VIII Impact delivers next-level 802.11ac Wi-Fi with 2x2 dual-band 2.4/5GHz antennas for up 867Mbit/s transfer speeds - and the very latest Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) technology to ensure that every connected user experiences the best wireless and online speeds.\n\nMaximus VIII Impact also lets users unlock the full potential of the latest NVM Express (NVMe) technology to make SSDs scream at top speed. The new mini-ITX motherboard's built-in U.2 connector serves up data-transfer speeds of up to 32Gbit/s, and the board includes both USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A and reversible Type-C connectors for data-transfer speeds of up to 10Gbit/s - that's twice as fast USB 3.0.\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nASUS Global Press Room: http://press.asus.com\nASUS Global Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/asus\nASUS Global Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/asus\nASUS ROG Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/asusrog\nASUS ROG Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/asus_rog\n\nSPECIFICATIONS \nASUS ROG Maximus VIII Impact\nProcessor/CPU socketLGA1151 socket for 6th-generation Intel Core„ i7 / i5 / i3 / Pentium / Celeron processors\nChipsetIntel Z170 Express\nMemory2 x DIMMs, up to a maximum of 32GB, DDR4 4133 (OC)\nIntel Extreme Memory Profile (XMP) supported\nExpansion slots1 x PCIe 3.0 x16\nGraphics (VGA)Integrated Intel HD Graphics processor\nHDMI with maximum resolution of 4096 x 2160 at 24Hz \nIntel InTru„ 3D / Quick Sync Video / Clear Video HD Technology / Insider„\nStorage4 x SATA 6Gbit/s\n1 x U.2\nNetworking/LANIntel I219-V Gigabit LAN with ASUS LANGuard and GameFirst technologies\nWirelessDual-band 2.4/5GHz 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi with MU-MIMO support\nBluetooth V4.1, 4.0LE, 3.0HS\nUSB1 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A (on back panel)\n1 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C (on back panel)\n6 x USB 3.0 ports (4 on back panel, 2 mid-board)\nAudioROG SupremeFX Impact III\n- SupremeFX shielding technology \n- ES9023P high-definition codec\n- Sonic SenseAmp\n- 2VRMS headphone amp (32-600 ohms)\n- Jack-detection, multi-streaming, front-panel mic jack-retasking\n- Optical S/PDIF-out port on back panel\n- Front-panel audio connector\nDimensions / form factorMini-ITX, 6.7 x 7.7in (17 x \n\nAbout ASUS \nASUS is a worldwide top-three consumer notebook vendor and maker of the world's best-selling, most award-winning motherboards.
