FYI (for your information), Toadies: I support no Indian political party and oppose all attacks on free speech. Liberty is my only party.\"\nToady, is a term referred to person who praises and helps powerful people in order to get their approval.\nHis tweets came after Shiv Sena activists in Mumbai blackened the face of ORF chief Sudheendra Kulkarni over his refusal to cancel the book launch function of former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, prompting strong condemnation from political parties.\n\"I think what's crept into Indian life now is a degree of thuggish violence which is new,\" Rushdie told a news channel.\nThe Mumbai-born author was in 2012, forced to pull out from the Jaipur Literature Festival citing death threats after some authors used the platform to read out portions from his 1989 novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" which was the target of a fatwa, for allegedly hurting Muslim sentiments.\nMeanwhile, author Chetan Bhagat took to twitter to term as posturing and politics the decision of authors who had announced they were returning the Sahitya Akademi award.\n\"Accepting an award and then returning it demeans the award and the jury. It's posturing. It's politics,\" Bhagat wrote.\nIn another tweet, he questioned the decision of the authors, saying if someone did not like the government in power would they return their passports or their government college degrees? \"Why just an award?\" he asked.\nBhagat had earned the ire of social media for his tweets \"Ok so am I also supposed to return my Sahitya Academy award? Oh wait. Haven't got it yet.\"\nAttempting to be humorous he said, \"Is there an award return office? And do they then zap you men in black style so you forget you ever got an award.\"\n\"Men in Black\" was a sci-fiction film where the alien fighting protagonists used devices to erase memories of the public.\nThe popular author also said, \"Politicians not protesting Dadri play to their vote bank. But those protesting it are also playing to theirs. Nothing more. Nothing less.\"\nAt least 21 authors have so far announced their decision to return their awards given by the Sahitya Akademi, and five writers have stepped down from official positions of the literary body, which in turn has convened an emergency meeting on October 23 to discuss the developments.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:57:22.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
