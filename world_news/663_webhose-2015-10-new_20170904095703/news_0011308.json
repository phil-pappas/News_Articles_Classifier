Anuga is the world's largest international food fair, organized by Koelnmesse and Group FOOD, with over 160,000 visitors from 192 different countries. The award comes shortly after Bellucci released its trace-to-source technology in the form of an innovative new app. \nThe free Bellucci App, which traces bottles of EVOO to their specific origins in rural Italy, teaches users how to evaluate product freshness and to taste for flavors unique to EVOO. Users also learn how to discern flavor nuances based on harvests, regions and olive cultivars. A recipe section highlights EVOO's flavorful impact on food. \nThe Anuga jury commended Bellucci for successfully communicating the value of a traditional agricultural product through innovative digital and social media. \nThe fair also featured speakers committed to ensuring the authenticity of Italian food products. Maurizio Martina, the Italian minister of agriculture, and Luigi Scordamaglia, president of the Italian Food Industry Federation, were among them. \nGiovanni Quaratesi, Bellucci's European Sales Manager, said, \"The Bellucci App is empowering consumers with the ability to authenticate their EVOO and to appreciate the flavors that come from origin. We are thrilled to be contributing to the enjoyment of such a historically important food.\" \nThe Bellucci App is available for download on both Apple and Android devices. Bellucci EVOO is available for purchase in US stores and on the Bellucci website.
