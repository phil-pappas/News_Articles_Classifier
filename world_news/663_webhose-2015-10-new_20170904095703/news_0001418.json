(Photo: Reuters) \nApple's much awaited two new iPhone models, iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus hit Indian shores last night. This is by far the fastest rollout of an iPhone to Indian customers, post its US launch less than a month ago. \nThe phones were launched in the US market on September 10, 2015 and the tech giant claimed that it sold more than 13 million iPhone 6s and 6s Pluses during their first weekend of availability in 12 markets. \nThe iPhone 6s - 16 GB is priced at Rs 62,000, the 64GB for Rs 72,000 and 128GB for Rs 82,000. The iPhone 6s Plus 16GB will be available for Rs 72,000, 64GB for 82,000 and 128GB for Rs 92,000. \nThe new iPhones will be available in silver, gold, space grey and a new rose gold colour. \nThe phones can be bought from authorised Apple resellers and at chain stores like Croma and Reliance Digital, as well as on e-commerce websites Flipkart , Amazon India, and Snapdeal. \nTrying to rake in the moolah, many retailers already started taking pre-orders for the devices. \nMajor telecom company Bharti Airtel said it is offering free 4G data over 12 months, saving customers Rs 15,000 on their monthly bill for the iPhones. \nEarlier Vodafone had said it will offer the latest iPhone 6S and 6S plus from October 16 wherein customers can avail free data and voice benefits worth Rs 8,885 for six months. \nThe phones sport a 64-bit A9 processor which is faster and saves more power. It is 70 per cent faster than the A8 chip. The company claimed the graphics would be 90 per cent faster on the device. Also, the 3D Force Touch has been deeply integrated with the iOS 9 on these two iPhones, offering different actions on a tap, press and deep press. \n(With input from agencies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:01:19.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
