The early stage drug-development company, which is working on treatments for rare diseases associated with the liver, raised roughly $72 million by selling 5.5 million shares, it said. The deal gives Dimension a market value of roughly $323 million at its IPO price.\nShares recently fell 11% on Thursday on the Nasdaq Global Market, where it made its stock-trading debut under the symbol DMTX.\nA spokesman for Dimension declined to comment.\nThough 2015 started strong for sector, demand for biotech stocks and IPOs has waned recently. Six pharmaceutical or biotech companies have gone public in the past four weeks, five of which priced below expectations—the most to do so in a four-week period all year, according to Dealogic. In 2014 and 2013, health-care—overwhelmingly led by pharmaceutical and biotech companies—had more IPOs than any other sector, Dealogic said.\n\"It definitely feels a little bit chilled out there,\" said Ziad Bakri, a health-care analyst at mutual-fund firm T. Rowe Price Group, referring to the market for new public listings for biotech companies.\nIn early October, oncology company NovoCure Ltd. priced its IPO below expectations. The company's shares fell sharply in their first day of trade, though they have since rebounded.\n\"Pricing deals properly is key,\" said Jill Ford, head of equity syndicate for the Americas at Credit Suisse.\n\"No one wants to see big falls, where the stock opens down 20%,\" she said.\nThe stumbles in the biotech IPO market come as biotech stocks more broadly have tumbled. Since hitting an all-time high in July, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has fallen about 24%, partly because of increased scrutiny of drug pricing.\nTo be sure, the market for biotech IPOs has slowed in the past only to bounce back. In spring 2014, many biotech stocks sold off sharply, and the pace of biotech companies coming to market slowed in the subsequent months, before picking up again.\nBiotech companies, often more so than other sectors, require easy access to the equity capital markets. It can take many years, and many millions of dollars, to shepherd an early stage drug through clinical trials and ultimately FDA approval. The ability to sell additional stock makes the process easier financially.\nWrite to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"T.
