But his image and political standing have been dented by the ongoing student protests, an expert said on Monday.\nPolitical analyst Daniel Silke told News24 that the minister's standing had been weakened, and so had that of the South African Communist Party, of which he is the general secretary.\nSilke said although there might be some in the ruling party who had been pleased at Nzimande being embarrassed by the violent student protests that have swept the country, he would not lose his cabinet post - at least not yet.\n\"We really have very little precedent in SA for cabinet ministers to be replaced following protests. We might yet see a cabinet reshuffle, but students themselves would have to be much more vocal on his position if it was to have any effect on the cabinet. For the moment, he will survive.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=4324", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=416796", "http://whoswho.co.za/daniel-silke-416796", "http://whoswho.co.za/blade-nzimande-4324"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:30:26.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
