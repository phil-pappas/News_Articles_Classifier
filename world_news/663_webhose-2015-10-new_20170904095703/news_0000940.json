Analysts on average projected profit of 59 cents on revenue of $21 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been focused on selling Microsoft’s Azure cloud services and Office 365 subscription-based products, bolstering the company’s new Intelligent Cloud and Productivity segments. The software maker also released the new Windows 10 operating system last quarter as a free upgrade for many consumers, while large businesses paid for multiyear licenses that included the new program.\n“In enterprise and cloud their product offerings are strong and their moats are deep,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial, who has a hold rating on the stock. “The enterprise base is the pillar of the company, but that doesn’t get you the huge multiple.”\nMicrosoft shares gained 4.9 percent in extended trading following the report, after closing at $48.03. The shares were unchanged in the quarter, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 6.9 percent.\nEarnings were reduced by restructuring costs of $1.14 billion, the Redmond, Washington-based company said. Microsoft in July announced it would cut as many as 7,800 jobs and incur a massive writedown on its Nokia handset unit, plus take a restructuring charge as it scales back its ambitions for making its own mobile phones.\nMicrosoft released Windows 10 on July 29 in a staggered launch that meant all customers didn’t get it at once. Nadella said at a Dell Inc. conference on Wednesday that the rollout was the fastest of any version of Windows to both consumers and the enterprise. The company has pledged to reach 1 billion Windows 10 users within three years.\nThe new software arrived as the PC market remained mired in a slump. Earlier this month, researcher Gartner Inc. said global shipments declined 7.7 percent in the third quarter, as the industry heads toward a fourth annual contraction.\nOn the cloud side, Microsoft is persuading both consumers and businesses to sign on for Internet-based versions of its Office suite of productivity programs, called Office 365, and is focusing more of its engineering work on those iterations rather than traditional software that is purchased once and installed on customers’ own machines. Late in the quarter, Microsoft released the new Office 2016, which includes flagship tools such as Word and Excel.\nThe company last month announced a reorganization of the units for which it reports revenue into three categories: Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure and server software; Productivity and Business Processes, including Office and Office 365; and More Personal Computing, or products like Windows, Web-search services, Xbox gaming and devices such as the Surface tablet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:39:10.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
