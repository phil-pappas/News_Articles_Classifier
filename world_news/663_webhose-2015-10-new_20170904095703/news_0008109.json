Tanner , the world’s largest employee recognition company, today announced a groundbreaking partnership with MuleSoft , the company that makes it easy to connect applications, data and devices, that will provide universal integration between O.C. Tanner recognition solutions and a host of enterprise applications. The partnership will accelerate recognition program implementation and effectiveness for O.C. Tanner clients by immediately integrating O.C. Tanner solutions file-free with HRIS and HCM systems like SAP, Oracle, ADP, Workday, and dozens of others.\n“Universal integration is core to our strategy,” said Dave Petersen, CEO of O.C. Tanner. “We believe that free-flowing connectivity with enterprise applications is the future state of our industry. That future state begins now.”\nBrent Hayward, vice president of global partners and services, MuleSoft, added, “O.C. Tanner’s vision and energy aligns well with MuleSoft’s mission to connect apps, data, and devices across industries. O.C. Tanner’s domain expertise plus MuleSoft’s technology gives us a whole new way to help companies get the most out of HR enterprise systems in the cloud.”\nUniversal connectivity makes sense for recognition solutions, since, according to Bersin by Deloitte, one-third of all organizations have 10 or more HR systems in place. “It’s all about our customers,” said Petersen, “On the surface, announcing an alliance with one HR system sounds fine, but what if you’re O.C. Tanner and you have thousands of customers in 150 countries, running a dozen HR systems? This partnership means even if a client is running Workday in North America, SAP in Europe, and Oracle in APAC, we can offer a consistent recognition experience globally.” The new offering helps HR leaders:\nprovide new insights from integrated data increase data integrity and security dramatically speed up program implementation increase user adoption and program effectiveness\nLack of HR technology integration has been a significant problem. 49 percent of large organizations allocate over 10 percent of their HR technology budget to integration efforts [Sierra-Cedar 2014]. In spite of that expense, fewer than a quarter of organizations have any real-time integration between their HRIS systems. Only 13 percent of organizations leverage an enterprise integration strategy (such as MuleSoft) that allows real-time integration with enterprise systems both within HRIS and beyond.\nO.C. Tanner solutions already allow employee recognition to happen easily within communication tools like Outlook and Sharepoint. This partnership will extend that possibility to other collaboration programs gaining traction like Yammer and Slack with a simple #thanks. “It’s a lot easier for recognition to become part of a company’s culture when it can happen in the programs people use every day,” said Petersen, “that’s where the recognition industry is headed.”\nThe partnership will take advantage of MuleSoft’s Anypoint Platform™. The platform is a complete solution for API-led connectivity that integrates applications and data both on-premises and in the cloud, unleashing the value of that data through the design, implementation and management of APIs .\nAbout O.C.
