Our team was honored to work with this extraordinary group of entrepreneurs and the TechWomen program to help promote a new generation of global woman leaders in STEM,” said Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos. “I am personally inspired by the hard work and incredible commitment of the TechWomen entrepreneurs. As we all execute on this #ironsisters pledge to help 100 other women, 10,000 will be impacted just from the women in the room together today.” \nAssistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Evan Ryan, who oversees the TechWomen program for the U.S. State Department, said, “TechWomen is as much about a shared community experience as it is about science and innovation. The inclusive culture Elizabeth Holmes has built at Theranos and her experiences as an inventor, scientist, and leader are precisely the kind of example of leadership that these TechWomen came to the U.S. to experience. We are delighted that Theranos employees spent this time working with our women leaders and that Elizabeth shared her passion for progress through science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.” \nSeveral Theranos employees spoke about their experience working in a woman-led business and in a company in which women are encouraged to have leadership roles in STEM. Theranos software senior product manager Angela Ha said, “Being on the Theranos team is not just about our shared commitment to changing the health care paradigm, it’s about being able to work at a place dedicated to cutting edge science and tech, where a lot of the senior people are women and its led by a woman who has invented more at the age of 31 than most engineers do in a lifetime.” \nMany of the program participants asked questions over the course of the day-long workshop regarding the challenges of being a woman in the STEM field, and program organizers offered a series of insights and advice aimed towards overcoming obstacles related to gender. “Be the smartest and hardest working person in the room,” said Mona Atallah, also a software senior product manager at Theranos. “That's how you build a place like Theranos. We all watch Elizabeth work harder than anyone. It’s motivating, because she’s there in the trenches with us day in and day out.” \nHolmes is working with the TechWomen program as part of her Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship (PAGE) initiative. In addition to TechWomen, Holmes’ PAGE Initiative will work to address global health care problems, connect women and girls, and enfranchise entrepreneurs. \nAbout Theranos \nTheranos, Inc. is a consumer health technology company founded in 2003 by Elizabeth Holmes.
