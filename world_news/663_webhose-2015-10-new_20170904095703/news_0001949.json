The action was driven by economic interests Britain had over the AmahHlubi land which was finally dispossessed on a pure colonial agenda.\nThe action compromised indigenous language of AmaHlubi which nearly disappeared/ extinct. But what is surprising is that the intention of colonisation of land and destruction of Kingship is now being perpetuated by our tribal neighbours the Zulus or King Zwelithini for advancement of greediness and territory at the time when we think we are liberated.\nZulus and AmaHlubi had been living in peace as good neighbours to one another. It should not be a difficult exercise to approve the land claim made by AmaHlubi King Mthimkhulu III. The struggle waged against the colonial rule and apartheid regime was to liberate blacks in general and Africans in particular surely the definition of the objective of the struggle coming from the ruling party surely the matter must be given an attention it deserve.\nIt would only be if the current government is not interested or willing to address, as the matter which had been long outstanding.\n The King of Zulus must confine their land claim and Kingship along the traditional territorial lines within KwaZulu and leave Natal for AmaHlubi nation.\nThe Zulu King acts as if he is the heir of Britain over the AmaHlubi land but what has to be noted is that democratic breakthrough of 1994 has brought the benefits and liberation to all South Africans.\nAll the languages that are taught at school, there’s no attempts to teach Tekela Language for the Hlubi nation in regions/areas where AmaHlubi are found in large numbers. It is only through the return of land and allowing a space for AmaHlubi nation to practice their culture in peace in their land of birth.\n Please allow me as a subject of AmaHlubi King to Quote: from the submission to the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims which states that “Langalibalele I, who was the King of the AmaHlubi until his arrest and deposition in 1873, died under house arrest as a prisoner in 1889. As a result, his successors were never returned to the throne”\nThe AmaHlubi are not the subjects of King Zwelithini as were never conquered by Zulus or any nation ever since.\nCulture and language are distinctive to those of Zulus even at the time the British authorities were colonising Natal, the war was clear that it was between AmaHlubi and British authorities.\nIn Hershel, Eastern Cape, AmaHlubi can appreciate it when King Mthimkhulu III addresses them because they are his (King Mthimkhulu III) subjects. In each province you find more than one King why in KwaZulu/Natal people want to consolidate and extend their power to other areas not falling under their tribal area. It is a perpetuation of colonialism and tribalism for people to be intolerant and aggressive when they are to face reality.\nThe question to be answered is that, can the government assign another commission to sort out the land claim and disputes as far as the land claim is concerned in KwaZulu/Natal? Can the government act impartially on the matter to minimise land disputes between the AmaHlubi and the Zulu King? Is the South African President Mr GJ Zuma, tribalistic in his approach as every King complains about the huge chunk of a budget which is being allocated to the Zulu King?\nThe understanding is that we are having KwaZulu and Natal combined to form what we call today KwaZulu/Natal meaning it was acknowledged that there are two nations in the province.\nZulus can continue to practice their culture and traditions in Zulu land while AmaHlubi the great nation can also do the same in their space (Natal) unless it is true that the intention was to establish unfair dominance and to enlarge AmaZulu with other nations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:33:38.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
