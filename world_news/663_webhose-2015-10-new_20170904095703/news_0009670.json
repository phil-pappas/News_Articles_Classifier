El Nino finally here; but this one is weak, weird and late March 5, 2015 \nA long anticipated El Nino has finally arrived. But for drought-struck California, it's too little, too late, meteorologists say. Best hope for California drought: El Nino pattern next year May 15, 2015 \nThis week's wet storm isn't expected to provide much, if any, relief from California's historic drought. But there is hope for a serious drenching next year in the form of El Nino, a tropical weather pattern over the Pacific ... UN: This El Nino to be among the strongest since 1950 September 1, 2015 \nThe current El Nino weather pattern may be on track to become one of the strongest in more than half a century, experts at the World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday. Extreme Pacific sea level events to double in future September 25, 2015 \nMany tropical Pacific island nations are struggling to adapt to gradual sea level rise stemming from warming oceans and melting ice caps. Now they may also see much more frequent extreme interannual sea level swings. The ... New rhythm for El Nino discovered May 26, 2013 \nEl Niño wreaks havoc across the globe, shifting weather patterns that spawn droughts in some regions and floods in others. The impacts of this tropical Pacific climate phenomenon are well known and documented. Recommended for you Life on Earth likely started 4.1 billion years ago—much earlier than scientists thought October 19, 2015 \nUCLA geochemists have found evidence that life likely existed on Earth at least 4.1 billion years ago—300 million years earlier than previous research suggested. The discovery indicates that life may have begun shortly ... New study explains near-annual Monsoon oscillations generated by El Nino October 19, 2015 \nA new research study by a team of climate researchers from the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa explains for the first time the source of near-annual pressure and wind changes discovered previously in the Southeast Asian Monsoon ... Alaskan boreal forest fires release more carbon than the trees can absorb October 19, 2015 \nA new analysis of fire activity in Alaska's Yukon Flats finds that so many forest fires are occurring there that the area has become a net exporter of carbon to the atmosphere. This is worrisome, the researchers say, because ... New insights into the dynamics of past climate change October 14, 2015 \nA new study finds that changing climate in the polar regions can affect conditions in the rest of the world far quicker than previously thought. Bubble plumes off Washington, Oregon suggest warmer ocean may be releasing frozen methane October 14, 2015 \nWarming ocean temperatures a third of a mile below the surface, in a dark ocean in areas with little marine life, might attract scant attention. But this is precisely the depth where frozen pockets of methane 'ice' transition ...
