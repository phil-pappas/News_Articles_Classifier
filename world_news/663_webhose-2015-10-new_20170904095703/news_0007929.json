You can add animations to display different objects, buttons to buy and videos to introduce the company or product, among others”, explained Lee.\nWhile at normal magazines the content is static, Flip PDF allows the user to convert his PDF file into a flipping magazine in a short period of time. It enables designers to add multimedia features like Youtube videos, Vimeo, Sounds, Flash animations and images to make the content more interesting and engaging.\nAlso the magazine can be shared to global audiences through the network and can be published as a WordPress plugin.\nFlip PDF has two versions: Windows and Mac. Users can download the suitable one to have a try.\nFor further information about FlipBuilder and other tools visit the website www.flipbuilder.com", "external_links": ["http://www.flipbuilder.com/extension/magazine-multimedia-design.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:39:09.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
