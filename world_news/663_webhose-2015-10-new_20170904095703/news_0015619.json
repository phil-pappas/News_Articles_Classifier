Management of Aviat Networks monitors gross margin, research and development expenses, selling and administrative expenses, operating income or loss, income tax provision or benefit, income or loss from continuing operations attributable to Aviat Networks, basic and diluted income or loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Aviat Networks shareholders, adjusted earnings (losses) before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") attributable to Aviat Networks shareholders adjusted to exclude certain costs, charges, gains and losses, on a non-GAAP basis for planning and forecasting results in future periods, and may use these measures for some management compensation purposes. These measures exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses as shown on the attached Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table (table 4). As a result, management is presenting these non-GAAP measures in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP to better communicate underlying operational and financial performance in each period. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on results in any given period. Management also believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance the ability of an investor to analyze trends in Aviat Networks' business and to better understand our performance. \nAviat Networks' management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Aviat Networks presents these non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its financial performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are included in the tables below. \nAbout Aviat Networks \nAviat Networks, Inc.

We also believe these non-GAAP measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in our business and to understand our performance.

Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Aviat Networks was determined by excluding depreciation and amortization on property, plant and equipment, interest expense, provision for or benefit from income taxes, and non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments, as set forth above, from the GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Aviat Networks. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP items provides meaningful supplemental information to investors, when viewed in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, our GAAP results. However, the non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP information should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.
