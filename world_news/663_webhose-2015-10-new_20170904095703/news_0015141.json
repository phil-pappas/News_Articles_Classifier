Turning a school into an oasis of learner achievement within an environment of academic excellence, will require real changes, at grass roots level, by improving Learner attendance, and encouraging Educators and School Management to focus on the real purpose of a school - to prepare children for the big world outside. Realtimeschool is a “hope in Action” company and the RealtimeSchool Management System can help by improving Learner school attendance, Manage Educators, and offer schools a common platform where all key stake-holders can interface successfully. The RealtimeSchool system empowers Parents and includes them in their child’s education . Parents are be considered a key stake-holder in their child’s education and the Realtimeschool system gives schools the opportunity to treat Parents as part of the solution, and not part of the problem, by directly involving them in their children’s education. SMSs are immediately sent to the Parent if their child fails to arrive at school and general/social SMS and email communication with Parents is fast and efficient .\nA powerful, active, real-time, database accurately reflects the school’s daily learner and Educator numbers and a unique school computerized photo student ID card is issued to all Learners and used to access the school premises. School access is with a student ID card only. This allows the school to monitor and manage Learner and Educator attendance and behaviour. The Student ID card also gives Learners a true sense of belonging and self-empowerment as well as keeping them safe.\nA powerful and comprehensive Text book management system efficiently controls, manages and records the issuing, returning, and stocking of text books . The system prints the text book requirements for each Learner and during the school end-of-year holiday period, casual labour (learners) are offered \" holiday work\" packing individual cardboard boxes containing the text books required for each learner. A bar-coded label, on the box, details the books inside the box as well as any books that may have been short supplied, and towards the end of the holiday period , Parents will receive an SMS, class by class, inviting them to collect their child’s box of books, and informing them of their responsibility for their return, failing which any missing books will be replaced at their cost. This is a key responsibility for a key stakeholder, the Parent.\nEven meals are managed and monitored by the Realtimeschool system. The value of all food entering the school is captured onto the system including date of food received and driver name. Each day, Learners swipe their Student ID cards on the system to receive their daily meal at the food distribution point. At the end of each month, or for any defined period, the system automatically calculates the school’s average cost per meal based on value of food received by the school and number of meals issued, The \"per meal\" budget can now be compared to the \" actual cost per meal\" confirming all learners receive their meals and all food delivered to the school is consumed by the Learners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:29:49.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
