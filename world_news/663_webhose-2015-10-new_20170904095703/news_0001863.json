Supplied by Beverley Head Once shackled to the technology it could afford to cobble together in the premises of its Brisbane office, property services business Unita has recently deployed a cloud solution that it says will allow it to think about a new phase of growth.\nFounder and managing director Robert Rowe is seeking a $20 million capital injection to support that plan. The company, which has revenues of about $80 million and 180-plus staff, offers a range of property services, directly and through subsidiaries, which include everything from shopfitting, to joinery, to steelwork.\nUnita and its seven subsidiaries took the plunge in April and replaced multiple on-premise MYOB accounting systems and servers with NetSuite's OneWorld, and Mr Rowe said he believed the business would now be able to grow revenues to $100 million.\n\"Cloud is opening up both our business and technology opportunities,\" Mr Rowe said.\nDr Kevin McIsaac says any small organisation or start-up would be crazy to try to run its technology in-house. Quentin Jones Levelling the playing field Unita is just one example of the way in which sophisticated technology, once only within reach of large enterprises, is percolating through to SMEs. Cloud computing platforms, quality consumer grade technology and ubiquitous broadband are levelling the playing field between SMEs and the big end of town.\nLee Thompson, senior vice-president and general manager of NetSuite APJ, described it as the \"democratisation of software\", allowing SMEs to gain the benefits of the cloud, where all the complexity was taken care of by the vendor and there were no internal IT overheads to manage.\nDr Kevin McIsaac, analyst with IBRS, said any small organisation or start-up would be crazy to try to build its technology in-house, and advised them to take advantage of IaaS (infrastructure as a service) or SaaS (software as a service).\nGary Tramer from LeadChat said his company's technology democratises the cost of 24x7 contact centres, making them affordable for SMEs. IBRS, itself an SME, has for five years been using Google apps: \"And I think we have better collaboration tools than most enterprises. It's well beyond what most mature enterprises can do,\" Dr McIsaac said. \"It is consumer technology – but consumer grade no longer means poor.\"\nDr McIsaac said access to cloud-based accounting solutions such as Xero, customer relationship management from Salesforce or SugarCRM, marketing solutions such as Marketo, or administration software such as Office 365, meant enterprise-grade technology could be accessed by even small companies.\nA cascade effect is also under way, which is further raising the bar in terms of the technology solutions available to SME's. The first SME uses cloud-based IaaS to develop and host a technology that it onsells to other SMEs, which develops another technology that it can onsell and so forth.\nAustralian SME LeadChat, for example, uses Rackspace cloud services to host its technology. The LeadChat service allows other businesses to install a tag on their website that provides visitors with access to LiveChat. Contact centre workers employed by LeadChat in Manilla engage website visitors in a conversation, gather their details, then route the lead back to the SME for a monthly fee starting at $99.\nAirService co-founder Dominic Bressan said it would cost at least $500,000 for an organisation to build a much more basic ordering system, than the one they could use from his company. Supplied Affordable to SMEs Gary Tramer, chief executive and co-founder of LeadChat, said the model democratised the cost of the technology and the 24/7 contact centres – making the service affordable for SMEs.\nThe next cascade comes from some of LeadChat's users. MessageMedia, for example, sells business-to-consumer SMS services to about 15,000 clients worldwide. Cameron Buckley, executive director of sales and marketing, said that MessageMedia sent 70 million messages a month reminding consumers that they had, for example, doctor, dentist or hairdresser appointments.\nMessageMedia chief operating officer Matt Varley said the business had deployed LeadChat to capture leads from the website at any time of the night or day. \"The implementation was simple – you just put a tag on the website and that opens to this powerful technology in the cloud.\n\"Five or 10 years ago, you would have needed servers, engineers and people to service that chat.\"\nDominic Bressan, CEO and co-founder of AirService, which sells SaaS mobile ordering and a payments facility through Braintree, said it would cost at least $500,000 for an organisation to build even a basic ordering system itself, and be prohibitively expensive for SMEs to build in the location-based services that AirService also features.\n\"To build that you need a specialised team and that's the kind of sophisticated technology that's only been available to the very largest enterprise,\" such as listed entity Domino's, he said.\n﻿ Increased options AirService, however, allows SMEs to offer mobile ordering service, or build their own app – hooking into AirService's APIs to leverage its ordering and customer management platform – for fees starting at a \"couple of hundred dollars per venue per month\".\nWhile the range of high-quality solutions targeted at SMEs continues to grow, IBRS' Dr McIsaac sounds one note of caution:\n\"The really difficult part is that you have got to think about all the business processes and how to integrate them together. That's the secret to doing this well and you need to find or hire the right person to do this, who's not trapped in the old way of building everything themselves.\"\nIt was also important, he said, that SMEs took steps to ensure that whatever happened to the vendor of their computing services, they could always maintain access to their customer or corporate data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:26:05.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
