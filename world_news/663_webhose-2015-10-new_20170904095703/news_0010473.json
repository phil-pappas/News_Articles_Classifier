Picture: Damian Shaw Source: News Corp Australia\nVodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom’s billion-dollar partnership is unlikely to lead to a full merger between the two operators, with Vodafone Australia boss Inaki Berroeta saying the deal is just the next step in its road map to turbocharge its ­mobile network.\n“These are two very important commercial agreements for both companies but that’s pretty much the extent of agreement and collaboration between us,” Mr Berroeta told The Australian.\n“This is going to be the core of the network that covers most of our customers but that doesn’t mean we won’t use other solutions for other sites.”\nThe partnership is a significant step for both companies as the industry undergoes another bout of consolidation, with M2 Group and Vocus Communications announcing an agreement to merge into Australia’s fourth-largest telco worth $3 billion.\nHowever, Telstra boss Andrew Penn said he was not perturbed by the efforts made by telco competitors to beef up their positions in the market.\n“We have been gaining share both in mobile and fixed and we are not surprised that there’s a lot of interest in the fixed market as the demand for data and the need for penetration in the market grows,” Mr Penn said.\n“It’s not surprising to me that (our) competitors are seeking ways to improve their own scale.”\nHe added that Telstra’s main asset is the quality of its network and the telco was on track to invest a total of $5bn into its mobile network by 2017.\nUnder the terms of the agreements struck between TPG and Vodafone, TPG will build about 4000km of new fibre to Vodafone cell sites across the country, at a cost of $300 million-$400m. In turn, TPG expects the project to deliver minimum revenue of $900m over the next 15 years.\nThe dark fibre, which will cover two-thirds of Vodafone’s network, will boost capacity and potentially deliver cheaper prices to Vodafone customers. However, Mr Berroeta said the partnership had more to do with securing the future of the network than fixing any gaps in coverage. “It’s not something we require today but something we will need for the next technology cycle in the next four to five years,” he said.\nHe said it would alleviate latency issues on the network, with minimal lag in performance as new applications were introduced. It also allowed Vodafone to significantly cut the costs associated with moving data on the network.\nThe partnership will also see TPG migrate its mobile wholesale customer base of 320,000 users from Optus to Vodafone, in what is one of the largest ever Mobile Virtual Network Operator arrangements in the local industry. Customers of TPG’s recent acquisition, iiNet, will not move to the Vodafone network. Optus said it was working with TPG on revised wholesale arrangements and said TPG customers that wished to stay on the Optus network would need to get new SIM cards.\nTPG chief executive David Teoh said TPG mobile customers could look forward to a reliable and super-fast service offering. “One of the biggest benefits for all existing TPG mobile customers is access to 4G on Vodafone’s network, meaning they will be able to experience substantially faster data speeds,” he said.\nTPG has started offering new SIM-only 4G plans, but Ovum research director David Kennedy said it would take some time for TPG to improve its position in the mobile space. “TPG has been pretty lousy in marketing its mobile offering up to this point and there is nothing to suggest that that’s going to improve overnight,” Mr Kennedy said.\nHe said it was Mr Teoh’s continued push to extend the company’s fixed network footprint before the National Broadband Network is built that was worth watching: “David Teoh is doing everything he can to shape the trajectory of the overall market before the NBN comes online.”", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/30/1227551/373041-4018884e-674b-11e5-a694-a01135d43b99.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:40:33.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
