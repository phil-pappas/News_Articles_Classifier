With cooperation from the FDA, CLSA investigated several issues that impact average times for medical device product reviews.\nThe summary, titled Recent Trends in FDA Medical Device Regulation includes premarket approval (PMA) review times, 510(k) decision times, and variation in performance across the FDA’s Center for Device and Radiological Health (CDRH) review divisions and branches. CLSA developed the report in collaboration with The Boston Consulting Group.\n“The FDA is a vital element in the medical innovation ecosystem, and has the challenging mission of balancing rigorous science and safety standards with the need for timely, predictable and efficient review processes,” said Sara Radcliffe, CLSA President and CEO. “We generated this report to illustrate the progress made by the FDA as well as to identify areas that could still benefit from further improvement. The decrease in review times over the last several years demonstrates the positive outcomes that can result from collaboration between industry, the FDA, Congress, and patients.”\nKey Facts and Report Highlights\nWith the exception of 2013, PMA average review times have declined steadily since 2010. In 2013 there was a surge in the proportion of devices sent to advisory committee panels for review, increasing from 8 percent in 2012 to 36 percent in 2013, and likely contributed to the slowdown in average review time that year. Fiscal year 2014 PMA average review times are on track to drop to their best performance since the year 2000. Recent decreases in 510(k) review times over the last three years suggest the first real improvement since 2005. The data shows a trend in improved consistency across the system. Previously, review divisions and branches varied markedly in meeting their PMA MDUFA and 510(k) performance goals. These trends are getting the attention of industry leaders. “The recent and real improvements in FDA’s medical device review times sends a positive signal to companies and investors developing new lifesaving devices for patients in need,” said Don Bobo, Corporate Vice President of Heart Valve Therapy, Corporate Strategy and Corporate Development, Edwards Lifesciences. “We look forward to continuing the productive partnership with the agency in the years to come in order to ensure patients have access to important new therapies in a timely fashion.”\n“Our report reflects the strong efforts made by FDA leadership and between the FDA, Congress and industry to decrease medical device review times and improve consistency throughout the Agency,” said Todd Gillenwater, CLSA’s Executive Vice President of Advocacy and External Relations. “However, there is still more that can be done. CLSA looks forward to continuing collaboration with the FDA and Congress to meet our shared goals.”", "external_links": ["https://califesciences.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CLSA-Recent-Trends-in-FDA-Medical-Device-Regulation-2015rgbWEB.pdf", "http://califesciences.org/2015fdadeviceupdate/", "http://www.califesciences.org/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:42:46.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
