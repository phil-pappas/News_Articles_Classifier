There was a mad rush to buy tickets ; wild fan theories emerged on just what might be up with the conspicuously absent Luke Skywalker ; and perhaps more surprisingly, Bill Kristol offered a neo-conservative defense of the Galactic Empire . Fevers are running high as the film’s December 17 release date draws ever-closer, but there’s still so much we don’t know. Including this question: How original can the movie actually be?\nDavid Sims: Spencer, in your analysis of the trailer , you hit on the intense waves of nostalgia coming off The Force Awakens already. The chief villain, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), literally worships Death Vader’s melted helmet. Han Solo talks about the days of Jedi fighting the Dark Side like it’s ancient mythology. There’s all this chatter about the Death Star-like base glimpsed on the poster capable of blowing up whole solar systems. You’ve worried in the past that things look almost too familiar . But maybe that’s the meta-point J.J. Abrams is trying to make. Here’s a franchise inexorably scarred by George Lucas’s underwhelming prequel trilogy, ravaged by overuse of CGI, wooden acting, and those gosh-darn midi-chlorians. So might the only recipe for success be a return to that old-time religion?\nRelated Story The Trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens Hints at an Apocalyptic War Movie\nBecause that’s what’s pumping people up more than anything, right? Certainly, the swell of John Williams’s score, the screaming noise of TIE Fighter engines, and the practical, tactile sense of the special effects is what revs me up. Yes, it’s very exciting to see John Boyega and Daisy Ridley getting some serious action beats, and to hear Adam Driver’s sonorous villain-voice, but it’s interesting to think about just how little we actually know about this movie’s plot. I’m fine with Abrams keeping most details under lock and key, and I imagine fans are too—but what do we know? Rey’s (Ridley) a scavenger. Finn (Boyega) is an ex-Stormtrooper. Han Solo is an old man. Luke’s missing. The Empire is rebranded The First Order is up to no good. That’s about all we’ve got.\nSo I’ll take the nostalgia—though Bill Kristol’s crackpot take on the Empire might help define nostalgia’s limits. Folks, the Empire was not a liberal meritocracy, it was a galactic police state that blew up planets to quell rebellion. This is the kind of damage Lucas did with his prequel films, and the reason fans cheered when Disney bought the rights to the Star Wars franchise for billions. The Star Wars prequels essayed the fall of the Old Republic and the decline of the Jedi Order as plot dressing for its supposed grand arc: the rise of Darth Vader and the Emperor. They existed to justify his original stories, which needed no justification, and even though they portrayed the Republic as being bogged down by bureaucracy, they also paralleled the Empire’s emergence with Hitler’s sweep to power, with the Clone Wars functioning as a kind of Reichstag Fire.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/656477320182636544", "http://www.wired.com/2015/10/star-wars-online-ticket-sales/", "http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Luke-Skywalker-Isn-t-Kylo-Ren-Right-89247.html", "http://www.impawards.com/2015/star_wars_episode_vii__the_force_awakens_ver3.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:44:06.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
