As of September 1, we've completed over 600 system enhancements to the leading home builder software suite MT. HOLLY, NJ, October 13,   At their 2015 Executive Roundtable , Mark Systems debuted over 600 separate system enhancements to their clients in attendance. For over 16 years Mark Systems has held Executive Roundtable meetings where they review top enhancements suggestions from customers. These suggestions are then reviewed and prioritized quarterly by the Mark Systems executive team before making their way into product development. In fact, IHMS product development has been customer driven for over 30 years! \" 2015 was once again a year of significant new development in virtually every aspect of Mark Systems' IHMS (Integrated Homebuilder Management System). As of September 1st, we've completed over 600 system enhancements, including 104 major new features, and 38 custom modules ,\" said Don Scattergood, Vice President of Mark Systems. These enhancements include: QuickBuild Reporting - A native report writer within IHMS that contains built-in views of the data, and allows users to easily create, save and modify custom reports. Added Sizing Capability for High Definition Monitors - Lets users change the size of all IHMS screens with one scaling selection. Photo Upload to VPO from any Device - Allows superintendents to attach a photo from their phone or tablet when creating a Variance Purchase Order (VPO). This technology will be extended into other areas (ie. home owner progress photos) in upcoming releases. A/P Invoice Import - This major enhancement allows the generation and maintenance of Accounts Payable invoices in Excel for import into A/P Data Entry. Similar to the Journal Entry Import process, it allows accounting departments to process large numbers of invoices quickly and accurately. Dashboards - One of the initiatives that began in 2015 is a drive to deliver visual metrics based on the data within IHMS. Part of that process is the development of functional dashboards across the system, including Job Cost Variance, Sales Performance, and Warranty. Menu Search - allows users to type in any part of a program, process, or report name from the main IHMS menu and go right to that module without stepping through the menu system. Mark Systems also announced they are increasing the volume of new features and enhancements to IHMS in 2016. In an extended effort to release a superior product to customers in a timely manner, Vincent Christiani transitioned from the Consulting and Support Department to Quality Assurance and Testing. \" The goal is for Vinny to use his IHMS experience and customer feedback to focus on system regression testing. We believe this will allow us to maintain the industry leading quality of IHMS and expedite the delivery of custom tasks and system enhancements ,\" said Robert Cain, Vice President of Consulting Services.
