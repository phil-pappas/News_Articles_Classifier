Currently, the company is organising continental transport. \"We now pleased to have concluded this agreement for fertiliser supply, which provides us with access to the required quantity and quality of fertilisers.\" \nThe contract was signed during the East and Southern Africa Fertiliser Trade Platform (ESAF) annual conference and fertiliser expo held in Lusaka, Zambia. \nFollowing the first MOU announced last August, the FFSA is considered to be a significant development towards implementing African Potash's strategy of becoming a vertically integrated African-focused fertiliser business. \nAfrican Potash executive chairman Chris Cleverly said: \"Having established a sale price of $500 per metric tonne in respect of the 50,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser product to be supplied in connection with our first trading MOU. \n\"We are now pleased to have concluded this agreement for fertiliser supply, which provides us with access to the required quantity and quality of fertilisers, at competitive pricing structures. \n\"We are continuing to establish relationships and work towards concluding agreements to complete the full trading chain and look forward to providing further updates on these developments in due course.\" \nThe company has announced that is in negotiating to establish a trade finance facility of around $50m to fund its trading operations. \nAfrican Potash has also signed a deal with a local Congolese distributor to supply 150,000t of fertiliser to Congo. \nThe supply will be done under the the COMESA Trading MOU, under which the company, along with Mask Africa Crowd Farm Fund, agreed to supply and deliver at least 500,000t of fertiliser during the first three years. \nCleverly said: \"No region of the world has been able to expand agricultural growth rates, and thus tackle hunger, without increasing fertiliser use. \n\"Despite economic growth rates of 8.9% in 2014, according to World Bank figures the Democratic Republic of Congo currently uses only 1kg of fertiliser per hectare of arable land, whereas India uses 16kg per hectare, and the United Kingdom uses 234kg per hectare.\" Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:17:31.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
