You just wait and see...\nWhen folded, its dimensions come in at 12 x 14 x 7 inches and it weighs just , weighs just 4.3kg or 9lbs.\nIf you have no clue what any of the above means in real-life terms, just watch the video above to see exactly how easy it is to fold it up - and how compact the pram becomes once it's folded.\nThere are two different methods. One is slightly quicker to carry out, but the end result isn't as compact.\nEven more impressive is that when you need to use it again, it snaps back open within seconds.\nFacebook The buggy very quickly folds down to an incredibly compact size - and it stands up all by itself\nThe clip was uploaded to Facebook by The Baby Guy NYC , where it has since been shared more than 200,000 times by impressed parents, racking up more than 11million views.\nMum Carla Garcia commented: \"I'm very frugal, but I would have spent bank on that thing when I had my first kid and had a 2 door compact car.\n\"Strollers were the devil... fitting 2 strollers when I took my friend and her baby somewhere required master skills in tetris!\"\nFacebook Going on a flight? This will definitely fit in the overhead locker!\nDiana Amare said: \"The best stroller for a flight.. why didn't they create this when my kids where little.. (sic) i always try to find the smallest folded light stroller.. now there's one...\"\nIf all this sounds appealing, you might be disappointed to know that you won't be able to get your hands on one until next year, as it's not available to buy until Spring 2016.\nIt's also not yet known how much the pram will cost - but still, hope is on the horizon.\nOne day we might be able to get through a trip to the shops without tears. At least not from mum or dad...\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorMums", "https://twitter.com/nicolajoakley", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "http://form.jotformeu.com/jsform/50283502375350", "https://www.facebook.com/TheBabyGuyNYC/videos/vb.324403437086/10153300003777087/?type=2&theater"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:12:43.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
