The most popular online retailers for secondhand and refurbished Macbooks are Amazon and eBay .\nOn eBay you can buy on auction or as a 'buy it now' item. There's no manufacturer warranty, but you are protected through eBay's protection policy for up to 30-days.\nIf you want peace of mind, and a warranty, there's an Argos Outlet on eBay which stocks Apple products.\neBay also has a Refurbished MacBooks section , where Apple netbooks regularly go for around £300+.\nThe Currys PC World clearance and refurbished online store is also a good place to start when hunting for a cheap Apple product.\nApple's online refurbished outlet is one of the most trusted places to buy second-hand, and prices can be as low as £629.\nHow much can I save through buying refurbished? This depends on the format of the sale. Is the item refurbished, used, secondhand, or ex-display?\nIf the item is purchased on auction or second-hand, there's no limit on the amount you can save, however, if the item is purchased as a 'refurbished' device, in other words, manufacturer checked, you're likely to save around £100.\nAs it's classed as almost new, the savings can be quite small.\nWhere can I sell my old MacBook Pro for cash?
