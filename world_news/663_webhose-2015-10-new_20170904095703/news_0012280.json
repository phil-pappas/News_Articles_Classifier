Net income from continuing operations fell 14 per cent to $3bn. \n“This quarter we fell a little short of the revenue expectations we set for ourselves,” said Martin Schroeter, IBM’s chief financial officer. “We’ve always said our transformation would take time.” \nJust a quarter ago, IBM increased its forecast for free cash flow to say it would grow “modestly”. But on Monday IBM trimmed that outlook back again, saying free cash flow would be “relatively flat”. \nThe New York-based company said it now expected to earn adjusted per-share earnings of $14.75 to $15.75 for 2015, down from a previous estimate of $15.75 to $16.50 given in July. \nIBM shares fell by 4.9 per cent to $141.94 in after-hours trading. \nAmid 14 successive quarters of declining sales , IBM is slowly trying to reorient its business under Ginni Rometty, who was appointed chief executive four years ago, away from a struggling core in IT infrastructure and storage towards racier parts of the market such as cloud computing and its “cognitive technology”, known as Watson. \nOverall revenues in China fell 17 per cent, including foreign-exchange headwinds, as sales from its global business services unit were down 13 per cent. Software, such as middleware and operating systems, fell 10 per cent, including a drop-off in transactions in September. \nOffsetting those declines, sales in IBM’s “strategic imperatives” such as cloud and data analytics increased by 27 per cent year-on-year, on a like-for-like basis. \nAfter investing $10bn in R&D, capital expenditure and acquisitions in the last year to shift its business towards faster-growing units such as Watson and Bluemix, IBM said that it would continue to spend “at a high level”. \n“We are getting the returns and we are getting the growth,” Mr Schroeter said. “We are also improving margins as we continue to manage the portfolio.” \nSome of those investments, such as Watson, have not even begun to generate meaningful revenue yet, he added. \nCloud delivered as a service, in which IBM hosts some of a company’s operations at its data centres, hit a $4.5bn annual run rate, from $3.1bn in the same period in 2014. Cloud is a quickly-growing business, with companies such as Amazon .com and Google looking to stake their claims. \nRevenues from the so-called Bric markets were down 30 per cent on a reported basis, as double-digit growth in India failed to offset declines in Brazil and China, where there were fewer large transactions during the quarter, IBM said. \nWhile US revenues fell 4 per cent because of a decline in IBM’s traditional enterprise applications, Japan and Germany saw the strongest growth in its portfolio.
