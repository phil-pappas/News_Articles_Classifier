Confusing navigation, unclear content, mobile-unfriendly design and unbranded donation forms can prevent website users from making a donation, and result in a 7 percent degradation in usability overall. \nOnline donations are on the rise and totaled $23.3 billion in 2013, according to the most recent statistics from the National Philanthropic Trust . That means if nonprofits were able to close the usability gap in the donation process, they could be looking at another $1.6 billion in donations each year -- an extra 7 percent. \nNeon Web Studio will function as a full-service web design agency exclusively serving the nonprofit market. Services will include custom website design, content strategy, maintenance and hosting -- all priced for nonprofits and optimized for donations. \nJeff Gordy, CEO and co-founder of parent company Z2 Systems, said that the idea for the company came from interactions with current nonprofit software clients. \n\"So much of what we do involves integration with a nonprofit's website,\" Gordy said. \"A lot of our clients were already asking us for help with their website, and it just made sense to take this next step. The majority of our staff have nonprofit experience and this enables us to apply this knowledge to our new web design business.\" \nNeon's entrance into nonprofit website design started with its original product -- NeonCRM. Like some other fundraising software platforms, NeonCRM offers its users the ability to create online donation forms. Neon offers a unique technology called a \"template sync\" that creates unlimited customized donation forms that matches each nonprofit's website. \n\"We knew that redesigning a donation form could make a huge difference in donations,\" Gordy said. \"That made us start thinking about what redesigning an entire website could do. Now we have the ability to help nonprofits fully express and support their missions online.\" \nTo celebrate the launch, Neon Web Studio is granting a pro-bono nonprofit website to an organization in need. The grantee will receive a custom website, web strategy consultation, a Google Analytics consulting package, plus web hosting and maintenance -- a $25,000 value in total. \nTo apply for the grant, visit https://www.neoncrm.com/websites/grant/ . Applications will be accepted until November 11, and qualified organizations will be contacted in the coming weeks. \nAbout Neon Web Studio: \nNeon Web Stu­dio is a full-ser­vice web de­sign agency ex­clu­sively serv­ing the non­profit mar­ket.
