(DDoS, or a Denial of Service Attack, is a way to take down a website by overwhelming it with traffic.) \nThe global financial services and energy sectors were the worst hit, with average annual costs of $13.5 and $12.8 million respectively. \nRising business expenses come as the cost to hackers themselves is plunging, thanks to a proliferation of botnets that make launching DDoS attacks cheap and simple, and the easy sharing of tools and exploits on \"dark net\" forums and marketplaces. \nAccording to cybersecurity firm Incapsula, the price of launching a DDoS attack has plummeted to just $38 per hour. By comparison, \"the real-world cost of an unmitigated attack is $40,000 per hour\" for businesses. \nAnother boon to cybercriminals was the release of tools and data from Italian surveillance company Hacking Team, which was itself hacked in July. \nIncluded in the leaked data were a number of \"zero day\" exploits, or previously unknown security flaws in popular software. \nWhile the affected software makers, including Adobe and Microsoft, rushed to fix their software, experts reported seeing several attacks in the wake of the hack and warned that users who do not regularly update their software are at risk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:01:09.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
