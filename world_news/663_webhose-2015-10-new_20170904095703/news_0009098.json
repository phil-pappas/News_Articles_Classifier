It’s precisely what it says: a global network of things from lights and locks to cameras and cars, fitted with microchips and software so they can talk to each other.\nThe impact of such connectivity beggars the imagination, and so does its commercial potential.\nBoth will dominate this year’s Gitex, the Gulf IT exhibition being held later this month at Dubai World Trade Centre.\nKeynote speakers have been lined up to describe their vision for “smart cities”, where everything from home entertainment and fitness “wearables” to cars and traffic lights will be tied together in “data-driven relationships”. \nIt’s a vision that has sparked the imaginations of civic planners around the world.\nSouth Korea has created Songdo, a purpose-built smart city south-west of Seoul, that is already showcasing IoT tech, from interactive TVs to automated trash tracking. \nIn April, India gave the green light to the creation of 100 smart cities across the nation over the next five years. \nIf you can’t wait for the future to arrive, just stay put: last year the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) announced that Dubai will be the smartest city in the world by 2017.\nAnd the plans are right on track. Just last month telecoms provider du successfully tested the first IoT network in the Middle East. \nThis will allow battery-powered wireless gadgets to exchange data with each other, opening the way to an IoT connecting a vast array of smart city tech, like intelligent, energy-saving street lights to parking sensors that will flag up available spaces to drivers in real-time. \nThe first phase of Dubai’s IoT will be rolled out in the first quarter of next year. \nBut that’s just the start: du has made clear its determination to make the entire nation “smart” within a year or so. \nThere can be no doubting the company’s ambition, nor its focus on using the technology to make Dubai an easier place to live. And to IoT evangelists, it’s simply the next step in our technological evolution. \nFirst came the internet in the late 1960s, which for anything other than simple messages was slow and clunky. \nThen came the World-Wide Web in the early 1990s, which made the whole messy problem of data exchange between computers so user-friendly anyone could do it. \nNext came the cloud computing revolution, that allows us to access whatever we want from wherever we are, whenever we like. \nNow the IoT completes the process, extending the connectivity we’ve got with computers to everything else. \nBut within the IT community there’s growing concern that this is a dangerously complacent view. And they’re warning we may be sleepwalking towards a tech-driven nightmare. \nThe focus of the concern is security. \nNo surprises there; from stolen memory sticks to database hacking and viral infections, every advance in IT has exposed us to new threats. \nThe concern is that with the IoT these vulnerabilities are being taken to a whole new level. That’s because while the devices being connected might be “smart” in name, the software they run is anything but.\nWe’ve all grown used to switching on our laptop, tablet or smartphone and waiting for the latest software patches to upload. It’s annoying but it’s the price we have to pay to stay safe from attacks by cyber criminals. Even then, it doesn’t always succeed – but at least we can isolate the problem and deal with it. \nThat’s not possible with the IoT. Security experts are warning that “IoT-ready” devices are achieving ubiquity by reliance on cheap, outmoded software that can’t be updated easily – or even at all.\nEarlier this year, Deepak Taneja, of leading IT security company RSA, warned that the headlong race to roll out the IoT is turning it into “a time-bomb”. \nHis concerns are echoed by the internationally respected IT security expert Bruce Schneier, who estimates that the IoT already has hundreds of millions of insecure devices, waiting for someone to discover their vulnerability.\nIn short, the IoT is giving hackers hundreds of millions of trapdoors into our lives. And they’re already using them. \nTop of their hit-list are routers, the devices which act like post office sorting clerks, taking incoming data and passing it on to the right recipients. \nBy targeting vulnerabilities in their software, hackers have already found ways of seizing control of the devices they connect. \nLast month, US security consultancy company Rapid7 reported that tests of several popular web-connected baby monitoring cameras revealed they were vulnerable to basic hacking techniques. \nAs well as seizing control of the cameras for remote spying, criminals could use the cameras to hack into computers connected to the same network. \nThe report follows revelations that “smart” internet-connected TVs made by Samsung not only respond to voice commands but can transmit whatever their microphones detect across the internet for remote processing.\nThe story sent commentators scurrying for their copies of George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, which describes “telescreens” that pick up anything said above a very low whisper and report it to the Thought Police. \nNot surprisingly, civil liberty groups are also concerned about the power of the IoT to command and control us all. \nBut even those living under the most benign regimes need to ask questions about the IoT. Industry reports estimate that within five years it will consist of 10 times as many devices as there are humans on Earth. \nIn kicking open the door to this technological wonderland, IoT companies need to assure us they know who’s rushing in behind them. \n\nRobert Matthews is Visiting Professor of Science at Aston University, Birmingham, UK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:43:31.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
