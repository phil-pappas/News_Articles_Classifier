No, you don't need a degree in computer science or a tech nerd's vocabulary to accomplish your goal. Nor do you have to be particularly mechanically proficient. A screw driver, the ability to snap pre-made components together and a little patience is all it takes to assemble. \nThe real work begins with your pre plan. What are the components necessary to build a dynamite system that will enhance my love of gaming? Let's take a look at operating systems to choose from. \nSince most diehard players use Steam as their go to source to download games, I trust Steam surveys of gamers systems will let me see what is hot and what is not. \nThe number one current question on many minds is how does the new Windows 10 OS treat gamers? The last Steam survey in July of 2015, out even before the official unveiling of 10, showed that in pre-release the new system was more popular with gamers than any other OS operating system version on the market and all Linux-based systems combined! \nIf that isn't reason enough to go with the flow, testing of the Windows 10 OS has been impressive. Results showed a slight advantage over Windows 8 for gaming, but the real eye opener was the potential of the new DirectX 12 graphics technology \nWith no gamer major complaints over the last few months since its release and with a free upgrade if you already have Windows, it appears that version 10 will be the go to OS for the foreseeable future. \nThe July Steam survey also revealed another interesting OS tidbit. While Mac OS's have their base of generic loyalists that dedication does not translate well to gamers. In the Steam survey, gamers using the Mac Yosemite OS accounted for a paltry 2.4% of Steam users. \nIf you are building your own gaming computer and ready to select your operating system look to the current gold standard that most gamers use and enjoy, Windows 10. \nI hope this information was helpful, but it's your new computer build. Research additional current operating systems geared towards gamers like the Linux-based Steam OS. Join forums where gaming computer builders share ideas and help solve problems. \nHaving the operating system for your gaming PC build is critical. Without it, your system will not perform accurately", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:38:44.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
