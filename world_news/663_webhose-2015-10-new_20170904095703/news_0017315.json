The hospital said she was being treated in its isolation unit.\nMedical authorities say the risk of Cafferkey transmitting the virus is low, but public health officials in Scotland are monitoring people with whom she had close contact. Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with blood or body fluids.\nCafferkey was diagnosed with Ebola in December after returning from Sierra Leone. She was treated at the Royal Free for several weeks and discharged in January.\nCafferkey was honored at the Pride of Britain Awards in London last month and met with the prime minister's wife, Samantha Cameron , at 10 Downing St.\nSince Ebola broke out in Guinea's forest region last year, it has killed more than 11,200 people in West Africa.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-09T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:37:58.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
