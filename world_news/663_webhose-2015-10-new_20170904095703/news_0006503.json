That ban has not been rigorously or consistently enforced, however. \nReports in domestic media have suggested Beijing is planning by the end of the year to announce national rules that could either formally legalise the growing car-hailing industry or strangle it. \nPeople in the industry point out that even if the draft regulations are adopted, there still would be ample room for municipal regulators to issue detailed local policies that could affect their implementation. Some of the rules are as strict as those on the heavily regulated traditional taxi industry, and thus could prove costly if rigorously enforced nationwide, they said. \nUber welcomed the draft, saying that it “demonstrates [the] government’s recognition and support of online car-hailing services”. The US-based company added that it already met some of the criteria set out in the draft, including having servers located in China. \n“We are in close communications with local regulators, and will . . . follow the spirit of the draft regulation, comply with all requirements, and continuously partner with local governments in implementing the new set of rules,” Uber said. \nThe regulations could make it possible for Uber, Didi Kuaidi and potentially other services to be fully legalised in China, industry observers said. \nThe draft rules included requirements that such services share data with local transport authorities, register their cars as taxi services, insure cars and passengers and have labour contracts with drivers. Car-pooling and ride-sharing services offered by private drivers without a taxi licence would be banned. \n“The policy would have a disastrous impact on the taxi-hailing industry if it takes effect since it would ban private cars,” said Zhang Xu at Beijing consultancy Analysys. \nThe draft also appeared to signal Beijing’s intent to bring China’s heavily subsidised cab fares more into line with market pricing, by gradually eliminating fuel subsidies for the traditional taxi industry. \nAdditional reporting by Jackie Cai Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:48:21.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
