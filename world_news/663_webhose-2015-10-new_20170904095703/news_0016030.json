This expansion – one of Nortech’s key strategic initiatives for 2015 – is designed to help support its North America-based customers by providing a high-value option to complement its existing, U.S.-based PCBA design, production and service capabilities. \n“Adding a PCBA manufacturing option in Mexico has always been a popular request from our customers,” said Rich Wasielewski, president and CEO of Nortech Systems. “We’re happy to provide these partners a great option that provides high value with assuredness of Nortech’s strong quality and speed-to-market.” \nNortech initially established its Monterrey facility in 2002, focusing on complex wire and cable assembly production services. The facility features ISO 9001 certification and on-site manufacturing engineering support. The PCBA expansion – co-located next to existing wire/cable operations – offers both SMT and manual “thru-hole” production to meet growing customer needs. \nIn addition to Monterrey, Nortech also features PCBA manufacturing capabilities at its facilities in Mankato and Merrifield, Minnesota, along with related integration and box-build manufacturing services. All three facilities will share engineering, design and other support resources on projects to offer customers optimized scheduling and cost benefits. \nAbout Nortech Systems Incorporated Nortech Systems Incorporated ( www.nortechsys.com ), based in Maple Grove, Minn., is a full-service electronics manufacturing services (EMS) provider of wire and cable assemblies, printed circuit board assemblies, and higher-level complete box build assemblies for a wide range of industries.
