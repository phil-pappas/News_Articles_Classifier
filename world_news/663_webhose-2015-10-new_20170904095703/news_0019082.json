Lark is now announcing a smaller version of the Tunable Band Pass Filter family. The Tunable Band Pass Filter in the Surface Mount (SMT) configuration will measure 1.6\" (W) X 0.60\" (H) X 2.4” (L).\nAccording to Bob Swelgin, president of Smart Electronics and Lark Engineering, \"Reduction in the physical dimensions of our entire family of Filters and RF Sub-assemblies has become paramount in meeting our customers’ needs. The reduction of the Tunable Filter size is no exception.\nTunable Band Pass & Notch Filters:\nLarks Engineering’s digital control filters are a new upcoming series of fast switching variable frequency filters that can facilitate designs for IFF, Jammer and frequency hopping applications. The tunable filters provide a less complicated alternative to controlling and encrypting signals while maintaining a smaller profile.\nLark’s extensive tunable band pass and notch filter products span frequency ranges of 1.5 to 2200MHz. The existing designs provide a proven engineering foundation to work with our customers in developing custom specific tunable filters in the frequency bands:\n 1.5-4MHz 4-10MHz 10-30MHz 30-90MHz 90-200MHz 200-400MHz 400-700MHz 700-1000MHz 1000-1400MHz 1800-2200MHz\nContact:\nFred Little\nVP Sales & Marketing\n(M): (949) 887-9695\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13017385.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.larkengineering.com/filters/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13017385.htm"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:12:47.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
