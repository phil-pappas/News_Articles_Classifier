This Smart News Release features multimedia.

While spurred by the Pope’s visit, the DAS deployment is a permanent amenity on Ben Franklin Parkway, which is home to many other concerts and events. This infrastructure investment will benefit festival attendees and residents for years to come. \nThe FlexWave Prism DAS deployment on Ben Franklin Parkway includes some 70 pole-mounted remote units that deliver mobile coverage and capacity for the nation’s largest mobile operators. It provides 850 MHz, 1900 MHz, AWS, and 700 MHz frequencies to deliver 3G and 4G mobile services to tens of thousands of users who will text, tweet, phone, or send photos or videos while in that popular area of the city. \nFlexWave Prism was chosen for the deployment because its modular, high-power remote units deliver the performance and frequency bands needed in each location, and because CommScope’s exclusive CDIU (CPRI Digital Interface Unit) made deployment of the DAS head-end compact and cost-effective. CDIU eliminates RF interface equipment in the head-end, delivering as much as 80 percent savings in unneeded equipment, floor space and operating costs, including real estate and energy. Thanks to the all-digital architecture of this CommScope DAS, the network easily transports wireless signals some two kilometers from the head-end to the farthest remote unit. “Mobile operators are densifying their networks for high-capacity crowds in cities, event centers and stadiums without the cost and time of adding new towers,” said Matt Melester, senior vice president and general manager, Distributed Coverage and Capacity Solutions, CommScope. “FlexWave Prism digital DAS is a perfect fit for these public areas that serve subscribers for many mobile operators. The carriers can add sites that service all of them in the utility right-of-way, which also keeps the community happy.” \nFlexWave is a registered trademark of CommScope, Inc. \nAbout CommScope: \nCommScope (NASDAQ: COMM) helps companies around the world design, build and manage their wired and wireless networks.
