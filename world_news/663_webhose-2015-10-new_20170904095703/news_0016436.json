The product allows users to answer a simple questionnaire, similar to TurboTax. The software then generates a completed form N-400, Application for Naturalization, along with additional supplemental forms and documents, as well as a customized checklist that give clear instructions on what to include and where to send it. An additional service offered is “Premium Review”, where the entire packet is manually reviewed a second and third time to reduce potential delays.\nAccording to Homeland Security’s immigration statistics , 654,949 individuals were naturalized in fiscal year 2014. That doesn’t include the nearly 8.8 million individuals eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. Many applicants file on their own, using the raw forms and complicated government instructions.\nBen Ives, CEO of RapidVisa, Inc. is optimistic about how the product will be received. “We’re happy to finally launch this new citizenship product. We hope to make the process less intimidating with the power of software and open our services to thousands more customers,” Ives commented.\nAlthough RapidVisa primarily classifies itself as a software company, it offers accompanying services that differentiate it from a simple do-it-yourself form filler. The flat price includes unlimited chat, phone and walk-in support from its over 25 employees in 3 offices.\nOther RapidVisa products have been well received by customers, as depicted in their over 600 customer photo testimonials. One recent testimonial from Joseph and Edelyn Villareal dotes, “When we first went to RapidVisa we were skeptical as most people are because we knew we had many questions and needed guidance. RapidVisa proved to be the reliable source that we turned to for help. They answered every question and addressed each fear with clear direction and facts.”\nAbout RapidVisa, Inc.\nFounded in 2006, RapidVisa, Inc. was the first company in America to offer online family visa processing direct to consumers without a lawyer and has helped customers bring over 15,000 family members to the United States. With offices in the United States, China and The Philippines, RapidVisa offers full-service phone, chat and walk-in support 7 days a week and boasts a 99.7% approval rate.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13004543.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://rapidvisa.com/about/", "http://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics", "https://rapidvisa.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13004543.htm"], "published": "2015-10-06T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:01:22.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
