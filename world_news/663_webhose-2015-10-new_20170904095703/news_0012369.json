In partnership with the Prague Convention Bureau and a number of local DMCs, the four-day event will see fully hosted buyers hold over 4,000 meetings with event suppliers from across Europe and beyond.\nThe Forum will introduce some of Europe’s leading meeting and incentive professionals to new and undiscovered features of the Czech capital. While it retains a rich culture and history, Prague is also a modern and dynamic city, home to state-of-the-art, multifunctional event spaces, and new hotels.\n“Prague hosted an M&I Forum back in 2009 and this is the perfect time for the event to return. Heritage and history remain an inseparable part of the city, but they’re now complemented by stunning modern venues, all with exceptional services. A dynamic city, we’re excited to show Prague in a new light. Our wonderful city is perfectly suited to both big events and smaller incentive groups, and I am sure the experience will open up new business opportunities and give attendees total confidence in the destination.” said Lenka Jarošová, Executive Director of Prague Convention Bureau. “Coming to this Forum is in my opinion a great opportunity to experience up close what we have to offer and, besides doing good business, have a huge amount of fun.”\nM&I Forums are trade events held in the world’s leading meetings destinations. They offer business events suppliers the opportunity to meet and develop relationships with vetted, hand-selected buyers who have confirmed budgets to spend. The Forums provide a professional, effective and fun platform for business meetings and networking with these high quality buyers. They also allow top global meetings destinations to showcase their offerings, in order to grow their share of the international business events market. In 2016, Prague will join Dubai (UAE), Scottsdale, AZ (USA), Madrid (Spain), and Izmir (Turkey) in hosting M&I Forums to showcase their offering to a global audience of events professionals.\nCommenting on the event in Prague, Richard Barnes, Managing Director of M&I Forums, added: “Prague has invested a vast amount in their meetings infrastructure in recent years, and there’s a new side to the Czech capital that’s waiting to be explored. It’s home to an array of new, groundbreaking hotels and venues which we’re excited to introduce our delegates to, opening their eyes to the opportunities this city has to offer in 2016.”\nSince Prague last hosted an M&I Forum in 2009, the city has undergone substantial changes. The accommodation offering, especially 4 and 5* hotels, increased considerably, and the public transportation system has been modernized and widely extended to make the city and its meeting venues easily accessible to visitors. Prague is now home to many international innovative technology and science institutions, attracting experts and scholars from all over the world. In tandem with these infrastructure changes, Prague Convention Bureau has developed its services significantly, including an extensive program of incentive support granted by the city and Ambassador Programme for association events. In short, Prague is completely prepared to meet the demands of the very highest end of the meetings industry.\nSource:- Prague Convention Bureau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:19:47.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
