Free Basics, a Facebook-led initiative, is aimed at making Internet access available to a wider group of the world's population and lower the digital divide among people. The collaboration between TrueMove H and Facebook is another challenge for both in offering communities an opportunity to connect to basic information resources on the Internet, mainly covering health, education and jobs, as well as local communities and news. Free Basics makes the Internet more accessible for more than 46 per cent of the population who are not yet connected to the Internet via TrueMove H's nationwide mobile network. Kittinut Tikawan, True Corporation's chief commercial officer, said the service was expected to help connect a wider group of people to online sources of news, information, knowledge as well as entertainment via this basic Internet service without data charges. \"The knowledge in Free Basics will greatly benefit Thai people and help develop the country in this digital age,\" said Kittinut, who is also managing director of True's mobile and retail business. All TrueMove H subscribers can use Free Basics free of charge simply by pressing *699# and calling free on their phone to get a link to the Free Basics service. Free Basics is available to TrueMove H prepaid and postpaid customers, and can be accessed from both feature and smart phones. Anna Nygren, head of Growth Partnerships, APAC at Facebook, said the Internet was a powerful enabler for social and economic progress, and Free Basics would help connect more Thais to the Internet. \"By bringing people essential Internet services like jobs, health and education, Free Basics gives them the power to improve their lives. We are excited to partner with TrueMove H to help bring more Thais into the knowledge economy,\" said Nygren. TrueMove H subscribers can now enjoy free access to useful content from more than 20 selected websites, which can be categorised into key areas, including community, education, health and jobs. 405 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:03:33.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
