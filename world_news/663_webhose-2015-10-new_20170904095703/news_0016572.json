The female tortoise released Wednesday is the 35th one set free this year on the Marine Corps base at Twentynine Palms. Biologists have been raising tortoises over the past nine years at a six-acre facility to help boost the population that was nearly decimated by a respiratory virus in the late 1980s. They cannot be released until their shells are mature enough so they better survive predator attacks.
