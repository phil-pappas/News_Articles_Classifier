The two companies are jointly offering the SharePoint Knowledge Portal which provides an Internet-like experience to users, is connected to diverse data sources (on premise and in the cloud) and personalizes search results based on user profiles and business processes.

An integrated view of data sources including all relevant operational, historical, structured and unstructured data (including Big Data and IoT).\n2. A contextual information architecture that organizes data, defines attributes and maps relationships to reflect the landscape of the business - its customers, products, people and processes.\n3. A highly scalable platform for tagging, categorizing, finding and presenting data that has high volume, variety, and velocity while maintaining enterprise standards of governance and security.\n4. A personalized digital user experience that streamlines the refinement of search results and provides a simple, intuitive approach for finding answers to complex business questions.\n5. Future-proofing the implementation and simplifying upgrades with a “no customization” approach that makes it easier to support the environment over time.\nCollectively, EIS and BAI have 100s of person-years of experience in implementing SharePoint-based intranets and portals for customers.
