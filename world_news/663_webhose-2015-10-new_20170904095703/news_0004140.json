The Advertising Standards Authority will continue to act as a co-regulator for advertising content on video-on-demand services. Netflix subscribers shoot up \nOfcom’s announcement came shortly after Netflix announced its third quarter results, showing impressive growth in subscriber numbers outside its domestic US market, backing up Ofcom’s own statistics on market growth. \nThe service now boasts 69.2 million members worldwide, up from 65.6 million in the second quarter and 53.1 million this time in 2014. It added 2 million members outside the US during the quarter. \nAlthough revenues of $1.74bn missed analyst expectations, Netflix made international sales of $517m during the period, up $62m sequentially.
