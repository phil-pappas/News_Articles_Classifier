Court proceedings resume on Tuesday.\n“We believe it is critical that we join the proceedings so that we can provide accurate information about our procedures and processes, as well as to correct inaccuracies that already exist,” the Facebook spokeswoman said.\nFacebook has repeatedly denied providing the NSA with “backdoor” access to its servers, and says its data transfer processes have already been audited by the Irish DPC.\nWithout the Safe Harbour framework struck down by the ECJ, companies have to use more costly and time-consuming legal channels to transfer personal data to the United States.\n 20, 2015 1:20 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:53:57.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
