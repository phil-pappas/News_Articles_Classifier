In June, C3nano announced its partnership with Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd in the joint development of TCTFs using C3nano’s Activegrid™ silver nanowire (AgNW) solution-based inks to enable a new class of flexible, more intuitive touch sensor applications, including those in large panel and curved displays. In May, C3nano and Nissha Printing Co., Ltd succeeded in the joint development of the next generation of silver nanowire (AgNW) transparent inks to meet the demand for smarter, flexible phones, tablets and large panel displays. In April, C3nano acquired Aiden, Co., Ltd of Korea, recognized as the quality and manufacturing leader in AgNWs. In March, C3nano announced its partnership with Kimoto, Ltd of Japan, with whom it delivers transparent conductive films (TCFs) to the flexible display and touch sensor markets. \nAbout C3nano, Inc. \nFounded in 2010 as a spinout from Professor Zhenan Bao’s chemical engineering laboratory at Stanford University, C3nano is the developer of the solution-based, transparent conductive inks and films as direct replacements for indium tin oxide (ITO). C3nano has raised more than $20 million in funding to date, which has enabled the company to quickly achieve best in class ink formulations and expanded production capabilities. \nAIMCAL, The Association of International Metallizers, Coaters and Laminators is a global nonprofit trade association representing converters of metallized, laminated and coated flexible substrates and their suppliers. Dr. Robert Fry, formerly the Senior Economist for DuPont, will provide the keynote that will look at the global economic trends that impact the industry.
