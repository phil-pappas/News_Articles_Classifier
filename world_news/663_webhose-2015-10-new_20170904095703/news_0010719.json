Citibank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank all plan to hire in unprecedented numbers at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other schools. The numbers may go up by up to 50 per cent for some banks this year.Citi plans to hire at least 275 graduates mainly through engineering campuses, up from 214 last year. Bunty Bohra, CEO of Goldman Sachs Services India, said one in four campus hires is joining Goldman Sachs' growing tech team in Bengaluru.ICICI Bank made its debut at IITs in Delhi, Bombay and Madras as well as Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) in Pilani for the class of 2015.A top recruiter at India's premier business schools, ICICI plans to tap more IITs. The country's largest private sector lender is looking to generate business worth Rs 80,000 crore through mobile banking this year. The industry is moving away from commodity banking to customised services, said TK Srirang, head of human resources at ICICI Bank, which is investing heavily in digital technology.\"While we have core skills sets of banking and sales, going forward a lot of our services will be delivered through smart devices,\" he said. \"Data analytics is gaining focus too and our ability to mine customer-centric information will be of key strategic advantage.\"The 214 graduates that Citi hired in the year ended March were mostly from engineering campuses under its Citi Analyst programme, up from 143 in FY14.The role of technology in banking is changing, said Vikram Subrahmanyam, head of operations and technology, Citi South Asia. Technology specialists, once seen as delivering a support function, are now a part of teams working on products and services.\"There is a larger involvement of tech teams in business solutions from an early stage. Some of the tech operations may be outsourced, but banks are looking at building greater expertise in the domain and are reaching out to engineering schools to hire directly,\" Subrahmanyam said. \"Technology lifecycles are shortening and the way we can use information and the speed at which we can react and offer solutions to customers is critical. India is not seen as a cost arbitrage play alone anymore. Operations and technology are key to delivery transformation in banks,\" he said.ICICI will pay its top engineering hires on par with recruits from the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs).\"We're hiring at the same salary levels as the IIM graduates so that they can build key leadership skills while working with us instead of pursuing an MBA programme,\" Srirang said. \"Going ahead, these graduates could build their careers in any of the banking fields.\"Hiring of freshers with technical specialisations has gone up 30 per cent this year at HDFC Bank. In addition to core IT needs, the bank is seeking expertise in digital, payments, market risk, risk analytics and credit risk fields. \"This year the bank will increase its intake of candidates from engineering institutes. The hiring will be across various roles in IT and business technology functions,\" said a spokesperson.\"We built an innovation team in the bank a few quarters ago to scan new solutions and developments in emerging technologies,\" said Nitin Chugh, head of digital banking at HDFC Bank. \"The team is expected to identify potential problems and opportunities and run solutions or projects, and create capacity for experimentation.\"New-age banking products that require data analytics and more real-time customised solutions have led to a four-fold increase in hiring of tech graduates from IIT-Madras in the last four years, said V Babu, professor, department of mechanical engineering, and advisor, training and placement at the institute.IIT-Bombay said that typically 15 per cent of their undergraduate batch and 10 per cent of the combined undergraduate and post graduate batch joins banking companies. They typically register toward end November; indications are that hiring will be significantly higher.While Axis Bank, Credit Suisse, ICICI Bank and ICICI Lombard recruited from IIT-Madras last year, Deutsche Bank has given seven pre-placement offers to institute students this year. Barclays has also expressed interest in hiring. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Credit Suisse, Citi, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, JP Morgan, Bank of America and ANZ Bank visited IIT-Bombay last year. The banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) industry made a total of 106 offers. Almost all the companies have confirmed participation this year as well. The typical profiles for which banks are hiring include analyst, investment banking analyst, risk analyst, modelling analyst, IT analyst and manager.\"The rapid ongoing digitisation of financial services sector in India is one of the main reasons of financial firms coming to IIT-Bombay,\" said Rahul Katyal, placement manager, IIT-Bombay. \"Engineering graduates have good numerical and problem solving skills and, moreover, information technology serves as a backbone for smoother functioning of the constantly evolving new systems.\"Even the newer IITs have witnessed an interest from banks. Bank of America hired four students from IIT-Hyderabad's class of 2015 for technology graduate trainee roles. B Venkatesham, faculty-incharge for the training and placement cell at IIT Hyderabad, said tech graduates can contribute to evolving banking businesses in the areas of digitisation, remote access and security.Banks will also have to compete with the likes of Paytm, which has approval to set up a payments bank. Paytm will hire 300-350 recruits from campuses this year and a substantial number of them will be for the payments banking business.\"Last year, we had taken around 150 engineers from top IITs and NITs (National Institutes of Technology),\" said Amit Sinha, vice-president, business and people, at Paytm. \"We will reach out to more campuses this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:09:53.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
