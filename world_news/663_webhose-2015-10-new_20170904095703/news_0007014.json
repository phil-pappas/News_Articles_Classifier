However, if used incorrectly or if patient considerations and device selection are not taken into account, the clutch mechanism may fail to disengage, causing the drill tip to unintentionally damage the brain. In ten years, from January 2005 to August 2015, the FDA has received over 300 medical device reports about the automatic clutch mechanisms in cranial perforators failing to disengage. Over 200 patients were injured because of the accidents.\nThis failure to disengage isn’t specific to any one manufacturer or brand. Instead, it usually comes about through improper use, improper device selection, or failure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNeurosurgeons are asked to review all device labeling for cranial perforators with an automatic clutch mechanism very carefully, and to be cautious when preparing to drill. The cutting accessories must be appropriate based on the patient’s skull thickness, the FDA said, and the perforator must be held steadily perpendicular to the inner table of the skull.\nInjuries sustained by improper performance of cranial perforators can include brain contusion, cerebral tissue damage, bleeding, perforation of the dura mater, and decreased function of the brain. Some patients who suffered these injuries have experienced seizures, aphasia, or the need for additional medical procedures and hospital stays as a result.\nWhile the FDA is not taking any further action after issuing the safety communication, they have noted that they will continue to monitor usage of this particular device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:04:58.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
