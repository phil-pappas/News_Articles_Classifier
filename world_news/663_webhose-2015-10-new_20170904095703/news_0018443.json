It recognizes subjects across wide variety of physical and conceptual categories including home appliances, cars, industrial goods, architecture, apps, types of communication and even business models. The CL4NX and CL6NX series, engineered for zero downtime, was highly evaluated for its rugged design that can withstand all types of workplace environments. The printers also feature tool-less maintenance, which allows users to replace consumables on their own. The printers employ a universal design with intuitive buttons and icons and full-color LCD displays that provide operating instructions and explain procedures to prevent errors.“We took both functionality and user-friendly design into consideration for the NX series,” said Kaz Matsuyama, CEO and President of SATO Holdings Corporation, “This recognition by such a prestigious award is a great testament to our customer-centric approach toward product design.” For more about CL4NX and CL6NX, please visit http://www.cl4nx.com/ For other winners of the Good Design Award, please visit: http://www.g-mark.org/award/ # # # About SATO Holdings Corporation: About SATO SATO (TSE:6287) is a leading global provider of Auto-ID solutions that connect people, goods and information.
