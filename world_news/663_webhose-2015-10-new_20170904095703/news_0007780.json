Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 leaves Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, on July 17, 2014 \nThe Dutch-led investigators concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on by a Russian-made BUK missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. \nAll 298 people on board, most of them Dutch nationals, were killed when the Boeing 777 was blown up en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. \nBut the findings triggered protests from Moscow, which maintains the BUK missile was fired by the Ukrainian military, and not by pro-Russian separatists battling to breakaway from Kiev. \nTrend Micro said that on September 28, a fake server was set up to mimic the Dutch Safety Board's safe file transfer protocol server, and on October 14 a false VPN access was also created. \nOn September 29, a fake Outlook web mail server was also established targeting one of the board's partners. \nThe aim was to \"execute phishing attacks in order to collect credentials from the personnel of the Safety Board which could give Pawn Storm unauthorised access to the SFTP and VPN servers.\" \nPawn Storm is also believed to have been behind a cyberattack on France's TV5Monde television when people, claiming to represent the Islamic State group, shut down transmissions and placed jihadist messages on the station's website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:37:03.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
