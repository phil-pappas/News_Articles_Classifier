Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican whose Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee is investigating Clinton's email arrangement, says the attempts were apparently blocked by a \"threat monitoring\" product that Clinton's employees connected to her network in October 2013. But there was a period of more than three months from June to October 2013 when that protection had not been installed. \nIt was not immediately clear whether the attempted intrusions into Clinton's server were serious espionage threats or nuisance attacks. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
