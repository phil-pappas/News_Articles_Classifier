When started, this tool activates accessibility in Adobe Reader until you quit it. Each time you open PDF document, the following message appears, \"Please wait while the document is prepared for reading\".

Setting the reading order preferences to the reading order in raw print stream also speeds up this process but may interfere with the functionality magnifier. \n7. To improve the startup time and performance of Adobe Reader , defragment your hard drive by using the disk utility before you install this. You can use the disk included with your operating system or a utility. Hard drives become fragmented through normal use (for example, installing and uninstalling applications, adding and deleting files). Over time, the computer is unable to locate contiguous blocks of free space and saves files in pieces across the hard drive, which increases the time required to open these files. The hard drive pieces files back together and improves performance. \n8.

This data may execute desktop shortcuts that cause windows to open. The problem doesn't occur with all scanners. No solution exists \n9.

The same applies to the U + 3500, U + 3600, and U + 3700. Type the U + 3400 character in the search field instead of pasting it. \n13. If you install adobe acrobat elements 6.0 after installing the full version of Adobe Reader 7.0, you may encounter an error in acrobat elements when you try to convert a file to PDF asking if you want to run the installer in repair mode.

Install acrobat elements 6.0 before you install Adobe Reader 7.0.7 to ensure that both applications are installed in the same folder. (Acrobat Elements 6.0 doesn't allow you to specify the install location). Please note that installing Adobe Reader 7.0.7 doesn't remove Adobe Reader 6.0 which is installed by adobe elements to the same folder.
