It also achieved another significant milestone, reaching more than 10,000 members during the September quarter. This growth represents acceleration of more than 100 per cent since January 2015.\nThe company is on track to exceed $1 million in annual sales.\nBig Review TV founder Brandon Evertz, who started the company as a teenager three years ago, said the partnership with CDM Direct Communication Services and other sales initiatives had facilitated the acceleration of revenue and member growth.\n“We started on 15 sales staff now we have grown to 55 sales staff so that (CDM) has really been the rocket fuel in helping us get the numbers that we need,’’ he told The Australian. “We still want to continue to build that sales number by the end of December up to, hopefully, around 100 sales reps.’’\nEarlier this year, the company announced it had successfully raised $3 million via an oversubscribed capital raising, with strong interest from existing and new investors.\nThe cost to produce a promotional video starts at $399, with a monthly subscription from $7.50. The service is free for the public.\nThe company’s growing member base forms a strong part of its revenue base, with an increasing amount of members who sign up to Big Review TV’s online video content offering, converting to recurring subscription-based membership terms.\n“We are really starting to have a strong footprint overseas in building that content base,’’ the 21-year-old said.\nThe company’s initial target markets are Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Singapore.\n“In member growth, I would probably say 70 to 80 per cent would be Australia and then 10 per cent in the US and the UK.’’\nSales are expected to accelerate during the December quarter based on a robust sales pipeline and material uplift in recurring revenues.\nMr Evertz, who is Big Un Limited executive director, said the plan was to add to the business-to-business model with a business-to-consumer focus.\n“We are producing that content for the businesses but the next sort of step is to really start building a great, engaging show content base for consumers.’’\nHe said the main priority would be to continue to build member growth, with the company potentially based in the US in the future.\n“The US is ideally where we would like to be but, regardless, we still have operations in the US anyway so we will continue to build up that.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:33:13.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
