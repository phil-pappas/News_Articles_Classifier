Although the students should continue the fight for cheaper education, but for now, they should take a break for the time being. Here are the reasons why:\n1. Students and all parties involved need to regroup their minds.\nThis has definitely been an emotional week for all parties involved. From social media to the physically draining protests, this past week has been draining. Now that the president has given a zero percent increase, I feel that this is the time for reflection and to take stock of what had happened. As the saying goes \" when you bring peace to your past, you can move forward with your future.\n2. Exams and your courses.\nYes, the timing of the fees protest was bad as exams were looming and part of the reasons why I was not in favor of the students creating havoc in this noble cause was because of the students in their final year. The honors students and final students have walked a long road ( especially the guys who were poor but rejected by NFSAS). They now face an uncertain future and an anxious as they seek for jobs all because of the delay in the exams. On the other hand, the continuous striking shows that there is no urgency for the students to pursue their dreams. Yes, they are fighting for the future but on the other hand, what is the point of fighting for reduced fees if you don't pass your subjects.\n3. Time to plan the next #feesmustfall campaign\nThis may have been a success but I feel that this movement can be conducted a little better. The break should be a great opportunity for the incoming SRC leaders to plan and identify the issues to discuss with the Vice Chancellor. In addition to that, the next #feesmustfall campaign will be even more effective.\nSo students, you have done well. But, for the sake of family time, for the sake of the final year students looking for jobs and for your destiny, just give the #feesmustfall campaign a break until after exams and well into the beginning of next year where the registration fees are due.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:28:42.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
