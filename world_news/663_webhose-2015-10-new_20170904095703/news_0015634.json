The current plant is the company's only plant in Perham that produces pet food. \nPure Foods announced plans to establish its US headquarters and manufacturing facility in Kingsport city in Tennessee in March 2015. It will be the company's fourth facility in North America. Tuffy's Pet Foods' manufacturing facility details \nThe 130,000ft² state-of-the-art manufacturing facility houses completely segregated processes and is equipped with latest, technologically-advanced equipment. It comprises approximately 180,000ft² of production and warehouse space. \nThe processing and packaging areas in the plant are made of pre-stressed concrete walls with a rubber roof. The plant features four packaging lines with packaging systems designed to be flexible for blending and conveying. Of the four, two lines will be moved from the existing facility and a new high-speed large line and a new small line with a bundler will be installed in future. \nThree extrusion lines have been installed at the plant initially and enough space is provided to accommodate a fourth extrusion line in future. \nThe plant has the capacity to produce more than 180,000t of product, which is 50% more than the original facility. Once the new plant becomes fully operational, the old plant will be converted into warehouse and an expansion of soft moist treat capacity. \"The plant has the capacity to produce more than 180,000t of product, which is 50% more than the original facility.\" Related Suppliers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:44:17.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
