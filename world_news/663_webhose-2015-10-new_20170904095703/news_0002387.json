(NASDAQ: EVOL) \nTransaction expected to be accretive and augment Evolving Systems' revenue by approximately 20% in 2016 \nThomas Thekkethala joins Evolving Systems as President and Board Member \nCompany will conduct an investor conference call on October 1 at 8:30 a.m. EST to discuss details of the transaction \nEvolving Systems , Inc. (NASDAQ: EVOL), a leader in activation, enablement and management of services for connected mobile devices worldwide, today announced it has acquired for cash privately held Sixth Sense Media (SSM), a provider of real-time analytics and marketing solutions to global wireless carriers. \nRateIntegration, Inc., d/b/a/ Sixth Sense Media, based in Durham, North Carolina, is a software technology company, serving more than 15 carriers around the world, including tier 1 operators in India, Asia, Africa and Europe. SSM's software solution, Real-time Lifecycle Marketing, or RLM, platform enables carrier marketing departments to innovate, execute and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant, interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real time. \nCombining SSM's real-time analytics and campaign capabilities with Evolving Systems' Dynamic SIM Allocation (DSA) and Mobile Data Enablement (MDE) solutions will allow the Company to offer global wireless carriers solutions that utilize the highly valuable contextual data captured from the subscribers' initial welcome experience via DSA, their network usage via RLM and their on-device app usage via MDE. The combined solutions will create a highly personalized experience that engages subscribers in real time from the first time subscribers power on their new devices right through their day-to-day usage. \n\"Evolving Systems' acquisition of Sixth Sense Media is strategic, enabling us to augment our industry recognized strength in real time activation and aggressively move into the high value space of mobile marketing campaigns, advertising and analytics,\" said Thad Dupper, Chairman and CEO. \"By combining SSM's products with DSA and MDE, we will provide carriers with a powerful platform that enables real-time marketing campaigns based on highly actionable subscriber data. Our production-proven platforms will provide carriers the ability to execute sophisticated, hyper-targeted, revenue-generating campaigns as well as the analytics to measure their effectiveness -- beginning at the time of first activation and continuing through their life-cycle with the carrier -- including when subscribers upgrade their phones. Along with our recent mobile marketing partnerships, this acquisition continues to move Evolving Systems further into the mobile marketing and advertising space and makes us a larger, stronger and more diversified company.\" \n\"We are very excited about joining Evolving Systems and the tremendous potential this combination represents,\" said Thomas Thekkethala, former CEO of Sixth Sense Media who has joined Evolving Systems as President and a member of the Board of Directors. \"Carriers have invested significantly in spectrum, network and customer acquisition but have not been able to fully participate in the rapidly-expanding mobile marketing opportunity. We plan to leverage our combined solutions and market expertise to enable our mobile carrier customer base to generate new revenues across a range of mobile marketing channels.\" \nTransaction highlights: Financial impact and funding for transaction. Sixth Sense Media is a profitable company with sales that are expected to add approximately 20% to Evolving Systems' 2016 revenue. Evolving Systems will pay $10.0 million for Sixth Sense Media in two payments -- approximately $9.75 million in cash at closing, plus customary working capital adjustments, and a second cash payment of $250,000 on the one-year anniversary of the closing of the transaction. The transaction is being financed with the Company's $10.0 million revolving line of credit with East West Bank. Evolving Systems will file an initial Form 8-K with the SEC, followed by a Form 8-K/A within 71 days with additional details of the transaction. The new solutions. SSM's RLM solution combined with DSA and MDE will increase campaign effectiveness and generate unlimited upsell opportunities that lead to higher and more profitable carrier revenues. DSA's patented solution that collects critical data regarding the subscriber's service, device and location during the initial activation will be sent in real-time to RLM, enabling carriers to offer extremely timely and relevant offers that achieves much higher subscriber take rates compared with existing campaigns. The MDE solution will capture and provide RLM information about data consumption by date, time, location and, importantly, by app during the subscriber's day-to-day usage. These granular consumer behavioral attributes will enable RLM to generate hyper-targeted campaigns that will further increase carrier revenues. Expanded customer base. The combined Company will have more than 75 customers in 50 countries. Sixth Sense Media's customer base includes more than 15 carriers worldwide -- many of them tier 1 -- in important growth areas of the Middle East, Africa, India and Asia. The integrated products created through this merger will lead to many cross-selling opportunities among this expanded customer base. Strengthened management and sales teams. The addition of key members of Sixth Sense Media's management and sales staffs will broaden and deepen Evolving Systems' leadership team.
