That's version 48.0.2530.0 by the way. \nThis not only happened on sites or web applications but also internal Chrome pages which meant that I could not check the settings, check for updates, manage extensions or manipulate Chrome flags. \nI did not pay much attention to it yesterday as I assumed it was a broken update that was causing this. \nToday, with some time on my hand and the realization that things did not improve over night, I decided to investigate the matter to find out more about it. \nFirst thing I tried was to launch Incognito Modus just to see if it was a profile related issue. Turns out it was not as Aw, Snap! errors were displayed in that mode as well. \nNext step, downloading Chrome Canary again to see if installing it anew solves the issue. Turns out this did not help and neither did completely removing Chrome Canary from the system before installing it again on it. \nI then tried to make sure that third-party solutions like Microsoft EMET were not the culprit (which they were not). \nAfter researching the issue it turned out that several Chrome Canary users were experiencing the same issue on Windows 10. \nA Chrome Help Forum community manager confirmed on the official forum that this was an issue with Chrome Canary itself and not caused by extensions, programs or settings on the user system. \nThanks so much for reporting this and filing the bug. Our team has let us know that this has already been fixed and will go out in the next release of Canary shortly. \nThe issue will be fixed in the next Chrome Canary version according to him which will be released shortly. It is unclear when it will arrive and if the issue is limited to Chrome Canary running on Windows 10 or if other versions of Windows are affected by the issue as well. \nNow You : Are you running Chrome Canary currently and experiencing the issue? Summary Latest Chrome Canary is completely broken (Aw, Snap! on all pages) Author Martin Brinkmann Description The latest version of the Chrome Canary browser on Windows 10 is broken as it displays Aw, Snap! errors on all pages you open in the browser.
