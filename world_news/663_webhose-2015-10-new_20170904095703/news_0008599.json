Park Bench Solutions works with BroadSoft(TM)- based Service Providers around the globe, allowing for the best overall experience atop the leading hosted voice application platform, BroadWorks . \n\"Starting with a robust administrative portal is key for the user experience - but only the first layer,\" says Marc Tribbe, CEO of Park Bench Solutions. Rapid technology changes have challenged Service Providers with fulfilling many core components such as enterprise level self-service management, integration, automation, and provisioning. Park Bench Solutions core product, ODiN, continues to serve as the growth engine platform for many Service Providers addressing each of these challenges. \nBroadSoft(TM) BroadWorks offers the most advanced platform when it comes to Unified Communications & Collaboration (UCC) services. Marc Tribbe points out, \"We aimed to take an already robust platform [BroadWorks] and make it more flexible. Our platform [ODiN], is the first and only platform that allows BroadWorks-based Service Providers to 'build-your-own' solution when it comes to simplifying integration and automation to existing products & processes.\" \nThe industry has seen a rise in the adoption of more cloud-based solutions and the need for more agile development, especially when it comes to simplified APIs. BroadSoft(TM) BroadWorks offers an extensive library of its own APIs (called OCI and XSI) but the complexity often taxes development resources. One of Park Bench Solutions newly released core components of ODiN is the RESTful API overlay to BroadWorks. The ODiN REST API introduces an industry-standard method that simplifies development towards the BroadWorks platform. The additional components, such as ODiN's provisioning, bulk configuration tools, product & services bundling, brand management and complete enterprise self-service portal are just some of the latest modules to stem from the ODiN API. \nDusty Doris, CTO and head of development at Park Bench Solutions explains, \"BroadWorks OCI is a great tool but we felt faster development and integration efforts could be gained by simplifying it to a standardized REST API. ODiN is the first consumer of its own API. But, now anyone can speed up development of their own enterprise solutions such as a customer portal, OSS/BSS integration, apps, and service tools using our REST API.\" \nPark Bench Solutions will be showcasing their latest solutions at the BroadSoft(TM) Connections show next week October 25th through the 28th, 2015 in Phoenix, Arizona.
