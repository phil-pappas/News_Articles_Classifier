Along with a slimmer build than last year's model, Samsung has also tweaked the Galaxy Tab S2's screen to suit people looking to get some work done rather than just consume content.\nIn many ways the new Tab S2 range is only an incremental upgrade from last year's Tab S. There's a performance boost thanks to the upgraded Exynos processor, but it's still a 1.9/1.3GHz on \"Octa-Core\" chip – basically two quad-core chips running side by side. They're accompanied by a generous 3GB of RAM, along with 32GB of onboard storage (up from 16GB) and a micro-SD slot for expansion.\nThe spec sheet tells a pretty good story. You've got 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 and Wi-Fi Direct but no NFC. The 8MP rear camera offers improved aperture to enhance low-light performance and the new fingerprint reader now lets you press with your finger rather than swipe.\nAdvertisement Shape shifter\nThe most notable changes to the Tab S2 are the screen size and shape, bringing it into line with Apple's iPad line up. Slightly smaller than the original Tab S, the Tab S2 is available in a choice of 8 or 9.7-inch displays – selling for $499/$649 or $599/$749 respectively depending on whether you want Wi-Fi-only or the added benefit of 4G mobile broadband.\nSome people will snigger at Samsung for falling into line with Apple, but you have to admit that the iPad's form factor has clearly found success – inversely, the iPhone has copied more and more aspects of Samsung's smartphones over the years.\nWhen it comes to tablets Samsung narrowly retains the \"mine's smaller than yours\" bragging rights. Both Tab S2 models are 5.6mm thick, shaving half a millimetre off the iPad. They're also also slightly lighter than the corresponding Apple tablets, with Samsung's offerings tipping the scales at 272 and 392 grams respectively.\nLike smartphones, it seems we're reaching the tablet singularity – a convergence in hardware design where it's becoming harder to tell them apart. Tablets are so slender that they're becoming all-but invisible, you can easily forget you're holding one once you become immersed in what's happening on the screen.\nThe Galaxy Tab S2's screen looks phenomenal, sticking with the exquisite Super AMOLED displays that we expect from Samsung. It's bright, vivid and crisp with very white whites. The screen offers wide viewing angles, albeit with a slight blue tinge when you're off-centre. Samsung's Adaptive Display setting adjusts the screen for any conditions and it does a decent job of handling outdoor glare.\nSamsung has also upgraded its SideSync screen mirroring feature, letting you view the Tab S2's home screen on your PC or Mac. You can also mirror the Tab S2 to a Samsung Smart TV. Alternatively you can mirror a Samsung Smart TV or smartphone to the Tab S2.\nProductivity boost\nAlong with new screen sizes the Galaxy Tab S2 tablets have also switched to an iPad-esque 4:3 aspect ratio, so they're shaped less like a movie screen and more like a sheet of paper. With this change comes a slight drop in screen resolution and pixel density. The change in aspect ratio might frustrate people looking for a multimedia companion, but it's likely to appeal to those looking for a productivity tool.\nIt's little surprise that the Galaxy Tab S2 comes with the Android version of Microsoft Office pre-installed along with 100GB of OneDrive cloud storage which is free for two years. The Tab S2 also supports Samsung's optional Book Cover Keyboard, featuring a physical keyboard along with a trackpad in order to mimic a notebook.\nAs with last year's model and a few other Samsung devices, the Galaxy Tab S2 supports \"multi window view\" to aid with productivity. This lets you run two apps side-by-side in landscape mode, or one above the other in portrait mode.\nPress the Recent button and you'll see that compatible apps have a split-screen icon in the title bar. You can even shift the dividing line between the two apps on the screen. Alternatively you can use \"pop up view\" – shrinking one app and keeping it on top of the other, picture-in-picture style.\nWhat's really surprising is that the Microsoft Office apps don't work with multi window or pop-up view. You'd think that multi window view would be a non-brainer, especially considering that Microsoft Office apps on the iPad support side-by-side mode. Hopefully it's on the road map.\nThe tablet runs Samsung's TouchWiz Android skin, which thankfully has matured with age and is far less annoying and intrusive than it once was. Android fans may be disappointed to learn that the Galaxy Tab S2 doesn't run Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which was released earlier this month. Instead it comes with Android 5.0.2 pre-installed, with the promise of an upgrade to Android 5.1.\nSo what's the verdict?\nThere's a lot to like here even though, screen size aside, the Galaxy Tab S2 is an incremental upgrade rather than a major overhaul. There's plenty of grunt under the bonnet, the razor-thin design makes it easy to slip in your travel bag and the fantastic Super AMOLED screen ensures it looks great in any environment.\nThere's no killer feature here to entice satisfied Galaxy Tab S owners to upgrade, unless you're an Android user secretly envious of the iPad's 4:3 aspect ratio – which is rare in the Android world. But if you're in the market for a new slab of Android goodness then Samsung's Galaxy Tab S2 is hard to beat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:23:21.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
