October 26, 2015 By Jodi Dorsch NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The Professional Pest Management Alliance board of directors last week approved the budget for the group’s 2016 media/public relations plan. The board meeting, which was the first for Cindy Mannes in her second go-round as executive director, was held prior to the opening ceremony for NPMA PestWorld in Nashville. Bobby Jenkins, sitting in for PPMA Chairman Tommy Fortson whose travel was delayed on his way to Tennessee, said, “It’s great to have Cindy Mannes back as PPMA executive director.” Mannes replaced Missy Henriksen, who left to fill a similar role at the “green” association NALP (National Association of Landscape Professionals). Jenkins touted Mannes’ unique industry experience, which includes previous stints at an industry manufacturer, a pest management firm and as an association executive at NPMA. “I don’t know anyone else who has that kind of experience,” Jenkins said. “It is good to be back. Thank you all for your support and for the kind notes and words and encouragement,” Mannes said. “I am very proud to be serving this industry. It gets in your blood and I love this industry.” PPMA UPDATE. Mannes reported that in 2015, PPMA had 370 investors and operated on a $2 million budget. From that $2 million budget, PPMA secured $100 million worth of advertising value (up from a value of $70 million last year). That $2 million budget includes investments in various advertising and public relations efforts. Components of the 2016 program will include: • A continued partnership with Bob Vila. • Continued efforts promoting Bed Bug Awareness Week, Termite Awareness Week, Rodent Awareness Week and Pest Management Month (April). • Continued airport display advertising.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:46:12.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
