Rise in incidence of low back pain and spinal injuries and increasing usage of ESDs in sports medicine has triggered the demand for ESDs globally. In terms of regional classification, the global electrical stimulation devices market has been segmented into five major markets: North America , Europe , Asia Pacific , Latin America , and Middle East & Africa . \nBrowse Market Research Report on Electrical Stimulation Devices Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/electrical-stimulation-devices-market.html \nIn terms of revenue, North America was the largest regional market for electrical stimulation devices, and accounted for a share of over 40% of the global market in 2014. Dominance of North America has been attributed to increasing aging population, highly structured health care industry, and availability of well-defined reimbursement policies from public and private health insurance firms. Additionally, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), approximately 60% to 80% adult population in the U.S. suffers from low-back pain and more than 13 million people visit a clinician for chronic back pain. Thus, the expanding patient base and positive product approvals are cumulatively analyzed to boost the market growth in this region. \nGet Sample Report Copy of Electrical Stimulation Devices Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=7075 \nEurope was the second largest market for electrical stimulation devices in terms of revenue in 2014. Major countries such as Germany , the U.K., and France accounted for a majority share of the European market. Factors attributed to the rapid growth of the electrical stimulation devices market in Europe are increasing introduction of innovative products by top market players along with rising incidence of chronic back pain and diseases such as diabetes, injuries sustained from traffic-accidents, sports injuries, and occupational injuries are some of the key factors fueling the growth of the electrical stimulation devices market in Europe . \nBrowse Press Release of Electrical Stimulation Devices Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/electrical-stimulation-devices-market.htm \nAsia Pacific was the third largest market for electrical stimulation devices market in 2014, and is anticipated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Certain factors such as, large pool of aged individuals and perpetual addition to the same, implementation of government initiatives aimed at improving health care access, and growing health care expenditure would drive the growth of the market in Asia Pacific . In addition, presence of large medical device sector in the developing regions of Asia Pacific would contribute towards the growth of electrical stimulation devices market. Asia Pacific was followed by Latin America ( Brazil and Rest of Latin America ) and Middle East & Africa ( South Africa and Rest of MEA) in terms of market revenue. \nOther Reports Published by Transparency Market Research: Deep Brain Stimulation Devices Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/deep-brain-stimulator-market.html Neurology Devices Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/neurology-devices-market.html Electrophysiology Devices Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/electrophysiology-ep-devices-market.html \nBoston Scientific Corporation, BTL Industries, Inc., Cyberonics, Inc., DJO Global, EnteroMedics Inc., Medtronic plc, Nevro Corp., NeuroMetrix, Inc., St. Jude Medical, Inc., Uroplasty, Inc.
