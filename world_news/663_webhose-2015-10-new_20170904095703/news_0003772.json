Somewhat predictably, amenities do not include a gym, wireless internet or cable TV.\nBut it's not all doom and gloom: The evening also includes a \"culinary experience\", private concert and storyteller. \"Finally, enjoy dawn with the dead, as you become the only living person ever to wake up in the Paris catacombs,\" AirBnB says on its website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:58:22.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
