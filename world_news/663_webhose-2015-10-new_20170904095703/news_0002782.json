Abstract: Vedolizumab Exposure in Pregnancy: Outcomes from Clinical Studies in Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease (Mahadevan U, Dubinsky M, Vermeire S, Abhyankar B, Lasch K) Abstract: Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab with Advancing Age in Patients with Crohn's Disease: Results from the GEMINI 2 Study (Yajnik V, Khan N, Dubinsky M, et al.) \nAbout Entyvio ® (vedolizumab) Entyvio, an integrin receptor antagonist, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the alpha4beta7 integrin and blocks the interaction of alpha4beta7 integrin with mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and inhibits the migration of memory T-lymphocytes across the endothelium into inflamed gastrointestinal parenchymal tissue. Entyvio does not bind to or inhibit function of the alpha4beta1 and alpha E beta 7 integrins and does not antagonize the interaction of alpha4 integrins with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on the surface of a discrete subset of memory T-lymphocytes that preferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal tract. MAdCAM-1 is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical role in the homing of T-lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue. The interaction of the alpha4beta7 integrin with MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. \nINDICATIONS: ENTYVIO (vedolizumab) \nAdult Ulcerative Colitis (UC) \nENTYVIO (vedolizumab) is indicated in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker or immunomodulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids for inducing and maintaining clinical response, inducing and maintaining clinical remission, improving endoscopic appearance of the mucosa, and achieving corticosteroid-free remission. \nAdult Crohn's Disease (CD) \nENTYVIO (vedolizumab) is indicated in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to a TNF blocker or immunomodulator; or had an inadequate response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids for achieving clinical response, achieving clinical remission, and achieving corticosteroid-free remission. \nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION ENTYVIO (vedolizumab) for injection is contraindicated in patients who have had a known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to ENTYVIO or any of its excipients. Infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have occurred. Allergic reactions including dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased blood pressure and heart rate have also been observed. If anaphylaxis or other serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue administration of ENTYVIO immediately and initiate appropriate treatment. Patients treated with ENTYVIO are at increased risk for developing infections. Serious infections have been reported in patients treated with ENTYVIO, including anal abscess, sepsis (some fatal), tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasis, and cytomegaloviral colitis. ENTYVIO is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled. Consider withholding ENTYVIO in patients who develop a severe infection while on treatment with ENTYVIO. Exercise caution in patients with a history of recurring severe infections. Consider screening for tuberculosis (TB) according to the local practice. Although no cases of PML have been observed in ENTYVIO clinical trials, JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has occurred in patients treated with another integrin receptor antagonist. A risk of PML cannot be ruled out. Monitor patients for any new or worsening neurological signs or symptoms. Typical signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing with ENTYVIO and refer to a neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue ENTYVIO dosing permanently. There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving ENTYVIO. ENTYVIO should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury. Prior to initiating treatment with ENTYVIO, all patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Patients receiving ENTYVIO may receive non-live vaccines and may receive live vaccines if the benefits outweigh the risks. Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 3% and greater than or equal to 1% higher than placebo): nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, rash, pruritus, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, and pain in extremities. \nPlease see the accompanying full Prescribing Information including Medication Guide for ENTYVIO. \nMore information is available at www.ENTYVIOHCP.com and www.ENTYVIO.com \nAbout Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are marked by inflammation in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. UC impacts the large intestine only, which includes the colon and the rectum, while CD can impact any part of the digestive tract, and predominantly affects the ileum. There is no known cause for UC and CD, although many researchers believe that the interaction between genes, the body's immune system, and environmental factors may play a role. \nAbout Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. , Inc.
