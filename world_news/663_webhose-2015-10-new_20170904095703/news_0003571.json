(CELG) said its investigative treatment for ulcerative colitis showed significant benefits for patients at week 32 of a phase 2 clinical trial compared with a placebo.\nCelgene acquired the treatment--called Ozanimod--with its recent $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos Inc. The Summit, N.J., biopharmaceutical company has been trying to diversify beyond its foothold in drugs treating multiple myeloma. With the Receptos deal, Celgene aimed to move deeper into the multibillion-dollar market for autoimmune diseases.\nCelgene had estimated Ozanimod--which also is being studied as a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis--could have $4 billion to $6 billion in yearly sales if it wins approval.\nThe company said the maintenance study included patients who showed improvement after eight weeks of using the treatment. Of those patients, 21% of patients that received Ozanimod achieved or maintained clinical remission at week 32--the primary study goal-- compared with 6% receiving a placebo.\nThe study results were presented at an American College of Gastroenterology Annual Scientific Meeting in Honolulu.\nThe drug also showed significant improvement on secondary study goals--including the achievement or maintenance of a clinical response by 51% of patients receiving Ozanimod, compared with 20% for a placebo.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 19, 2015 09:40 ET (13:40 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:27:31.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
