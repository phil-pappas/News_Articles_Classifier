SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra is expected to join Western Digital’s board.\nIn September, Unisplendour, a division of China ’s Tsinghua Holdings , announced a $3.78 billion investment in Western Digital.\nMilligan will be CEO of the combined business, which will keep its headquarters at Western Digital’s Irvine location.\nThe boards of both companies have approved the deal, expected to close next year. It still needs approval from SanDisk shareholders.\nIn the Lam KLA-Tencor deal, also expected to close next year, the combined company will be valued at $19 billion.\nThe offer, for $67.02 per share, marks a 24 percent premium to the Tuesday closing price of KLA-Tencor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:24:14.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
