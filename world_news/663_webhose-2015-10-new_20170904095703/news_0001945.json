That was the conclusion Snowflake came to with their data warehouse-as-a-service offering,” said BBBT Founder, Claudia Imhoff. “We have seen a dramatic uptick in the acceptance of cloud-based architectures, so having one for the data warehouse makes complete sense. This is especially true given the unpredictable storage needs of most data warehouse implementations.”\nA podcast summarizing the presentation will be available at the BBBT podcasts page and a video of the presentation will be available at the BBBT videos page .\nAbout BBBT\nThe Boulder Business Intelligence Brain Trust has served the BI industry since 2006.
