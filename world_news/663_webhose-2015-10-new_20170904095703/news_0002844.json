Infinitely Virtual will make its entry official during a Nov. 12 cocktail reception at San Antonio's Eilan Hotel Resort & Spa . \n\"When it comes to payroll hosting, there's no margin for error -- hosted payroll solutions must be up and available 100 percent of the time, and a hosting vendor must deliver absolute reliability, total security and zero data loss,\" said Adam Stern, founder and CEO, Infinitely Virtual. \"For nearly a decade, we have been focused on cloud-based application delivery, including hosted solutions like Execupay. Every Execupay hosting plan is designed to provide what payroll processors need. With us, it's never necessary to build from scratch. That's because we've been at home in the cloud since cloud computing began. \nWith Infinitely Virtual, every user gets a server and a dedicated firewall. \"Payroll processors simply can't obtain a more secure environment,\" Stern said. \"Deploying appropriate security protections, with technologies such as clustered firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), doesn't come cheap. The fact is, many of the smaller players in the hosting business can't and don't make that investment. At Infinitely Virtual, we include IDPS for free. IDPS is able to detect threats to your data that even the best firewall won't catch. And we ensure data integrity. As cyber threats become ever more insidious, we implement systems that go well beyond basic antivirus 'solutions.' For us, advanced monitoring and multi-level intrusion detection and prevention are mandatory, not discretionary.\" \nInfinitely Virtual will offer current Execupay users flexibility in selecting the configuration they prefer. Those who are currently hosted at Execupay can migrate to Infinitely Virtual's environment in its entirety. Those using Execupay Replicated can implement full hosting or opt for a split configuration, continuing to run the application locally while SQL Server is hosted. \nUnder the first option, users can move their Execupay software to Infinitely Virtual's fully-hosted Infrastructure as a Service environment, which includes the company's Virtual Dedicated SQL Server and Employee Terminal Server with RemoteApp Support -- Client Terminal Server (for Platinum Pay) or Client Web Server (for Platinum Pay Express). \nUnder the Execupay Replicated option, users can move the local database to the company's Virtual Dedicated SQL server in the cloud. Users can continue to run software locally on their desktop; Platinum Pay clients can login to Terminal Server, while Platinum Pay Express users can log into a Client Web Server. Clients retain the ability to move into Infinitely Virtual's Infrastructure as a Service Environment and take advantage of the same options as fully hosted customers. \nInfinitely Virtual's per-user pricing typically leads the industry, whatever the application or market segment. For Execupay, pricing is transparent and straightforward: from $50/employee user (fully hosted only); from $20/client login to Platinum Pay; and from $100 for Platinum Pay Express Portal. \nFor additional information on the company, visit www.infinitelyvirtual.com . \nAbout Infinitely Virtual \nInfinitely Virtual is a leading provider of high quality and affordable Cloud Server technology, capable of delivering services to any type of business, via terminal servers, SharePoint servers and SQL servers - all based on Cloud Servers.
