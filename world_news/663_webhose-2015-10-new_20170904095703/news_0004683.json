Edifecs participated in the August event focused on Structured Data Capture (SDC) and successfully demonstrated patient access to eligibility inquiries via a mobile device. Edifecs delivers interoperability to reduce the administrative costs of healthcare while improving patient engagement and timeliness of data. \nHL7 FHIR continues to offer more capabilities for the healthcare community. SDC is a new domain that the FHIR community is exploring with the potential to accelerate interoperability. Edifecs has focused on aspects of FHIR SDC that drive administrative simplification , maintain compliance with industry mandates such as Operating Rules while increasing patient engagement for both payers and providers including: Automation of manual processes. Streamlining the ability for providers to verify eligibility and for patients to understand the cost of healthcare. Extending existing electronic automation to the edge of the enterprise and of the healthcare ecosystem. Ensuring that data collected via web forms is governed by the same data validation rules as electronic processes reducing risk, increasing confidence in compliance activities and reducing infrastructure costs. Enabling patient engagement. Extending common queries and responses to mobile devices using the structured data capture profile enables organizations to accelerate mobile health programs, increase patient and member satisfaction and pilot new programs by extending automation processes. \nEdifecs demonstrated two major use-cases during the HL7 FHIR SDC Connectathon. During the first demonstration the team created an eligibility request form and populated it into the FHIR Server. In practice, this will allow a care coordinator to create a patient questionnaire and order procedures, and when loaded to the server the questionnaire is accessible for patients on a hosted web page. The second demonstration included the completion of an eligibility request form intended to receive medical coverage information from a payer. This process provides a patient access to a mobile HL7 FHIR SDC questionnaire where information about a procedure is submitted to a health plan, the health plan then has the ability to transform the FHIR JSON request to HIPAA 270 and send back a FHIR response via a mobile page that shows the corresponding coverage per each requested procedure. \n“Edifecs is an avid supporter of the HL7 FHIR initiative and developing interoperability standards industry-wide,” said Sunny Singh, president and CEO of Edifecs. “This technology offers a new standardized and efficient way to handle the back-end clinical, financial and administrative processes that will ultimately save the industry millions and improve healthcare data exchange among all trading partners.” View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151009005112/en/ Copyright © Business Wire 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:10:38.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
