Brands and agencies can more easily spot high performing page posts, for example, and amplify their reach by turning them into promoted or boosted posts. \nAccor, the world's leading hotel operator and market leader in Europe, uses Kenshoo to manage its search and social advertising and Hootsuite to manage organic social media. The new integration was designed for clients like Accor - data driven organizations who want to better understand how organic social media impacts the bottom line. \n\"The integration between Hootsuite and Kenshoo is invaluable in enabling us to track performance metrics about our organic and paid social campaigns in one place. From our initial trials, we can already see that it will help us pinpoint useful insights and learnings to refine and optimize our campaigns and improve their overall performance,\" said Romain Roulleau, senior vice president e-Commerce at Accor. \n\"The Hootsuite and Kenshoo integration bridges the gap between paid and organic social media to help marketers execute high-performing social media strategies,\" said Kevin Zellmer, vice president of corporate and business development at Hootsuite. \"Successful organic social media activity can inform and enhance paid social campaigns, and we're excited to provide these valuable insights for our customers.\" \nWith Hootsuite and Kenshoo, paid and owned social media marketing teams can collaborate in real-time, share insights about advertising and organic social content performance, and optimise the impact of paid campaigns. \n\"This integration allows marketers to follow a consumer's interactions with a brand via paid and owned social media as they move along the path to purchase. Brands and agencies can better evaluate campaign strategies and tactics, identify those that resonate most with target audiences on social media and use those insights to achieve better engagement, conversions and ROI,\" said Rob Coyne, managing director for EMEA at Kenshoo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:05:22.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
