Keeping these markets competitive is important,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.\n\"Today's decision demonstrates once again that cartelists cannot escape fines just by holding their meetings in cinemas and car parks outside Europe, while selling their products in Europe,\" she continued.
