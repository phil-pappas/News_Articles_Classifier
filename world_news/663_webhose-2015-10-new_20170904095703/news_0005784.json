InventionShare is now looking to license the technology.\nOttawa, Ontario, Canada (PRWEB) October 15, 2015\nGreg Waite, CEO of InventionShareTM, announced that new PowerWindingsTM transformer technology can now reduce the amount of heat and energy use associated with data centers, solving energy consumption issues.\nPowerWindings technology, transformers can be designed for reduced heat and power consumption while providing the same output. PowerWindings technology can also reduce the cost and weight of materials required in a transformer by up to 30% without sacrificing output.\nThe amount of power required to run CPUs, switches, backup devices and storage racks is off the charts and a continuous problem for the industry. All sorts of techniques are now used to keep these facilities running cool to avoid circuit, drive, component and CPU failure.\nMost data center owners are now, more than ever, concerned about energy consumption. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, data center electricity consumption is projected to increase to roughly 140 billion kilowatt-hours annually by 2020 - the equivalent annual output of 50 power plants - costing American businesses $13 billion in electricity bills and emitting nearly 100 million metric tons of carbon pollution per year.\n“A data center can eat up as much power as a large town or a small city, and you have to realize that these data centers and co-location server facilities are massive consumers of power and generate heat –and heat is the biggest threat for computer technology reliability,” said Mr. Waite.\nTransformers built with PowerWindings technology can provide higher output and greater efficiency with less heat and, therefore, less electricity. The savings can be used to run more equipment and further cool the facility. PowerWindings technology also allows for optimization of transformer technology for specific outcomes. For example, in cooler geographies where air exchange can be used for cooling, a company may opt for less material usage and smaller, lower-cost transformers without sacrificing efficiency. In warmer climates, a company may optimize transformers purely for temperature reduction with no material cost savings.\nMr. Waite believes that data center owners and corporations have become more sensitive to data center operating costs as electricity costs are increasing in most jurisdictions and equipment failures due to excess heat are costly.\nPowerWindings technology is now available for use in transformers of all kinds of applications including electronics, appliances, manufacturing, grid and industrial applications. InventionShare is now looking for partners interested in licensing and manufacturing transformers using PowerWindings technology.\nAbout InventionShare\nInventionShare provides inventors with funding, talent, expert processes to accelerate innovation, patent creation and monetization.
