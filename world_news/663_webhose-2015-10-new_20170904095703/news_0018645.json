Audi says the function will be extended worldwide over national Audi sites in the coming week. \nThe company says customers can also go to Audi dealers to check on their vehicles, and that a fix will be presented to authorities in October. \nAffected are some 2.1 million Audis with the 1.6 or 2 .0 liter TDI diesel motors with the designation EA 189 that are approved for the EU5 emissions standard.
