The Bureau of Reclamation this summer issued the results of a nearly three-year study that concluded that there will be significant shortfalls between water supply and demand on the Colorado River over the next 50 years. \nBut the scholars say in the letter that those conclusions \"may be insufficient to accommodate the full range of risks that lie ahead,\" the letter says. \nThe scholars who signed the letter include Robert Adler of the University of Utah law school; Victor Baker of the hydrology and water resources department at the University of Arizona; and Tim Barnett at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. \nOwen Lammers, executive director of Living Rivers and Colorado Riverkeeper, said the federal government needs to pursue a wider breadth of scientific projections to ensure it is prepared for all water flow scenarios. His group supports the scholars' efforts. \n\"We're hoping for the best when we should be preparing for the worst,\" Lammers said. \"We are really putting society at risk without looking at some of these scenarios.\" Smaller Colorado River projected for coming decades, study says December 23, 2012 \n(Phys.org)â€”Some 40 million people depend on the Colorado River Basin for water but warmer weather from rising greenhouse gas levels and a growing population may signal water shortages ahead.
