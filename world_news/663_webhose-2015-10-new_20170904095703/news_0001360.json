And, according to some tips provided by SolutionReach , which provides patient management technology options to many vision care practices across the country, there are at least five “fixable” things that can affect a practice’s patient reviews. \n1. Start worrying about wait times. Sometimes a long wait time is inevitable, but keep in mind that extended waits are usually the biggest complaint found in patient reviews. \nStarting with a long wait also tends to set the tone of a patient’s overall experience, making them especially critical about other things that wouldn’t usually bother them. If you’re in the habit of overbooking in case some patients don’t show up, stop. Keep a list at the front desk that estimates the typical length of time for various types of appointments. Send appointment reminder messages a couple of hours before they are scheduled to be seen. If a patient does have to wait longer than a few minutes, don’t ignore it. Acknowledge it with a sincere apology. \n2. Keep calm. When your office staff is running around like chickens with their heads cut off, patients end up feeling like just another obligation for the overwhelmed staff to worry about. \nOn the other hand, when patient receive attention and care without distraction they feel like the top priority—a huge win when it comes to patient experience. Don’t under-staff just to reduce overhead. Keep one person person dedicated to in-office patient engagement at all times. Last minute scrambles are obvious to your patients. Make sure everyone on staff is on the same page. Give your staff the tools they need to work efficiently and effectively. \n3. Understand the importance of a first impression. Though it might not feel like a top priority to you, the appeal of your waiting room has a large affect on a patient’s experience. Even if it meets sanitary standards, no one wants to spend time sitting in an unappealing office. Posters of eyeballs don’t count as decoration :) Get new carpet. Replace things like doorknobs and blinds. \nDon’t disregard the importance of investing in their comfort to improve patient experience, and—as an added benefit—it goes a long way to ease frustration when patients have to wait longer than they would prefer to. \n4. Remember that they’re listening. Just because a patient sits down doesn’t mean that they aren’t paying attention to what is going on behind the counter. In fact, without something to keep them busy, they often notice even more once they sit down. \nRemaining professional doesn’t mean you or the staff have to be stiff. Cheerful staff chitchat will actually make the office feel more inviting and comfortable. Just be sure to be aware of whether or not staff interactions are detracting from patient attention, and make sure the tones/topics of their discussions aren’t negative or potentially offensive. \n5. Let them complain. This is the kicker: if you don’t ask a disgruntled patient how they feel, they’ll give their opinion anyway. They just won’t be giving it to you! Have someone in charge of catching patients before they leave the office to ask how their experience was. Proactively request feedback by sending post-appointment surveys that let them tell you how their experience was. Post on the social media page for your practice with a Contact Us link and reiterate how much their feedback means to you. \nWhen you come across negative patient reviews, respond to them quickly in a positive, helpful manner. The best way to avoid a negative review is to address your patients’ complaints before they complain. More advice about practice experience solutions for ECPs is posted at SolutionReach .
