Intravenously injected EDV™ nanocells exit the leaky vascular system only within tumors and attach to cancer cells via a specially designed, targeted bi-specific antibody. Once attached, the nanocell is able to enter the tumor cell and deliver intracellularly a drug, siRNA, or miRNA payload. In parallel, the bacterial cell wall of the nanocells stimulates key components of the immune system, which are then activated to seek out and destroy cancer cells. \nAbout EnGeneIC EnGeneIC is an emerging biopharmaceutical company focused on developing its proprietary EDV™ nanocell platform for the targeted delivery of cancer therapeutic and other therapeutic molecules. The company's lead technology platform, EDV™ utilizes antibody-targeted, bacterially derived, non-living \"nanocells\" to release high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents, molecularly targeted drugs, and RNA-interference molecules directly into targeted tumor cells. In doing so, EDVTM nanocells enable current cancer treatments to be more potent and far less toxic, while also offering a potential new means for treating drug-resistant cancers. EnGeneIC is currently planning to undertake clinical trials in several cancer indications in Australia and USA . \nFor more information, please visit www.engeneic.com . \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:19:54.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
