We hope to start this week or next week,\" he told state television. \nDismantling the centrifuges, which enrich uranium, was part of a July 14 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, between Iran and six world powers. \nAs well as slashing the number of centrifuges at Natanz and Fordo to around 6,000, Iran will have to satisfy the IAEA that its Arak reactor cannot be used for military purposes. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:21:35.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
