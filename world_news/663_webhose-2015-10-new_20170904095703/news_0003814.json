Climate control and environmental monitoring of food products \n7PSolutions understands the requirements to protect the climate controlled food supply chain. Our unique GPS devices provide our clients with complete transparency and climate management from farm to consumer by sending real-time alarms when products are handled outside of predetermined tolerances. \nOur RouteWatchâ„¢ software platform also maintains a complete trip history tracking of: temperature; humidity; shock and vibration; air pressure; light exposure and 3D orientation. Security protocols and food-stuff monitoring \n7PSolutions offers comprehensive cargo security options with our covert and overt GPS devices, as well as software platform and security protocols. \nOur supply chain security capabilities are powered by the same system monitoring product integrity, RouteWatch. Proprietary technology platform this enables real-time transport video surveillance, linear geo-fencing, 24-hour, 365-day GPS tracking and monitoring, security alerts and alarms, redundancies, and cargo insurance reductions. Quality management system and food safety \n7PSolutions will work with your current transportation and logistics providers, as well as your security, quality and supply chain management teams to develop a customised and comprehensive cold chain food logistics solution, in addition to creating standard operating procedures to fit your products distribution, security, quality and compliance requirements. \nOur quality management system (QMS) includes proper temperature management, monitoring, cargo security, in-transit visibility, and internal and external audits. \nAllowing 7PS to perform food safety audits on your current climate control carriers will ensure they meet governmental regulations, as well as your company's requirements. Climate control for food supply chain in a web-based, secure system \nOur robust web-based software platform system allows clients to focus on their business. \nThere is no software required and all collected data is managed securely using our redundant server banks. Through secure user names and passwords, users are given access to the information they require to perform their particular job functions. \nThe Transportation Environmental Monitoring System (TEMS) is our client interfacing software module that allows clients to manage their climate control food supply chain. This is a first-of-its-kind intelligent solution using GPS and GSM communications to activate the required data within the platform, removing most of the human intervention. \nThe platform also provides security management service offerings using our vehicle and independent GPS tracking devices. The combination of RouteWatch and our GPS deliver the highest quality of food product shipment security by allowing our global command centre to watch your products, regardless of where they are in the world. \nRouteWatch allows us to provide intelligent security protocols using GPS real-time positioning and predetermined client tables. It is a sophisticated combination of hardware and software that provides our clients with a unique selection of service offerings internally and externally. \nOur hardware and software platforms are developed, tested and validated according to Good Automated Manufacturing Practices (GAMP5) standards. \nOur combined solutions provide our clients with return on investment (RoI) by improving shipment visibility, reducing product loss and labour, real-time event-based communications, and improving quality. The intelligence built into our platform removes most of the human intervention requirements from the process. Refrigerated shipping and in-transit climate controlled storage \n7PSolutions is committed to food safety and the food products industry, and provides compliant refrigerated shipping, in-transit climate controlled storage and cargo theft prevention using RouteWatch, TEMS and our GPS tracking solutions. \nOur solutions can be used to monitor vehicles, facilities and independent shipments, and are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each solution is tailored to meet each client's individual requirements. Although our clients have the same goal of food safety in mind, every client has different business processes and requirements that require flexible solutions we provide.
