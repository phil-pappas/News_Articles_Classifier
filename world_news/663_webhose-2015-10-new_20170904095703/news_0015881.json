Airbnb is vigorously fighting the measure, saying it would significantly reduce tax revenue, but proponents argue that Airbnb is hurting the availability and affordability of long-term rental space in the area.\nSome thought the ads were a hoax, but Airbnb admitted that it was behind the campaign and it has since apologized and removed the ads. Per a statement to SF Weekly, Airbnb said the intention of the ad campaign was to show the hotel tax contribution that hosts and guests make to San Francisco.\nWe apologize for Wednesday’s SF ads. They displayed poor judgment and do not live up to the values and humanity of our global community.\n— Airbnb (@Airbnb) October 22, 2015\nTrending on Facebook\nPolice warn if you get these in your trick-or-treat bag, they're not candy 9 times that Back to the Future totally predicted the future What killed man who bit another passenger on Aer Lingus flight?
