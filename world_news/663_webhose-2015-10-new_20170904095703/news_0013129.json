It offers double the pixel density of the Apple iPhone 6S Plus.\nSony Oceania managing director John Featherstone said the company’s three new smartphones had been designed to stand out by lasting “more than a day” and improving on the camera sensors it produced for rival phones.\nPrice wars .. the Xperia Z5 will cost $999 and the Compact $849. Source: News Corp Australia\n“Sony produces imaging sensors for a number of well-known brands,” Mr Featherstone said.\n“In fact, you probably have a Sony image sensor on you right now.”\nSony’s Xperia Z5 smartphones will also deliver a fingerprint scanner for the first time, adding it to the on button that protrudes from its right side, promises two days of battery life from its 2900mAh battery, and a day of use from a 45-minute charge.\nBut its camera will likely earn it the most attention, with a 24mm wide-angle lens and hybrid contrast and phase-detection autofocus that locks on to subjects in just 0.03 seconds.\nSony, which slipped out of the top five position in the Australian smartphone market according to Kantar Worldpanel, will face steep competition from leaders Samsung and Apple, however.\nApple’s recently released iPhone 6S uses a Sony image sensor to deliver 12-megapixel photographs, while Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 5 and S6 Edge+ cameras offer a Quick Launch feature that opens its 16-megapixel camera in seconds.\nSony could win consumers over on price, however. The Xperia Z5 will cost $999 and the Compact $849 at launch compared to the iPhone 6S’s entry price of $1079 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ at $1198.\nThe Sony Xperia Z5 Premium will demand a premium price at $1199, however, when it launches in November.\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://news-whistleout.s3.amazonaws.com/News_Deals_300px.html", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df7996a1302a497b973c632bfa0f2a1d", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/500401deafa3bdaba62b8f9bb256baa0", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:22:06.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
