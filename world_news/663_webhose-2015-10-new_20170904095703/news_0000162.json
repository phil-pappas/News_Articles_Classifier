Right? South African consumers have become far too accustomed with this way of thinking and fail to recognise the implications of living on credit. Credit was not designed to replace our salary packages. If however you run into a financially straining position; such as your car breaking down or an untimely illness, credit can alleviate the immediate financial demands. Always ensure that the credit you access is used for the right reasons and used responsibly. Applying for a loan or retail account to buy a fancy new TV is not a good idea.\nCan I afford the monthly commitments?\nThis is a fairly simple question, but an honest one. If you answer yes, with confidence knowing that you have completed your calculations, then proceed. However, if there is small voice within saying no, then stop all activity. This little voice is the voice of reason, the voice of caution and the most realistic self assessment we will ever have. If you choose to ignore the warning and throw all caution to the wind, you will act recklessly and place yourself in an over indebted position. The bottom line is that we are all responsible for the choices we make The time is now to man up to our circumstance and find a viable solution. Financial survival mode must be initiated. If you are having trouble with repaying your debts, seek assistance and help from a professional.\nHave I taken into account all options available to me?\nThe most convenient option is not always the most affordable option. What would your best alternative to credit be? Interesting question in itself don’t you think? Consumers are obsessed with immediate satisfaction and gratification. For example, doing some research on fees and charges billed is always a good idea. Find packages that are affordable and provide you with peace of mind. Alternatively look online for assistance with price checks. Buying items second hand can sometimes work out to be more affordable and practical. Always get the most out of your deals. If you have better or affordable option, walk away from your deal. Determine what your reservation price is and stick to it.\nHow do I avoid the debt trap?\nIf you are experiencing some form of financial strain, accessing more credit is not going to resolve your underlying problems. By accessing debt you are just adding to your worries and stress levels. Always make sure that your debt commitments do not exceed 50% of your nett income. Be aware of your total debt capital and push your surplus into this balance to bring it down. If need be, access professional advice and services to help advise and manage your financial plan. Create a savings/emergency fund to avoid future financial hiccups.\nWill this benefit my credit record?\nKeeping a healthy debt repayment pattern is crucial to your financial health. Always make monthly repayments on time and pay the full instalment required. Do not over expose your “pocket” as this can lead to missing payments and falling behind. As we mentioned earlier always determine first hand if you can afford the instalments. Listen to your better judgment.\nAuthor: Samantha Lotze", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:29:27.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
