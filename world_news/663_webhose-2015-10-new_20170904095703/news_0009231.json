However considering the racial nature that many of the discussions on all social media platforms soon descends to the topic is as relevant as ever.\nI’ll be referring to these two articles. So for those who are interested you should give these a read to situate my article.\nhttp://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanwpyle/this-teacher-taught-his-class-a-powerful-lesson-about-privil#.vnq5GwqoxW\nhttp://occupywallstreet.net/story/explaining-white-privilege-broke-white-person\nThe Buzzfeed article on privilege is very good at demonstrating the concept of privilege but notice that the article never refers to race. The Occupy Wall Street article refers directly to white privilege and was used as part of an argument by someone posting on the Facebook group “The Great Debate”. Now right here is where things start to get unhinged on our debate groups; my first reaction to any article claiming blanket white privilege is a basic “oh __ck off!”. I’ll bet that many of our black, coloured and Indian brethren have a similar response to anyone posting an article along the lines of “Get over Apartheid, it’s 20 years already” or other such articles. And why do we react that way? The answer is that all these kinds of statements generalise and in so doing make offensive assumptions about the group we’re having a go at. This is the problem we run into whenever we use race as the determining factor in our world view. If you ever want to see how deep the damage of apartheid goes you simply have to look at our debate groups. People can’t seem to stop defining themselves by the standards set by the National Party over 48 odd years. And as long as we continue to do that apartheid has the victory.\nSo back to the Occupy Wall Street article, why isn’t it relevant in our context? Simple really, we’re not the USA. White people aren’t in the majority in good old SA so unlike Gina Crosley-Corcoran I don’t experience waking up in a culture where I have things all nicely laid out for me. I live in a land where most state help goes to non-white people, where the state effectively reserves jobs for black people and leaves posts vacant rather than employ a white person, where the internet is filled with articles blaming white people for every ill in SA and where there are a variety of self-loathing white apologists who often write the most offensive and racially charged articles. I live in a land where well known politicians, including our current president, sing songs like “Kill the Boer” which is mainly directed at white people. Most of Gina Crosley-Corcoran’s points simply don’t apply to white people here in SA Some of her points apply to the new political elite in our country better than to white people.\nThat said on the whole the financial lot of white people is vastly better than that of the majority of black people, many of whom wake up to the daily grinding reality of extreme poverty. There is no denying that apartheid has much to do with our current situation and some form of restitution does need to be made. In such a reality of lack it is easy for our politician to maintain the racial divide by simply convincing many of these people that it’s all someone else’s fault. As they do that they’re polarising our nation more and more and many of our black brethren rightly feel much betrayed by this democracy. Unfortunately they often fail to perceive who the real betrayers are.\nKeeping the above in mind and understanding that there will never be a world where we don’t see race I’d like to offer an alternative way of doing things in SA that is more helpful and avoids the requirement for highly charged racial definition.\nLet me use the Buzzfeed example again. If each group in class were given a turn to sit in the front and take their shot you’d have a fair system. Lets populate the class apartheid style, white people at the front and black people at the back. If we simply rotated them in turn we’d have a fair system but life doesn’t work that way. You can’t rotate the people from the back to the front because they didn’t get the appropriate education at the back of the class. So when the next class comes in and we switch it round so the black people are at the front that seems fair right? Wrong! What does the next class have to do with the previous one? Those at the back of the previous class are still disadvantaged. Fixing the next class doesn’t help. And those now at the back of the new class are simply disadvantaged. All that’s happened is that we’ve had two unfair classes. This is what our current situation in SA is like.\nSo how do we get around this? We use financial wellbeing as the yardstick. Those who come from an environment of financial lack get preferable assistance to those who come from a background of financial plenty. Why would this work? Well for a few reasons really:\n1. Those who have financial clout behind them have resources to get a proper education so they won’t suffer disadvantage.\n2. Those who have financial lack get assisted regardless of their race. So no unhappy racial groups.\n3. The historic inequalities still get addressed because apartheid historically disadvantaged black people so they form the majority of those in financial lack.\n4. We stop dividing ourselves along apartheid lines and have a shot at building a true rainbow nation.\nSo to conclude, we need a better way of doing things here in SA if we’re ever going to overcome our past and build trust.", "external_links": ["http://occupywallstreet.net/story/explaining-white-privilege-broke-white-person", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanwpyle/this-teacher-taught-his-class-a-powerful-lesson-about-privil#.vnq5GwqoxW"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:06:18.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
