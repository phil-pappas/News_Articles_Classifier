And then Gionee comes along with an interesting feature in its 2015 flagship: Lossless zoom.\nGionee’s latest device – the Elife E8 – has special lens technology that zooms in and out to upto 3X of the original image size, while maintaining the same image quality. Most cameras cause some degree of pixilation, leading to hazy, unclear images, but the E8 is one of the few devices that seems to have overcome this problem. The device also features a phase detect auto focus capability to ensure that the camera focuses faster on the scene you wish to shoot. The E8, with its 24 MP rear camera with dual LED flash, comes with an auto mode selector which dynamically selects the best image mode, depending on the background, lighting and other parameters.\nThe E8 is powered by an Octa-core 2 GHz processor, with 64 GB memory and 3 GB RAM. The 6 inch device comes with 4K video recording and an AMOLED screen that can display 16M colours. At the heart of it is a 3520 mAh battery.\nGionee seems to have joined the bandwagon of devices that include fingerprint sensors in their smart phones. The E8 comes with a round sensor at the back that claims a success rate of more than 99% and identification time of less than 500 milliseconds. The sensor is aesthetically nestled below the camera lens and makes for easy handling.\nThe E8 is tastefully designed, with a handpicked list of features that make it one of the better phones to be launched in time for the festive season. With the added intricacies around image technology, we feel the E8 is a good premium buy at Rs. 34,999. It is available through Snapdeal.\n latest Mobiles and tabs Gionee Also Read Transcend releases JetFlash 880 USB 3.0 flash drive for on-the-go storage An app to plan your evenings better 10 must-have apps for health and fitness Witches and thrones: Indian animators cash in on special effects boom", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Gionee%20elife8.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151019/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/gionee-elife-e8-review-zoom-baraabar-zoom", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Gionee%20elife%208_%20alternate.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Gionee%20elife%208_%20alternate.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:51:42.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
