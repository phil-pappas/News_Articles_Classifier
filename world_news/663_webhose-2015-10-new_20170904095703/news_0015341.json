If only there was an easier way, and before long there might be. A team of researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands has created a 3D printed tooth that kills the bacteria living in your mouth, thus preventing tooth decay. \nThe key to the bacteria-murdering tooth is a new type of dental polymer that has been infused with quaternary ammonium salts. These salts have antimicrobial properties that can effectively clear bacteria from a sample in the lab. They are positively charged, which causes disruptions in the negatively charged membranes of bacteria. Bacteria can’t survive with a ruptured cell membrane — it’s a bit like popping a balloon. \nPresumably, you’d just have one antimicrobial resin tooth in your head that could protect all your others from plaque buildup. Since this is a physical disruption of membrane and not a biochemical reaction (eg. antibiotics), there shouldn’t be an issue with the development of resistant organisms. \nTo test the tooth, researchers applied a mixture of human saliva and Streptococcus mutans , which is one of the species responsible for tooth decay. The tooth effectively sterilized the saliva , but there’s still more testing to be done. Researchers first have to make sure the new resin is durable enough to be used as a tooth, but they also plan to look into repurposing it as a component of retainers or toothpaste. \nFuture applications of the technology might focus on medical implants, which can sometimes play host to dangerous bacterial biofilms that are resistant to antibiotics. A bit of the antimicrobial resin might be an effective way to ward off bacterial colonization.
