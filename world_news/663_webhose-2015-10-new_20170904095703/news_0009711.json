The apheresis market, by procedure, is mainly segmented into apheresis/automated blood collection and therapeutic apheresis. In 2014, the automated blood collection segment accounted for the largest share of approximately 77.2% of the apheresis market, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7% during the forecast period. Growth in this segment is mainly attributed to the increasing severity of blood shortage and growing concern regarding blood safety, and increasing incidences of blood disorders and chronic diseases. \nOn the basis of applications, the apheresis market is segmented into plasmapheresis, plateletpheresis, erythrocytapheresis, leukapheresis, LDL apheresis, and others (photopheresis, lymphapheresis, and extracorporeal immunoadsorption). The plasmapheresis segment accounted for the largest share-46.5%-of the global apheresis market in 2014. The large share of plasmapheresis is attributed to the increasing demand of source plasma for transfusion from hospitals and for fractionation from biopharmaceutical companies. \nIn 2014, North America commanded the largest share of the global apheresis market, followed by Europe , Asia-Pacific , Latin America , and the Middle East and Africa . North America accounted for the largest share of 47.8% of global apheresis market in 2014. The U.S. is a prime market due to the easy access to advanced apheresis devices through well-established distribution channels, increased collection of source plasma, and increasing incidences of blood disorders and chronic diseases. On the other hand, Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing region in the global apheresis market, mainly driven by the increasing demand of blood components for the treatment of the large patient population, increased spending capabilities of consumers on healthcare, improving healthcare infrastructure in the region, and increasing investments by leading players and respective government agencies in the region. \nCompanies profiled in this apheresis market research cover Haemonetics Corporation (U.S.), Fresenius Medical Care ( Germany ), Terumo BCT, Inc. (U.S.), Asahi Kasei Medical Co., Ltd. ( Japan ), Kawasumi Laboratories Inc. ( Japan ), Cerus Corporation (U.S.), B. Braun Melsungen AG ( Germany ), HemaCare Corporation (U.S.), Medica S.p.A. ( Italy ), Kaneka Corporation ( Japan ), Nikkiso Co., Ltd. ( Japan ) and Therakos, Inc. (U.S.).
