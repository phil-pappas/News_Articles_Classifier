With Priya, no one even knows she’s wearing it. The self-inserted sensor is the most discreet, precise, effortless method for women to pinpoint their fertile window without having to actively engage in data collection. \nIdentifying a woman’s fertile window is key to successful pregnancy, however surprising statistics published by the International Journal of Advanced Nursing show that only 13% of women could correctly identify the specific days of menstrual cycle that they are most fertile and could become pregnant. This golden time happens two days prior to ovulation, signaled by a small dip in core body temperature, which can only be detected by a highly accurate sensor like Priya. \n“Our personal sensor combines rigorous science with cutting-edge technology to quantify the body’s most important physiologic parameter,” explains Dr. Lauren Costantini, Ph.D., Prima-Temp’s CEO. “Priya will allow women to take charge of their fertility with less effort and greater confidence.” \nPriya will be offered to a limited number of women in the United States to be the first to gain access to Priya at a discounted price. The launch by Prima-Temp will be unveiled on IndieGoGo at http://igg.me/at/PRIYA-Ring on October 1st. This is a limited offering for those enthusiastic followers who have been asking for the most effortless, discreet and precise system to identify that fertility window two days before it can be signaled by other methods. \nPrima-Temp is a female-led company that has raised over $3 million in funding, established a world-class leadership and development team, received two issued patents and has garnered worldwide attention including SXSW awards and the mHealth Summit Venture Pitch award. The innovative technology behind Priya has been in development for 5 years, and proven safe as an FDA-regulated product. \nPriya: effortless, discreet, precise. \nAbout Prima-Temp \nPrima-Temp brings new, innovative approaches to many of today’s healthcare challenges through the application of 21 st century thermometry. Prima-Temp’s continuous temperature sensors and associated software allow the most precise method to measure true core body temperature, with the potential to address a multitude of applications.
