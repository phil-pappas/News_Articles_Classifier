We will begin evacuation when there is an instruction from the government,\" navy spokesman Muhammad Zainuddin told AFP. \n- 'Extraordinary crime' - \nThe government has deployed around 30 aircraft to fight the fires and for cloud seeding with 22,000 troops on the ground to combat the blazes. \nIndonesian disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the fires had killed 10 people so far, some fighting the blazes while others died of respiratory illnesses or medical conditions exacerbated by the pollution. \n\"The impact of the forest fires has caused 10 people in Sumatra and Kalimantan to die, directly and indirectly,\" Nugroho said. \nThe figure did not include seven hikers killed in a wildfire on Java last week. \nThe agency estimated at least half a million people have suffered from respiratory illness since the fires started in July and 43 million people have been affected in the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. \nNugroho said the figure was likely just the tip of the iceberg because many people did not go to health facilities for treatment. \nMore than 1.7 million hectares (4.2 million acres) of land has been burned and six provinces severely affected by the haze, according to Indonesia's forestry ministry. \n\"This is due to human acts because 99 percent of forest fires were started deliberately. This is an extraordinary crime against humanity,\" Nugroho said. \nOther countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and Japan have sent assistance to help Indonesia fighting the forest fires. \nWith Malaysia, Singapore and parts of Thailand already affected, the Philippines Friday said the haze had now spread there, disrupting air traffic and prompting warnings for residents to wear face masks. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:58:52.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
