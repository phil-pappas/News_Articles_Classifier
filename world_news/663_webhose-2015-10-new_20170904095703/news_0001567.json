The integration empowers online merchants to sell products directly to their followers on a customized shopping page through their store’s Instagram profile.\nSocial selling is a hot new retailing trend, allowing consumers to not only have conversations and connect with a brand’s social media accounts, but to now also make purchases on sites like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest. With Springbot already at the forefront of tracking revenue attribution for merchants on Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter, integrating with Instagram was a natural progression for the eCommerce marketing platform.\nAt the core of Springbot’s Instagram integration for Magento and Shopify stores is the merchant’s ability to quickly create and brand their Instagram shopping page with a customized shopping gallery instantly — without any knowledge of HTML or hours of coding. In three easy steps, eCommerce merchants can publish a customized link to their profile, encourage customers to shop among featured products, and convert product page visits to sales – all from Instagram.\n“With over 27% of the total US population on Instagram and its dominate popularity with millennials, it is a critical social platform for online retailers to stay top of mind with consumers in order to drive revenue,” said Brooks Robinson, co-founder and CEO of Springbot. “Smart commerce marketers are utilizing real-time data to know which products are generating the most social shares and sales, and how to simplify the shopping process to drive online conversions by understanding where to invest marketing dollars.”\nAdditional Springbot Instagram features include the ability to allow online stores to send followers automated email reminders to visit their site later. With Springbot’s tracking tools, online merchants can identify hot-selling products and track the sales and revenue generated from Instagram.\nSpringbot combines marketing tools, content, demographic, social and purchase history data into one streamlined dashboard to help marketers make informed marketing decisions based on real-time data.
