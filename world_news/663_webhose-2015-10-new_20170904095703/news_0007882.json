The company's proprietary RISE student success coaching model then uses the data to help advisers personalize their outreach strategies. \nIn addition, Helix teaches institutions how to manage its retention services on their own, so that schools can move the services back in-house over time. \n\"Helix allows us to take retention to a much higher level, putting a proactive, personal touch on all outreach,\" said Ed Schrader, president at Brenau University , in a press release. \"By layering success coaching on top of the retention technology, we are developing a powerful resource to keep our students connected. We know how they are doing so we can be more hands-on when offering support, and they know they have someone to reach out to if they are struggling.\" \nThere are no up-front costs for the Retention-as-a-Service program â€” institutions pay based the incremental gain in retention rates that they achieve.
