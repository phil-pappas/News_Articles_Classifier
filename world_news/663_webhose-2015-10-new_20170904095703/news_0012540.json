As American Structurepoint scaled their Citrix environment across their remote locations, their IT Director discovered that the monitoring solution in use, SolarWinds, was unable to gather sufficient data from the network, needed to troubleshoot and resolve performance issues before end users were affected.\n“If we can’t see what’s happening at any infrastructure level, we are in big trouble, because we would just be guessing at the root cause of a specific issue. To us, Goliath Technologies’ key value is pulling metrics for Citrix XenApp/XenDesktop, End User Experience, NVIDIA GRID vGPU and the supporting IT infrastructure into a single console, so we have broad and deep visibility to preempt potential issues and if they do occur, troubleshoot quickly” said, Adam Martin, IT Director for American Structurepoint.\nIMSCAD , a Citrix Partner and leader in Graphics Virtualization, recommended American Structurepoint utilize a 30-day free trial of Goliath Performance Monitor to test the technology’s ability to get metrics fro\nm XenDesktop, vGPU, XenServer, and the physical infrastructure in order to ensure a positive end user experience.\n“We are grateful to IMSCAD for their recommendation and happy that American Structure point chose our technology to proactively monitor and manage their Citrix and NVIDIA GRID vGPU environment.” said Thomas Charlton, Chairman and CEO of Goliath Technologies.\nRead more about why American Structurepoint chose Goliath Technologies on the Goliath blog .\nAbout Goliath Technologies\nGoliath Technologies provides proactive IT Operations software for IT organizations that address the evolving challenges of deploying virtual server and virtual desktop infrastructure whether on premise or in the cloud.
