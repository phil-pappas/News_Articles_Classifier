There was an 80% chance of favorable weather for a Saturday launch in the event of a scrub on Friday, but that has been downgraded to 60%.\nUSA TODAY\nNational Guard activates ahead of Hurricane Joaquin\nNinety-three million miles away, a sunspot is also causing concerns as it continues to retain enough energy for an X-Class solar flare. NASA defines an X-Class flare as the largest and most powerful type.\nThe sunspot happens to be in an ideal location — if a flare does occur, it's likely that it would be directed at Earth. The solar flare issue is present both Friday and Saturday.\nThis will be ULA's 100th mission since the joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin was formed in 2006.\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RjtrGM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/984d6e5f9f0a386806f84ca5570ee7910531b789/c=0-1040-2845-3179&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/27/Brevard/Brevard/635789790313329754-ULA-S-TONY-SOTO-ATLAS-LAUNCH-CR-32711.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc0937862a217af33f2702dadc63da97a8732b1a/c=67-0-468-401/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793429617961171-national-guard.jpg", "http://on.flatoday.com/1FIfwJ6", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RjtrGM&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/27/Brevard/Brevard/635789790313329754-ULA-S-TONY-SOTO-ATLAS-LAUNCH-CR-32711.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58b367d0521c8a720f5a2c604ed8dd53f70ffa57/r=344x400/local/-/media/2015/09/27/Brevard/Brevard/635789790313329754-ULA-S-TONY-SOTO-ATLAS-LAUNCH-CR-32711.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RjtrGM", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RjtrGM&text=Hurricane%20Joaquin%20may%20impact%20Friday%20Atlas%20V%20launch&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:56:12.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
