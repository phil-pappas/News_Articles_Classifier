Using Cloudyn’s enhanced functionality, enterprise companies can now streamline their multi-cloud deployments for growth while SmartSizing their cloud resources for maximum control and operational performance. The company will be demonstrating its award-winning SaaS-based solution at AWS re:Invent 2015 in booth #635.\nOrganizations planning to expand their cloud usage should, as a primary measure, ensure they have control, governance and the ability to identify their true utilization and cost to seamlessly scale purpose-built cloud resources.\nWhen it comes to SmartSizing cloud deployments, Cloudyn breaks the mold. The typical approach seeks to right-size deployments but falls short because this only measures performance metrics around instances—not the underlying workloads. Cloudyn’s approach, on the other hand, optimizes the performance at the architectural layer of a company’s applications and workloads. Cloudyn’s new capabilities go further with:\n Recommendations for downsizing and upsizing Performance and cost optimization Accessing workload type and usage scenarios Optimal deployment utilization Ensuring cloud is set for growth\n“Until now, the standard practice for managing cloud deployments has been to right-size cloud resources focused around individual instances. Cloudyn’s new functionality enables our customers to smartsize their cloud deployments, streamlining all of their global cloud resources, using a single console,” stated Sharon Wagner, Cloudyn’s co-founder and CEO. “These new platform enhancements underscore our commitment to help customers maximize performance, and agility while helping them align their operations for ‘responsible cloud growth’.”\nEfficient Cloud Growth Management\nFor the first time, Cloudyn enables companies to efficiently manage all of their public and private cloud assets and services through a single interface. This is achieved by employing Cloudyn's unique cost model for private cloud, which derives the on-demand rates of private cloud assets, then applies them to usage, just like in the public cloud. This holistic framework simplifies cloud management for DevOps, IT managers and developers, enabling cloud usage, costs and performance to be managed as a single task—regardless of the number or characteristics of the clouds. In addition, Cloudyn’s unique prescriptive porting recommends the optimal mix of private and public clouds, based on performance and costs, and continuously monitors deployments to identify performance inefficiencies and enable smart assessment of scalability needs.\nFollowing are highlights of Cloudyn’s new platform enhancements:\n One single, powerful console to monitor and manage across all clouds Comprehensive visibility and in-depth monitoring of usage, cost and performance Map cloud costs to business activities for accurate cost allocations and chargebacks Optimize reserved instances across all global cloud resources Role-based views and access for enforcing cloud accountability Hybrid cloud porting analysis and recommendations Rich, multi-dimensional reporting\nLimited Time Special Promotion\nFor attendees of AWS re:Invent, Cloudyn is running a special offer of its solution for 30 days as well as a free GoPro HD camera. Eligibility for the GoPro HD Camera requires a $1 million cloud spend or higher as well as completion of a trial registration in advance.
