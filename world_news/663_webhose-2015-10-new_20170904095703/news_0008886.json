The development phase is under way and construction work is scheduled to start in second half of 2016. \nYohann Bénard, Oil & Gas General Manager of Alcatel-Lucent Submarine Networks, said: “After connecting Angola to the global network through several undersea cables, ASN is pleased to further contribute to the development of the Angolan fiber optical infrastructure. This award is a prime illustration that submarine fiber-optic technology is becoming the standard telecommunication medium for offshore assets. It further demonstrates our leadership in the platform connectivity market, which is one of the priorities of ASN’s industrial plan to diversify into the oil and gas sector.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:26:47.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
