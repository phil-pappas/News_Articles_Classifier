These power systems consist of a set of individual systems such as converters, distribution systems, controllers, and backup systems, which hold different technical specifications. The main applications of these systems can be found in wireless and fixed-line environments. They are used for other applications such as network equipment, xDSL terminal, mobile broadband, cellular, and transmission. Most telecom operators use DC power supply systems for cellular applications as they are reliable, safe, and easy to integrate with battery backup systems.\nAnalysts forecast the global telecom power systems market to grow at a CAGR of 7.01% over the period 2014-2019.\nGET REPORT DETAILS @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/reports/global-telecom-power-systems-market-2015-2019\nCovered in this report\nThe report covers the current scenario and the growth prospects of the global telecom power systems market for the period of 2015-2019.
