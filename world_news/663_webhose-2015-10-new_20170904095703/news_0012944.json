The investment will take place “over the coming years,” Intel said without offering further details.\nIntel, which gets the majority of its sales from processors, has a joint-venture with Micron Technology Inc. to produce memory chips -- called NAND flash -- that store data in mobile devices and increasingly in computers. By shifting computing from its reliance on magnetic disks to semiconductors for storage, Intel is trying to speed up data access and make laptops, servers and desktops more responsive.\nIn its most recent quarter, Intel said demand for memory chips helped offset weaker demand for personal-computer processors.\nIntel shares were little changed at $33.65 at 1:21 p.m. New York time.
