As of the 2016 school year, Edify's mathematics textbooks and workbooks by David Barton will be introduced as a unified, interactive product designed to engage students and teachers alike. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278087LOGO \n\"We are proud that Edify chose PageWerkz to transform David Barton's award-winning mathematics series, and we are excited to bring our industry-leading educational technology to new markets around the world,\" said Werkz Publishing CEO Mark Salata, PhD. \"PageWerkz-powered apps place content in a simple-to-use format that is similar to an eBook, but with more interactive functionality. Our eWorkbook design offers a dynamic digital experience and internalized learning management system. This enables students to check their own work and submit answers to teachers, and allows instructors to grade assignments and provide feedback seamlessly from within the app.\" \nEdify selected PageWerkz for the digital launch of its mathematics series based on the eLearning platform's powerful capabilities, ease of use, and exceptional design, which surpasses digital offerings from other providers. PageWerkz features an array of embedded tools that allow writing, drawing, graphing, self-check assessments, and submissions. \nAnother factor that made PageWerkz a compelling choice for Edify is the ability to synchronize users' work across all major tablet and computer platforms, including iPad and Android tablets as well as PC and Mac computers and laptops. With a PageWerkz-powered app made specifically for each of these devices, users benefit from optimal function, greater efficiency, and enhanced security. \n\"Edify is thrilled to be able to bring educational content alive for learners and teachers in New Zealand,\" said Adrian Keane, CEO of Edify Limited. \"The current array of PDF-based iterations of publishers' content is simply not dynamic enough for the 21st century learner. Converting our textbooks and workbooks to the PageWerkz eLearning platform is a major step forward, and we are confident it will yield measurable improvements in both engagement and student performance in secondary schools that adopt this content.\" \nFor more information on Edify and its school resources, visit http://www.edify.co.nz/ .
