But a new British outfit has a different shape in mind for the towable living module. Go Barefoot molds the camping trailer into a more three-dimensional, egg-like shape in its Barefoot caravan. The immediately cool, indisputably classic trailer packs an interior that's cozy enough for a baby chick. \nThe Go Barefoot team originally set out to create a design with classic retro appeal that would be at the same time chic and distinct. We'd say they nailed it – a quick glance mistakes it for a traditional teardrop, but the second look reveals a more oval shape and rounded, sculpted sides. It combines the dramatic roof arch of a flat-sided teardrop with the 3-D pop of a rounded box trailer, like the Boler or Scamp or the newer Nest and Happier Camper HC1 caravans. It comes off more egg-like than the EggCamper itself, though maybe not quite so much as the Ecocapsule . \nThe Barefoot's distinctive fiberglass shell is a single piece (roof and sides) laminated to the wood floor with more fiberglass. Go Barefoot uses a gel coat to finish the body in the buyer's choice of color. \nTurning that curvy body shell into a functional interior wasn't an easy task, and the team spent a total of four years on the design. \"Now we understand why most caravans are square,\" Go Barefoot declares on its website. \nGo Barefoot's managing director Cathy Chamberlain tells us that the company was keen to keep the interior curves. Those curves, of course, cut in on headroom, particularly in the already small bathroom, so working around them took some extra configuration work, including dropping the shower tray down below the floor to give shower users enough height. In the end, Go Barefoot succeeded in creating a floor plan that it believes offers an optimal amount of living and storage space, calling the design a \"tardis\". Speaking of, the Barefoot packs a full suite of living amenities: bathroom, kitchen, \nconvertible sofa-bed and plenty of cupboard space. It sleeps two (or three very close friends) on the 6 x 6-foot (1.8 x 1.8-m) bed that converts from the L-shaped seating. The kitchen unit includes a two-burner Thetford gas cooktop and sink below a glass top and a 65L Isotherm marine-style compressor fridge. The oak-top wall cabinet across from the kitchen provides some counter space. While small and curvy, the bathroom includes all the fixins: Dometic cassette toilet, sink, shower, cupboard and mirror. \nThe Barefoot also offers the utilities needed to keep things comfortable inside. Its Truma Combi 4E heating and hot water system (30 L fresh water tank) keeps the temperature up and works on either gas or electric. The 110 Ah battery powers the interior lighting; 12 V socket; heater; toilet flush; and refrigerator. There's also a Roberts Revival digital radio, which comes in the buyer's choice of color. \nThe Barefoot's body shell measures 12.5 x 6.2 x 7.9 feet (3.8 x 1.9 x 2.4-m, L x W x H), and the caravan stretches 16.7 feet (5.1 m) when including the tongue. It weighs 2,006 lb (910 kg) and has a user payload of 308 lb (140 kg). It rides on galvanized steel chassis and 13-in alloy wheels. \nGo Barefoot launched its caravan last month, and is now selling it in the UK for a base price of £21,950, which includes VAT (approx. US$33,600). It's fitted by motorhome manufacturer Auto-Sleepers and comes with a two-year manufacturer's warranty. The buyer picks out options like exterior and interior colors, upholstery and curtains. Go Barefoot plans to expand to mainland Europe and the US next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:16:40.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
