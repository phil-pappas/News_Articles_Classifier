Copyright facilitates innovation rather than hinders it.”\nThe research also found subscriptions to streaming services had grown by six per cent from 26 per cent in 2014 to 32 per cent in 2015.\nA third (33 per cent) of respondents said they took advantage of a free trial, with 66 per cent saying they intended to take up a paid service in future.\nNetflix reportedly has around one million subscribers, while Fairfax and Nine Entertainment Co’s online streaming joint venture Stan has about 153,000 paying subscribers and Foxtel’s Presto service had about 80,000 subscribers, The Australian reported.\nOf those who claimed to be pirating less frequently, a third (33 per cent) said legal alternatives such as streaming services like Netflix were the main reason, while 21 per cent said they felt bad.\n16 per cent said they were worried about being caught or getting a virus and 13 per cent said they no longer had the time.\nMs Flekser said education played an important role in the fight against copyright theft.\nThe report found those who had pirated were far more likely than those who have never pirated to be aware of the Copyright Amendment Bill 2015 (43 per cent vs 24 per cent), the Dallas Buyers Club litigation (51 per cent vs 42 per cent) and the proposed notification scheme (48 per cent vs 32 per cent).\n“IP Awareness focuses a lot of effort on creating consumer campaigns and free online resources to teach primary and secondary students about the value of content, the role of copyright and the impact of piracy,” Ms Flesker said.\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["http://news-whistleout.s3.amazonaws.com/News_Deals_300px.html", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/179fd1c3cf34ba959e95ffcfbe4fffbe", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/netflix-no-panacea-to-piracy-ipaf/story-e6frgakx-1227566545891", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ad4d5f1333fce422769a0ad119835677", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:40:49.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
