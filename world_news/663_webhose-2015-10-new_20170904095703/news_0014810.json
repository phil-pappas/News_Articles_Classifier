He was cold as ice to me. Am I losing my touch? When I was young I used to get out of tickets with a warning, using a lot of charm, eyelash batting and sexy innuendo. At one point the ice king just looked at me and said, \"Cut it out.\" I knew what he was talking about, so I just heaved a sigh and said, \"You’re no fun,\" and accepted the ticket.\nAt what point does a woman’s charm become invisible? I’m more upset by feeling unattractive at 41, than at having to pay the ticket. What happened to all the playfulness between the sexes?\n— It’s No Fun Anymore, Winnipeg\nDear No Fun: Getting a ticket instead of a warning for doing something dangerous in traffic is not a judgement on your attractiveness. In fact, you’re harassing someone who’s doing a job. From now on, do what the policeman says and \"cut it out.\" You earn a ticket, you answer the questions, listen to the lecture and move on — slowly.\nIf you want to play a form of \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?\" do it with a lover who thinks you’re hot, not a policeman working his beat, who may be thinking you’re annoying before he even talks to you.\nPlease send your questions and comments to lovecoach@hotmail.com or Miss Lonelyhearts c/o the Winnipeg Free Press, 1355 Mountain Ave. Winnipeg, MB, R2X 3B6\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:38:29.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
