The event was organized by NJMEP and NJBIZ. Scott Maurer, President of OPEX International, accepted the award on behalf of the company. Earlier in the day, Mr. Maurer participated as a panelist in a session titled, “Case Studies: Manufacturing in NJ - Challenges and Opportunities.” \n“OPEX Corporation is grateful to receive the Manufacturer of the Year award in celebration of this year’s National Manufacturing Day,” stated Dave Stevens, President and CEO of OPEX. “It is indeed very satisfying to be recognized for ‘demonstrating excellence in the manufacturing industry’ and it is a wonderful tribute to the dedication and hard work of hundreds of OPEX employees around the world.” \nWhile many companies have outsourced their manufacturing operations, OPEX continues to demonstrate its commitment to not only retain, but expand its skilled manufacturing facilities within the State of New Jersey. “In January of this year, OPEX opened a state-of-the-art 42,000 square foot metal fabricating plant in Pennsauken Township, just down the road from our 25-acre campus in Moorestown,” said Dave Stevens. “With the many design, production, ergonomic and sustainable systems built into our new facility, this new metalworking shop presents a model for more efficient manufacturing.” \nOPEX Corporation is also a standout New Jersey manufacturer due to its net-zero manufacturing complex. Since April 2012, OPEX has derived 100% of the electrical energy needed to operate its 250,000 square foot manufacturing, distribution, and administrative complex located in Moorestown, New Jersey, from a 2.77 megawatt (MW) solar array – the largest installation by a privately-held company in the State of New Jersey at the time. In addition to the extensive solar array, OPEX has implemented many other ”green” improvements that include lighting retrofits, roofing improvements, HVAC automation and recycling, just to name a few. \nThis year, OPEX celebrates its 40th anniversary as a leading New Jersey manufacturer. While the 21st century has provided OPEX with fresh challenges, the arrival of innovative new technologies has allowed the company to significantly expand its product offerings and services to meet the demands of a changing marketplace. \nThe recent release of Falcon, OPEX’s newest high-speed document scanning workstation, and Perfect Pick, the unique robotic goods-to-person picking technology for order fulfillment, are just two examples of the technological innovation, product quality, and unmatched customer service and support that has made OPEX Corporation a successful manufacturer in the State of New Jersey for the last 40 years. \nAbout OPEX Corporation OPEX Corporation is a recognized global technology leader in high-speed mailroom automation, document imaging and material handling.
