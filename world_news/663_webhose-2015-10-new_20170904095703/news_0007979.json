This marks the second successive year the company has been honored and ranked with industry giants such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.\nEric Schumacher-Rasmussen of Streaming Media Magazine said, “These are the 100 companies charting the future during a time of transaction. This year’s Streaming Media 100 shows an industry that’s come into its own, one that some might even say has reached maturity.”\nSchumacher-Rasmussen continued, “That’s not to say it’s stagnant. The 2015 list is significantly different than last year’s, but only by 15 companies. Compare that to 2014, which featured 24 companies that weren’t on the 2013 list. This year, we decided to focus exclusively on vendors in the online video space, companies that offer products, services, and technologies that enable end users (or other vendors) to contribute to the unstoppable growth of multiplatform, multiscreen, multidevice video delivered via the internet.”\nAccording to Roger Bieri, General Manager of Osprey Video, “For nearly 20 years, Osprey Video Technology has set the industry standard for high-quality, reliable streaming performance. This recognition two years in a row means so much to our company, but even more important is continuing our tradition of developing and delivering professional-quality capture cards even as we expand our product portfolio and also our customer base.”\nKnown for setting the standard in producing the finest video capture experience for its customers, the company launched a host of new products in 2015, including the Osprey 815e single channel HD/SDI card as well as the dual-channel HDMI card, the Osprey 821e. The additional lineup of the Osprey 811e HDMI single channel card and827e high definition card offered enhanced performance and flexibility across platforms. The company also debuted its new Osprey Black product line of converters and peripherals with the release of three distribution amplifiers in July, introduced its Talon hardware encoder at IBC2015, and has released new products, including the Osprey SSR-42R reclocking switcher, for the fourth quarter of the year.\nAbout Osprey Video\nOsprey video capture cards are used in mission-critical applications throughout the world and are known for legendary quality and performance.
