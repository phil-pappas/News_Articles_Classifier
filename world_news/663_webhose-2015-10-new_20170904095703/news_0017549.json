Thirty years later, the company has grown into an industry powerhouse, providing association management companies with accounting, management and automation tools to make managing community associations easier.\nBut if TOPS Software’s president Michael Hardy has learned anything from the company’s storied history, it’s that the company cannot afford to rest on past success.\n“When TOPS was started 30 years ago, my father revolutionized the way community association management was done, with a software designed to match the needs of the industry. In that same spirit, we are building TOPS [ONE] to revolutionize the industry for the next 30 years. With TOPS [ONE], we aim to not only adapt with the industry, but to redefine how work gets done.”\nTOPS [ONE] is a web-based community association management application built on the same principles that have guided the company and the products through the years, on a modern platform. TOPS [ONE] is designed to help management companies stay more competitive through customer relationship management, efficiency, automation, integration, mobile readiness, and more.\nTOPS [ONE] is still in development, although a minimum viable product has already been produced, and several prominent industry veterans have begun to put it through its paces, with highly positive feedback.\nTOPS Software plans to showcase TOPS [ONE] at the 2016 CAMfire Conference, an industry conference sponsored by the company. The CAMfire Conference will be held February 3-5 in Orlando, Florida.
