Therefore, device-based patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure procedures are most commonly performed using atrial septal defect (ASD) closure devices being used off-label. Despite the lack of FDA approval, PFO closure remains popular due to the reduced risk of stroke and the reduced frequency of migraines. \nOver 2.5 million men and women suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States . With many AF patients hesitant to take anti-coagulant medication, a huge patient population exists for left atrial appendage (LAA) closure devices in the United States . Endocardial LAA closure devices present a minimally invasive option for LAA management. \nAs of August 2015, the U.S. market for endocardial LAA closure devices was composed entirely of Boston Scientific's WATCHMAN device, which received FDA approval in March 2015. The large AF patient population, reports of negative patient outcomes with other methods of LAA closure and patient preference for minimally invasive treatment techniques will combine to drive unit sales of the endocardial LAA segment to grow at a CAGR in excess of 60% over the forecast period. The rapidly increasing unit sales of the endocardial LAA segment will interact with the high ASP of the WATCHMAN to urge massive growth in the value of the total U.S. market for LAA devices. \nThis Report Includes Segments On: Patent Foramen Ovale Devices Atrial and Ventricular Septal Defect Devices Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device Market \nThis Report Includes: In-depth, Professionally Researched Data That Has Been Formatted and Analyzed to Gain Actionable Insights as Quickly as Possible Executive Summary Market Value Forecasts until 2022 and History Back to 2012 Market Drivers and Limiters Detailed Competitive Analysis for Each Market and Segment \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:35:27.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
