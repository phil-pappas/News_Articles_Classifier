The 2016 Nissan Altima has incorporated Nissan's latest design language and added several distinctive exterior features making the Altima more stunning than ever before. For 2016, Nissan has also added a new, performance-inspired SR trim to the selection of Altima vehicles. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277853 \nStarting on the outside of the vehicle, the goal of the Nissan designer's redesign was to make this a sedan with a sports car feel. This all starts with the V-Motion Grille at the front of the car which establishes its athletic aesthetic. Along with this is the new boomerang-shaped headlights and low, sculpted bumper, the 2016 Altima has the ability to intimidate even the most ferocious sports cars. \nCustomers looking for an even more performance-based edge will find the 2016 Nissan Altima SR trim an enticing offer . The SR has the Xtronic 7-step \"manumatic\" transmission mated to either the 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder or 3.5-liter V6 engine. It will also have a specially tuned suspension, rear spoiler, paddle shifters and 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. \nIn addition to the SR trim, there will also be three other models to choose from: S, SV and SL. Each of these has its own selection of features to choose from. Aside from the SR trim, the only other model available with the 3.5-liter V6 engine will be the SL trim. \nAny prospective car-buyers interested in learning more information about the 2016 Nissan Altima should contact a Boardman Nissan sales professional by calling 888-88-6354.
