Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC today assigned preliminary ratings to two classes of residential notes from LSTAR Securities Investment Ltd. 2015-9 and LSTAR Securities Investment 2015-9, LLC (LSTAR 2015-9), a resecuritization of previously issued residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). The preliminary ratings are based on information known to Morningstar as of Oct. 9, 2015 . Preliminary Ratings (as of Oct. 9, 2015) Class NR NR – Not Rated The collateral backing the LSTAR 2015-9 notes consists of previously issued RMBS backed by seasoned subprime, Alt-A, option ARM, and second-lien residential mortgages.
