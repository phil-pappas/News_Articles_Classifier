Further, the new calendar capability benefits the hourly employees who are assigned tasks and perform actual work in stores. For merchandising and retail store managers, the new calendar capability provides a real-time, consolidated, and store-specific view of the hourly labor working to deliver time-sensitive shopper marketing programs.\nFor hourly workers, the new functionality offers a simplified interface through which they can see and schedule important tasks. Also, the new and improved interface includes a built-in capacity metric that prevents hourly staff from scheduling and working un-approved overtime.\n“Timely execution of shopper marketing programs is critical to modern retail operations and that’s why our customers count on us to manage hourly labor from end-to-end,” said Stefan Midford, CEO of Natural Insight. “Now, with the unveiling of this dynamic calendar, we’ve incorporated a powerful level of transparency into store operations with our already robust scheduling, communications, task management, and time keeping functions.”\nVisit booth #525 for a full demonstration of the Natural Insight workforce management platform, including the newly unveiled calendar capabilities.\nAbout Natural Insight\nSupporting 65,000 skilled retail professionals in more than 110,000 locations globally, Natural Insight is a leading provider of cloud-based workforce management software for staffing firms, merchandisers, product companies, event marketers and retailers.
