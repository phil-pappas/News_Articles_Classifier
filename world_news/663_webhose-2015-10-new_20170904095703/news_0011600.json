A host of new elements such as the cloud, remote access, data sharing and analytics, and connected and shared networks has changed how built environments are being used and operated. \nAdditionally, these elements have thrown open an otherwise closed-loop building architecture into one that necessitates the open access and control of many operators and service providers, thus making it vulnerable to cyber threat. This research paper looks at the issue of cybersecurity in smart buildings and the steps needed to counter this disruptive trend. \nKey Topics Covered: \n- Background: Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Smart Buildings \n- Strategic Messages for the Industry \n- Defining Smart Buildings and Cybersecurity \n- Takeaways \n2.
