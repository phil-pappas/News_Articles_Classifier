Greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets \nThe document had been slimmed down from 80 pages to 20 by two diplomats guiding the process. \nBut the 130-plus G77 group of countries, which include China and India, insisted on reinserting dropped phrases on finance and fairness, a process which took the whole day and grew the text back again to 34 pages. \nIn Paris, French President Francois Hollande cautioned against an empty deal coming out of the forthcoming summit, saying countries' actions will have to be reviewed \"regularly\" to make sure progress is being made. \n\"There will be a deal in Paris. The question is at what level the agreement will be reached,\" he said. \nA key pillar of the pact will be a list of national pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \n'The whole world is looking' Rich nations have pledged to mobilise $100 billion per year from 2020 to help vulnerable countries cope with the impacts of global warming and reduce greenhouse gases \nScientists warn that pledges submitted by more than 150 nations so far place Earth on course for warming closer to 3 Câ€”a world of dangerous rises in sea levels, superstorms and the spread of disease. \nA key disagreement at the talks concerns a mechanism to regularly review and ramp up countries' actions so that the 2 C goal is achieved. \nAnother cause for dispute is developing countries' demand for money to finance a shift to less carbon-polluting economies, and to shore up their defences against the impact of climate change. \nThe Paris pact, due to take effect in 2020, will be the first climate agreement to include all the world's nations. \n\"The whole world is looking at us,\" Peruvian Environment Minister Manuel Bulgar Vidal told negotiators on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:07:52.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
