Port Manatee is on the right track in diversifying its business and generating more jobs for Manatee County.” \nMuch of the gain is attributable to World Direct Shipping’s weekly service, which began in November, 2014 between Port Manatee and the Port of Coatzacoalcos, in the southern part of the Mexican state of Veracruz. \nFact File: Located ‘Where Tampa Bay Meets the Gulf of Mexico’, Port Manatee is the closest US deepwater seaport to the expanding Panama Canal, with ten 40-foot-draft berths serving container, bulk, breakbulk, heavylift, project and general cargo customers. The port generates more than US$2.3 billion in annual economic impact for the local community, while supporting more than 24,000 jobs, without levying ad-valorem taxes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:04:56.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
