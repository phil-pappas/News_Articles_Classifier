Carey School of Business has named TTI Success Insights (TTI SI) as a semi-finalist for its annual Spirit of Enterprise Awards in the category of Social Impact.\nScottsdale, Ariz. (PRWEB) September 30, 2015\nRecognizing local leaders in the field of entrepreneurship, Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business has named TTI Success Insights (TTI SI) as a semi-finalist for its annual Spirit of Enterprise Awards in the category of Social Impact.\nTo qualify for the Social Impact Award, local businesses had to showcase a demonstrated impact on giving back to the community as a core part of business operations. This spring, TTI SI launched its 100K Lives Touched campaign . The campaign's goal is to make a positive impact by donating the use of assessments to 100,000 individuals in need and in underserved communities. These complimentary assessments are being delivered by TTI’s network of Value Added Associates and are at use in non-profits, in families and in outreach organizations around the globe.\nTTI SI Chairman and Founder Bill J. Bonnstetter and Vice President of Corporate Communication Emily Soccorsy recently presented to the judging panel at Arizona State University and shared the company’s story and vision for positively impacting others.\n“Not all people or organizations have the means to better understand themselves and others and thus to positively impact our decision-making and achieve true growth,” Bonnstetter said. “We are very proud of our ongoing efforts to make people and organizations more self-aware, and more productive and impactful. With over 150 VAAs in Arizona, many of whom donate their time to organizations and people lacking resources, we are making an impact right in our own backyard.”\nIn one local example of the 100K Lives Touched campaign, two associates annually donate assessments and their time to high school students, with the belief that teens who discover more about themselves during high school will build confidence and set the stage for better college and career planning. The Fountain Hills duo helps students look at career planning from a new perspective to determine overall job fit for the future.\nThe 19th annual Spirit of Enterprise Awards ceremony takes place Friday, Nov. 20 at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge Resort & Spa, where finalists and semi-finalists will be recognized for their innovative business contributions that have positively impacted the local economy.
