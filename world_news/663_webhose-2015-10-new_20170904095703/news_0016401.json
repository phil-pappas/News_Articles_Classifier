In a verification process, a one-to-one matching method is used to verify the biometrics traits of an individual against a particular template in a database, whereas in an identification process, a one-to-many matching method is used wherein the biometrics traits of an individual is matched against all templates in the database to determine an individual's identity.Fingerprint biometric technology matches the fingerprint scan of an individual with the database to identify and verify an individual based on features such as arch, whorl, and loop. Pattern-based algorithms are used to match an individual's fingerprint against the database. With advances in technology, AFIS was introduced in 1986, which is being used by a number of law enforcement agencies to identify a criminal.
