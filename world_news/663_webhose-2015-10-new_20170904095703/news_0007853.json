This report also forecasts the growth numbers till 2019 (on a YoY basis) and hence suggests the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the estimated period.\nTough and Increased Competition Among Retail Companies fueling the Adoption\nGlobally, retail companies are recording faster growth and the number of companies entering the retail market is increasing constantly. In this scenario, surviving the competition becomes a tough task, Most of the retail companies are realizing these challenges and are using better analytics tools like Natural Language Processing to assess the customer mood. In order to design perfect promotional programs and to price their products sensibly, most of the retailers globally are pushing for better analytical tools. In order to bridge the gap between what customer needs and what is actually being delivered, most of the retail companies have turned towards social media platforms to pick cues from the customer responses and views expressed on-line. Solutions like Natural Language Processing have emerged as one such solutions that would definitely add value to their efforts.\nGiven the large sets of data generated in the retail business, it becomes important for these companies to decide what data to retain, how much to retain and what needs to be discarded. This is again a tough call to take due to limiting factors of normal analytic tools. Some data may involve human sentiments which analytic tools fail to pick. For this, Natural Language Processing tools are being employed by the retail companies which pick data from social media platforms, customer review platforms and convert them to structured and actionable format. The applications of NLP can be for text analytics, sentiment analytics or social media analytics. With social media becoming a new marketing tool for businesses, identifying the human sentiments that were expressed on the various on-line platforms becomes important.\nThe revenue generated from retail segment towards NLP is still comparably limited. But, as the retail sector is growing globally, many of the large retail firms have already started adoption of NLP solutions. The most important point to consider here is, even though the adoption of NLP started late among this vertical, the rate of adoption is equal to that of the leading adopting verticals like financial services and IT & Telecom.\nMarket Segments and Forecasts Covered in the Report\nThe Retail Segment Natural Language Processing market is segmented by:\n- Applications (Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Question Answering, Report Generation, Others)\n- End users (Enterprise, Mid-size, Small Business)\n- Regions (North America, Europe, APAC, RoW)\n- Solution (Hybrid, Rule Based, Statistical)\n- Technology (Analytics, Operational, Recognition)\nCompanies discussed in the Global Natural Language Processing (NLP) research report include IBM, Nuance Communications, 3M, HP, Fuji Xerox, Apple, M*Modal, SAS, Oracle, Verint Systems, SAP, Artificial Solutions, Netbase Solutions, Microsoft, Attensity, Google, Sakhr Software, Precyse, Temis, Expert System.
