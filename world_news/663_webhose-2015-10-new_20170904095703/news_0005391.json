It was using backup systems to check-in travelers lacking printed or mobile boarding passes. \nAirline representatives have not said what caused the problem, but did say there was no indication that hackers were involved. \nThere were about 500 delays out of 3,600 flights scheduled Sunday. Passengers reported long lines at several locations across the country, including major airports like Los Angeles International, which provided water and canopies to those stuck waiting in line outside. \nOn Monday morning, Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport tweeted that operations were returning to normal with few delays and diminishing passenger lines. \nSouthwest is allowing traveling customers to change plans, as they had on Sunday, to accommodate any disruptions. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
