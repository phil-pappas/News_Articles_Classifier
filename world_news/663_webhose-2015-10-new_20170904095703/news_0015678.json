Now, Behlman also shatters the useful performance ceiling with their new VPXtra 1000CD-IQ, which has a high level of internal intelligence that supports communication, measurement and control. This intelligence upgrade gives VPX system designers the capability to create more compact systems with fewer additional instruments needed to accomplish their communication, measurement and control functions.\nAccording to Behlman’s President, Ron Storm, “Contrary to what many people think, a power supply can do a lot more than just supply power. As we watched VPX system designers working towards ever-smaller systems with more capabilities, we realized that some of the systems’ required communication, measurement and control functions could be integrated into our VPXtra Power Supplies, to save space and improve system functions. I congratulate the Behlman engineers for their visionary approach, which made the world’s highest power VPX power supply also the most intelligent.\nVPXtra 1000CD-IQ is Vita 62 compliant, and designed to power Open VPX modules. Its dual outputs offer 960 watts of 12 VDC and an auxiliary 3.3 VDC. Standard features include overvoltage, over current, short circuit and thermal protection, and the 12 VDC output can be paralleled for higher power and fail-safe redundancy. Its “IQ” capabilities include the ability to monitor and report all output voltages; output current; input voltage; input current; and temperature. It also supports ANSI/VITA 46 signals for geographical addressing, NVMRO (Non-Volatile Memory Read Only) and SYSRESET.\nOther features include user-adjustable warning/fault levels for voltage, current and temperature; inventory management information such as part numbers, serial numbers, and revision status; SMBALERT # signal to alert system controller of a power supply fault; over 200K user storage memory for settings and information; extensive PMBUS command set and status registers support.\nComplete specifications and data sheets for VPXtra1000CD-IQ Power Supply are immediately available at http://www.behlman.com .\nA new five-output 700 Watt Behlman Intelligent VPXtra1000CM-IQ Power Supply is also available.\nBehlman Electronics Inc., ( http://www.behlman.com ), a subsidiary of Orbit International Corp., manufactures and sells high-quality standard, modified-standard, custom and COTS power solutions, including AC power supplies, frequency converters, inverters, DC-DC, AC-DC, DC-AC, uninterruptible power supplies, and the VPXtra line of VPX/VME power supplies.\nOrbit International Corp., based in Hauppauge, New York, is involved in the manufacture of customized electronic components and subsystems for military and nonmilitary government applications. Other subsidiaries and divisions include Orbit Instrument, Tulip Development Laboratory, and Integrated Combat Systems, all of which are members of the Orbit Electronics Group.\nFor more information, contact Behlman Electronics Inc., 80 Cabot Court, Hauppauge, New York 11788 USA; TEL: +1 631 435-0410; FAX: +1 631 951-4341; sales(at)behlman(dot)com; http://www.behlman.com .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038283.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038283.htm"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:30:53.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
