Now, a Chromebook can fulfill most of your basic computing requirements with just a few tweaks and extensions, and for a lot less money than a Windows laptop. Here are 11 things you need to do in order to get the most out of your Chromebook. Remember the search button \nChromebook keyboards don’t have a caps lock key. Instead, it’s a search button. If you really need caps lock, you can change the function of the key in settings, but you should get used to having the search key there — it’s extremely useful. The search popup on Chromebooks gives you quick access to recent apps, Google Now cards, and your full app list. You can also use the quick search bar in this window to do all sorts of cool stuff like a quick calculation/conversion or setting a timer. Touchpad gestures \nChromebooks have a single-click mousepad button, which is a little strange at first. However, once you learn the basic gestures, it’s no problem. Right-clicking is handled via a two-finger tap, and middle-click is a three-finger tap. Two-finger scrolling is available, but the default setting is the “old” drag down to scroll down version. You can enable “Australian” mode in the settings, which is what Microsoft and Apple use as the default now. Bookmarks favicons \nThe favicon hack has been around for a while, and it’s not exclusive to Chromebooks. Still, it’s a great tweak to make your device easier to use. Odds are you know a lot of the favicons for your bookmarks pretty well, so do you really need the text next to each one? Try putting your most used sites in the bookmark bar at the top of the browser, then edit them and delete all the text under “name.” You’re left with a row of favicons that take up very little space and provide access to all your favorite sites. Chrome Remote Desktop \nEven if you can get most things done with a Chromebook, you might need a Windows computer from time to time. That doesn’t mean you have to put the Chromebook down, though. Chrome Remote Desktop lets you access a Windows PC connected to your Google account with almost no configuration. Just install the extension and sign in on both computers. Pushbullet \nOne of the first things you should do with your Chromebook is install Pushbullet on your phone (Android and iOS) and on the Chromebook. Just like with the desktop Chrome extension, Pushbullet allows you to send files, links, and text between your computer and mobile devices. It also mirrors your notifications from the phone to your Chromebook (Android only). It’s a completely free app and there’s optional end-to-end encryption. Screenshots \nChrome OS has a built-in screenshot tool, but you need to know the key combos to activate it. There’s the standard full screenshot, which is activated by pressing ctrl+ overview (that’s the one above the 6). You can also capture just part of the screen by pressing shift + ctrl + overview . This gives you a cursor that can be used to draw a box around whatever you want to capture. All screenshots are saved to the downloads folder. Dropbox mounting \nChromebooks come with limited local storage, but Google Drive is built right into the file manager. What if you’re more of a Dropbox fan? Just use the File System for Dropbox extension to add it. Log into the extension and it will mount your Dropbox storage as a location right next to Google Drive. It’s totally seamless. OK Google hotword \nAndroid users might be familiar with the experience of shouting “OK Google” at their phones, but you can do the same with a Chromebook. First, make sure the OK Google feature is turned on in the settings. Then open a new tab or hit the search button to start your voice query. You can launch apps by voice, get the weather, or just Google what the answer is to life the universe and everything. If you want to get fancy, you can enable always-on listening mode by toggling the flag under chrome://flags/#enable-hotword-hardware . Snap Windows \nChromebooks rely almost entirely on web apps accessed via Chrome, but there are a few dedicated apps and tools as well. Surprisingly, Chrome has rather robust window management. You can snap any two windows, be the Chrome or something else, to the left and right edges of the screen in Chrome OS. You can drag a window to the left or right to dock it and take up half the screen. The same can be accomplished by hitting alt + [ or alt + ] for the left and right sides, respectively. You can also click and drag the divider between two split-screen windows to change the split. Another tap of the docking hotkey can also shrink a window down to just a narrow column. This doesn’t make much sense for Chrome, but it’s great for something like Keep. Basic photo editing \nYou can’t run Photoshop on a Chromebook (yet), but there are a few capable photo editors that run in the browser. A basic Photoshop analog is Pixlr (seen above), which has layers, filters, image transformations, and more. It’s ad-supported, though. For processing and improving your photos, there’s Polarr , which is essentially a lightweight version of Lightroom. You can adjust color temperature, exposure, levels, and more. It can even open RAW files. Keyboard shortcut overlay \nThere is a whole array of keyboard shortcuts for Chromebooks, only some of which we’ve covered here. If you want to see all of them and get a refresher on the ones you already know, just remember this shortcut: ctrl + alt + ? That combo pulls up an on-screen keyboard diagram that shows all the hotkeys as you press the ctrl and alt modifiers. It’s super handy. \nThis is just the start of mastering Chromebooks. You can do a surprising amount with these browser-based machines. Chrome OS is a much more focused experience compared to Windows or OS X, but it’s also constantly changing. Google pushes updates to Chromebooks frequently, which can enable new features and patch bugs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:35:46.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
