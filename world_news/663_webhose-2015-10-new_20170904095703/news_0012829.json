(OTCBB: CHGT) and CEO Marco Valenzuela recently consulted on the writing of a significant new 3D printing text, giving the company valuable market exposure and prestige. Meanwhile, the company also reports its new 3D printing portal, 6d3d.com , has maintained a red-hot pace following its launch, as site visits and usage continue to exceed projections . \n3D Technology in Fine Art and Craft, by author and master sculptor Bridgette Mongeon , hit stores in September and is currently available via Amazon and other dealers nationwide. Valenzuela, with more than a decade of solid experience in 3D modeling and animation, lent his expertise and images of his work to the text and an accompanying website . Both aim to teach artists on how to use technology to bring their creations to life, an area of considerable familiarity for Valenzuela. \n“These are great resources for artists who could be future 6d3d.com portal users,” Valenzuela said. “My role down the line will be to act as an oracle – a virtual knowledge base – to answer questions from readers and website visitors on how to best utilize 3D printing. We’re honored to lend our expertise to this effort, which could grow the global 3D printing world and our portal, as well as enhance CHGT’s reputation throughout the community.” \nFor more information on CHGT, please visit www.changingtechno.com . \nFor more information on 6 th Dimension Technologies, visit http://www.6d3d.com . \nAbout Changing Technologies, Inc. \nChanging Technologies, Inc.
