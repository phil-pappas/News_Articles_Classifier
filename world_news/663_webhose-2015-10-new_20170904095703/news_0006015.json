The conference runs from October 24-27.\n“We’re excited for the opportunity to share some of our industry knowledge with some of the most experienced law enforcement officials in the world,” said eFORCE CEO, Cory Bowers. “This isn’t a sales presentation. It’s a chance for us to use our years of experience in the software industry to help other agencies through the RFP and purchasing process, which is often painful and time-consuming.”\nThe company’s presentation is titled, What Your Grandma Didn’t Know She Taught You About Buying Software, and will be held in the Solutions Presentation Theatre (SPT), on the showroom floor, on Tuesday, October 27 at 11:00 AM CT.\n“Of course, we hope you learn something practical and beneficial, but if you attend the presentation, you’ll at least walk away with a free USB car adapter, so you can charge your phone or tablet in your squad car,” said Ken Clark, eFORCE National Sales Manager. “Although, the theatre room only holds 50 people, so if you want one be sure to come early.”\nIn addition to car adapters, eFORCE will also be giving away some big-ticket items, including an Apple Watch and five Amazon.com gift cards worth $1,000 each. Visit the company’s booth (#4419) for details on how to win.\nWhen eFORCE began in 2003, it was the first company in the public safety software industry to develop an entire web-based suite of products that could be operated online from any computer with Internet access.
