Conyak’s patented technology allows advertisers to perform 100% accurate cross-device retargeting with dynamic product ads, and a recommendation engine that leverages past browsing behavior and consumer interests. This marks Gravity4’s thirteenth acquisition since the company was launched in July 2014.\n“We are very excited to be working with Conyak,” said Gurbaksh Chahal, Chairman and CEO of Gravity4. “In terms of ROI for advertisers, they’re easily beating their nearest rival, Criteo, and we can’t wait to integrate their DCO platform and AI-based recommendation engine into the Gravity4 Marketing Cloud so we can share these incredible results with all of our customers globally,” said Mr. Chahal.\nTwo years in the making, Conyak’s technology makes it possible for advertisers to reach consumers at the “moment of intent,” on the best converting device, at the right time. Moreover, Conyak’s frequency controls span both campaigns and devices, which dramatically increases ROI by enabling advertisers to precisely manage their campaigns and insure maximum conversions.\n“Over the past two years, our efforts to develop a disruptive, game-changing cross-device digital marketing platform have been rewarded by continuously increasing customer adoption,” said Christian Sundgaard, CEO of Conyak. “We are experiencing rapid growth in Northern Europe and we’re excited to amplify these gains as part of the Gravity4 family globally. Conyak’s goal has always been to ensure customer success by leveraging one-to-one marketing, and we are looking forward to taking our platform to the next level as part of the Gravity4 Marketing Cloud,” said Mr. Sundgaard.\n\"We chose to work with Conyak because of their technology, and their ability to track users across all consumer touch points,” said Marlene Schøler Sørensen, Project Manager at the WhiteAway Group, one of Denmark’s largest eCommerce websites. “By working with Conyak, we were able to achieve all of our ROI goals, easily surpassing results from previous partners. We are excited to see what we can do with the entire Gravity4 Marketing Cloud,” said Ms. Sørensen.\nGravity4 plans to integrate the Conyak team into its existing Copenhagen offices. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\nAbout Gravity4\nGravity4 delivers the world’s first high frequency marketing cloud that dramatically boosts digital marketing ROI across web, mobile, video, and social channels.
