The pan-American coverage of this satellite expands the area for video contribution to Latin America and the United States, allowing NBR and TV Brasil to increase their programming without increasing costs. \n\"Winning this bid helps consolidate our strategy to use the C band of the Amazonas fleet for video contribution and distribution services, and gives us the opportunity to provide audiovisual services to a government-owned company in Brazil,\" said Sergio Chaves, Hispamar 's business director for South America. \n\"Hispamar trusts that this is the beginning of a partnership that will allow viewers of EBC channels to enjoy the quality offered by the Amazonas 3 satellite, in addition to a broader diversification of these channels, since TV Brasil and NBR will now be able to broadcast content produced not only in Brazil, but also produced in different countries throughout the Americas,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:49:59.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
