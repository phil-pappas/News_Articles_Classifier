The contract includes support services to the local integrator and end user. \nDesigned for use in harsh environments such as armoured vehicles and fast patrol boats, EID's intercom systems establishes an integrated end-to-end information and communication network for shared situational awareness between crew members inside a vehicle or boat. \nExternally, it includes radio equipment providing voice and data communications, either over the air or via standard copper or either ruggedised fibre optic cables. \nThe intercom system serves as the centre of voice and data communications for all types of armoured vehicles and patrol boats, allowing integration of various sensors and other equipment, data terminals and radios. \nDue to its modern, flexible, modular concept it can be easily adapted and upgraded with minimal impact on the existing installation.
