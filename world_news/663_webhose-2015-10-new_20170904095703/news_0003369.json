The license has been fully paid for and Afriwave is currently involved in a full service deployment programme. \nBut the legality, constitutionality and necessity of the ICH is being challenged in court, while the telecom operators have also made their reservations about the ICH public. \nThe judge sitting on the case, Justice Essel Mensah was named among the alleged corrupt judges in the famous Anas video so the case has been halted. \nAfriwave, however got a provisional license to continue with its installation ahead of the decision of the court, a move which counsel for the plaintiffs have described as contemptuous of the court but have not sued for it. \nBut to the extent that the court earlier deferred ruling on an interlocutory injunction case brought against parties in the ICH, nothing prevented Afriwave from installing and deploying the network, even if it cannot implement the ICH policy immediately. \nMeanwhile, telcos and other communications service providers are yet to connect to the Afriwave platform.
