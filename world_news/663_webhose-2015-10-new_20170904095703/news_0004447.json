I would be loud and clear. And say, ‘Yes, I have officially adopted a second child.’ Right now, Louis must be it.” \nIn April, the actress opened up to People about having more children, putting to rest the rumors that she was planning to add a new member to the family. \n“Oh, those drumbeats. I’ve always said that I could have a house full of kids,” she told the magazine. “But at this time the only kids in my house, other than Louis, are the ones whose parents want them back at the end of the playdate. But if these drumbeaters know something that I don’t, I’d appreciate a heads-up on the details so I can pick up some supplies. I’m wickedly unprepared if Louis is getting a sibling this week.” \nSandra Bullock adopted son Louis Bardo in 2010, the same year she and ex-husband Jesse James split up.
