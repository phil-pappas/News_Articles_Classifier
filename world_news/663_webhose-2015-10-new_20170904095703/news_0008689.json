These videos that are constantly in circulation showing Zuma making a fool out of himself however, have really gotten in my nerves. I don't think they are funny at all\nYou see as much as we cannot agree with some of what members of the ruling party has done or what Zuma himself has done but I would like to point out that whether we like it or not, Zuma is the face of South Africa. He represents us out there, and when he is making a fool of himself we ought not to laugh, we must in fact ask ourselves, what does that say about us as South Africans to the international community?\nWe all know that Maths is not our President's strong point but there's no one in the ANC with the foresight to see to it that numbers needs to be written in words to avoid Zuma embarrassing himself over and over again when making his speeches.\nNOOO man this is really not on!\nCan someone reading this article from the ANC do something about this!.. I'm Swati and we have this saying-- Tibi Tendlu-- which literally translates to ( Dirty laundry), Zuma is our dirty laundry, as patriots let's all agree that we've made a mistake to have elected this man to that position and let's acknowledge that we have learned from this but most importantly let's try and hide our dirty laundry to protect ourselves from this kind of shame!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:13:08.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
