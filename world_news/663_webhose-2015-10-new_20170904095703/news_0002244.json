During the quarter, we made certain adjustments regarding our network of distributors supporting our offerings for the surgical, orthopedic and spine market sectors. Revenue could have been even stronger if not for the short-term effect of these strategic steps in our distributor network. \" \n\"During the quarter, we continued to gain very good momentum from our recently introduced new graft sizes and our mesh configuration. During the second quarter, we began to see improvement in our mix of small to large sizes to our prior levels. This improvement continued during the third quarter, and we anticipate this trend will continue,\" stated Bill Taylor , President and COO. \n\"We introduced a new product during the quarter, our OrthoFlo amniotic liquid offering. We will discuss this new offering, as well as our other future product introductions, at our October 13 th Analyst Day Meeting. In addition to discussing new product introductions, we are looking forward to presenting to investors our strategic plans for 2016 and beyond, new clinical and scientific study results, our growth opportunities, our reimbursement progress, intellectual property updates, our operating efficiencies and a number of surgical case studies,\" added Petit. \n$50 Million Credit Facility \nThe Company reported that it has entered into a new three-year $50 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
