Jones doesn’t just study tools made of antler and bone, rawhide and stone — he makes them. \nHe’s also an expert in things like making fire with friction and even considerably more modern pioneer skills such as hewing logs for use in making cabins. \n“My hands-on approach gives me a different perspective on archaeology,” he said. \nThe envy of any survivalist (and there’s even a wilderness survival guide on his website, www.mediaprehistoria.com ), Jones has made hundreds upon hundreds of tools that humans and human ancestors made and used over the past three decades as one of the country’s few full-time primitive technology specialists. \nSometimes the tools are for study or to teach himself things, sometimes for museum replicas; often he makes them in demonstrations for school groups or classes, like the University of Georgia anthropology class that watched him zip through two and half million years of human progress in 45 minutes Thursday. \nHe also writes about making these tools, how they were used and so on, \nand seven years ago collected a lot of those writings into a book. \n“A view to the Past: Experience and Experiment in Primitive Technology” was in large part a how-to book for anyone who might want to try things like using pitch for glue, pressure-flaking a sharp projective point (arrowhead, to most of us) or making a simple lodge such as the Yuchi Indians might have constructed long ago. \nJones thought he’d said all he wanted to about tool-making and use in that first book, but he was wrong; now he’s come out with another one he calls “Postcards to the Past: Context and Continuity in Primitive Technology.” \nThe new book is also part how-to; it’s got chapters on how to make arrow points from sharp gar fish scales, using a glue derived from the long fish’s skin, for example. \nBut it’s also full of ideas Jones has been thinking about during nearly three decades of making these tools. \n“Even though it’s still a lot hands-on, it’s a little more philosophical and archaeological. In nearly 30 years of doing this stuff, you develop some opinions on things,” said Jones, a University of Georgia graduate who lives in Oglethorpe County’s Vesta community. \nThe new book is also somewhat more focused on the prehistoric cultures and technology of this part of the world, the Southeast and the Piedmont region that includes the Athens area. \nHe also muses in some unexpected directions, such as fire-cracked rock and what archaeologists ought to think about when they study such rocks and other things they find that bear evidence of being through fire. They are often cracked simply because the rocks cracked while they were being used in cooking, but things are not always as they seem, according to Jones. \nAs a research method, he’s taken to burning all sorts of things that might be found by archaeologists exploring something like the centuries-old buried remains of a Native American habitation. \n“Burn some of everything,” Jones advises. “When you burn it, you learn a lot about what it looks like,” \nFollow education reporter Lee Shearer at www.facebook.com/LeeShearerABH or https://twitter.com/LeeShearer. \n\nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
