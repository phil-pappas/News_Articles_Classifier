Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell ï»¿\nRedBalloon has been quietly brewing a global business all year and has racked up almost 25,000 users before officially launching the software offering, which it plans to do this week.\nRedii.com is software for recognising and rewarding staff. While it is a separate business to RedBalloon, it grew directly out of a platform RedBalloon founder Naomi Simson had built to celebrate her staff.\n\"I realised really quickly as an entrepreneur that if I didn't treat everyone properly and make sure they were happy it would hurt the business and cost me dearly,\" Ms Simson said.\nMs Simson never planned for the platform to become its own business. It was simply an internal project that only became a stand-alone company after discussions with one of her board members, Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar, who suggested keeping staff engaged was a global problem crying out for a solution.\nUnlike RedBalloon, which is geographically bound by the experiences it offers on its gifting program, Redii is designed to be a global play. The platform is used to track and recognise employee success with events, gifts and manager feedback.\nDespite only launching this week, the Redii platform has gathered 56 customers and 25,000 users since January through businesses that are part of the RedBalloon network. Its target clients are likely to be similar to the large corporate clients that are the focus of RedBalloon's growth strategy.\nThe team will be headed up by Jemma Fastnedge, who served as the RedBalloon chief executive until the birth of her first child. She headed up the development of Redii since it launched and is a shareholder in the business.\n \"We've just separated out from RedBalloon. Moving forward we have big plans for growth,\" Ms Fastnedge said.\n\"The last few months have focused a lot on refining the product, interviewing customers, gathering insights and getting ready to scale it.\"\nThe team of eight intends to quadruple the user base in Australia and launch the product internationally within six months.\nWhile global growth will be a focus, Ms Fastnedge is hoping to keep the company in Australia.\n\"We are avid consumers of technology but not big creators of it,\" Ms Fastnedge says.\n\"There is feeling that Australia is somewhat conservative when it comes to investment in our own tech and less likely to take risks unless the business is a guaranteed unicorn.\"\nSimson is the majority shareholder, with ownership shared with Fastnedge and the founding employee trust. It is currently funded by Simson and Fastnedge but the company has plans to seek investment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711"], "published": "2015-10-05T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:26:37.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
