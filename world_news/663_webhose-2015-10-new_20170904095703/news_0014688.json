However, that hasn't been enough to stop the fake reviews from adulterating the purity of real user feedback.\nAmazon verified the fraud through its own investigation, it said, seeking out and paying for positive reviews from Fiverr users.\nThe vast majority of reviews on Amazon are authentic, helping millions of customers make informed buying decisions, noted Law, \"and our goal is to make reviews as useful as possible for customers. We continue to use a number of mechanisms to detect and remove the small fraction of reviews that violate our guidelines. We terminate accounts that abuse the system, and we take legal action.\"\nSolving the Problem Amazon intends to amend the complaint to identify each of the defendants by name as the information becomes available.\nIt has not named any of the sellers who have been hiring fake reviewers, however, said Jen Roach, partner at Thompson Hine .\n\"Pursuing the companies that sell fake reviews and the individuals writing those reviews leaves the source of the problem -- the sellers purchasing those reviews -- unchallenged,\" she told the E-Commerce Times. \"As long as that is the case, and it is still costly to monitor, detect and pursue action against fake review writers, it seems Amazon will still be contending with fake reviews.\"\nSellers certainly have been a key part of the problem, Amazon noted in its latest complaint. They often wrote their own positive reviews, which Fiverr users then placed.\n\"You know the your [sic] product better than me,\" read one Fiverr user's ad. \"So please provide your product review, it will be better.\"\nFor merchants, the most compelling cases for buying fake reviews are instances in which they are the sole seller of a particular product, or they stock more of an item than anyone else on Amazon, noted Gilad Komorov, chief revenue officer at Feedvisor .\n\"In all other cases, they could potentially invest in promoting the product on search results, but in the end, see one of their competitors get the deal,\" he told the E-Commerce Times.\nAs for Amazon, a decline in review credibility can yield a loss of trust in the system, said Komorov, and that can hurt sales.\n\"Amazon's interest is to promote high-quality products by ensuring they get discovered first,\" he said, \"and product reviews play a key role in this strategy.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.ectnews.com/images/end-enn.gif", "http://www.ectnews.com/"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:07:50.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
