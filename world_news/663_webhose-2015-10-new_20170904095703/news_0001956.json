On Wednesday, both sides presented testimony on damages in a phase expected to last into Friday.\nThe Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation sued Apple in 2014 claiming it used the foundation's patented technology in its latest processors, which power iPhone and iPad devices.\nThe technology dates to 1998 when the work of four UW researchers was patented. The foundation sued Intel Corp. over the same patent in 2008 and settled for an undisclosed amount.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:56:13.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
