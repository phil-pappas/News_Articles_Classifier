The port determined that capturing and recycling the sediment before it settled into the river bottom could provide financial benefits by selling it for such beneficial uses as composting and road fill.\nAs a cost-saving measure, the Army Corps had proposed dumping the sediment directly into Lake Erie. But the Ohio EPA refused to approve the plan, saying the sediment was too polluted to dump in open water.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:00:36.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
