An email to UMaine students encouraging them to watch the video thanks them for their \"willingness to address this most difficult of real-world realities.\" \nWayne Maines, executive director of Safety, Health Services, Transportation and Security for the University of Maine System, said crisis management plans are designed to address all sorts of emergencies, not just shootings. \nThe Associated Press looked at public colleges and universities across the county after yet another mass shooting rampage, the killing of nine people at an Oregon community college Oct. 1. \nAt some institutions, training on how to respond to an armed intruder has become as much a part of fall orientation as lessons on alcohol abuse. Other schools have purely voluntary training or put information on what to do on websites, where it can be overlooked by students and staff members. \nIn Maine, there's no requirement for specific active-shooter drills but the University of Maine at Farmington worked over an 18-month period to plan a full-scale exercise in 2014, engaging police, fire medical and emergency management teams. University of Maine police have attended state police active shooter workshop. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:42:43.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
