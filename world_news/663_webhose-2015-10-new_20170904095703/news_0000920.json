Using SLAM technology – best known for its use in the Google self-driving car – Neato robot vacuums use laser sensors and advanced technology to avoid obstacles, move from room to room and return to their charging bases to recharge before returning to the exact spot it left off. \nNeato also kicked off its holiday marketing campaign with entertaining online videos highlighting how Neato can take care of the messy situations humans often create. Called “Neato Knows,” the full suite of ads can be found here . \nAbout Neato Robotics \nNeato Robotics creates robots smart enough to perform household chores as intelligently and efficiently as a human.
