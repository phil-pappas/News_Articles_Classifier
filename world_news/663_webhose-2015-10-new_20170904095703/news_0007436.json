Both companies are chip-makers, but Broadcom is known for chips for wireless devices, whereas Avago focuses more on wired and industrial chips.\nOverall, M&A is expected to hit a total of $3.83 trillion by the end of the year, up 4.5% higher from the previous record of of $3.66 trillion reached in 2007, according to research firm Mergermarket. Deals of more than $10 billion, or \"mega-deals,\" have accounted for a whopping 38% of activity, up from just 25% in 2014, according to Mergermarket.\nDell's $67 billion offer to buy EMC only accelerates the trend.\nBut mega-deals can also be risky. In fact, there has been some movement in the opposite direction, especially in tech, with some companies seeking to whittle down in order to better compete, including Dell competitor Hewlett-Packard.\n“This is a real opportunity for HP,\" the company said in a statement. \"Two of our largest competitors are attempting a highly distracting, multi-year merger, just as we are launching two new, focused companies.\"\nUSA TODAY\nMerger boom shows no sign of slowing, on track for record year\nHP is currently working on a plan to split into separate consumer and corporate computing divisions after going through it's own mega-deal in 2001 and finding that bigger was not, in fact, better. HP bought Compaq in 2001 for what was then a record $25 billion tech acquisition in an effort to scale its resources and better compete with Dell.\nA desire to be more nimble led eBay to spin off payments arm PayPal earlier this year.\nDespite the risks, analysts are responding well to Dell's desire to be bulk up. The acquisition of EMC \"improves the company's profitability profile as a result of better product mix, and also enables the opportunities for revenue and cost synergies,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst David Tsui.\nDell founder Michael Dell is no stranger to paying record amounts for companies he wants. He and private equity group Silver Lake Partners paid $25 billion to take Dell private in 2013, upping their bid from an initial $21 billion. That deal marked the largest leveraged buyout of 2013, as well as the largest since the 2008 financial crisis made taking over companies with borrowed funds more difficult.\nCONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1LqPLNI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801802552974566-ousted-ceo002.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3070f83a9f7ea0afd69bec195732d6ec57d1cd2e/c=142-0-3436-2477&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801802552974566-ousted-ceo002.jpg", "http://imgur.com/zSXoRjv.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LqPLNI", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LqPLNI&text=Dell%27s%20record-setting%20bid%20adds%20to%20deal%20froth&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LqPLNI&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aa144168360a10a62d0b0aa1758fad5460bccff5/c=370-0-2891-2521/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793150205994618-XXX-World-Series-Game-7-eb0022-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801802552974566-ousted-ceo002.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:49:08.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
