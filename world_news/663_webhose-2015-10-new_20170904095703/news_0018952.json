Advanced manufacturing using photonics components is responsible for over $83 billion in revenue and 380,000 U.S. jobs, and produces items such as LED lighting systems, fiber optic systems, industrial lasers, scientific probes and infrared imagers. Continued investment and implementation of advanced manufacturing is crucial to the economic well-being and strengthening of the United States in the international marketplace.

Seth Moulton (D-MA) at its Wakefield, Massachusetts, facility on National Manufacturing Day. Optikos is one of 300 optics and photonics-related manufacturing companies in Massachusetts providing over 46,000 jobs and over $10 billion in annual revenue. Optikos is a recognized leader in the fields of optical and electro-optical testing whose optically-based products and solutions are manufactured in Wakefield and exported to homes, laboratories, and manufacturing facilities around the world. Rep. Moulton toured the facility and met with both senior executives and staff of Optikos and a representative of The Optical Society. \n“Congressman Moulton’s visit underscores the importance of optical technologies and their use in modern manufacturing processes,” said Stephen Fantone, President and CEO, Optikos. “Federal investment in optics and photonics research and development is critical to creating advanced manufacturing technologies and helping U.S. manufacturers compete globally.” \nElizabeth Rogan, CEO of The Optical Society, said, “Photonics technologies in process manufacturing have been a key component in the revitalization of U.S. manufacturing. Integrated photonics, already in use in industries ranging from aerospace to agriculture, will reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and bring improved technologies as diverse as brain imaging and solar energy to market.” \nThis year, National Manufacturing Day marks the one year anniversary of President Obama’s announcement of the Integrated Photonics Institute for Manufacturing Innovation – now known as the American Institute for Manufacturing of Photonics (AIM Photonics). Awarded to a New York-based consortium, the institute is the largest within President Obama’s National Network for Manufacturing Innovation with more than $600 million public-private partnership. AIM Photonics will develop an end-to-end integrated photonics “ecosystem” in the United States, bridging the gap between applied research and product development by bringing together companies, universities and Federal agencies to co-invest in key technology areas that encourage investment and production in the United States. It will provide a unique opportunity for education and training of students and workers at all levels, while providing the shared assets to help companies, most importantly small manufacturers, access the cutting-edge capabilities, skilled technicians and equipment to design, test, and pilot new products and manufacturing processes. The National Photonics Initiative (NPI) supports AIM Photonics through the resources and platforms of its scientific societies, including The Optical Society, a founding NPI partner and strong supporter. \nAbout National Manufacturing Day \nEstablished in 2012, National Manufacturing Day is a celebration of modern manufacturing, encouraging manufacturers to demonstrate the potential of modern state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and foster interest in manufacturing careers.
