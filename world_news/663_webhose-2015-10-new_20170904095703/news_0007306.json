More than 100 million people have signed up for the unlimited photo storage service since it was spun off from Google+ five months ago. Available on Android and Apple devices as an app, plus in a desktop version, Google Photos helps users store and easily manage their collection of photos, essentially tidying up what would otherwise be an unwieldy collection of images.\nGoogle Becomes a Part of Alphabet: What You Need to Know\nStorage One of the most welcome features of Google Photos is all of the space the auto-upload feature clears up on a smartphone. Google says the auto-upload feature of the service has freed up 3,720 terabytes of storage on users' smartphones.

Awww.\nSharing A photo assistant capability lets users quickly create ways to share photos, whether through a montage movie, animation or a collage, making sharing those event photos friends have been bugging you for a simple and quick task.\nGoogle Photos: 3 Big Reasons Why It's a Hit \"\nTrump Leads in Expectations, Shows Strength on Attributes \"\nIf Biden Enters Race, Winning Iowa Caucus Presents Challenges \"\nHow 'Back to the Future: Part II' Scored on 2015 Predictions \"\nColorado Woman Sues GM After Harrowing Crash \"\n'Back to the Future Part II' Cast Then and Now \"\nPhoto of Police Officer Comforting Lost Boy Goes Viral \"\nDuchess Kate Dazzles at Her First State Banquet \"\nNew Treatment for Psychosis Leads to Remarkable Recovery \"\nBoehner Predicts Ryan Will 'Get Support He's Looking For' as Speaker \"\nTrump Says Jeb Bush 'Embarrassed by What's Happening' \"\nSyrian President Visits Russia in 1st Trip Abroad Since Conflict Democrats Release Benghazi Testimony of Top Clinton Aide Pilot Killed After US F-18 Jet Crashes in England \"\nNetanyahu Causes Uproar by Linking Palestinians to Holocaust \"\nMajor Shift in Mammogram Recommendations Girl, 4, Shot and Killed in Road Rage Incident New York City Police Officer Dead in Shooting Iran's Top Leader Endorses Landmark Nuclear Deal Vatican Denies Report Pope Has Small, Curable Brain Tumor VW Halts Sales in EU of Diesels With Scandal-Hit Engine \"\nGM Overcomes Huge Recall Costs to Post Healthy 3Q Profit \"\nMan Arrested in Detroit EMTs Attack Charged With '06 Murder \"\nMan Killed by Plainclothes Cop in Florida Had Gun, Police Say \"\nActor Jaden Smith Claims to Have Duped Us All \"\nAdele Explains New Album, Hints at Title \"\nFriends Use iPhone App to Find Missing College Student", "external_links": ["http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/custom/pages/trident_story.js?v=50", "https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/11-things-to-know-about-google-photos.html", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/abcn.js?v=50", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-ext.js?v=2", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-core.js?v=2", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Google+Photos%3A+3+Big+Reasons+Why+It%27s+a+Hit+-+ABC+News+-+http%3A%2F%2Fabcn.ws%2F1GSZJCg&via=ABC", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FTechnology%2Fgoogle-photos-big-reasons-hit%2Fstory%3Fid%3D34623740", "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.24.0.0000/amp.premier/amp.premier.min.js?v=2", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/google-photos-big-reasons-hit/story?id=34623740&title=Google+Photos%3A+3+Big+Reasons+Why+It%27s+a+Hit", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/js/s_code_15.js?v=4"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:18:51.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
