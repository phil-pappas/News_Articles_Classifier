First\" programming and scheduling strategy. Data released by the pay-TV giant, exclusive international home of The Walking Dead, has revealed 17% year-on-year live ratings growth and a 24% reach increase for the season six return of the show in 18 markets across Europe and Asia. \nThe company added that in key markets such as the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, the premiere episode of the latest series became the highest rated live TV hour on FOX ever. The premiere was up 17% in rating across the 18 metered markets from prior season and boosted the channel's prime time average five-fold. The live opening attracted 4.3 million viewers increasing last year's reach by 25%. \nIn the highly competitive UK market, the season premiere scored the highest overnights audience ever recorded on FOX, up 11% compared with the previous season's opener. FOX became the most watched pay-TV channel during the timeslot, with an audience more than four times bigger than its nearest rival, beating BBC2, Channel 5 and Discovery. The Talking Dead follow-up programme which FOX has licensed in the UK, also got off to a positive start, helping FOX to retain its hold as the most watched pay-TV channel through prime time and #TheWalkingDeadUK was the top UK Twitter trend during the premiere. \nThis year's premiere of The Walking Dead in Germany drew the largest viewership to FOX ever, resulting in a new record of 3.7% daily share for MF14-59 pay-TV Individuals for the channel. It was a similar story in the Netherlands and Spain. \nCommenting on the performance data, Hernan Lopez, president and chief executive officer, FOX International Channels said: \"We are thrilled to see our No 1 series continue to perform so well on FOX and are convinced this season will continue to deliver explosive entertainment and ratings to match.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:54:41.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
