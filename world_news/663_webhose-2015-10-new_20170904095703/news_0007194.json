It’s the “Creepy” crate, and you won’t get it by subscribing to Loot Crate. It’s a NYCC exclusive, and considering they were hitting the 3,000s by Thursday afternoon, it probably won’t last. Of course I picked one up. \nExclusives abound in this crate, starting with a Funko Pop! Figure of Edith Cushing from Guillermo del Toro’s upcoming movie Crimson Peak . I’m looking forward to it, and only partly because I really like his work. I’m also looking forward to it because he’s been the Charlie Brown of media recently, with the football of Silent Hills yanked from him so abruptly and the seeming never-ending struggle to get Pacific Rim 2 made. His work’s often super-creepy, but he’s really sympathetic right now. \nAnother vinyl figure came in the crate, and amazingly it wasn’t a Funko one. It’s a Mezco Bride of Chucky vinyl figure of a sewn up and slightly green Chucky brandishing a knife. There’s more than vinyl in the box, though. There’s painted ceramic, in the form of a mini zombie garden gnome. It’s cute, and oddly similar to the blue giant gnome statue we pass around at work for our Thursday fighting game tournaments. \nI also now have my second Umbrella Corporation umbrella. The one included in the Creepy Loot Crate is a smaller, collapsible umbrella compared with the full-sized golf umbrella I got at Capcom’s booth at PAX East earlier this year, but it’s just as useful, and just as representative of an amoral and monstrous company. I’m talking about Umbrella, not Capcom. \nThe Fear in a Can device looks like a mini air horn, but it’s actually a battery-powered speaker. Press a button, and it screams, or growls, or makes other spooky noises. Rad. Finally, the crate included a pack of foil Black Lantern cards from Cryptozoic, and another Loot Crate pin. Unlike the painted pins included in most crates, however, this exclusive one is enameled, and fancy!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:55:43.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
