Through the Amnesty Program which had begun on October 1 of this year qualified drivers will be able to pay their fines in 50 or 80% reduced rates.\nAlthough this latest amnesty program is considered as not part of the DMV programs interested applicants are advised to contact the superior court that has jurisdiction on the traffic tickets they had received for them to find out if they are eligible for the reduced rates.\nCalifornia drivers that are entitled to the reduced rates are those who have outstanding infraction tickets with payments that are originally due on or before the 1st of January 2013. Included also are the drivers who want to reinstate their licenses. However the amnesty program is not applicable to reckless parking tickets and offenses related to DUI. In addition to this drivers with more than one ticket are not entitled to have their fines reduced to the suggested rates. So as long as the drivers can meet the requirements set by the amnesty program drivers can avail the reduced rates on their traffic tickets.\nAnother point that is clarified by the DMV is that drivers will no longer be eligible if they made payment after June 24 2015. There’s a big chance that their licenses will be returned but they still have to pay the fines with no reduction on the tickets. Keep in mind that any infraction is honored by the amnesty such as the unpaid tickets and violations related to “failure to appear” with an initial payment that has been accomplished on or before January 1 2013. And the extension of this program depends on the individual superior courts and counties where some demeanors are included.\nWhen it comes to payment the eligible participants do not have to pay for any civil assessments. When the civil assessment amount were deducted what will remain will be deducted by the amnesty rate of 50% or 80% - that still depends on the income or the receipt of certain public benefits. The 80% discount will be given to those who can prove and certify that they make 125% or less in the federal poverty level. On the other hand the 50% discount will be given to eligible participants.\nYet as much as possible the DMV advises lots of drivers as well as those who are renewing their licenses to undergo studying and improve their driving skills through . This will help them prevent receiving traffic tickets and paying hefty fines which could affect their car insurance premiums.\nAbout \nIt is an online traffic school which is approved by the CA DMV to help in the dismissal of every driver’s traffic tickets in all the counties and courts in California. They ensure every client that they will be provided with a complete module to keep their driving records clean and escalating the insurance premium. They also keep your electronic reports updated without having to spend extra money for this service.
