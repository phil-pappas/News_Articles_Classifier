(AP) - A suburban Chicago garden with a disappointing rainforest plant that refused to bloom now has a new star attraction. \nThe Chicago Botanic Garden announced Tuesday that a second corpse flower is not only on display in its semi-tropical greenhouse, but it is blooming. \nGarden officials say the smell is a combination of Limburger cheese, garlic, rotting fish and smelly feet. \nVisitors have been flocking to the garden to see the plant as it blooms. The garden is live-streaming the titan arum plant on its website (www.chicagobotanic.org/titan_arum_corpse_flower ). \nThis plant has been nicknamed Alice. In August, another corpse flower, nicknamed Spike, didn't open after much anticipation. Garden scientists finally opened the flower manually.
