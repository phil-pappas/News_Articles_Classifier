These waveguide adapters are used for any number of applications such as SATCOM, wireless communications, industrial, test and measurement and defense systems whenever there is a requirement to transition from coax to waveguide or vice versa. Pasternack’s newest selection of 10 waveguide to coax adapters complements the company’s already vast portfolio of more than 75 waveguide adapters. This new offering brings the overall family into the millimeter wave frequency ranges with models in the K-band (18 to 26.5 GHz) up to V-band (50 to 65 GHz). Available waveguide sizes for these new models include WR-42, WR-28, WR-22, WR-19 and WR-15. These coax to waveguide adapters exhibit excellent VSWR as low as 1.29:1 while also offering insertion loss performance as low as 0.3 dB.\nThe new waveguide to coax adapters from Pasternack that are designed with 2.92mm connectors utilize a UG-style square waveguide flange, while the 2.4mm and 1.85mm connectorized versions utilize a UG-style circular waveguide flange. Both male and female connector options are available in each frequency band. All waveguide adapters are in-stock and available for same-day shipping.\n“Pasternack has a broad line of waveguide to coax adapters already in its broad product portfolio, but mostly in frequencies below 18 GHz,” explains Mark Blackwood, Passive Components Product Manager at Pasternack. “We are pleased to now offer from stock an extensive line of millimeter wave transitions that meet our customers’ application requirements up to 65 GHz.”\nAll of the new waveguide to coax adapters from Pasternack are in-stock and ready to ship now.
