Swisscom, Switzerland's leading information and telecommunications technology company chose ClusterHQ for managing its customers' critical databases because only Flocker specifically addresses the problems associated with running a containerized persistent service in production. The Swisscom Application Cloud, a public PaaS based on Cloud Foundry, is leveraging Docker and Flocker, which allows customers to easily provision and manage containerized services, including their databases, in production from a single, secure platform. \n\"Persistent data management was the key feature that we needed to build a leading edge Platform-as-a-Service with Cloud Foundry on top. With Flocker, we found a way to effectively manage and migrate Docker containers and their associated data between servers as real-world operations demand,\" said Marco Hochstrasser, Head of Swisscom Application Cloud. \"Thanks to Flocker, Swisscom has successfully implemented container-based services to achieve new growth opportunities. The integration of Flocker into our new Cloud Foundry PaaS offering has finally made persistent and containerized services on a production level achievable.\" \nWith the new Swisscom Application Cloud, developers have the freedom to focus on writing applications because Swisscom automatically takes on all the operational tasks, including the management of servers, storage, and networking. Swisscom's PaaS offering gives developers a new level of simplicity and security for the development and management of modern cloud native applications built with microservices architectures. Unlike most PaaS offerings that require users to adopt a separate service to manage databases, Flocker enables Swisscom to offer a unified platform to their users that includes Database-as-a-Service, as well as Messaging-as-a-Service offerings such as MongoDB, MariaDB and RabbitMQ. From the Swisscom perspective, Flocker enables entire applications created on the Swisscom Application Cloud to experience the portability and per-server density benefits inherent in containers, a boon to service providers who must always look for ways to increase application density without sacrificing operational manageability. \n\"Flocker increases the ease with which enterprises like Swisscom can adopt containers to simplify the creation, deployment and management of stateful applications,\" said Mark Davis, CEO of ClusterHQ. \"Our customers are proving that by using Flocker to deploy stateful containers in production environments, they gain meaningful business benefits such as improved operational management and increased per-server density of applications.\" \nFlocker is quickly becoming the industry standard for running stateful services in production. ClusterHQ is creating a thriving ecosystem around Flocker through partnerships with industry-leading enterprise storage providers such as EMC, VMware and NetApp and integrations with leading container companies such as Docker, Mesosphere and CoreOS.

DevOps teams worldwide rely on ClusterHQ's open source Flocker software to meet the data portability requirements of distributed, microservices-based applications. Available for download at www.clusterhq.com/flocker , Flocker enables containers and their associated data volumes to be easily moved between servers as a single unit, a prerequisite for production operation of stateful application components in containers. Flocker facilitates widespread production deployment of containers for databases, queues and key value stores by making it simple and practical for entire distributed applications to be consolidated into an all-container development and operations environment. No matter where, or what, a container is running, Flocker gives DevOps teams operational freedom to quickly react to market conditions by relocating application containers in response to changing conditions, so that their business can innovate faster and be more responsive. Flocker increases the value of an organization's container investment and opens the door for a greater variety of mainstream enterprise use cases. Organizations can now embrace the portability and massive per-server density benefits of containers for stateful application services, enabling the creation of a new generation of microservices-based applications, and in some cases the replacement of virtual machines with containers. ClusterHQ provides the tools and services necessary for deploying and managing fully containerized stateful applications, simplifying IT processes and delivering on the advantages inherent in containers.
