Large businesses including Coca-Cola also announced similar commitments.\nCalifornians have been early adopters of electric vehicles, and their elected leaders have set policies to get 1 million zero- or low-emission vehicles on the road.\nMary Nichols, the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, hailed the promise to increase charging stations, saying that the concern an electric vehicle will run out of juice is a major barrier to widespread adoption of the vehicles.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
