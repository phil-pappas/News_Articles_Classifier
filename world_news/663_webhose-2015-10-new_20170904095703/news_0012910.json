From immersive coffee bars, to the familiar neighborhood store or an express format, each experience is designed for the customer it is serving. In this case, it's the busy professionals who work for more than 150 tenants inside the Empire State Building. \n“New York City has always inspired us to consider new ways to innovate for our growing store portfolio and I cannot think of a better location to launch one of the most frequently requested services,” said Cliff Burrows, group president, U.S. and Americas. “With Starbucks Green Apron Delivery, we’ve simply moved that moment of connection between our customer and the barista from our place to theirs.” \n“The Empire State Building is a true urban campus within a building in New York City and we’re always looking for new ways to ensure that the environment we offer creates the opportunity for maximum productivity for our tenants and their employees,” said Anthony E. Malkin, Chairman and CEO of Empire State Realty Trust. “This Starbucks Delivery pilot will unite two iconic brands to bring New Yorkers hard at work in our offices an innovative experience and added convenience to their daily routine.” \nHow It Works Created specifically for the unique characteristics of the building, Starbucks Green Apron Delivery service will allow Empire State Building tenants to order a selected set of food and beverages via a dedicated website. Beverages will then be handcrafted by Starbucks baristas in a designated kitchen within the building. \nOrders will be prioritized and prepared within a 30-minute timeframe, giving Starbucks partners (employees) the ability to craft the beverages based on volume and distance to the drop off location while ensuring the quality of the product upon delivery. Starbucks baristas will bring orders to each company’s designated drop off location, which could include reception, a desk or other common areas, where the customer will meet them. \n“My team is so proud to be the first Starbucks baristas to be delivering our products to customers outside our stores,” said Brian Murphy, store manager. “It is a historic moment for the company and after all the planning and practice, it’s now time to bring Starbucks Green Apron Delivery to life.” \nWorking in The World’s Most Famous Building The Starbucks Green Apron Delivery kitchen is located in the 33rd Street lobby of the Empire State Building. Soaring 1,454 feet above Midtown Manhattan, the Empire State Building is New York City’s most recognizable and celebrated attraction. Millions of visitors from all over the world marvel at the spectacular views from its 86th and 102nd floor observatories. With new investments in infrastructure, public areas and amenities, the Empire State Building attracts first-rate tenants in a diverse array of industries. \nStarbucks Green Apron Delivery service will be available to over 12,000 business professionals with over 150 tenants working on any of the 75 office floors in the Empire State Building. While tourists or other customers visiting the Empire State Building will not be able to order from Starbucks Green Apron Delivery, they can stop by the express store in the lobby to pick up a Starbucks item or visit the cafe in the 34th Street lobby. \nThe unique and bustling work environment, mixed with a large number of tenants, makes this office building an ideal location to run the first test of Starbucks Green Apron Delivery. \nThe First Delivery The first Starbucks Green Apron delivery went to the Observatory Director, Empire State Building.
