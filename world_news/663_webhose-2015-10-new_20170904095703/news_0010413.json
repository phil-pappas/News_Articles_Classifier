I mean, Doogie started keeping a digital diary in 1979 —totally an early adopter.\nThis is the sort of thinking that comes from hunting for the earliest TV-show reference to the Internet, a search that leads deep into the grungiest, cheesiest corners of 1990s television.\nEven as dial-up Internet connections went mainstream, television representations of the web lagged. Computers appeared on television mostly as props, boxy monitors sitting dark on desks. The arrival of Internet represented a huge cultural shift, but it was barely a plot point in the 1990s—with some exceptions.\n“Ooh, hey. What is all that?” “Oh, it’s a website.” The X-Files had to have been among the first shows to use the web in a storyline, in “2Shy,” which originally aired in November 1995. The episode features a mutant serial killer who sweet-talks self-conscious women online, convinces them to meet in-person, then pulverizes their flesh for sustenance. (Moral of the story: Chat with strangers online and an alien will turn your body into goo.)\nScreenshot from “2Shy,” an episode of The X-Files that used the web as a plot point in 1995. A year later, in 1996, an episode of Friends treats an online romance between one of the show’s male leads and a mystery woman as amusing and bizarre. “Well, we haven’t actually met,” Chandler says of his new love interest. “We stayed up all night talking on the Internet.” The audience laughs. Monica shouts “Geek!” More laughter.", "external_links": ["http://doogiehowser.wikia.com/wiki/Personal_Journal_of_Doogie_Howser,_M.D."], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:10:03.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
