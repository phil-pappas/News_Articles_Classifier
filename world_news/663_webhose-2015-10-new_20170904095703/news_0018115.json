Ardent will be showcasing it’s unique “In Touch” support model which allows companies to consolidate disparate support contracts and end-of-life hardware, all under one roof. All while saving money, and increasing support levels.\n“In Touch” was developed to help IT Managers manage their support contracts by incorporating multiple hardware vendors support contracts under one support provider. This strategic consolidation of contracts allows faster response time for Storage, Server, and Network issues – while saving the company 40-70% on average. Before “In Touch” companies were faced with paying more for extended OEM Support contracts, or risking a sub-par support offering by a Third-Party support provider with little to no guarantee on support levels.\n“Today’s IT Managers are under increasing pressure,” said Jim Stevens, VP of Sales for Ardent Support. “Budgets continue to be scrutinized. Doing more with less is the common theme and the mandate is clear; streamline infrastructures and cut costs - but this can’t come at the expense of performance.”\nThere are 3 great ways to engage with Ardent Support at Gartner ITxpo:\n1. Stop by Booth 608 to grab a free external battery charger for your smart phone while simultaneously entering to win a grand prize (1) GHOST UAV Drone and (2) Amazon Echo’s for runners up.\n2. Have questions for the folks in the know? Here's a great opportunity for a informal chat with an Ardent Engineer or Executive. Members of our staff will be available to answer the toughest questions you can provide.\n3.
