Its thermal efficiency was increased by improving combustion and reducing mechanical loss. [Click to enlarge image] \nContinued from Toyota Unveils Fuel-saving Technologies for New Prius (1) \nToyota also reduced the mechanical loss of the entire gasoline engine by 14%. First, its frictional resistance was reduced by using a sliding bearing covered with a low-friction-coefficient resin film for the sliding part of the crankshaft. \nMoreover, the company employed a conical coil spring, instead of a cylindrical type, for the engine's the valve train (for intake and exhaust) so that the diameter of the spring becomes smaller at its upper part, which moves more than the lower part. As a result, the mechanical loss of the moving part was reduced. \nFurthermore, Toyota smoothed the sliding part of the piston. It applied microdimple treatment to form small concavities that retain engine oil. Compared with a conventional piston with a streak pattern, the frictional resistance of the new piston's sliding part is smaller. The company used a low-viscosity engine oil. \nTo prevent knocking and reduce frictional resistance at the same time, a water jacket spacer equipped with \"Expad\" is used. It is a plate that is installed in a water jacket formed outside the cylinder block to control the flow of cooling water. \nIt leads cooling water fed by a water pump to the upper part of the bore. By cooling the upper part of the bore, combustion temperature is lowered, prevening knocking. \nOn the other hand, the temperature of the middle and lower part of the bore is kept at a constant level. For this purpose, a heat-resistant foam elastomer called Expad was inserted between the plate and a part in contact with the cylinder. It functions as a heat insulator and keeps the temperature of the sliding part in which the piston moves. As a result, the viscosity of engine oil can be reduced, lowering frictional resistance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:54:16.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
