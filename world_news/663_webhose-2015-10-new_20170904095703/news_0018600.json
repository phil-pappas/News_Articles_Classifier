We don't, but this novel process paves the way for pioneering new applications for electronics such as organic electronics or optoelectronics.[caption id=\"attachment_8573\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"] Magnified 20,000 times, the digitally colored microflower shows form and structure through its bloom.[/caption]The flowers are actually microstructures shaped like flowers. And by micro we're talking extremely small. The artificial blooms on the microflower are only 10 microns wide and according to researchers, 10 would fit along the width of a human hair.To create the microflowers the researchers mixed two organic chemicals, phosphonic acid and melamine, in water. As the reacting chemicals evaporate a bond if formed between them which causes the petals to form and begin to unfold and bloom just like a real flower.[caption id=\"attachment_8571\" align=\"\" width=\"685\"] This is a field emission scanning electron micrograph of the ​micro​flower ​shown at ​various stages of growth during​ the ​​evaporation​ stage​. ​Image courtesy of RMIT University.​[/caption] Dr. Sheshanath Boshanale , Future Fellow, RMIT University and lead researcher on the project said this is the first time flower-shaped microforms have been developed in a water solution.\"Organic flower-shaped morphology is still in its infancy,\" adds Boshanale. \"While tiny, they have potential to make a big impact by enabling researchers to easily and reliably build microflowers and use them to break frontiers in a range of scientific fields including chemosensors, nanotechnology, biotechnology and biomedicine.\"Flower -shaped organic structures like these also have potential in the field of non-wetting materials and for explosive detecting materials.
