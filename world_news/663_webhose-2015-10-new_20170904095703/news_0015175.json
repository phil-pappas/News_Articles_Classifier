TI has struggled recently with lackluster demand for personal electronics, particularly PCs, and communications equipment.\nIn the latest quarter, sales in both the analog segment and the embedded processing segment, which includes processors and microcontrollers, grew 2%.\nOverall, TI reported a profit of $798 million, down from $826 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings were flat at 76 cents on fewer shares outstanding.\nRevenue ticked down 2.1% to $3.43 billion.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast 68 cents a share in earnings on $3.28 billion in revenue.\nFor the current quarter, TI said it expects earnings of 64 cents to 74 cents a share on $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast 62 cents a share in earnings and $3.12 billion in revenue for the period.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n 17:39 ET (21:39 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:18:20.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
