Not only did MediaHub meet and exceed every one of our requirements but they did so with a fully working and operational demo in twenty-four hours. It really was quite impressive to see our channels up and running as if they had been with MediaHub for some time.” \nThe demo consisted of a full workflow and playout of channels that included ingest, storage, data centre services, media asset management, QC, system integration, and playout. \nThe implementation began in what was an incredibly tight timeframe from signing contracts to parallel broadcast operations. A fact and a feat not lost on Lloyd who remarked, “In just eight weeks MediaHub have managed to provide the total Australia and New Zealand playout platform and services for all FIC channels with very a compelling SLA target. This includes full data centre services for FIC, presentation, monitoring, logging and delivery of all feeds to Foxtel and SKY NZ. “ \nHe added: ‘MediaHub demonstrated a great can-do working culture with the ability to be flexible and responsive ensuring we get the best on-air presentation for our viewers which is what matters most.” \nMediaHub, founded in 2010, takes video content from external sources such as studios, outside broadcasts, international feeds or production environments and distributes it to broadcasters and to IPTV, mobile content and other handheld devices. It offers clients a centralised digital media handling facility, including presentation, master control functions, media asset management and archive storage, where content is received, prepared and distributed as required.\nMediaHub Australia CEO Alan Sweeney said, “We are absolutely delighted to have an organisation of Fox International Channels’ stature as a partner and to be handling and managing the playout for all of their channels. Not only are the Fox International Channels premium channels, but their decision to partner with MediaHub further validates our offering to the market in general. MediaHub is open for business and very ready to manage new channels and data services as the market requires.” \nFIC develops, produces and distributes 300+ wholly- and majority-owned entertainment, sports, factual and movie channels in 45 languages across Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. \nFor more information on FIC go to: http://foxinternationalchannels.com \nFor more information on MediaHub Australia go to: www.mediahubaustralia.com \nFOX INTERNATIONAL CHANNELS CHOOSES MEDIAHUB PLAYOUT PLATFORM IN ANZ ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:19:32.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
