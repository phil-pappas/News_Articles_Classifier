The company, which filed the antitrust complaint alleging Google’s bundling has harmed “fair competition,” has become the country’s leading search engine, according to Reuters .\n“Our goal is to return fair play to the market – when apps are preinstalled on mobile devices based on how good or how popular they are rather than due to restrictions imposed by the owner of the operating system,” Yandex said in a statement, CNBC reports .\nGoogle’s aggressive approach to promoting its own products has long proved controversial , but whether the approach constitutes an anticompetitive practice is still up for debate. In April, regulators in Europe charged the company with promoting its own shopping search service over that of competitors earlier this year.\nBut in South Korea, for example, a 2013 investigation into requirements that phone companies using Android load Google’s search engine found that the process didn’t violate Korean antitrust laws.\nThe company’s bundling proved more controversial in Russia, where device manufacturers told Yandex they were unable to pre-load apps made by the local company and were instead forced to use Google apps instead, prompting the company to file an antitrust complaint.\nGoogle's Russian office said in a statement that it would study the regulators’ full ruling before taking further action. “Device makers are free to use Android with or without Google applications,” a spokeswoman told the Journal, “ and consumers have complete freedom to use rival application.”", "external_links": ["http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/were-googles-practices-anti-competitive-or-just-anti-competitor", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/06/russia-demands-google-fix-anticompetitive-android.html", "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2044695/s-korea-drops-antitrust-investigation-against-google.html", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-gives-google-a-month-to-rectify-antitrust-breaches-1444130172", "http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/10/05/russia-google-idINKCN0RZ1Y720151005", "http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/15/google-shopping-so-android-probe/"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:22:56.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
