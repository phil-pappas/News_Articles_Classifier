Sortor, a 17-year-old high school student from Louisville, Kentucky, came up with the concept and developed Forte to solve a problem that most smartphone users have dealt with for years - the quiet, bass-less sound being produced by their smartphone's built-in speakers. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277904 \nForte gives you the ability to play that music or hear that phone call loudly and clearly wherever you are and whenever you want. No longer will there be a problem hearing music playing from your iPhone's speaker. With the all-new Royale Forte, your iPhone has its own audio amplifier that allows you to play your music or make that call without having a difficult time hearing it, regardless of the environment that you're in. Watching videos and sharing them to your friends is now easier and better than ever and conference calls can now be conducted on-demand. \nHoused in Forte is a large and powerful 2W driver that is routed through an amplifier to deliver warm, rich bass with uncompromising volume. Powered by a high capacity lithium-ion battery, Forte lasts for up to 8 hours of constant full-volume music playtime on a single charge. By utilizing Bluetooth technology, the Royale Forte can be quickly and easily connected as well as disconnected with the push of a button. \nAs Royale Audio Technologies' founder and CEO, Nicholas Sortor, explained, \"By creating a space separate from the phone designated completely for delivering better sound, Forte allows for audio technology previously unavailable. It creates an entirely unique and incredible audio experience, and it fits right in your pocket. It provides a sublime experience whenever you connect and press play. Regardless of where you are, Forte is always right on your phone at all times, ready to go.\" \nRoyale, an Apple-licensed MFi developer, will offer Forte in both white and black for iPhone 5 and 5S, 6 and 6S, as well as 6 Plus and 6S Plus. \nForte will be available for pre-order on Kickstarter and can be accessed on October 20, 2015 at http://www.royaleaudio.com/kickstarter . \nSRP: $129.00 LAUNCH DATE: 20 OCTOBER 2015 \nLearn more about Royale Audio Technologies, Inc. and Forte and download high-resolution photos at pr.royaleaudio.com . \nMedia Contact: Nicholas Sortor, Royale Audio Technologies, Inc., 5027419503, nsortor@royaleaudio.com \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com \nSOURCE Royale Audio Technologies, Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:37:07.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
