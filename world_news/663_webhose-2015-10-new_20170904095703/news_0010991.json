PepsiCo PEP, +0.33% and other major beverage companies continue to feel the pinch of a stronger dollar, and even more so in recent months as the U.S. currency strengthened relative to other currencies, particularly versus emerging-markets denominations.\nSome say, however, PepsiCo will make up for that in productivity gains and with the support of its strong snack business. In addition to its namesake soda, PepsiCo is the maker of Doritos, Cheetos, Ruffles and other salty snacks, as well as Quaker oatmeal.\nHere’s what to look for:\nEarnings: Pepsi is expected to report adjusted earnings of $1.27 a share in the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet. That’s down from $1.36 a share a year earlier.\nRevenue: Pepsi sales are expected to reach $16.22 billion in the quarter, led by the company’s Americas beverage division (sales of $5.2 billion), the FactSet analysts say. A year ago, Pepsi sold $17.22 billion worth of beverages and foods, and the Americas unit sold $5.38 billion.\nThe same analysts expect Pepsi’s arch-rival Coca-Cola Co. KO, +1.48% to report earnings of 50 cents a share on sales of $11.6 billion in the third quarter. Coca-Cola is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct 21.\nStock reaction: Shares of Pepsi are down 0.6% in the past three months, and up 1.6% over the last 12 months. That compares with losses of 6.2% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.43% in the past three months, and gains of less than 0.1% for the index in the last 12 months.\nWhat to watch for: Analysts at Wells Fargo expect macroeconomic headwinds to persist for Pepsi, particularly in international markets. But the Purchase, N.Y., company may sidestep that by reporting productivity gains and showing it took advantage of cheaper commodities prices to improve its margins, the analysts said.\nMoreover, brands such as sports drink Gatorade and Mountain Dew Kickstart (a line with juice content and less caffeine that launched successfully a few months ago) continued to perform well, the Wells Fargo analysts said this week.\nSodas, not so much, the analysts said. Volumes for carbonated soft drinks as well as snacks are seen softening in the quarter, Wells Fargo said. Currencies in some of Pepsi’s key markets, such as Mexico, Brazil and Russia, have been battered in relation to the dollar.\nEarlier this week, analysts at Citi cut their earnings expectations for Pepsi and other beverage makers because of the stronger dollar. The Citi analysts said they now expect PepsiCo to earn $4.53 a share this year, down from expectations of $4.54, and $4.88 (from $4.91) a share in 2016.\n“Despite improving price/mix trends, we remain uncertain about (PepsiCo’s) ability to generate consistently strong top line growth,” they said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:52:04.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
