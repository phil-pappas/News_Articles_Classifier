The tolls are said to only include those killed in the disaster at Mina, near Mecca.\nThat puts the September 24 tragedy, with hundreds still reported missing, even closer to the deadliest disaster to ever strike the hajj. A stampede in 1990 killed 1 426 people at an overcrowded pedestrian tunnel leading to holy sites in Mecca.\nSaudi officials have said their official figure of 769 killed and 934 injured in the Mina disaster remains accurate, though an investigation into its causes is ongoing. Health authorities in the kingdom previously said civil defence officials would be offering any new casualty figures, though no new toll has been released by authorities since September 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:04:55.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
