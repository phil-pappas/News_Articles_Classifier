October 7, 2015 \nQUEBEC CITY — Just a little over three years after the start of operations at its new building on rue des Rocailles in Quebec City, Maheu&Maheu just received the LEED Silver certification from the Canada Green Building Council (CaGBC). This is a higher level than that aimed for in the beginning, the \"certified\" level, based on the rating system of CaGBC. The building, designed by BGLA architects and built by Construction Béland & Lapointe, integrates unique and cutting-edge architectural features. Indeed, the structural glass curtain wall made by IC2 Technologies was the first built for a commercial project in the province of Quebec. The building has several other features aimed at optimizing energy efficiency including solar panels preheating fresh air and it is equipped with a green roof.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:20:17.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
