Most cases of recurrent genital Herpes are caused by HSV-2, and approximately 50 million persons in the United States are infected with this type of genital Herpes. However, MPWH is bringing hope to those living with Herpes through an app that brings singles together, with the ease of Tinder-style use. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150930/272439 \n\"There's a terrible tendency to write off people with Herpes in the dating world,\" said Michelle Li, the Co-founder for MPWH app. \"On the general dating sites or apps, many singles with Herpes are often rejected by others immediately after they disclose their condition. It's not fair. Should they be denied an opportunity for love simply because they struggle with a disease? This was how the MPWH app came into being.\" \nWith the new Tinder-style feature, MPWH makes dating much easier for people with Herpes (HSV-1 & HSV-2). The app shares many of the same features as Tinder along with some unique upgrades. On Tinder, users are given one profile at a time. Users can swipe right to like someone, and swipe left to dislike someone. The system will notify only when they like each other. The person on the other end won't know if they dislike them. Therefore, users don't need to feel depressed and being rejected when a user send a message to another, but they don't reply them. \n\"The basic idea behind launching the MPWH app was to lend credence to the phenomenon of Herpes dating. With an exclusive dating platform accessible from one's smartphone or other mobile devices, the process of finding a perfect partner has become simpler than ever before,\" said Michelle Li. \"MPWH currently is a Free Herps dating community especially for those people with Herpes. Due to the difficulties that Herpes singles meet and originally aim to support more people with Herpes, we would seek for financial assistance in the future regardless of the enormous cost of operating now.\" \nThe app also boasts user-created blogs. The blogs enable users to share their thoughts on any topic they like: life stories of living with Herpes, experiences of Dating with Herpes and more. It's a great place for anyone who is newly diagnosed to ask for help and information, and to talk to others who understand what they are going through. \nThe MPWH app is currently available in the iTunes Store and Google Play Store .
