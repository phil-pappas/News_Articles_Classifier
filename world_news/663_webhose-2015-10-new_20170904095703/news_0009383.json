One driver, Sasha Antman, sued Uber alleging poor network security.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco ruled that Antman had not plausibly alleged that Uber's conduct surrounding the data breach caused injury. Beeler gave Antman's attorneys 28 days to file an amended lawsuit to try to establish legal standing.\n(Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Jonathan Oatis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:04:11.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
