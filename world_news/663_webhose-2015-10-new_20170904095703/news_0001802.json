We certainly have a chance to outrun it and that is why we firmly reiterated,\" he told journalists.\nThe company expects operating profit of 5.6-5.9 billion euros this year, which would at least match the prior year figure of 5.6 billion.\nCLOUD RISES\nSAP is targeting an increase in cloud and software revenue of 8-10 percent in constant currencies during 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.\nSAP's cloud and software revenue were already up by 11 percent at 11.85 billion euros during the first nine months of 2015. Analysts say the swing factor in the fourth quarter will be how sales of SAP's classic packaged software perform.\nSAP shares were little changed at 0820 GMT, having gained last week when third quarter figures were released early.\nSAP reported a 19-percent rise in third-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, to 1.62 billion euros (US$1.84 billion) as revenue rose 17 percent to 4.12 billion euros. In constant-currency terms, revenue rose 10 percent.\nIBM, the world's largest technology services provider, blamed weakness in its consulting and storage businesses, along with a severe decline in emerging markets, where sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China plunged a combined 30 percent.\nBy contrast, SAP's third-quarter results were driven by strong growth in North America and Europe, especially France and Germany, while weakness in certain emerging markets including China and Brazil was offset by strength in India, South Korea and elsewhere in Latin America.\nGross margins in its cloud business grew 9 percentage points, Luka Mucic, the company's chief financial officer, said. That helped SAP beat expectations for profits, excluding special items, for the first time in six quarters, Morgan Stanley noted.\nThe final quarter of the year is traditionally SAP's strongest period as companies renew existing software licences but this factor could prove volatile against the backdrop of economic uncertainty, brokerage Berenberg predicted recently.
