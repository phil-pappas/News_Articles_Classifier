The 10,500 TEU Gustav Maersk called at Haifa Port and was unloaded at a rate of 135 moves per hour, using 4 of the 6 STS cranes in Haifa’s Carmel Terminal.\nCEO of Haifa Port Mendi Zaltzman said: “This is a great day for the Israeli economy and a huge day for us. We are thankful for the trust and cooperation we get from Maersk and MSC.”\nThe call represents the dawn of a new era for East Asian imports to Israel – Israel’s largest and most important trade route aside from Western Europe.\nAccording to the Israel Shipping & Ports Authority, imports will total more than 200,000 containers annually once the 2M Alliance’s ships begin to call at Haifa Port on a weekly basis.\nMendi Zaltzman concluded: “I am satisfied by our efficiency today, dealing with such a big vessel, and I am sure that this cooperation between us and the 2M will expand in the near future.”\nView a birdseye video of Haifa Port unloading the Gustav Maersk below:\n \n\nRead a Technical Paper from Haifa Port on the implementation of automation \nFor more news on Haifa Port, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:07.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
