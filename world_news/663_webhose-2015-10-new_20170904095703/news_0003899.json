Firmware is among the products his company will rate, and hardware will \"come into play in certain situations,\" Zatko told the publication. \nThe goal is to come up with a cyber equivalent of Underwriters Laboratories' testing regime that vets electronic devices for safety. \nChristopher Soghoian, principal technologist and a senior policy analyst for the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, questioned the award on the grounds that Zatko once worked for DARPA. \n\"I love the idea of a cyber Underwriters Labs, but DARPA giving half a mil to an ex-DARPA manager looks a bit iffy,\" Soghoian tweeted . GSA adds IT resources to Acquisition Gateway \nThe General Services Administration has added three categories to its IT Hardware and IT Software hallways in its Acquisition Gateway, bringing the total to 17. \nIn an Oct. 7 blog post , Mary Davie, assistant commissioner of the agency's Office of Integrated Technology Services, said the new categories cover telecommunications, IT services and IT security. \nGSA is developing the gateway to provide a one-stop resource for federal buyers looking for IT goods and services. Gateway managers gather a wide range of resources, including pricing tools and information, guides, best practices, and expert articles. \nCurrently, only federal users have access to the Acquisition Gateway, but Davie said her agency will give industry stakeholders, state and local government procurement officials, and the general public a view into the service by early fiscal 2016. Former top cyber official lands at D.C. law firm \nAri Schwartz, who recently left his job as senior director for cybersecurity at the National Security Council, is joining Washington, D.C., law firm Venable as managing director of cybersecurity services. \nIn his work at the White House, Schwartz was responsible for coordinating network defense cybersecurity policy, including critical infrastructure protection, federal network protection, supply-chain efforts, cybersecurity standards promotion and information sharing. \nIn his new position, Schwartz will help clients and the firm's attorneys understand risk management strategies and cybersecurity policy, including implementation of the White House's Cybersecurity Framework and other tools. NASA gives startups a hand with tech \nNASA is offering more than 1,200 of its patented technologies to startups for free (at first), the agency announced Oct. 7. \nStartup NASA , part of NASA's Technology Transfer Program, will enable young companies to pay nothing upfront to license patented NASA tech ranging from materials to advanced sensors. \n\"The Startup NASA initiative leverages the results of our cutting-edge research and development so entrepreneurs can take that research -- and some risks -- to create new products and new services,\" said David Miller, NASA's chief technologist.
