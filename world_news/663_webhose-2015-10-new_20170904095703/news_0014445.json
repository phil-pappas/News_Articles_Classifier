A spinal cord injury may interrupt communication between the nerves in the spinal cord that control bladder and bowel function and the brain, causing incontinence. \nLoss of bowel control causes embarrassment, even humiliation. Bowel dysfunction, secondary to spinal cord injury, reduces quality of life. Fecal incontinence in SCI is the #1 risk factor for development of pressure ulcers. \nContact:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:19:38.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
