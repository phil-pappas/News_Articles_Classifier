A smiling Clinton reached over to shake his hand and said, \"Thank you, Bernie.\"\nWhile the five candidates onstage took issue with each other, they also repeatedly sounded traditional Democratic themes, such as fighting income inequality that are sure to carry over to the general election campaign against the Republicans. They also sought to cast the Republicans as a party focused on sowing division and denigrating minorities and women.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:07:47.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
