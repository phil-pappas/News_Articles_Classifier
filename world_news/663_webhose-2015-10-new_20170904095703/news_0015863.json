The hall has been packed with technology – and test and R&D engineers wanting to buy it!”\nHunt’s view was backed up by show visitor Lee Tatarczuk, a senior test engineer and electrical specialist at Webasto Roof Systems: “I was sent here on a mission to find a couple of things such as torque sensors and data acquisition – there are so many to choose from! It’s been a great experience.” Meanwhile, exhibitors were equally as happy, with Bill Willis, president of Dyno One, describing Automotive Testing Expo North America as “probably the best show we’ve attended in the last two to three years”. Likewise, Ron Mederski, national sales manager, Q Corporation, said: “We’ve had lots of genuine inquiries, good questions and all our competitors are here so we know it’s the place to be”, while Alex Karapetian, director of sales and marketing, commented: “It’s been fantastic, we’ve gotten a lot of high-quality sales leads, there’s great traffic and we’ve gotten to meet a lot of existing customers too.”\nThis year’s Automotive Testing Expo has quite probably been home to more brand-new testing technology launches than ever before. For example, visitors to InfraTec’s booth witnessed the company showcase its new VarioCAM HD head thermographic high-resolution camera system. This piece of equipment uses uncooled microbolometer FPA detectors with 640 x 480 or 1,024 x 768 IR pixels. In combination with the integrated optomechanical Microscan feature, which was designed for continuous operation, it generates image formats with geometrical resolutions of up to 3.1 megapixels. For capturing minute details on the largest of surfaces efficiently, the VarioCAM HD head produces high-quality thermographic images with 16 bits. Thanks to the maximum frame rate of 240Hz, very quick temperature changes can be recognized reliably. Sets of equipment make it easy to adjust the setup to the respective measurement task.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:40:24.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
