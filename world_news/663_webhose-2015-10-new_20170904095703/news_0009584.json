Since advanced evasion techniques make it impossible to prevent all attacks, it is critical to have visibility into network behavior in real time and over time. In his presentation, Newman will discuss how organizations can eliminate blind spots that keep them from detecting hidden or unknown adversaries. Organizations must accept that compromise is inevitable but so too is the ability to take action before data theft. As an industry we must shift our energies towards finding the compromised devices on a network early so that we don’t become accustomed to breaches hitting the ‘millions of records’ mark before they are detected. \nThe full agenda can be found at https://www.fbcinc.com/e/cybermdconference/agendagrid.aspx WHAT:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:00:06.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
