Mr Aagesen believes that technology will also play a key role in meeting customer needs as they consistently require sustainable transport.\nHe said: \"It's important that the industry adapts. Partly, to comply with many of the upcoming environmental requirements but also to maintain its competitive edge, so that players can always be at the forefront and deliver the best product to end customers, who in turn also demand increasingly sustainable transport from carriers.\n“It will benefit carriers, as their ships become more efficient this will translate to bottom line results. So it's a win-win situation for them.\"\nLloyd’s Register recently identified eight technologies that will be crucial for the future of shipping and to maintain global competitiveness. They included Big Data analysis, robotics, sensors, more ship-building and smart ships.\nRead: Smart Ships to Revolutionise Shipping \nJesper Aagesen added: \"The construction of increasingly advanced ships will demand more from shipyards and ship designers. They'll need to think in terms of system integration and a lot more holistically.\n“Shipbuilding has traditionally divided construction areas, with one group focusing on hull design, another on steel structure, a third on the machinery and a fourth on the electrical work. This will be much more integrated in the future.\"\nThe next generation of technology for ships could be in full operation by the year 2030, with many shipping lines adopting Big Data and sensor technologies in order to boost the capabilities of their ships and to optimise the overall supply chain.\nRead about how Big Data can be applied to ports and terminals \n\n(Source: Lloyd's Register)\nFor all the latest on smart ships, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:07.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
