In early August, media stocks including Disney, Viacom and Time Warner fell sharply. Investors seem to be worried, principally, about one thing: The prospective undoing of the expensive cable television bundle.\nPeople seem to be growing agitated with their cable bills, especially as more online choices such as Netflix or Hulu are being offered at a fraction of the price.\nMost industry analysts agree that the bundle, as it exists now, is in trouble. Or, as CBS’s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, put it earlier this year: “The days of the 500-channel universe are over.”\n$92 Average monthly cable bill, including standard fees\n“The days of the 150-channel universe in the home, not necessarily over, are changing rapidly,” he continued. “There’s going to be people who are going to be slicing it and dicing it in different ways.”\nMost Read Stories Win over USC puts UW’s coaching upgrade (Chris Petersen over Steve Sarkisian) on full display Lloyd McClendon will not return as Mariners' manager Expect traffic delays when Obama visits Seattle Friday afternoon Huskies upset USC 17-12 and beat Steve Sarkisian, their former coach Obama visits Seattle for fundraisers; traffic not as bad as expected Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. But what does all that slicing and dicing mean for consumers? There is more television programming than ever, and far more choice of when and where to watch it. But in a few years, if the cable bundle as it exists is coming apart, will people who want to watch a variety of television actually pay more or less?\nAnalysts are divided, but some see a path for a cheaper cable bill. That will result from what one analyst described as increased offerings of so-called skinny bundles, or slimmer packages than the hundred-plus cable channels of today.\n“The skinny bundle is going to pick up speed,” said Tony Lenoir, a senior analyst at SNL Kagan. “There will be more choices, and that is all good from a consumer’s point of view.”\nAll good, in this case, could include the amount a consumer spends, but how the consumer will spend in the new environment is an open question.\nYou might drop an expensive cable bill to get a slimmer package, such as one offered by Sling for about $20 a month that comes with greatly reduced channel offerings. Then that could be supplemented by other online services such as Net­flix ($8 a month), HBO Now ($15 a month) or Amazon Prime ($8.25 a month). But what offerings will be available in the future is unclear.\n“I’m not sure the savings will go into buying HBO, Netflix and Hulu,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG. “You could probably spend some of the difference, but you spend it on other forms of entertainment.”\nThat could include online gaming, or a future in which a YouTube star will command paid subscriptions for access to content.\nThe current bundle, however, could be more appealing than a la carte programming. Buying a la carte would allow consumers to pay for only the channels they want — a common demand of unhappy cable subscribers — but they could end up paying more.\n$55 Monthly coast of a “skinny bundle” offered by Verizon, which prompted a lawsuit by ESPN\n“This is where it gets interesting,” said Michael Goodman, the director of digital media strategies at Strategy Analytics. “The pendulum is clearly swinging in the direction of skinny bundles, and likely at some point you’ll start to see a la carte programming. But be careful what you ask for.”\nRight now, there is pressure for change and resistance to it. ESPN has lost roughly 3 million subscribers in the past year, according to Niel­sen, because of people’s cancellation of their cable subscriptions.\n$50 Monthly cost for PlayStation Vue, assuming the customer already owns a PlayStation\nIn April, ESPN sued Verizon over the slimmer, $55-a-month cable package it had begun offering, called FiOS Custom TV, at a significant discount from the average cable bill. ESPN, along with other media companies such as NBCUniversal and Fox, said Verizon’s controversial cable plan violated contracts under which Verizon pays to carry channels on a per-subscriber basis.\nMedia analysts were skeptical about the FiOS Custom TV package because it would charge additional fees if people wanted to add channels from a range of categories such as children’s and pop-culture programming.\n$43 Combined monthly cost of Sling, with limited channel offerings, with Netflix and HBO Now\nGiven such pricing tactics, some analysts still defend the merits of the bundle.\n“Do you want to lose 90 percent of your content and save the equivalent of three glasses of wine?” said David Bank, a media analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “It’s a solution looking for a problem, from a pure economic perspective.”\nThe bundle offers choice and is a “really good system we have going,” Bank said. And he is not convinced that the majority of Americans are going to opt out in the next five years.\n“I don’t think the revolution is about to hit us,” he said. “It’s much harder to call outside of the next 10 years.”\nThe problem, analysts said, isn’t the channel bundle itself: It’s the fees providers charge, including set-top box rental and router fees. As a result, the average cable bill has ballooned to $92 a month, according to SNL Kagan.\n“When Comcast says it costs $50 or $75 or whatever, it doesn’t really cost that much,” said Goodman, of Strategy Analytics. “It costs another $30 to $50 more when you pay those various fees.”\nGoodman said this makes a service such as PlayStation Vue — available starting at $50 a month on Sony game consoles and other devices — attractive and possibly a model for the future.\n“Sony does not have to charge you for a set-top box and they don’t have to recoup the price of the equipment because you already paid for your PlayStation,” he said.\nPlayStation Vue is not without its problems: It does not offer popular channels such as ESPN or Discovery. But it represents the sort of arithmetic that has made some analysts optimistic that consumers will pay less in the next five years or so for similar skinny bundles.\nThe future, Goodman argues, is one in which the consumer will likely pay less but will have to be vigilant about what to mix and match — or slice and dice.\n“More choice,” he continued, “means you’re going to have to pay attention to what you’re buying.”\nJOHN KOBLIN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:54:58.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
