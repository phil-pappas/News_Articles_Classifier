In this week's Swipe, the team speak to Rebecca Pick, 22, who hopes her invention will help prevent future attacks on people who may find themselves in a vulnerable position.\nNationwide there were 80,262 sexual offences reported to police last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThere are many apps out there which can help you stay safe - but it is not always possible to get to your phone or device in a struggle.\nSo taking inspiration from wearable technology, Ms Pick went with a design that lets you clip the alarm onto a bra strap or belt - making it more discreet.\nPlay video \"Anti-Attacker Alarms\" Video: Anti-Attacker Alarms \"The Personal Guardian is a lightweight, discreet, personal attack and lone working alarm,\" the Strathclyde University postgraduate said.\n\"When you activate it, it will connect via your smartphone to a central monitoring station, who listen in and assess the situation. They send all that information to the police along with your GPS location, who respond as a high priority response.\n\"It also texts your friends and family, so they know where you are and can also race to help.\n\"The monitoring station also records all the dialogue, which can be used in court to help secure a conviction.\"\nAs well as devices incorporating GPS tracking, there are a wide variety of personal safety apps.\n1 / 10 Gallery: The Apps That Can Help Keep You Safe\nThe bSafe app enables users to share their location with an assigned contact group. The app also features an SOS button, which stores the location, voice and video footage of the surroundings\nSome, for example, alert you if you are entering a high crime area, others - like the Watch Over Me app - let you share your journey with selected friends or family in real time.\nThe Companion app also lets you choose friends to accompany you on your way home. The app detects spikes in your heartbeat and can sound an alarm or send a message to a police station.\nAnother, the React Mobile Safety app, has a 'share your location feature' and an 'SOS' button which sends friends an emergency text, which can be optionally posted to social media sites.\nHowever, security expert Kirsty Henderson, founder of Personal Safety London, says these apps should not be relied on.\n\"If you are under duress or you are experiencing fear or high stress, you have physiological responses to that,\" she said.\nPlay video \"Can Phones Really Keep You Safe?\" Video: Can Phones Really Keep You Safe? \"When your heart rate goes up, your cognitive processing drops and your fine motor movements - and the dexterity in your fingers - is not available to you.\n\"If you were very scared, you would not be able to actually function any of those functionality keys.\"\n:: You can watch Swipe on Sky News on Friday at 9.30pm, Saturday at 2.30pm and Sunday at 8.30pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T14:50:00.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
