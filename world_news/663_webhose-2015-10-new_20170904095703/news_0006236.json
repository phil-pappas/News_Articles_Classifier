The burning of any combustible material, especially organic minerals, economically is no longer a viable concept. It is a criminal act against our environment. The sooner hydrogen replaces natural gas, oil and coal, the sooner humanity will get rid of smog, global warming and the threat of irreversible climate change.\nThe fact that hydrogen fuel cells have become a bridge for the transition to a hydrogen economy in the US government is something that was realized relatively recently. Only in 2005, the Energy Bill was signed, in which special attention was paid to fuel cells and authorizes money for research into hydrogen fuel cells. Obstacles on the path to the mass use of fuel cells was the lack of infrastructure associated with the production, storage, transportation and the relatively high cost of hydrogen. These obstacles are reduced or limited by the concept of rotary fuel cells (RFS) Serices”Sigma-1A”. This concept has been expediently and experimentally proven. Our development is a combination of the rotary electrolytic generator and classic fuel cell.\nThe main features of RFS \"Sigma-1A\" are:\n1. In RFS \"Sigma-1A\", instead of the traditional projects \"one cathode, one anode\" the used scheme is, \"one anode - seven cathodes.\" The six cathodes are under process, and the seventh, the reserve, comes into operation when there is a need to replace one of the cathodes, which is depleted. That ensures continuity of RFS \"Sigma-1A\".\n2. The continuity of the process was achieved only due to the fact that in 2015 I had synthesized a new chemical solution, which prevents the formation of oxide film on the surface of the cathode. ( http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/08/prweb12897587.htm ). (Two delegations representing the interests of investors from Michigan and New York, NY visualized the results achieved.)\n3. Each of the six cathodes through the liquid medium successively comes into electrical contact with a single anode for a certain time, during which there is an intensive dissociation aqueous solution to form a positive and a negative of charged ions. Thus, during the one cycle, this process is repeated 6 times, allowing for a few seconds of \"emission\" dense ion flows. Which significantly improves performance of actual fuel cells?\n4. We have paid attention to the fact that the benefits of such an approach to the process of the dissociated water molecules is increased eight-fold due to the multi cathode schemes functioning fuel cell, and due to the effect in some ways similar to the phenomenon of hysteresis in magnetism. That means that even after an interruption of direct electrical contact, the cathode and anode, through a liquid medium, continue formation of the stream, exponentially decreasing positive and negative ions.\n5. It is known that the classic electrolysis is energetically unfavorable because part of the energy supplied to the electrodes and to the heat is consumed. Almost 20 years ago, at a seminar dedicated to the problem of creating in a closed system a perpetual motion machine of the first kind, I put forward the idea of the possibility of combining exothermic and endothermic reactions to break the hydrogen bonding of water molecules. Efficiency of the process can thus approach 90% and above. This idea has been implemented in my project RFS \"Sigma-1A\".\n6. One of the important advantages of RFS \"Sigma-1A\" is that it does not require expensive proton membranes. Streams of charged positive and negative ions are produced in different vessels and do not contact each other.\n7. Applying of the RFS “Sigma-1A” does not require transportation and storage of intermediate products of the process (oxygen and hydrogen) and the final product of electrical power (high voltage transmission lines, raising and lowering stations and electrical transformers on pole). The RFS \"Sigma-1A “ allows both products to be on-demand anywhere and at any required amount. Attempts to construct RFS “Sigma-1A” in my home workshop had to stop because it is impossible to achieve the required technological level in such a setting. Developing this revolutionary project requires a production facility, modern equipment and tools.\nFor more information contact:\nProf. Konstantin Balakiryan\nk(dot)balakiryan(at)gmail(dot)com\nRebecca Castro\n602-799-8699\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13001867.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/08/prweb12897587.htm", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13001867.htm"], "published": "2015-10-05T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:03:05.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
