It is well suited to predict general free-surface and/or multiphase flows – such as macroscopic oil flow in powertrain assemblies and fluid sloshing in tanks – while analyzing forces and torques on individual components. The meshless approach of nanoFluidX and utilization of GPU-based technology empowers high-performance simulations of real geometries.\nultraFluidX is specifically suited to predict aerodynamic properties for vehicles of all types with unbeatable speed. The software is based on the Lattice Boltzmann method and especially designed to leverage GPU technology, providing users with high performance and dramatically reducing the model preparation time for large, complex models. The integrated volume meshing and fast overnight transient analyses deliver short turnaround times, resulting in completely new possibilities for simulation-driven optimization and significant cost savings.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/5_web-Altair-Partner-Alliance_front_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:55:47.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
