You've been able to install software to block them on desktop computers for a while, but Apple has allowed them on phones for the first time in its latest software update - iOS9.\nThis is mobile web browsing we're talking about here, so you won't see any change in the apps you use on your iPhone, but you can now buy software to block some kinds of adverts in browsers like Safari.\nBut this move by Apple has opened up a debate. Blocking adverts: is it fair?\nThe people making ad-blocking apps certainly think so.\n\"We believe that the user should always have control over how they consume the content and how they use their devices,\" said Chris Aljoudi, the lead developer of the Purify ad-blocking app.\nThis kind of software is proving popular - in the UK around 12 million of us are actively blocking adverts each month.\nBut whatever you think of them, those adverts are at least in part paying for the content you're looking at.\n\"We have to help people appreciate that what they receive for free costs money to produce,\" said Nigel Gwilliam from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising.\n\"If you strangulate the ability for people to make money in return for content production, they simply won't make content.\"\nOne developer pulled his chart-topping advert-blocking app just two days after its release due to a change of heart.\nMarco Arment said the success \"just doesn't feel good\".\nHe described the ad-blocking debate as a \"kind of war\" with consumers on one side and advertisers on the other.\nOne answer is to make changes to advertising.\nAnti-ad block company PageFair helps websites create what are called \"non-intrusive\" adverts.\n\"We need ads that respect the user and support the publisher. Advertising 2.0 must be better,\" said PageFair boss Johnny Ryan.\nPatrick Goss, TechRadarâ€™s global editor-in-chief, agrees that it's time for advertising to change.\n\"Adverts have become a problem,\" he said. \"They've stopped people being able to look at the sites that they love.\n\"This is a wake-up call for the industry. We have to change.\n\"We have to be a little bit gentler with the way that we advertise ... and we have to make sure that we're putting the user first.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:17:32.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
