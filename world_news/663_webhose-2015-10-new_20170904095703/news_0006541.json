The new robotic system does not require a large console in an adjacent room or bedside within the OR, such as those required by the current Surgical Robots on the US market. \nThe system may be used with flexible and rigid mini-invasive instruments. The surgical instruments will have 7 degrees of freedom, 360 degrees of articulation, and Canady Flex Lapo Wrist TM motion and finger tip control. Surgical instruments for use with the System will be compatible with any single port system on the market. This innovation will allow surgeons to operate the robotic surgical system at the operating table, leveraging an approach common to current laparoscopic products on the market. The robotic system will also integrate 3-D optic technologies via the new Canady PanOptes TM systems. \nAbout US Medical Innovations \nUS Medical Innovations, LLC (USMI), an innovate leader in the field of plasma technology for the eradication of cancer, is a private FDA registered U.S. biomedical device specification manufacturing company founded by surgeon and inventor, Dr. Jerome Canady. USMI’s focus is developing advanced, innovative and affordable plasma electrosurgical devices. The company’s products are designed for ambulatory and inpatient endoscopy centers as well as complex surgical procedures. \nAbout the Canady Hybrid Plasma ™ Scalpel \nThe Canady Hybrid Plasma ™ Scalpel is the first multifunctional electrosurgical scalpel in the world allowing a surgeon to simultaneously cut and coagulate through biological tissue at a temperature of less than 98°F, significantly reducing intraoperative blood loss and operative time, improving wound healing, minimizing the length of stay for the patient, and reducing the risk of hospital acquired infections.
