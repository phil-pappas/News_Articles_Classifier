Announced every two years, the winning workplaces are chosen after reviewing hundreds of companies and 10,000 employee surveys. \n“Over the past year, we have grown our staff by 76%, which makes this award even more meaningful since we have been able to maintain our positive company culture while adding new talent,” said Tripp Donnelly, RepEquity’s CEO and founder. “We take great pride in the work we do and embrace a company culture that celebrates every employee’s individual contribution and talent.” \nThe 50 winning workplaces were chosen on the basis of factors such as: challenging and interesting work, great work/life balance, generous pay and benefits, opportunities to learn and grow, commitment to charity and community, and the recognition and respect given to employees. \n“RepEquity is a great company because of its employees, and we work hard to create an environment that nurtures creativity and rewards initiative,” Donnelly said. “The result is a team that is passionate about our client’s success, dedicated to quality work and building a great company.
