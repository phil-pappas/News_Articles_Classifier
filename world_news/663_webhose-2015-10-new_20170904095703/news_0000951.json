The upwind part of the nacelle lowers smoothly to the service position in a rapid, easy and secure operation. \nThe Vergnet GEV HP 1 MW can also be installed in high wind-prone areas (where previously only reinforced class-1 conventional wind turbines could be installed) and can sustain hurricane-force winds of up to Category 5 (250km/h). In the case of a hurricane alert, the upwind nacelle, including the rotor blades, is lowered to the landing platform and secured to the ground. \n120 wind turbines of this type are currently under construction for the Ethiopian National Electricity Company (EEPCo).
