Probing electron behaviour at the tips of nanocones February 5, 2015 \nOne of the ways of improving electrons manipulation is though better control over one of their inner characteristics, called spin. This approach is the object of an entire field of study, known as spintronics. Now, Richard ... Ultrafast uncoupled magnetism in atoms September 10, 2015 \nFuture computers will require a magnetic material which can be manipulated ultra-rapidly by breaking the strong magnetic coupling. A study has been published in Nature Communications today in which Swedish and German scientists ... Study is the first to apply measurement methods in spin caloritronics field September 23, 2015 \nAn experiment at Tohoku University (Japan) in 2008 laid the foundations for research on 'spin caloritronics' – a field that aims to develop more effective and energy-saving data processing in information technology. Since ... Spin lifetime of electrons in graphene increased by magnetic fields October 2, 2015 \nResearchers at Chalmers University of Technology shows that applying a moderate in-plane magnetic field increases spin lifetime of electrons in graphene. The results of this work have profound implications for graphene's ... Physicists turn toward heat to study electron spin October 6, 2015 \nThe quest to control and understand the intrinsic spin of electrons to advance nanoscale electronics is hampered by how hard it is to measure tiny, fast magnetic devices. Recommended for you Physicists trace origin of electromagnetic interaction to Dirac equation October 12, 2015 \nAn international group of physicists has traced the origin of an electromagnetic interaction to the Dirac equation, a fundamental equation of quantum physics. Perfectly accurate clocks turn out to be impossible October 7, 2015 \nCan the passage of time be measured precisely, always and everywhere? The answer will upset many watchmakers. A team of physicists from the universities of Warsaw and Nottingham have just shown that when we are dealing with ... How the neutrino could solve great cosmic mysteries and win its next Nobel Prize October 9, 2015 \nThe humble neutrino particle won its fourth Nobel Prize in physics this year (also in 2002, 1995 and 1988). Despite being millions of times smaller than other subatomic particles, it is of major importance in physics and ... MacGyver this! New DIY experiment shows students the physics of climate change October 8, 2015 \nFishing line, paper clips, glass marble, glue - no, not the makings of a MacGyver episode but a new experiment that lets students precisely measure the effects of global warming on oceans. 200-terawatt laser brings new extremes in heat, pressure to X-ray experiments October 6, 2015 \nA newly upgraded high-power laser at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory will blaze new trails across many fields of science by recreating the universe's most extreme conditions, such as those ... The topolariton, a new half-matter, half-light particle October 7, 2015 \nA new type of \"quasiparticle\" theorized by Caltech's Gil Refael, a professor of theoretical physics and condensed matter theory, could help improve the efficiency of a wide range of photonic devices—technologies, such as ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:40:14.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
