With that type of efficiency, you can have your online store up and running in less than a day,” said Alex Head, owner of Drink Dispatch . “The integration allows for inventory continuity and a better customer experience, which are necessities when you’re offering your customers options like one-hour delivery.” \nOnce merchants connect Square with Bigcommerce, they don’t have to worry about overselling because inventory levels adjust after every sale. Through unified reporting, merchants gain a single view of inventory, allowing them to see what products are available, running low or needing reordering. Business owners are also able to manually adjust stock levels through the Bigcommerce control panel and have it update automatically in Square. \nThrough the integration, Bigcommerce and Square customers are able to: Increase sales by expanding their business beyond physical retail and point of sale locations Reduce complexity of managing inventory across multiple sales channels Avoid poor customer experiences created by overselling and cancelled orders Eliminate the need for manual bookkeeping across multiple sales channels \nBigcommerce and Square will also deliver functionality that enables online sellers to sync their inventory to Square for in-person transactions. Availability is expected this quarter; interested merchants can register to receive updates at http://www.bigcommerce.com/square . \nAbout Bigcommerce \nBigcommerce is the leading cloud ecommerce platform for fast-growing and mid-market brands.
