Since ProtonPACS is a flexible and scalable solution, each new client was able to tailor the system to work within their specific environments.\nOnCall Emergency Centers strives to provide patients with exceptional customer service and low wait times in their full-service emergency care centers located in Texas. ProtonPACS assisted with their mission by simplifying their integrations with existing partners and by providing a superior and more efficient PACS viewer. “ProtonPACS integrated with our EMR vendor to provide modality worklist and a seamless workflow, both things that our previous PACS provider could not deliver,” stated Daniel Garcia, Director of Radiology.\nProtonPACS also leveraged their existing integration with RAYS, OnCall Emergency Centers’ radiology exam interpretation provider, Garcia noted, “Since ProtonPACS came to the table already integrated with RAYS, our implementation was simplified and our upfront investment costs were mitigated.” In addition, the ER physicians now have instant access to all clinically relevant information with ProtonPACS’ ability to display images and reports in the same view.\nAbout ProtonPACS\nProtonPACS by Radsource provides hospitals, imaging centers and physician practices everything needed to optimize imaging workflow and increase profitability. By combining award-winning PACS software with proactive support, speech recognition, report delivery and guaranteed secure archiving, ProtonPACS delivers a fully functional and flexible PACS solution in a cost effective fee per study model.
