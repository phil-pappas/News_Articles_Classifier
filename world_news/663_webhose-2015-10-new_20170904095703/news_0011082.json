Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR) has launched a newly upgraded ProxyVote.com site which improves the shareholder communication and proxy voting experience for millions of individual shareholders of virtually all publicly-traded companies and mutual funds.\n\"ProxyVote.com has long been a key technology in the corporate governance process,\" said Broadridge Investor Communications Solutions President Robert Schifellite . \"Since its launch more than 17 years ago, usage has grown tremendously and, in the past year alone, more than two-thirds of all proxy votes by individual shareholders were cast on ProxyVote.com. The newly upgraded platform reflects extensive input from individual investors, companies, broker-dealers, corporate governance experts, and regulators.\"\n\"Better usability of the proxy voting platform is key so that shareholders feel welcome by the companies they invest in,\" said Broc Romanek , editor of TheCorporateCounsel.net.\nBroadridge's ProxyVote.com is designed for use by beneficial and registered shareholders, including mutual fund owners, in the U.S. and Canada. The website features a user interface that's optimized to provide a consistent experience across all devices - desktops, tablets and smartphones.\nNew features make it easier for shareholders to review proxy information and other communications, and to cast informed votes. Examples include a capability to vote additional ballots, with fewer steps, for other shares held in current meetings, and to easily view additional communications from issuers, including video and virtual shareholder meetings. As part of this initiative, Broadridge also redesigned the content and format of the email messages that initiate proxy communications with shareholders. Broker-dealers can also easily add their branding and custom messages.\nAbout Broadridge\nBroadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.
