The hacking skills contest, called Capture the Flag (CTF), is the signature event of NYU CSAW, which draws tens of thousands of students every year through online preliminaries and sends the finalists to compete in six in-person events at the school's Downtown Brooklyn campus. \nCapture the Flag events are essential training competitions for students interested in cybersecurity careers. Designed to test a range of both offensive and defensive skills, including vulnerability testing, exploit discovery, and reverse engineering, CTFs are widely used to train both students and security industry professionals. As competitors advance through the challenges, they earn points, or \"flags,\" with winners qualifying for cash prizes and trips to New York City for the CSAW finals November 12-14, 2015 . \nFifteen teams will compete at the CSAW CTF Finals in New York : \n1. 1064CBread,   University of California, Santa Barbara ; California Institute of Technology ( Pasadena ); Dos Pueblos High School ( Goleta, CA ); Thomas Jefferson High School of Science and Technology ( Alexandria, VA ). \nTeam members: Andrew Dutcher (UCSB), Alex Meiburg (Caltech), John Grosen (DPHS), Samuel Kim (TJHS)\n2. asciioverflow, University of Tulsa \nTeam members:  Ryan McCarthy, Michael Frohlich , Matthew Hruz , Gavin Bauer \n3.

This year, the event drew 2,454 teams from 92 countries. Interest in CTF events has skyrocketed in recent years, as more students are exploring careers in cybersecurity—one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative fields in the sciences due in part to high demand and a low supply of highly trained workers. In 2011, just 209 teams scored points in the CSAW CTF. This year, more than six times that number—1,367 teams—scored in the event. \n\"The booming interest in CTF, and the skill level of those participating in all CSAW events, is very exciting,\" said Nasir Memon , NYU CSAW founder and chair of the Tandon School of Engineering's Department of Computer Science and Engineering. \"Over the past 12 years, we've grown CSAW into an event for anyone interested in computer security, from the high school level all the way through doctoral candidates and professionals. CSAW is legendarily hard but it's also incredibly fun—there's no better way to capture students' interest in this vital field.\" \nOne finalist team, 1064CBread, has two high school and two college members, and is the only CTF finalist team that includes high school competitors. The team formed at Dos Pueblos High School several years ago, and despite half of its members graduating and going to college, the group continues to compete together and will reunite at CSAW. \nThis year is also the first in many that a team from the NYU School of Engineering has qualified for the CTF Finals, a phenomenon explained by the nature of NYU CSAW itself. \"CSAW challenges are designed by students with guidance from faculty, and our top students are usually occupied with creating the event,\" explained Eric Liang , a senior majoring in computer science at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and the Student Leader for CSAW CTF. \nOn the opposite end of the spectrum from open-to-all Capture the Flag is the NYU CSAW Embedded Security Challenge —the oldest and largest hardware hacking competition in the world— and the most difficult event at CSAW. This year's challenge, designed by a team of top NYU security faculty and students, involves the corruption of digital voting systems. Submissions from elite student competitors from universities around the world resulted in seven finalist teams, who will compete in Brooklyn at the CSAW Finals:\n1. LCIS, Grenoble Institute of Technology ( France )\nTeam members: Isabelle Boulay , Jeremy Dubeuf, Arash Nejat \n2. LOGICS, University of South Florida ( Tampa )\nTeam members: John Gangemi , Sebastian Otero \n3.

The Policy Competition , which tasks entrants with designing proposals to solve controversial real-life dilemmas in cybersecurity. This year's contest asks, \" Should the United States implement a national 'bug bounty' program? \" Presentations from keynote speaker Brendan Hannigan , general manager of IBM Security , and featured speaker Neil Herschfield , deputy section manager for Homeland Security's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response . The Homeland Security Quiz , a lightning-fast security trivia game and a longtime CSAW favorite. Elite graduate and doctoral students will present recently published security research in the Applied Research Competition. Twenty-eight prestigious tech employers will be eagerly seeking CSAW competitors for internships and full-time positions at the Career Fair . CSAW finalists will learn what it takes to start and fund their own companies from tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists during a workshop presented by the NYU Incubators .

Their successor institutions merged in January 2014 to create a comprehensive school of education and research in engineering and applied sciences, rooted in a tradition of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship. In addition to programs at its main campus in downtown Brooklyn , it is closely connected to engineering programs in NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai, and it operates business incubators in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn .
