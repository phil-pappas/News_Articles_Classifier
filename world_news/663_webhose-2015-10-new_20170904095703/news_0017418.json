Smart Phones have become the style statement for the youngsters and are slowly catching up with the older generation too. The potential of the smartphone market in India looks more promising with a broad customer base and high purchase capita. The best mobile phone brands have thronged in their energy to capitalize the Indian Market and fighting for the customer base and market share. Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Xiaomi, HTC, Sony, Blackberry, Lenovo, Huawei, LG and many others have released many phones and tablets in competitive price to attract the customers in recent years. The beauty of the Indian Market is the variety and versatility and the wide range of buyers and their choices have made sure that there is a buyer for every brand. So, here are the top five mobile brands in India which are desperately trying to woo the buyers. Samsung Samsung captured the untapped market of the smartphones and toppled the then king Nokia to become the Best Mobile Phone maker in India few years back. The South Korean Giant has not looked back since then. The new smartphones and the affordable designs for the upper middle class were doing the trick for them. They almost took the market from Nokia and became the story of every household. Samsung releases an almost couple of phones every year in India and is still the most sold mobile phones in the country. The Galaxy Flagship phones of Samsung are widely accepted by the Indians. Micromax Some claim, it has already toppled Samsung, some deny it. However, the impact of the Micromax in Indian Smart Phone market cannot be ignored. With amazing branding skills and affordable mobile phone prices, it has entered the market as the ace of the triumph. The Canvas of Micromax has changed the story of Smart Phone market altogether and has redefined the limits and dynamics of the industry. The Gurgaon-based company has made sure to provide huge mobile specifications and kept a check on the price of mobile phones in India to take a huge market share. Microsoft Windows Phone may not be as popular as Android is in India, but the basic Nokia Phones are almost inseparable from the Indian market. The low-priced models are still favored by the rural area of the country. Many urban populations too like the basic Microsoft phones. Nokia was the first to capture the Indian Market and ruled with low budget phones. However, Lumia has created a buzz in the Indian market and doing quite well in the recent past. Apple The iPhone does not get the same response in India as in other countries. However, the reason is not the high price that is often thought. The blame can be put on the marketing strategy. It is not easy to buy an iPhone in India. The lack of dealership strategy of Apple has already cost them many billions in Indian Market. Steve Jobs probably could not crack the Indian Code, but Tim Cook has certainly realized it. The increasing presence of Apple is surely threatening all other in the smartphone industry. The new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S are going to be launched in India and the response may define the future strategy of Apple.Xiaomi The newest entry but probably the strongest among the all, Xiaomi has simply redefined the Indian market. The loaded features in affordable prices have made the phones hot favorite. Even though it had to go with a scuffle with Ericson and has already suffered a legal hurdle but, all seems history now. The RedMi and the Mi Phones are generating huge business and that has anticipated huge expectations.The Technology is moving very fast and new Tech Updates are making the competition even tougher.
