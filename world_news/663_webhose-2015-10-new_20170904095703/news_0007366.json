HTC claims that the roots of its latest phone design predate the look and feel of the iPhone 6 or 6s.\nBut while the iPhone continues to shatter smartphone sales records, HTC--despite strong reviews for the last several iterations of its flagship HTC One devices--struggles to remain relevant.\nWhether HTC's designers intended for its new device to be an iPhone clone or not, the company sure hopes to take a bite out of Apple.\n\"The big takeaway is that there is some smartphone fatigue out there,\" says Jason Mackenzie, HTC's president for the Americas. \"What we see is an opportunity. The problem is when you buy an iPhone, you really are submitting your mobile life to one company who is deciding what is good for you.\"\nAccording to Mackenzie, the A9 should \"really appeal to Apple users who are interested in doing something else but they're not seeing a product that checks the boxes for them.\"\nHTC One A9 looks like an iPhone. (Photo: Edward C. Baig, USA TODAY)\nThe boxes that he says have been checked on the A9 lead to a device that is well-designed, powerful, simple and not laden with \"bloatware\" or duplicative functions.\nI got a chance to peek at the new A9 recently and design-wise it does look very nice—yes, just like an iPhone. But I haven't gotten to try it in the wild yet.\nOne thing HTC is boasting about is that this will be the first non-Nexus phone out of the gate to run the new Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system.\nOther notes: the 5-ounce phone has a 5-inch full HD display, octa-core Qualcomm processor, fingerprint sensor and 32GB of memory, upgradeable through microSD to 2 terabytes.\nThere a 13-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilization to reduce a photographer's shakes, and a front \"UltraPixel\" camera that HTC claims can capture 300% more light than conventional smartphone cameras.\nThe cameras also have features aimed at pro shooters (including the ability to capture RAW images.) And you can take advantage of the HTC ZOE feature that is similar to (and indeed predates) the new Live Images feature on the latest iPhones.\nThe new HTC One will be available next month, under a promotional unlocked price of $399.99. It will come in Opal Silver and Carbon Gray at first, followed by Deep Garnet and Topaz Gold. The phone will initially be compatible with the AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile networks, and sometime after launch (through a software upgrade) with the Verizon Wireless network.\n\"We're going to zag at the same time everybody else is zigging,\" Mackenzie says. Whether zagging translates into those elusive sales for HTC remains to be seen.\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n2 CONNECT 26 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LLDfIO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LLDfIO&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LLBRGj", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c03c422fd17af2a747027222b60da2d8c37a08c1/c=0-0-2448-3264&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809422750571827-HTC-One-pic.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569720403001_4569675939001-vs.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LLDfIO&text=HTC%20One%20A9%3A%20Not%20an%20iPhone%20clone%20but%20looks%20like%20one.&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49fc5de273fd3e1aa49ca614f1fac363186d96b7/c=0-115-2431-1943&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809646571171166-20151020-183723-1.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569720403001_4569675939001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809646571171166-20151020-183723-1.jpg", "http://twitter.com/edbaig", "http://usat.ly/1LLDfIO", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569720403001_4569675939001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50117b4bfe181f32492ec4d414638d7c08e560e6/r=500x400/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809646571171166-20151020-183723-1.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4569720404001_4569675939001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:50:37.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
