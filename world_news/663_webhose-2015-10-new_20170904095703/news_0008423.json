EarthLink is leveraging Ipanema, InfoVista's application performance guarantee solution, to monitor and control WAN traffic and application performance as part of its recently announced Application Performance Optimization service portfolio. \nThe new managed network service offering will enable EarthLink to better control, manage and guarantee the performance of business critical applications over enterprise customers' WAN infrastructure, while helping them reduce their telecom costs. Like other EarthLink solutions, EarthLink Application Performance Optimization is available via the myLink® customer portal, providing customizable real-time dashboards for monitoring, troubleshooting and setting alarms and the ability to view quality of service score per location for jitter, latency, and packet loss. \nA combination of increased business applications and new enterprise digitalization challenges has made it difficult for businesses to guarantee consistent network performance. As an example, in the retail industry alone, 78 percent of organizations are unable to guarantee application performance, meaning employee productivity and the customer experience could suffer as a result. InfoVista and EarthLink's partnership solves this problem, enabling enterprises to gain insight into how their bandwidth is being utilized and optimize application performance based on real network conditions, resulting in a more effective management of today's increasingly complex IT environments. Equipped with reliable application performance, companies reap the benefits of increased productivity, customer acquisition and sales revenue, as well as an overall improvement on their bottom line. \nSupporting Quotes \"Now more than ever, application performance has a direct impact on a company's business performance,\" said Rick C. Froehlich, executive vice president and chief commercial officer, EarthLink. \"Yet, it is becoming more difficult to manage, especially as the shift to cloud and digital business continues. By leveraging InfoVista's Ipanema solutions as part of our Application Performance Optimization services, we are able to close that gap and grant our business customers more visibility, control over and confidence in their networks than ever before – all without costly bandwidth upgrades.\" \"InfoVista has been very successful in partnering with leading managed service providers such as Orange Business Services and BT Group to help CIOs of large enterprises guarantee business-critical application performance and a high-quality application experience to every user,\" said Frank Pinello, SVP worldwide sales, enterprises, InfoVista. \"Our partnership with EarthLink is a key milestone in increasing InfoVista's footprint in North America.
