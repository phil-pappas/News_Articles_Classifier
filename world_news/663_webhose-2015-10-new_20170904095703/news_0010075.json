As a former CIO, Paul brings 15 years of hands-on experience as a healthcare executive, and does not just understand or sympathize with today's CIOs, he is one. The challenges that face today's healthcare technology executives are the same challenges Paul has faced, and his new role with Divurgent allows him to lead his team and clients in ensuring technology efficiencies across an organization. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275710LOGO \n\"We are extremely proud to have Paul on board,\" says CEO and Managing Partner, Colin Konschak , \"he has the boots-on-the-ground experience and industry insight to build upon Divurgent's already strong Advisory Services practice line.\" \nDivurgent's Advisory Services practice offers strategic approaches to today's big IT challenges, providing expertise and services including: cyber-security, IT strategic planning, data warehouse strategies, benefits realization, IS reorganization, clinical integration, and HIE strategy. In addition to leading the Advisory Services practice, Paul will work in tandem with Divurgent's Leaders from our aligned practices—Clinical Transformation, Revenue Cycle Management, and Activation Management—to enhance Divurgent's service delivery across every client engagement. \nPrior to his position as Vice President of Advisory Services, Paul worked with Divurgent as an interim CIO at a 6-hospital, 500-physician health system, where he led an organizational redesign, business intelligence roadmap, and performance improvement initiates. Before working with Divurgent, Paul was CIO of Providence Health and Services' Washington / Montana region, where he helped develop and deploy an IT strategy to drive consistency and standardization to many disparate systems and organizations across the $2.7B healthcare organization, spanning multiple states. \n\"Paul brings value not only to the Advisory Services team, but also across all of our practices. Having been a CIO at numerous health systems, he understands the day-to-day needs and the organizational dynamics between IT, Operational, and Clinical Departments, and can use that hands-on experience to be a leader to his team and an innovator on client projects,\" says Dana Alexander , Divurgent's Vice President of Clinical Transformation. \nDivurgent is excited about Paul's industry knowledge and ability to apply his leadership skills to greatly advance Divurgent's services across the client base, making a tangible impact on the way healthcare clients interact with and think about their technology. \nAbout Divurgent \nDivurgent is not the typical healthcare consulting firm.
