The Stratmish Fantasy Sports platform prevents insider manipulation that was recently revealed about both FanDuel and Draft Kings platforms. \nStratmish offers an easy-to-use platform for fantasy sports leagues, from football to golf to mixed martial arts that is easy to implement for sports bars, gaming establishments and recreational online sports outlets. It gives participants a skills-based format where those who finish in the top four from their group of twelve advance in the tournament. This compares to competitive platforms where participants must beat tens of thousands of people playing simultaneously. \nSports bars and gaming establishments can easily install Stratmish for download to a user’s smartphone or tablet. Stratmish’s small-group play eliminates the possibility of employees using insider information to bet on players or teams after looking at selection trends and using them to better their odds while playing a lottery format. It is this alleged insider trading from employees of FanDuel and Draft Kings, participating in competitive platforms, that has created an unfair advantage in competitive fantasy football. Currently, there is one class-action lawsuit and possible FBI and congressional investigations. \n“Lottery format Fantasy sports carry the same danger of insider manipulation as the stock market,” said Phil Givant, CEO and founder of Stratmish Fantasy Sports. “If athletes were comparable to stocks, all one would have to do is access the undervalued player information, something a Draft Kings employee could get, and select a bunch of athletes that most contestants might overlook. That creates fewer obstacles to winning, assuming those athletes performed very well. Even if company policy prohibits employees from participating in their own tournaments, they end up competing with this exploited information on other sites. Even though this practice is now banned, what prevents employees from giving this information to someone else? \n“The Stratmish platform eliminates this manipulation of the data by requiring that players advance out of small-group play—something that emphasizes skill over luck. The result is an honest competition where everyone has a chance to win based on their picks.” \nThe reason companies have missed the mark can be boiled down to two integral gaming features that appear on the surface to contradict one another. One calls for maximizing the number of people who can play while the other does the exact opposite and wants to minimize how many can participate. This creates quite a dilemma. \nTournament organizers, like FanDuel and Draft Kings, would like for as many people to play as possible because they want to maximize profits. Contestants want to minimize the number of people who can play and cap the tourney because they don’t want it to turn into a lottery that eliminates skill. Ironically, both sides lose because the current products on the market contains both elements nobody wants and the most popular models on the market are considered a capped lottery tournament that doesn’t satisfy either side. \nThere are seven essential features that a skills-based tournament must have to attract enough fans in order to avoid the types of lotteries everyone else is using. Stratmish has all seven. The best any competitor has is four. \nThe seven required features include: A low entry fee. A life­changing grand prize. Making tournament skills-based and not a lottery. Allowing unlimited tournament entries. Giving players a solid chance to advance (at least 30 percent). Providing a re­entry component. Permitting individuals to play multiple entries simultaneously. \nFantasy sports enthusiasts are invited to try and compare the platform at Stratmish Fantasy Sports platform at www.stratmish.com for a skills-based Fantasy Sports experience that isn’t a lottery. \nStratmish is open to creating partnerships with companies to use its platform that will satisfy Fantasy Sports enthusiasts and businesses that cater to this expanding fan base. \nStratmish is currently in discussions with chain sports theme bars/eateries and gaming companies about deploying its platform for several fantasy sports applications.
