The purchase of the five MTS CriterionÂ® Electromechanical Universal Test Systems, which are reserved primarily for teaching College of Engineering undergraduates, was made possible through the MTS University Program. This program offers educational facilities access to special academic pricing on industry-leading equipment, as well as accredited curricula for use by colleges and universities around the world. MTS has been providing test systems, service and application support to Penn State for over 20 years. This latest installation builds on the strong relationship between the two organizations by giving the university's engineering undergraduates access to the very latest techniques for testing and analyzing the performance of materials, ranging from thin-film plastics and advanced materials to metals. \"By taking advantage of our University Program, Penn State's engineering science and mechanics department is able to offer College of Engineering undergraduates access to our most recent electromechanical systems designed for accurate and reliable testing of materials,\" says Dr. Jeffrey Graves , Chief Executive Officer and President of MTS. He adds, \"Providing universities with the solutions they need to advance the knowledge and experience of new generations of engineers and scientists illustrates that our core value of 'investing in our future' is delivering tangible benefits.\" Scott Kralik , ESM Laboratory Coordinator, comments, \" Penn State has had a strong relationship with MTS for almost a quarter of a century and the company's solutions have played a key role in teaching and research across a variety of departments. The MTS Criterion equipment, as well as MTS software and accessories, will allow us to develop more sophisticated programs for our students and support our mission to develop future state, national and international leaders of scientific and engineering endeavors.\" About MTS Systems Corporation MTS Systems Corporation's testing hardware, software and services solutions help customers accelerate and improve their design, development, and manufacturing processes and are used for determining the mechanical behavior of materials, products, and structures.
