Fairfax by Lex The last time the computer-memory industry had consolidated, everybody made piles of money. In 2012, Micron bought Elpida, capping a process that brought the number of big competitors in D-Ram and N and flash memory from a dozen or so to five. The result was dramatic. Profitability in the industry improved. In 2013 and 2014, Micron delivered total returns of 450 per cent; Western Digital and SanDisk managed 170 and 130 per cent. In Korea, SK Hynix returned 85 per cent; Samsung prospered, but its chip results are obscured by its smartphone unit.\nAnother round appears to be on its way, if boards and regulators co-operate. Micron and Western Digital have approached SanDisk about a merger, and both have the means to get a deal done (the Dell/EMC deal proves that there is plenty of merger financing available, regardless of the growth potential or leverage of the companies involved).\nIf a memory deal goes through, will another bonanza follow? There are a number of reasons to think there will not be a repeat of a few years ago. Most prosaically, the simple fact is that demand for PCs and smartphones is weaker now; yesterday's mushy results from equipment maker ASML and Tuesday's Intel numbers reflect that.\nPsychologically, there is the fact that the improved profitability and stock performance that followed the last round have not proved permanent.\nAt Micron and SanDisk, margins have started to turn down again, and share prices are back to pre-crisis, pre-consolidation levels. A commodity industry with fewer players is still a commodity industry, and excess returns still attract profit-destroying new capacity. Samsung is building a $15 billion memory-chip factory this year. Intel is showing increasing interest in the memory market, too.\nAs the global economy and stock markets cool, memory could be the first, but will not be the only, industry to discover that the returns on consolidation tend to decline.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:21:04.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
