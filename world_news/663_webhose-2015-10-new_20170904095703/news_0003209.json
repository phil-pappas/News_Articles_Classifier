This offers many business opportunities to further innovation and design making use of Internet of Things technology, for example. \nFlexbright is commercialising innovative LED foils, the lighting technology of which has been created in close cooperation with VTT and PrintoCent. The foils can be coupled with sensors and they can be controlled wirelessly. LED foils are suitable for a number of indoor applications, and they can be embedded in to structures, walls and furniture and into both indoor and outdoor advertisements. The lighting environment can be controlled as part of the overall building automation. \nThe technology is based on roll-to-roll mass production, high illumination power, IoT properties, low energy consumption and the ultrathin, flexible structure (less than 1 mm in thickness). The flexible lighting foil has high resistance to heat and humidity. As only light-weight structures are required, you can also save in raw materials. \nFlexbright has attracted international attention, especially in Russia, where capital investment company NNCRM has signed a contract with Flexbright. NNCRM (Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials Centre of the Republic of Mordovia) is part of Russia's state capital investment company Rusnano's Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs (FIEP). \nFlexbright is currently seeking partners to make LED technology applications, also displaying an interest in companies working with IoT technologies. ### \nFor more information, please contact: \nFlexbright Oy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:48:57.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
