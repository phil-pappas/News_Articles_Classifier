Dorsey, currently the company’s interim CEO, co-founded Twitter in 2007 and was its first CEO.\nHe has served as the interim head of the firm for the past three months, after former boss Dick Costolo stepped down on 1 July. Alongside his appointment, the company also promoted Adam Bain, formerly the company’s president of global revenue & partnerships, to a chief operating officer role.\nBain had been widely seen as the biggest competitor to Dorsey for the head position, but reportedly said he would only take it if Dorsey turned it down.\nDespite the announcement, Dorsey (who tweets as @ jack ) will remain the head of fast-growing mobile payments company Square, potentially setting up a conflict of interests for the co-founder of both companies. Twitter had previously said the CEO job would be a full-time position, which seemed to exclude Dorsey as long as he continued to run Square . He also sits on the board of Disney.\n— Jack (@jack) October 5, 2015 We are naming @adambain COO of Twitter, we're working to change the composition of our Board, and I will serve as CEO of Twitter and Square!\n— Jack (@jack) October 5, 2015 I've been CEO of both companies for over 3 months now. I have the smartest, strongest, and most determined leaders in the world on my teams.\nIn an SEC filing confirming the promotions, Quote: : “Mr. Dorsey was selected to serve on the Board because of the perspective and experience he brings as one of Twitter’s founders and as one of Twitter’s largest stockholders, as well as his extensive experience with technology companies.”\nDorsey’s return to the company he helped found has already had an effect on Twitter. In late September, news broke that the company was considering removing, or adding exceptions to, its long-standing policy limiting individual messages to 140 characters . The news was greeted with mixed feelings by users of the social network, with some arguing that any change would remove the aspect which makes it unique when compared to other networks such as Facebook.\nHowever, others pointed to the fact that users have been increasingly inventive in finding ways to circumvent the limit, such as posting links to text hosted elsewhere, screenshots of notetaking apps, or simply multi-tweet “tweetstorms” – a practice made popular by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.\nAn unnamed Twitter employee told Re/Code that Dorsey’s return was the impetus for reassessing the role of the character limit: “Having Jack come in and say it’s OK makes all the difference in the world.”\nDick Costolo, the former CEO of Twitter , is also stepping down from the board. The company is now advertising for a new board member, who will also replace Dorsey as chairman of the board.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jack/statuses/651003398922174464", "https://twitter.com/adambain", "http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000156459015008279/twtr-8k_20150930.htm", "http://recode.net/2015/09/29/twitter-plans-to-go-beyond-its-140-character-limit/", "https://twitter.com/jack/status/651003398922174464", "https://twitter.com/jack/statuses/651003315212300289", "http://www.twitter.com/jack", "https://twitter.com/jack/status/651003315212300289"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:42:25.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
