As the leading provider of surveillance and loss prevention services for the hospitality industry, DTT now features NCR Silver printer tap integration, DTT’s first such POS integration. With NCR Silver, DTT is able to isolate transactions including discounts, paid in/out, refunds, and small value sales.\nDTT piloted this integration with several The Cookie Place, Inc. stores, the largest Great American Cookies franchise, which signed with DTT based on the NCR Silver partnership.\n“Before the NCR Silver integration, we didn’t have a system in place to catch items like low sale values, discounts, and voids,” says Jeff Pizitz, President for The Cookie Place. “We were extremely excited when DTT told us they would be partnering with NCR Silver and offering us the printer tap integration. Our SmartAudits™ now reflect a number of transactional integrity issues that we were not able to see previously. There has been a lot of sweethearting and unauthorized discounts, which we can now take action to correct.”\n“We pride ourselves on doing whatever we can to ensure customers have the best possible experience with our loss prevention solution,” adds Jim Mack, VP Technology & Product Development for DTT. “This partnership with NCR Silver is the latest example of the ways in which we adapt our services to fit the specific needs of each customer. We are very enthusiastic about this partnership and look forward to the additional functionality that NCR Silver will be adding in the coming months.”\nAbout DTT\nHeadquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, DTT provides digital video surveillance solutions to the hospitality and specialty retail industries.
