The new AutoVu Free-Flow module helps increase parking enforcement efficiency by providing a real-time inventory of vehicles parked illegally in monitored parking lots.\nGenetec AutoVu Free-Flow records the license plate of vehicles entering and leaving each parking lot, and compares them to the list of payments received from connected pay-by-plate-enabled pay stations, permit management systems, and mobile apps. Vehicles that stay beyond their purchased parking period are flagged in a live report, highlighting violations awaiting enforcement. AutoVu Free-Flow also automatically identifies returning scofflaws as they enter a parking lot, and notifies parking enforcement officers of their arrival and location.\nAutoVu Free-Flow can also be used in conjunction with mobile ALPR vehicles. Vehicles placed on the AutoVu Free-Flow violations list are available through the Genetec Security Center interface, or synchronized dynamically with parking enforcement vehicles using AutoVu Patroller to maximize enforcement efficiency.\nAutoVu Free-Flow Helps University of British Columbia Transition to Gateless Parking\nAlready in use at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver as part of a new license plate-enabled parking (LEP) system built around AutoVu, AutoVu Free-Flow is helping the university transition to a gateless parking system.\nParking operators at UBC Parking Services have leveraged ALPR technology to simplify the enforcement task, minimizing the search for physical stickers, and covering more parking lots in less time. AutoVu Free-Flow has also been implemented to optimize enforcement routes and maximize resources. With a fixed AutoVu camera mounted at the entry and exit of each parking lot, the system tracks vehicles entering and exiting, and automatically alerts enforcement officers to vehicles in violation; these include vehicle owners who have not paid, vehicles that have not left the lot once their allotted time has expired, and vehicles with prior parking violations.\n“By going gateless with the AutoVu ALPR system, we have improved our enforcement productivity by 40%, deferred $400,000 in capital expenses on gate barriers, and reduced operational costs by $200,000 for each parking lot. We have also been able to reduce our greenhouse gases by 150lbs per parking lot every year, since there is no more idling at entry and exit gates,” explains Brian Jones, Director of Parking and Access Control Services at UBC.\nEnforcement teams can then pull violation reports and plan their routes according to the number of actual violations in each lot. AutoVu Free-Flow also provides real-time lot counts so that UBC can use key performance indicators to either improve overall parking services, or direct traffic to available parking lots when an influx of vehicles is expected.\nFor more information visit: http://www.genetec.com/solutions/all-products/autovu .\nAbout Genetec Inc.\nGenetec Inc. develops open-platform software, hardware and cloud-based services for the physical security and public safety industry.
