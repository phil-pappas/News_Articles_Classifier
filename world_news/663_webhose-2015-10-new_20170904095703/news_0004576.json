The news is filled with more communities suffering drought conditions and energy usage spikes. There is no time to waste in addressing these issues which are critical to our communities. \nTechnology is able today to reduce the amount of water used by most data centers (who use evaporative cooling) by 10%-50% or more. Ex.: Water Common Optimized Savings Average Tns Evaporative Cooling on line 1,000 1,000 Average Evaporation / Yr in Gallons 13,140,000 13,140,000 Cycles 4 8 Gallons % Bleed in Gallons / Year 4,380,000 1,877,143 2,502,857 57% Total Water Needed in Gallons / Year 17,520,000 15,017,143 2,502,857 14% Energy KwHr % KwHr Used to treat and deliver raw water 28,242 24,208 4,035 14% KeHr used to pump and treat waste water 8,370 3,587 4,783 57% Round Trip 36,612 27,795 8,818 24% Carbon Lbs % 18,414 7,892 10,522 57% 63,878 54,753 9,125 14% Round Trip 82,291 62,644 19,647 24% \nThe reason maximally efficient operation is not the norm is not the cost of the solution; it is tradition, lack of incentives and disincentive. \nTradition: Water and wastewater costs have been a small part of the total cost of ownership of a data center, therefore tradition dictates a low priority to conserve water and minimize wastewater. \nLack of incentives: ROI rules the roost. In locations where incentives provided by water agencies are not available, marginal projects are not considered until the issue becomes one of compliance. Incentives are needed in some cases to tip the scale. \nDisincentives: Water treatment suppliers sell chemicals that are directly tied to the amount of water used. When water usage decreases due to efficiency gains, less chemistry is used and a direct hit to the water treatment supplier's bottom line results. \nToday we have the ability to instantly and continually monitor and address an unlimited number of things including the following that just happen to impact water efficiency: 1. The water chemistry in the cooling tower 2. The amount and cost of the water and chemical used 3. How the cooling tower is operating vs. design and current atmospheric condition. 4. How weather is impacting the need for and quantity of evaporative cooling on line. 5. The full process capability and analytics needed to optimize water and energy consumption. \nThe questions we need to ask regarding all of the above are: 1. Is it optimal? 2. If not why not and what is the fix? 3. When can we deploy resources to remedy the suboptimal condition? \nIn 800 data centers in CA the savings potential is staggering: Data Center 800 Current Water / Day / Data Center 360,000 The Industry Current Water / Day 288,000,000 Current Water / Yr 105,120,000,000 Annual Savings the Industry Can Deliver Available Savings - Gallons 14,716,800,000 Available savings- KwHr /Yr 51,847,286 Available Savings - Carbon Tns /Yr 57,763 \nThis is 1. the carbon equal to taking over 11,000 cars off the road. 2. the power used by 93,000 homes in CA for a year. 3. enough water to provide for the needs of 231,312 average Californians. \nThe savings of our most precious resources can be delivered today. \nGrant Newhouse CEO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:22:38.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
