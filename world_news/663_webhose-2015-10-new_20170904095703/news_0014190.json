PENETRON crystalline technology ensured that construction was completed on schedule despite the high water table at the job site.\nEast Setuaket, New York (PRWEB) October 26, 2015\nThe Metro South Senior Apartments complex was inaugurated this September to provide affordable housing to elderly buyers. PENETRON crystalline technology ensured that construction was completed on schedule despite the high water table at the job site.\nAn initiative by the City of South Miami, the Metro South Senior Apartments are located across the street from City Hall. The affordable housing development includes 91 units (designed for independent living) in a seven-story structure, with a café, game room, theater, fitness center, and laundry room, all on the second floor. A four-floor parking garage provides 91 parking spaces for residents (one for each unit) and 45 spaces for visitors. There is also 2,600 square feet (242 m2) of commercial space on the ground floor.\n“The high water table at the job site initially presented Siltek, the project’s general contractor, with a sizeable challenge,” explains Christopher Chen, Director of The PENETRON Group. “But a combination of our crystalline materials overcame a troubling job site and resulted in a durable, waterproof structure.”\nPENETRON ADMIX SB was used to treat all concrete in the below-ground structures and the parking garage. The admixture, packaged in soluble bags, simplifies the dosage and mixing process; PENETRON’s non-staining, green tracer technology ensured that it was present in every mix where it was required. PENEBAR SW-55 waterstop and PENEBAR Primer were used to permanently seal all construction joints.\n“Siltek was also pleased that PENETRON was able to provide a more economical solution than what was originally specified by the project plans,” adds Mr. Chen. “They were very happy with the results!”\nThe PENETRON Group is a leading manufacturer of specialty construction products for concrete waterproofing, concrete repairs and floor preparation systems. The Group operates through a global network, offering support to the design and construction community through its regional offices, representatives and distribution channels.\nFor more information on PENETRON waterproofing solutions, please visit penetron(dot)com or Facebook(dot)com/ThePenetronGroup, email CRDept(at)penetron(dot)com, or contact the Corporate Relations Department at 631-941-9700.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038299.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.penetron.com/the-penetron-system", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038299.htm", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penetron-admix-sb", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penebar-sw-55", "http://www.penetron.com/products#penebar-primer"], "published": "2015-10-26T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:29:12.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
