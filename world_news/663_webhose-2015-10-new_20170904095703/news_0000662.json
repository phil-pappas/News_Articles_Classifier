Wall Street bounced 1 per cent higher while euro markets jumped nearly 3 per cent on Friday.\nAt the 10.15am (AEST) official market open, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index gained 25.6 points, or 0.48 per cent to 5377.2, while the broader All Ordinaries index was up 25.5 points, or 0.47 per cent, at 5413.6.\n\"There are now two central banks joining the early Christmas present stimulus program, IG market strategist Evan Lucas said. By the end of the week there could be three he said, referring to the Bank of Japan which meets on Friday, while the US Federal Reserve may not move on rates until mid 2016.\nLocally, all eyes will be on the mid-week inflation figures being released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which may determine whether the Reserve Bank of Australia eases local rates further.\n\"That would certainly keep the door open for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates, particularly after the major banks lifted interest rates because of capital requirements,\" CommSec chief economist Craig James said.\nThe out-of-cycle interest rate hikes by the big four bank has driven the local market to a firm end to the month.\nThe ASX over the month of October has added 6.6 per cent, Mr Lucas said. From the September 29 collapse, where $44 billion was wiped off, the ASX has added 8.8 per cent or $129 billion back in market value, he said.\nMeanwhile, iron ore slumped another 1 per cent to $US50.90 a tonne and has now lost ground for nine straight sessions.\nThe Australian dollar has also lost ground as traders piled into the US dollar, with the currency sitting at the low end of the US72c range.\nLast week the Australian sharemarket gained 1.6 per cent over the five sessions, closing at a two-month high.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:37:00.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
