What the ports sector needs is a stable business environment in which investors can have long term confidence. \n“However, we feel that the Port Services Regulation proposal, even with the compromises currently being discussed, will still jeopardise the conditions necessary for long term investment and growth.” \nLucy Anderson said: \"The Commission's 'one size fits all' proposal for a new port services regulation failed to recognise the complexity and diversity of the EU's port sector. \n“Although UK Labour MEPs and the socialists and democrats group are working hard to mitigate the Commission's approach, this legislation remains a blunt instrument with very little added value.” \nThe three red lines set out for European Ports Policy are: the autonomy of ports in determining their own charging structures, transparency of public funding, and the full implementation of the internal market in the maritime sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:25:05.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
