The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.2% up.\n\"China and emerging markets growth have been slowing since 2011. But will this impact U.S. and European growth? This is a key concern for investors,\" said Nick Nelson, head of global equity strategy at UBS in London.\nWhile he doesn't think this would be the case, a few months of strong economic data will be needed to ease investors' concerns.\n\"Until then, markets are going to remain volatile,\" he said.\nDriven by a rally in consumer and health-care stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed for a seventh consecutive day on Monday.\nThe pound fell 0.8% against the dollar after data showed that U.K. consumer prices fell 0.1% in September, a fresh sign that expansionary policies by central bankers around the world are failing to stoke inflation. Inflation has been close to zero throughout the year. The pound was recently trading at $1.5216 against the buck.\nEconomists at BNP Paribas have pushed back expectations for an interest rate rise by the Bank of England from February 2016 to May. \"However, the market isn't pricing in a full rate hike until the first quarter of 2017,\" they said in a note.\nThe euro was 0.3% higher at $1.1393 against the dollar, having earlier traded above $1.14.\nIn corporate news, SABMiller PLC's board agreed on the key terms of a sweetened takeover offer by Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, valuing it at GBP68 billion ($104.36 billion). The move sets the stage for the world's two largest brewers to combine after weeks of back and forth. SABMiller shares rose 9.3%, while AB InBev shares were up 1.6%.\nIn commodities, Brent crude was at $50.21 a barrel, mostly flat on the day. Gold was 0.3% lower at $1,161.60 an ounce after rising sharply on Monday.\nWrite to Chiara Albanese at chiara.albanese@wsj.com and Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nOctober 13, 2015 09:53 ET (13:53 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:07:52.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
