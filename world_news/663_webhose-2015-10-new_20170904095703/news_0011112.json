This year's event is being held over the weekend of the 8 to 11 October. \nWidely regarded as the pinnacle of Australian motorsport, the event is colloquially known as 'The Great Race' and attracts millions of viewers on primetime Australian TV. \nErebus's no. 9 car, driven by brothers Will and Alex Davison, achieved fourth position in last year's race and hopes are high for a position on the podium at this year's event. \n\"This is a great opportunity to raise awareness of the Sepura brand, not only in the Australian market but to a worldwide audience,\" said Terence Ledger, Sepura's regional sales director for the APAC region. \n\"Communications are critical in motorsport; the Erebus team continually strives to achieve the best possible results and this makes them a perfect fit for the Sepura brand.\" \nBetty Klimenko, owner of Erebus Motorsport said: \"Erebus Motorsport V8 is proud to welcome Sepura as a new sponsor for the Bathurst 1000 race.
