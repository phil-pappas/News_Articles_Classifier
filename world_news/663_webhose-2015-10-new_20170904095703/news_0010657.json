Newslook\nSAN FRANCISCO — The more VMware investors hear about the company’s prospects under a new corporate structure, the more bearish they’re becoming.\nAnd for good reasons.\nThe company’s shares plunged in early trading Wednesday after shareholders got more information on how much the merger of EMC, VMware’s parent company, and privately-held Dell will affect VMware’s financial results.\nThe shares began dropping late Tuesday afternoon after VMware executives, during the company’s quarterly conference call with investors and analysts, issued a fourth-quarter revenue forecast that was lower than most Wall Street analysts expected.\nVMware Chief Operating Officer Carl Eschenbach said third-quarter bookings, or orders that are expected to become sales, were “softer than planned” for three reasons: A slowdown in China, Russia and Brazil; “speculation over VMware’s future,” because of uncertainty over Dell’s plan to take EMC private; and the “secular shift” among IT buyers toward using cloud-computing services instead of buying their own servers and storage products.\nThe shares were sold off further late Tuesday after VMware shared details of how much a newly-announced joint business with EMC would hurt its 2016 profitability.\nThat business, to be called Virtustream, will be jointly owned on a 50-50 basis and combine the two companies’ product lines for cloud computing in one entity. That business will have hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue next year, VMware Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Chadwick said on the call.\nVMware CEO Patrick Gelsinger, meanwhile, said on the call that “we expect Virtustream to be one of the top five cloud service providers globally.”\nThat prediction points to the plans of Dell CEO Michael Dell to make the combined EMC-Dell-VMware entity into one of the new giants of the cloud era.\nThe problem for VMWare shareholders is that attaining that Top 5 status in a business now dominated by Amazon and Microsoft is going to take massive investment in equipment and infrastructure.\nVirtustream will have an operating loss of between $200 million and $300 million next year, Chadwick said.\nAnd because half of the investment will come from VMware, the company’s non-GAAP operating margin (a measure of profitability that excludes non-recurring items) is expected to be around 28% of revenue next year. That’s significantly less than the 31.8% the company has forecast for this year.\nEMC acquired Virtustream in July 2015 for $1.2 billion in cash to beef up its cloud offerings.\nAll of this means that EMC plans to use the financial resources of VMware — whose revenue is growing roughly three times as fast as EMC’s — to help fund its investments in cloud computing.\nAt the same time, Dell is going to use a VMware tracking stock to fund its purchase of EMC.\nAs we told you in a previous column, that tracking stock will dilute the stakes of current VMWare shareholders, which is why its shares are down 15% since reports of the deal surfaced.\nThe drop has reduced the value of Dell's $67 billion bid for EMC:\nUSA TODAY\nVMware selling drives down value of Dell’s mammoth EMC bid\nSince the deal was announced, Michael Dell has called VMware the “crown jewel” among EMC’s assets.\nThat may be, but each passing week offers more evidence that — as Dell and EMC use the company’s growth to fund their broader plans — VMware shareholders won’t get as much value out of that jewel as they once hoped.\nThe view from here: sell your VMware shares.\nThat’s what the smart money is doing Wednesday.\nFollow USA TODAY technology columnist John Shinal on Twitter: @johnshinal.\n1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LLw6s2 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/171f60672d2e16eef7767bfff786b425f598a688/c=0-39-1000-1039/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/23/1406155616000-XXX-IMG-TECH-INDUSTRY-SALES-1-1-HN62VGIO.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LLw6s2&text=Sell%20VMware%20before%20Dell-EMC%20bleeds%20more%20value&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2014/09/29906170001_3798928327001_thumb-newslook746944.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2014/09/29906170001_3798928327001_thumb-newslook746944.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2014/09/29906170001_3798928327001_thumb-newslook746944.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LLw6s2&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LLw6s2", "http://usat.ly/1uxLIEd"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:10:20.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
