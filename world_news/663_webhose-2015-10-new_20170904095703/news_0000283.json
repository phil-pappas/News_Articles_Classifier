Bloomberg\nSAN FRANCISCO — China may be a Silicon Valley obsession, but India increasingly is in the conversation and may soon displace its Asian neighbor as tech's next big frontier.\nThe near-future was on full display last week, when India Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a whirlwind tour of the valley, visiting Google, Tesla and Facebook in hopes of deepening ties with the U.S. tech sector. The visit, the first by India's leader to the West Coast in 33 years, was also economically motivated — stronger bonds with tech’s heavy hitters is crucial if India's economy is to become a $20 trillion, a \"dream\" shared by Modi in a Q&A with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday.\nUSA TODAY\nFacebook, Silicon Valley like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\nThe digital economy is a prime economic engine in the world’s second-most populous country (1.3 billion) and the largest democracy on Earth, and yet so many obstacles litter its path.\nIndeed, India is beginning to outperform China for a number of reasons. It recently entered the top-10 list of countries, based on gross domestic product, for the first time, according to a report from Credit Suisse. (China was No. 2, after the U.S., in its best showing yet.)\nBy 2022, India is expected to pass China and become the world's most populous nation.\n\"The Facebook of India is Facebook. The Google of India is Google,\" says Beerud Sheth, CEO of Teamchat, a communications app with employees in India and the U.S. \"In China, those services are banned.\"\nBut India's financial allure is fraught with risks, warns Ajay Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Vera. He says poor infrastructure and corruption hinder the prospects of U.S. companies in India, not to mention thousands of competing companies within that country.\nThe problems don't end there. Only one in five Indians have Internet access, ranking the country a desultory 131st in broadband penetration in 2014. Worse, India was 155th in mobile broadband penetration, according to a UNESCO report.\nOh, and one more cautionary statistic: Although consumption accounts for 60% of India’s GDP, says the World Bank; only 1% of its population shops online, according to the Wall Street Journal .\nComparisons between China and India are often made, and for obvious reasons.\nThousands of start-ups in India and China voraciously compete with one another for dominance in their countries, making it hard for U.S. companies to compete there, according to Dennis Yang, CEO of Udemy, an online education marketplace. Only a handful of U.S. companies have succeeded in China — including Kentucky Fried Chicken, Microsoft, Boeing and Intel. There, they benefited from robust infrastructure and a sizzling economy.\nCHINA\nTop 10 most popular American companies in China\nBut the governments of each country, and their relations with the U.S., tilt the economic scale to India despite its infrastructure woes.\nWhen Modi was elected in 2014, the hope was the pro-business leader would accelerate market reforms to attract foreign capital and grow the economy. Reforms, however, have been slow to take hold because political and social problems continue to plague the country.\nModi has prioritized the modernization of India’s digital infrastructure, with the intention to improve education and consumption to spark an economic revival.\nThis is where U.S. tech giants could help, including those led by Indian CEOs such as Google’s Sundar Pichai and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. They see a land of opportunity, where the government is open, cyberespionage is not a constant threat, as it is in China.\nThe appeal is obvious to their companies, Facebook, Apple and others. The Indian Internet market could rise to $137 billion by 2020 as Internet access and e-commerce sales soar.\nKarl Mehta, CEO of social-knowledge network EdCast, who met Modi and Pichai during the prime minister's visit, has done business in India and China. He's betting on India.\n\"India is where China was eight years ago; over the next 10 years, India will be the fastest-growing country, especially in infrastructure,\" Mehta says. \"The fundamental difference is India's growth will come from the bottom-up, and it will be pro-business, capitalist.\"\n\"It is unbelievable booming,\" he says, noting a surge in start-ups in India. \"It is a massive market, and Facebook and others see it.\"\nSeeing is believing in India.\nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz on Twitter: @jswartz.\n69 CONNECT 37 TWEET 19 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1KONVow TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4514710847001_thumb-ipjKleAj7KBk.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1KONVow", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af605a54b14d581e25ba50053684de5685758966/c=0-287-797-737&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/635789678201136878-zuckmodi.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4514710847001_thumb-ipjKleAj7KBk.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KONVow&mini=true", "http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2012-01/10/content_24368769_10.htm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4c503a0541b5bd9ff641b5899f973fdb99381c54/r=300/http/images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/site1007/20120110/0013729e78491075f1c260.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4514710847001_thumb-ipjKleAj7KBk.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KONVow&text=India%20increasingly%20is%20Silicon%20Valley%27s%20new%20frontier&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1FvRz7S"], "published": "2015-10-01T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:55:22.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
