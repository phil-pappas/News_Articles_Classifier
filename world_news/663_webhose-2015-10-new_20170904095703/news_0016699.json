Source: Supplied\nLean start up principles can be used by every business, they’re not just for the IT industry.\nThe principle behind lean is to accept failure, learn from it build on it. As Sahand Bagheri, business liaison officer at the start-up incubator, the York Butter Factory says, it’s all part of the entrepreneurial mindset.\n“You need to have a vision, you need to be determined and you need to be basically open to making mistakes and failing fast and recovering from that by strengthening your abilities and your skill sets,” Bagheri says. “What we encourage is for start-ups to fail fast and rise up faster. If she or he makes a mistake around his customer acquisition strategy for example, well they won’t make that mistake again. “\nThe key here is to learn from every product, feature and marketing campaign. In lean start up methodology, this is known as “validated learning”. Anything that doesn’t produce learnings is waste. Eliminate it.\nIt’s a strategy that works for all firms.\nThe Lean Startup revolves around getting to market quickly and learning from failures.\nLean methodology is based on experimentation rather than detailed planning and customer feedback, not intuition. Lean start up principles are the opposite of forces that drive companies to create intricate five year business plans which usually don’t survive when they are exposed to the market.\nIt starts with a customer development approach where the company gets out and talks to customers about issues. It can be about anything, from pricing to product features to distribution channels.\nIn a sense, the business is working like a start-up where the company puts together what’s termed as minimum viable products. These are designed to elicit customer feedback. Using the customer’s input, the product or service is reassembled and the cycle is started all over again. The revised packaged is tested once more and ideas that aren’t working are adjusted accordingly. Along the way, the strategy might have to be tweaked. In the lean start up lexicon, this is known as a pivot where the company still hangs on to what it’s learned so far. The strategy however does not change, it’s more a tweaking around the edges in response to customer feedback.\nThe next step in lean start up methodology is what’s known in the software industry as “agile development” which works with customer feedback. The idea here is to develop the product iteratively and incrementally, eliminating wasted time and resources by testing the product out to see how it flies with customers.\nLean start up methodology is easier these days with open source software and software building tools like GitHub, and cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services. All this has slashed the cost of software development. Lean development is now available for every company because the costs are so low.\nThe principle of lean start-up have produced results for the IT sector. There is no reason why they shouldn’t apply to other businesses.\nThis content was produced in association with Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
