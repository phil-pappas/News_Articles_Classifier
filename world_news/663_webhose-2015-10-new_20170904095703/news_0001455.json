An announcement of that plan was already made in June, and had been due to be concluded this month.\nSaudi Arabia has also entered exclusive negotiations to buy spy satellite and telecommunications equipment worth \"billions of euros\" from Thales, the document added.\nIt said the Saudi authorities had expressed their intention to enter negotiations for deals worth 5 billion euros with Veolia, Alstom and ENGIE for contracts in waste management and the metro in Riyadh, as well energy distribution in Jeddah.\nAn official from one of those firms said those negotiations were likely to be part of a general tender offer in which other international firms would also compete.\nFrench sources had said at the weekend they expected \"significant\" contracts, with one source saying there would be a military contract with Airbus Helicopters\nValls looked to play down the lack of deals.\n\"What's important is the perspective, the movement,\" he told reporters. \"Step by step, we are deepening each time our partnership. We don't doubt for a second that the letter of intention will be finalised.\"\nThe lack of contracts may also reflect lower Saudi spending. Its finance ministry, seeking to cut waste as state revenues shrink because of low oil prices, is telling government bodies to return unspent money allocated in this year's budget.\n\"I'm not convinced there will be big contracts,\" a French diplomatic source had said prior to the visit. \"Saudi Arabia's appetite is not as big. With the fall in oil prices and intervention in Yemen, they are less inclined to spend.\" (Writing and additional reporting by John Irish; Editing by Andrew Callus and Catherine Evans )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:46:24.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
