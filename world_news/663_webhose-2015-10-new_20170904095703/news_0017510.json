All three released surprisingly strong results the day before. \nThe Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, rose 89 points, or 1.8 percent, to 5,011. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 125 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,614. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 18 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,070. \nThe gains were enough to put the S&P 500 back into the black for the year following a market swoon in August and September. \nBond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.08 percent. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
