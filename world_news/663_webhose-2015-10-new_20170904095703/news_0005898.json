The new speakers feature a breakthrough design that transforms the home entertainment experience with omnidirectional, balanced sound, regardless of speaker or listener position, and even more intuitive controls, new user interface and multiroom capability for greater convenience. \nDeveloped in Samsung’s new state-of-the-art U.S.-based Audio Lab, the R5, R3 and R1 join the R7 in the Wireless Radiant360 speaker series line launched earlier this year. Each utilizes Samsung’s “Ring Radiator” technology to deliver a vibrant and rich audio experience with balanced room-filling sound, more so than any conventional speaker. \n“The way people listen to music has changed to a more social and shared experience. Consumers no longer sit in between a pair of stereo speakers to enjoy their music, but prefer the music move with them wherever they go,” said Jim Kiczek, Vice President of Samsung Electronics America Audio Group. “Our new Radiant360 speakers can be placed anywhere in a room to bring the sweet spot wherever listeners are as they are moving about the home.” \nThe all-black, unique cylinder-shaped design integrates seamlessly into any home décor. With a simple tap, swipe or touch on the top of the speaker, consumers can change the volume, play, pause, advance, or repeat tracks. \nThe R5, R3 and R1 models connect to the updated Samsung Multiroom App 2.0 for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets, making it possible to seamlessly share music across Wi-Fi connected devices throughout the home. The app also allows users to easily find and select music, and create playlists all from a single screen. \nConsumers can also easily connect the Wireless Radiant360 speakers to compatible Samsung TVs and soundbars quickly and easily. Adding a pair of R1 speakers as the “rear” speaker for example, can turn your soundbar into a full surround system. \nThe R1, R3 and R5 models will be available beginning in mid-October for $199, $299 and $399, respectively, making them a great holiday gift. \nAbout Samsung Electronics America, Inc. \nHeadquartered in Ridgefield Park, NJ, Samsung Electronics America, Inc.
