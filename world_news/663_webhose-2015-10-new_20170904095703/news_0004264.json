The Internet of Everything (IoE) continues to bring together people, processes, data and things to enhance the relevancy of network connections. As a member of the Cisco Solution Partner Program, Hedvig is able to quickly create and deploy software-defined storage solutions to enhance the capabilities, performance and management of the network to capture value in the IoE. \n\"Today's fast-paced, modern enterprise cannot afford to wait for its storage infrastructure to catch up with networking and compute. Organizations are storing more data, analyzing more data and embracing newer applications that generate more data,\" said Avinash Lakshman, CEO and founder of Hedvig. \"Our partnership with Cisco is a great supplement to our efforts to scale the company and introduce our platform to our joint customers. The combination of Cisco's Unified Computing System servers and the Hedvig Distributed Storage platform will enable our customers to leverage software-defined storage as a fundamental business enabler.\" \n\"Hedvig integrated seamlessly with our existing Cisco UCS hardware to deliver an elastic storage platform that keeps pace with our constantly changing business requirements,\" said Christoffer Niemi, IT architect at LKAB. \"With Hedvig, we can keep our Cisco UCS hardware and replace and add servers as we extend capacity or update the system in the future. This approach is more predictable because it leverages our existing investments, which means a more predictable cost.\" \nHedvig's Distributed Storage Platform is a highly-scalable software-defined storage solution that provides an agile, flexible and simple answer to modern storage. It is the only software-defined offering capable of in-software provisioning of file, block and object storage without decreases in data center performance. The platform transforms Cisco UCS servers into responsive storage clusters that are fully customizable and quickly scale up to thousands of nodes. With Hedvig, policy and provisioning processes that normally take hours, days or weeks now take just a few clicks and can even be performed from mobile devices. \nThe Cisco Solution Partner Program, part of the Cisco Partner Ecosystem, unites Cisco with third-party independent hardware and software vendors to deliver integrated solutions to joint customers. As a Solution Partner, Hedvig offers a complementary product offering and has started to collaborate with Cisco to meet the needs of joint customers.
