These technologies are considered to be some of the most advanced technologies in the history of science including Antigravity, Hover-boards, and new developments in energy. \nCJ talks about many of these breakthroughs at his website www.cjdabbs.com , where he explains in detail how some of these technologies work including his cure for cancer which he begins to explain by talking about how human cells are formed and stick together like a group of craft magnets when paired together properly as in the attached photo. At his website, CJ also talks openly about his experience going into space in a commercial airplane this past June. \nNo exact word yet on when an announcement is expected to be made but if we expect to see the hover-board before the end of 2015 an official announcement is expected to be made before the end of the year. \nSources: \n(2015, September 25).
