Photo: Bloomberg\nWith the launch of watchOS 2, I thought it was time to take another look at the Apple Watch, to see whether the new software has transformed it into a must-have gadget. I'm not sure it has.\nWhile I've enjoyed wearing the Watch these past few weeks, the enjoyment is based purely on gadget lust than from any utility the Apple Watch provides.\nWhat I've realised is that no native app will improve my experience with the Watch, because using any Watch app is a rather maddening experience.\nBefore discussing watchOS 2, I want to make one thing clear: I love the idea of the Apple Watch. I think smartwatches in general have an amazing future. But I haven't found one smartwatch I personally feel I need.\nApple Watch does some things amazingly well. The simple circles of the built in fitness app are genius – they're strangely addictive, and highly motivating.\nAdvertisement I personally like receiving notifications on my wrist. I whittled down notifications to just the ones I care about months ago, so only important things hit my wrist. This is a must for anyone about to buy a smartwatch. The Apple Watch notifications are great – those tiny taps of the taptic engine that alert but don't alarm.\nAnd for me, the Apple Watch is still the best looking smartwatch on the market. The screen is gorgeous, and unlike some, it never feels too bulky.\nGood, so are we all friends? We're all calm? Great, now let me complain a little.\nwatchOS 2 brings many little improvements to the Apple Watch, but the feature most anticipated was native watch applications. Native applications promised to launch and respond faster than the pseudo-apps of watchOS 1, where all the processing was taking place on the iPhone, with data streamed across to the Watch.\nSwarm was one of the first apps to get a native upgrade. And the app is faster, but still not a great user experience. Launch time from start to a usable app is down to about eight seconds – much better than the previous twenty seconds it used to take. But eight seconds still seems like an eternity when you have your wrist out in front of you, waiting for the wheels to stop turning, hoping the screen won't fall asleep. And you look kind of ridiculous.\nTelegram (my favourite messaging application) also received a native watch upgrade. The upgrade brings Telegram on par with Apple's built in Messaging app. You can send canned responses or use the Watch microphone to shoot off a little voice memo. But does it need to exist as an app? After a few weeks wearing the Watch, I never initiated a conversation from it, and rarely replied to messages as they came through. Like most users, I'd imagine, I just glanced at the message notifications coming through, deciding which ones to ignore and which I should pull out my phone to reply to.\nFantastical received a fantastic native update too, but again, I'm just not using it. Glances, the second way to interact with a Watch app, still take a while to refresh, so first glance is always a meeting behind.\nWhat I've realised is that no native app will improve my experience with the Watch, because using any Watch app is a rather maddening experience.\nIt starts with the placement of apps, on a layer beneath the watch face, accessed via the digital crown. To get to the apps, you push the digital crown. But then you need to move back to the tiny touch screen and search out the app you want in a honeycomb of tiny icons.\nDavid Pogue of Yahoo Tech shares my frustration. \"But the navigation! After months of using the Apple Watch, I can usually find what I want to find, but the logic of the layout still makes no sense.\" David has a better memory than me. I can never remember where an app lives in the honeycomb, or what order my Glances are in.\nTo make navigating the interface a little easier, I've found myself deleting apps and glances, so there's less to look at, and less to remember. I'd rather a system where one or two apps could have larger, more prominent icons, and I honestly don't know how to fix Glances.\nBetter still, I'd love to assign the button for recent contacts – something I never use – to my favourite app. My favourite app, by the way, is Next There – a brilliant little public transport app. It hasn't received a native upgrade, and its Glances take too long to load for my liking, but I've become used to waiting for it while waiting for a bus. I use Next There more than anything else, so the Apple Watch has become an $800 bus timetable on my wrist.\nI still have hope for the Apple Watch, but I think it will only become a must-have device once those tiny little apps start offering me information rather than waiting for me to interact with them. Apple have made a few smart acquisitions recently to bring some pre-emptive smarts to iOS and Apple Watch, but they're still so far behind the smarts of Android Wear's Google Now.\nOverall, watchOS 2 hasn't made the Apple Watch any more desirable for me. I've loved every second of wearing the Apple Watch, but I don't think I'll miss it for a minute when I return the loan unit to Apple.", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/tech/a-humble-proposition-how-to-fix-the-apple-watch-129185196924.html", "https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:59:01.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
