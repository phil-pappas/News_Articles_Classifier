Former Igate HR head Srinivas Kandula will take over from her as the CEO of Capgemini's India operations. | TNN | 24 October 2015, 5:12 PM IST Follow ETCIO Share BENGALURU: Aruna Jayanthi, CEO of Capgemini India, has been elevated as the global BPO head of the 11-billion euro French IT company. She will oversee a business that brings close to $700 million (635 million euro) in revenue and which has a robust footprint in areas like finance and accounting, procurement and supply chain.Former Igate HR head Srinivas Kandula has replaced Jayanthi as Capgemini India CEO. Ashwin Yardi, head of Apps One for Capgemini, has been appointed the COO of the Indian operations.Sources told TOI that Capgemini group chairman and CEO Paul Hermelin made these announcements at the company's group leadership meeting Les Recontres 2015 held in Rome earlier this month. The changes will be effective January 1.When contacted by TOI, Capgemini said, \"All management updates at Capgemini will be covered during our forthcoming Q3 results announcement on October 29, 2015.\"The new structure is being put in place following the completion of Capgemini's $4-billion acquisition of Igate. The $4-billion acquisition was announced in April this year. Igate CEO Ashok Vemuri resigned from the company soon after the completion of the merger.Jayanthi, who has been the CEO of Capgemini India since 2011, is part of the elite 18-member executive committee at Capgemini that sets strategic priorities and resulting action plans for the company. She will lead a workforce of over 1 lakh employees (post the Igate acquisition). BPO is part of the managed services business that contributed 26% or 2.7 billion euros to Capgemini's revenues in 2014.\"Jayanthi's elevation to the global leadership is testimony to the emerging pattern of Indian-origin leaders leading the way for global tech and services businesses. High analytical skills combined with deep understanding of people, process, low-cost innovation and emerging markets pivot these leaders to succeed in the fast changing global economy,\" said Venkat Shastry, partner in executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles.Jayanthi's predecessor Salil Parekh was included in the global executive committee in 2011 and was earlier this year elevated as deputy CEO of the company. He is also in the group management board.Kandula's appointment is a rare instance where an HR head has been appointed as the India CEO. At US-based IT firm CSC, Sreekanth Krishnan Arimanithaya is both India MD and global head of workforce management.Jayanthi's elevation comes at a time when Capgemini is exploring synergies with Igate's strengths in the BPO business through its flagship integrated technology and operations (ITOPS) framework that delivers business process improvements integrated with technology solutions.\"Capgemini's global BPO business is likely to exceed a billion dollars with the Igate acquisition and is very strong in finance and accounting BPO (the largest growth market), procurement and supply chain. There has been weakness in the vertical BPO areas, such as insurance and healthcare, but the Igate capabilities will create a footprint there for Capgemini to grow,\" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based consultancy firm HfS Research.Fersht said that moving the business under Jayanthi, \"will shift the power from Krakow (Poland) to India, but with RPA (robotic process automation) and analytics taking centre stage in the BPO delivery offering, this is where India is proving very strong from a development and execution perspective.\"Peter Bendor Samuel, CEO of US-based Everest Group, said Jayanthi has line responsibility for one of the largest, profitable and most important lines of business. \"Capgemini has a quite large and quite diverse BPO business ranging from F&A, procurement and a variety of industry specific BPO contracts. The practice is global with significant contracts in Europe, North America, Australia and Asia.\"Kandula will head one of Capgemini's biggest country operations. The country accounts for 50% or more of Capgemini's overall strength of 1.8 lakh employees. India accounts for some 70% of its offshoring.\"Increasingly, global IT services companies have tapped into business aggregation skills that India HR leaders bring to the table in addition to leading people function. Understanding of, and experience in leveraging talent as a critical lever has helped them scale management roles,\" Shastry said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:03:51.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
