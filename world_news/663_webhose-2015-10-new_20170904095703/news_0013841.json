The report, based on a survey of 91 retailers, found that because shoppers don’t care about channels anymore, retailers are having to drastically rethink their supply chain strategies from the ground up. In fact, the report reveals stark differences in how the best retailers’ strategies already differ from those of their competitors. The research is available for free download (registration required).\n\"Average and lagging retailers are distracted by such industry buzz as same day delivery,” says Steve Rowen, managing partner at RSR Research and co-author of the report. \"They’re already taking their eyes off more practical and attainable goals. By way of comparison, the best-performing retailers are already putting much more value on technology-enabled operational capabilities.\"\nKey Findings include:\n The new supply chain must consider stores not only as destinations for inventory, but also as potential sources to accommodate surging customer demand in another store or channel. Retail Winners see these new fulfillment options as some of their most valuable operational opportunities Average and lagging retailers are far more likely to report that the marketing department’s increasing influence is driving unintended supply chain consequences Retail Winners are inordinately focused on predictive demand analytics that utilize customer data (such as search, affinity) from digital channels\nRetail Supply Chain Execution: New Requirements To Meet New Demand contains analysis of the business drivers, opportunities, and organizational constraints surrounding retailers’ supply chains. It also offers baseline recommendations for navigating this brave new world for retailers. The report is part of RSR Research's ongoing efforts to provide market intelligence on retail technology trends, is sponsored by SAS, is supported by GT Nexus, Island Pacific, and Logitility, and can be downloaded here:\nhttp://www.rsrresearch.com/2015/10/16/retail-supply-chain-execution-new-requirements-to-meet-new-demand/\nAbout RSR Research: Retail Systems Research (“RSR”) is the only research company run by retailers for the retail industry.
