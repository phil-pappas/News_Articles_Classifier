David Paul Morris Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Salesforce is the world's fourth-largest software company, with a market cap of almost $US50 billion ($70.8 billion), but co-founder Parker Harris still has vivid memories of the dotcom crash that wiped out most of its clients and could easily have killed the fledgling cloud pioneer.\nWhile Harris and flamboyant co-founder Marc Benioff enjoyed rapid early expansion among eager customers in the tech and start-up scene for its cloud sales management software, it was slower going with larger clients, who were sceptical about the cloud and its security.\nSo Salesforce relied on building a big enough user base among the tech-savvy crowd to show the rest of the business world it was a serious player​. It was a great strategy until the dotcom crash hit.\n\"Suddenly everything around us was falling apart,\" Harris tells Fairfax Media.\nMarc Benioff, right, and Parker Harris at Salesforce's annual conference Dreamforce in 2015. David Paul Morris \"Too many of the businesses were hollow. We weren't the coolest but we were doing something real, but it was just such a sad time in San Francisco. Our friends were losing their companies and everyone was losing their jobs.\"\nCrisis management The company was running at a loss and many of its customers were wiped out in successive waves. But several of its clients remained, bolstering the Salesforce team's spirits as they went into crisis-management mode.\n\"We really had to hunker down and focus. I remember our office was quiet more often, really quiet,\" Harris says.\n \"After the dotcom boom blew up, it increased the focus on questions like why should I trust you to help run my business? How do I know you're not going to go away like every other company? That was hard. We had to keep proving ourselves.\"\nAs the tech-heavy NASDAQ shed trillions in value and thousands of tech companies collapsed around them, Salesforce continued to pitch to clients and slowly built up its customer numbers again.\nAfter a couple of years of death-defying commitment, the now significantly sized start-up still couldn't shake the shadow of doubt that hung over every young technology company, so Benioff and Parker decided they needed to take drastic action.\nNot going away \"We actually went public partly because we wanted companies to realise we were not going away. We were going to grow, we were here to stay,\" Harris says.\nDespite being based in San Francisco, the Salesforce executive chose to list on the New York Stock Exchange, which has a more rigorous process to list and requires a higher level of compliance than the NASDAQ.\nDuring the seven months between Salesforce announcing its intention to list and joining the NYSE, the regulator delayed it twice, over concerns about its accounting methods and complaints by the Securities Exchange Commission that a New York Times profile of Benioff broke the required \"quiet period\" during the float.\nThe company went public in 2004, with a market capitalisation of $US850 million. It was the 16th technology company to list that year and the third to price itself ambitiously above where analysts thought it should be. Its shares climbed 56 per cent on its opening day.\nMaintaining momentum \"People think floating should be the easiest and happiest time for a company, but it's actually really hard. We were meant to think we'd won – we'd gone public and could go on to new things. But we were only just getting started,\" Harris says.\nOne key challenge for the Salesforce leadership team was maintaining a healthy culture in the company. Harris began to walk past people in the corridors whose names he did not know and he knew that as companies begin to expand into the thousands, the ability to maintain and manage a culture inevitably slips out of the core executives' grasp.\n\"Our output and continued success is all about our culture. Ours has to be highly collaborative and we have company-wide events and processes to make sure everyone stays aligned,\" Harris says.\nIt is almost 18 years since he sat down to write the first line of code for Salesforce, but Harris says he has no plans to move on to another company.\n\"I like to build things and just love working with smart people. I wouldn't be as happy if I wasn't building things, and I can't think of much better than to keep building something innovative for decades.\"\n​This is part of an ongoing series of Start-up War Stories.
