Women4Solar will do everything in its power to push for Florida to come out of the darkness by allowing its residents to embrace the many benefits of solar power in a cost-effective way. — Raina Russo, Women4Solar Founder DELRAY BEACH, FLORIDA, USA, October 22,   Women4Solar , an organization of Florida’s premier social ambassadors aiming to shine a light on the benefits of solar energy and illuminate the path for solar-curious consumers, recently announced its endorsement of the Floridians for Solar Choice ballot initiative. The announcement came on the heels of Women4Solar’s participation in the Climate Reality Leadership Corps training, where Women4Solar founder Raina Russo, known as the “Solar Mom,” connected with other climate change leaders and solar advocates, including Climate Reality Founder Al Gore. After participating in the three-day intensive training session, Russo is recognized worldwide as a Climate Reality Leader, alongside other experts, such as panelist Debbie Dooley, head of the Green Tea Party and an active figure in the Floridians for Solar Choice initiative. By endorsing Floridians for Solar Choice, Women4Solar becomes a strong voice in a non-partisan coalition of over 60 local businesses, industry associations, political groups, faith communities, and clean energy and environmental organizations that support giving Floridians the right to choose clean, green solar power as an alternative to fossil fuels. As of today, Florida is one of only four states denying businesses and residents the freedom to buy solar power directly from anyone other than a monopoly electric utility or government-owned electric utility. “Florida is known worldwide as the Sunshine State, but less than 1 percent of the energy in Florida is coming from solar panels,” says Russo. “The Solar Choice initiative represents our best chance to change this and help create a smarter, greener way of life for all Floridians and a sustainable future for our children. After attending the Climate Reality Leadership Corps training, my next move became clear. Women4Solar had to align with these groups as a bridge between advocacy and action, connecting reputable solar installers with solar-curious customers and guiding them through the entire process, making our shared vision of solar growth a reality.” Pounding the Pavement for Solar As an endorser of the SolarChoice initiative, Women4Solar has participated, and will continue to participate, in a number of solar advocacy and awareness events. Most recently, on October 17, Women4Solar added its voice to the People’s Climate March in Miami, rallying along with hundreds of other members of Floridians for Solar Choice. Additionally, solar advocates young and old – including Russo’s own children -- campaigned to collect petition signatures in support of the Floridians for Solar Choice initiative. Women4Solar is also actively involved in the Road to Paris Climate Reality Project, which supports the U.S. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) campaign to reduce carbon emissions to pre-2005 levels by 2025. 680,000 Voter Signatures Needed to Support Solar Choice Next week, on October 28, 2015, Women4Solar will join the Floridians for Solar Choice volunteer training workshop, further solidifying the organization’s role as a solar leader and networking with other advocates as they share helpful tips to successfully campaign for the necessary 680,000 voter signatures required on the Solar Choice petition. If successful, a Solar Choice amendment vote will be placed on the 2016 solar ballot and, if the amendment passes, Florida residents will enjoy expanded choices in solar power providers, removing the barriers to investing in clean, renewable solar energy for many Florida families and businesses. “Women4Solar is proud to endorse Floridians for Solar Choice at this pivotal time,” says Russo. “As I go into the community as a Climate Reality Leader and share the incredible information Al Gore has put together, Women4Solar will do everything in its power to promote the Floridians for Solar Choice ballot initiative and push for Florida to come out of the darkness by allowing its residents to embrace the many benefits of solar power in a cost-effective way.” Those who wish to attend the Floridians for Solar Choice volunteer workshop, to be held on Wednesday, October 28, 2015 at Hacklab, North Boynton, 3491 High Ridge Road, Boynton Beach, FL, can register for free here.
