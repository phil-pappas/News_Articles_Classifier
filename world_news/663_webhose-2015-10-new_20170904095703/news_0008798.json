In his revamp of the bank, announced on Sunday , Cryan shook up the area of Deutsche Bank that's responsible for making sure these mistakes don't happen. He promoted Kim Hammonds, a technology specialist. \nHere's the statement: Kim Hammonds, currently Global Chief Information Officer and Co-Head of Group Technology & Operations at Deutsche Bank and formerly Chief Information Officer of Boeing, will become Chief Operating Officer. She will oversee the re-engineering of the Bank’s information technology systems and operations. To acquire the relevant experience in credit assessment in accordance with the German Banking Act, Hammonds will start her role as General Manager at the beginning of next year. She is expected to join the Management Board in no later than one year. \nThis is an important move. Analysts from JP Morgan said in a note that \"t he appointment of Kim Hammonds as new COO is a key appointment in the restructuring case of DB.\" \nA bank's operational risk department is supposed to catch problems such as rogue traders and mistaken transactions before they become a problem. \nBy putting a Hammonds in charge, Cryan will be hoping the bank has the right technology for this in future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:57:11.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
