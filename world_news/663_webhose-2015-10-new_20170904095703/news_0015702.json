Butts Jr. \nIn March, the city of Inglewood filed a lawsuit against Teixeira, saying six of his online videos had caused the city \"irreparable harm and damages.\" \nA judge disagreed, finding that Teixeira did not violate the copyright of the council meeting. \nInformation from: Los Angeles Times, http://www.latimes.com/ \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:37:41.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
