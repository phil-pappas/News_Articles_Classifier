Having to rely on different systems with multiple tools is often expensive, time-consuming and inefficient. Ultriva's technology supports true collaboration and execution between manufacturers and their supply chain partners to enable seamless performance and increased revenue.\nUltriva's cloud-based collaborative supply chain solutions solves challenges by creating a demand responsive network that extends from manufacturer's customers, through their plants and out to their supply chain partners. Global manufacturers using Ultriva benefit from more responsive and flexible supply networks and reduce inventory costs by an average of 35-40 percent per plant and improve customer delivery performance.\nAbout Ultriva\nUltriva’s (http://www.ultriva.com) cloud-based platform leverages seamlessly integrates with leading ERP and MRP systems, to deliver an end to end pull based replenishment solution.
