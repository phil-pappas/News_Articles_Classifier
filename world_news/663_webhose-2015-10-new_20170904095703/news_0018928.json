Buffalo I-Day draws more than 1300 insurance professionals.\n“Tech Tools and How to Use Them Safely” provided critical educational information relative to the insurance industry, including evaluating the effectiveness of a firewall, virtual private networks, strategies for intrusion prevention, mobile device management, and backup, disaster recovery and business continuity.\nAlper, whose firm’s client list includes a significant number of insurance industry clients, said that it is more critical than ever for the insurance industry to be vigilant where their website and infrastructure is concerned. “Because the insurance industry by its nature carries sensitive and confidential information about its clients, it is imperative for each agency and practice to be certain that information is protected.”\nAbout The Insurance Club of Buffalo\nThe Insurance Club of Buffalo has promoted education and fellowship in the Western New York insurance community since 1953.
