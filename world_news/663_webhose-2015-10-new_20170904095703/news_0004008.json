I have a real personal connection to the PTSD problem,\" Tyler said.\nPatrick Skluzacek now has night terrors, which according to the Mayo Clinic , \"are episodes of screaming, intense fear and flailing while still asleep.\"\nUSA TODAY\nAnother soldier spurned by Army dies of apparent suicide\nIn his case, \"at three in the morning all of a sudden I'm startled awake.\"\nTyler saw the effect on his father and wanted to help. In September, he entered a computer programming contest called HackDC .\nDuring HackDC, teams had 36 hours to create mobile apps for PTSD.\nTyler decided to \"try to create something that will help (his father) sleep better. That's what it's all about.\"\nTyler and his team, \"The Cure,\" wrote code and created a smart watch app called myBivy, short for bivouac — a temporary camp or shelter.\nThe app tracks heart rate and movement with the goal to predict night terrors.\nUSA TODAY\nJuly 4 can be a bad day for veterans with PTSD\n\"After a couple weeks of tracking the soldier we can find ... the exact symptoms of the onset of the panic attack and try to use the watch or use the Android phone to disrupt that or take them out of the deep sleep but keep them asleep,\" Tyler said.\nTyler said the app will use sound or vibration to prevent night terrors.\nThe myBivy app earned Tyler and his team top prize in the Best Mobile Application for Clinicians category. The team was awarded $1,500.\n\"I am very proud of him, yeah,\" his father said.\nThe app has yet to go through clinical trials but Tyler wants it on every veteran's wrist.\n\"My team and I kind of have a saying right now that my team and I won't sleep until the veterans can,\" he said.\nTyler said he has been working with the Department of Veterans Affairs and sleep experts. His team is currently raising money through a Kickstarter campaign.\nThey hope to start clinical testing of the app in the spring.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1LvjRQj TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://kare11.tv/1LaxNO5", "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/night-terrors/basics/definition/con-20032552", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LvjRQj&mini=true", "http://www.hackdc.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804903711930179-ptsd-app-101515.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LvjrJA", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc159f5f88658e4a4e2df5b2398e0256d1494e50/c=177-99-568-490/local/-/media/2015/07/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635714645355775217--eric-j-brock-3.jpg-20120924.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LvjRQj", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33d97f8a03d5ea06baca0f7a30eca34c8bd87643/r=500x281/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804903711930179-ptsd-app-101515.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/39df9339584aa260d3a0f5ef1a6030537a880a27/r=540&c=540x304/http/kare-download.edgesuite.net/video/73893094/73893094_Still.jpg", "http://kare-download.edgesuite.net/video/73893094/73893094_Still.jpg", "http://www.hackdc.com/glance", "http://www.hackdc.com/winners", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LvjRQj&text=Student%20creates%20app%20for%20vets%20to%20prevent%20night%20terrors&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5cfc5321b298bded7334f36809827cfe6a367184/c=558-0-3438-2880/local/-/media/2015/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635739526584588181-XXX-Akins-283.jpg", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1305386921/mybivy", "http://kare-download.edgesuite.net/video/73893094/73893094_Thumb.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/da2787534dcb33c5d8a72a1ca531b683f516f116/c=202-0-1694-1122&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804903711930179-ptsd-app-101515.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:52:22.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
