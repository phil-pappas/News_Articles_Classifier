The lists of lists. The lists of lists of lists .\nWe are a culture, and we have long been a culture, that loves lists. The list-o-mania runs counter to the logic of the list itself, in that it is both broad and inclusive: From the earliest Mesopotamian accounting—believed to have been the occasion for humans to create the mixed blessing that is writing—to Sesame Street ’s Count, we have relied on lists both to include and exclude, to delineate and declare and help us remember. “ The list is the origin of culture,” Umberto Eco, himself famously a fan of the list , put it. “It’s part of the history of art and literature.”\nHe added:\nWhat does culture want? To make infinity comprehensible. It also wants to create order — not always, but often. And how, as a human being, does one face infinity? How does one attempt to grasp the incomprehensible?
