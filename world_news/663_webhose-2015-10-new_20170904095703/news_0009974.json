He has designed and created a new and improved fire proofing technology for the Forestry Service. \nThe game changing technology is a multi-surface spray that can withstand up to 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. Surfaces treated essentially become self-extinguishing. He says he developed the spray and a ceramic zirconia fire blanket, that doesn’t burn and shows complete resistance to thermal shock, based on the NASA technology used to handle the searing heat of atmospheric reentry. \nWith fires raging across the country, this space-age tech could change the way we fight fires and protect our homes. Fire shelters used by hot-shot teams typically have been effective up to 1000 degrees, but only for minutes at a time. Keeping fire fighters safe in significantly higher temperatures and durations could save lives, especially if they become trapped by fast moving, high-heat blazes. \nMoseley’s California-based company is called SunSeeker Enterprises. His hope is that one day soon these products will be routinely utilized by those fighting dangerous wild fires. The company also says the technology won’t cost very much more than the older tools that firefighters currently use. \nIn addition, the fire blanket can be integrated into structures to protect homes and business buildings from fire. The tech can be used for automobile emergencies or even just to handle hot items in the kitchen. The spray can be used to treat historical buildings or potentially as a way to help stop fire spread when homes may become threatened by wildfire. \nWatch these exciting demonstrations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPsd12tqC20 https://www.dropbox.com/s/n917kd4gschyuq0/Utility%20pole%20burn.mp4?dl=0 and if you want to help crowd fund the revolutionary new Fire Shelter visit: http://www.gofundme.com/71kloo \n### \nCopyright 2015 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
