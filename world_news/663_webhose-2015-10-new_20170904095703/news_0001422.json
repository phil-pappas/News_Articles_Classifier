But, few know that it has another important application in the treatment of water. Thames Water's new Advanced Water Treatment (AWT) plant in Middlesex contains a state-of-the-art ozone generating system and to provide satisfactory environmental conditions within the generator room the company installed a Munters desiccant dehumidification system. \nThames Water is one of the UK's largest utility organisations and its new AWT plant supplies the recently completed 83km Thames Water Ring Main. Costing Â£100m, the Ashford Common AWT plant is one of the most modern in the world and processes 690 million litres of water a day. \nThames Water is using ozone in conjunction with granular activated carbon (GAC) to remove trace organics (pesticides) to ensure compliance with European Water Quality Standards. The ozone generators are water-cooled, but because the room they are in is relatively warm, condensation problems can occur during certain periods of the year. \nTo read more, please download this free whitepaper...
