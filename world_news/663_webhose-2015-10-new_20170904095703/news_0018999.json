The report details historical and projected single mode shipments by application and LTE category. \nAccording to Christopher Taylor, author of the report, \"Single mode LTE Cat. 2 and above data rate chipsets will ship into the bulk of devices through 2020, but lower-priced LTE Cat. 1, Cat. 0 and MTC chipsets will find ready adopters, supporting demand in less data-rate sensitive applications.\" \nAndrew Brown, Director of the Strategy Analytics Internet of Things Strategies service added that \"The top tier suppliers of M2M modules and gateways including Sierra Wireless, Telit and Gemalto are moving rapidly to 4G. Today most devices employ multimode LTE, but the need for narrowband in IoT applications remains strong, which combined with the 2G sunset in the US and the ramp in low power wide area networks (LPWA) from vendors like SigFox will see single mode LTE accelerate as concerns about LTE coverage diminish.\" The report includes information on more than 100 M2M module and device suppliers expected to move to single-mode LTE. \nThe report, supplied in EXCEL format, provides details of single-mode LTE unit shipments of M2M devices including LTE routers, portable external modems, tablets, embedded notebooks, handsets and wireless local loop consoles. \nAbout Strategy Analytics \nStrategy Analytics, Inc. provides the competitive edge with advisory services, consulting and actionable market intelligence for emerging technology, mobile and wireless, digital consumer and automotive electronics companies.
