Developed countries including the U.S. and the EU have pledged absolute reductions in emissions, while China has vowed to peak its emissions by 2030 and India has pledged to reduce its emissions per unit of gross domestic output. \nSaudi Arabia and other oil and gas-producing countries in the Middle East are among those that haven't proposed any targets yet. \n\"I had talks with Saudi Arabia last week in Istanbul and they told me they will be coming along with their (target) in due course,\" he said. \"I'm confident that (it) will arrive before Paris.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:51:02.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
