The coffee giant has named Gerri Martin-Flickinger, who previously served as senior VP and CIO of Adobe, as CTO effective Nov. 2. In her new role, Martin-Flickinger will lead the global IT function and play a key role in shaping the technology agenda across the Starbucks business. Interestingly, in her previous life she played a key role in enabling Adobe’s transformation to a cloud-based business. “Gerri is a technologist at heart and has a 30-year track record of leveraging technology-based solutions to drive business value,” said Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and COO. “As we continue to shape our global technology agenda at Starbucks, we needed leadership talent with deep experience in cloud, big data analytics, mobile and security to take us to the next level. As we searched for that leader, Gerri stood out as someone who has years of experience in Silicon Valley and brings deep management and technical expertise to help us navigate the future.” Martin-Flickinger will report to Johnson and serve as a member of Starbucks senior leadership team. Before Adobe, notable positions during her 30-year IT career include serving as CIO of VeriSign, as well as CIO of Network Associates Inc. and McAfee Associates Inc Current Starbucks CIO Curt Garner announced in June he would be leaving the company. Given Starbucks’ proprietary technology initiatives, such as ongoing mobile order and pay expansion, as well as planned online delivery, it is clear that the company is not slowing down efforts to serve as its own provider of technology innovation.
