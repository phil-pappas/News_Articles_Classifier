Culbert's 10-year history and expertise in guiding the nation's leading academic medical centers and integrated health systems to apply best practices and technology will be enhanced by Connexa's focus on extending and optimizing core access, clinical and revenue cycle applications to improve adoption and enhance the return on IT investments. \n\"With provider organizations facing changes in reimbursement and financial risk, there has never been a greater need for knowledge and expertise in applying technology that extends the value of existing investments,\" said Rob Culbert, president and CEO at Culbert Healthcare Solutions. \"Organizational performance is key to success and our team is making more and more observations and recommendations around technology improvements. ConnexaHealth is a trusted partner that will help our clients achieve that goal.\" Connexa's solutions center on conducting a comprehensive examination of technology within an organization, including people, processes and workflow.

Under the partnership, ConnexaHealth will build on this expertise by providing Culbert clients with a trusted source of IT services and products. \n\"Connexa's relationship with Culbert is truly synergistic and creates opportunities for sophisticated groups to realize the potential of their IT investments through a coordinated engagement, where the application of technology is informed by deep subject matter expertise,\" said John Beck, ConnexaHealth's chief product officer. \"Since the passage of the HITECH Act , the vast majority of groups possess the technology to meet EHR Incentive Program objectives, but few are able to move beyond implementation to adoption.
