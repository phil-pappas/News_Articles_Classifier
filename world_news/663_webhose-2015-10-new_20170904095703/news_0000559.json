Microsoft is hoping to bring a hands-on experience to customers with the company's own devices, as well as a lineup of other gear from Microsoft's partners, including Lenovo, Dell and HP. While Microsoft already has more than 100 stores around the United States, the opening of its sprawling flagship store on New York City's Fifth Avenue is set to position the brand to compete with its big neighbor down the street: Apple . \nABC News will be live-streaming from inside the Microsoft store around 12:30 p.m. ET, so stay with us for a live look inside of the 22,000-square-foot center. \n\nMicrosoft Band: What You Need to Know About the Scary-Smart Wearable \n\nLumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL: A Look at Microsoft's New Phones \n\nMicrosoft Surface Book: Company Unveils Its First Laptop \nMicrosoft has continued to up its game when it comes to making devices that function as both tablets and laptops. Today's opening coincides with the release of Microsoft's highly anticipated new Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. \nThe Surface Book is the company's first-ever laptop, coming with a 13.5-inch screen with 6 million pixels. \n\"We have the best engineers who understand portability and performance,\" Panos Panay, Microsoft's head of devices, said at a Windows 10 devices event earlier this month. \"Ounce for ounce, pound for pound, this is the fastest 13-inch laptop ever made.\" \nThe Surface Book weighs 1.6 pounds and is 7.7 millimeters thin. It's essentially a clipboard, making it easy to show someone something on your screen. \nBuilding on their success in the 2-in-1 devices category, the Surface Pro 4 has a 12.3-inch screen with 5 million pixels, making the resolution even higher with an even thinner screen. \nThe release of the Surface Pro 4 comes at an important time. Apple and Google recently unveiled their latest entries into the 2-in-1 device category, with the iPad Pro and the Google Pixel C.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments \" \nInside Microsoft's New Flagship Store   \n  \" \nTrump   \n  \" \n  Ricky  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:50:55.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
