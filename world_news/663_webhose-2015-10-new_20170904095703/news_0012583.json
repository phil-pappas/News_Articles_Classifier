I got so irritated, I said Adani Ambani 'aapka mehrbani hai' (Adani Ambai are your gifts),\" Naidu said in an apparent reference to Congress. \"We came to power only last year. All these industrialists were there during their 10-years rule,\" he said while addressing a conference organized by industry body FICCI on the 'Smart City' project.\nThe minister said there was nothing wrong with implementing projects under PPP mechanism with partnership among people, private players and government. \"Without people's participation you cannot make anything successful. And what is industry? You are private people. You are ready to do business with Pakistan, and you are not ready to do business with your own Indian industrialists,\" he said.\nNaidu also criticized some of the opposition parties for blocking the key reform Bill that are pending in Parliament. Citing how the proposed laws such as the Real Estate Regulation Bill and GST are crucial ones, he said all such bills are not of the Modi government rather these are \"will of the people\". Naidu said, \"People no more want sloganeering. They had enough of it. They want development and more jobs, which are this government's commitment,\" he said.\nNaidu said making smart cities is more than providing business and investment opportunities and required infrastructure. He said the 100 cities will work like lighthouse for thousands of other cities. \"We need cities that can sustain themselves through judicious use of precious and scarce natural resources ensuring ecological equilibrium. The task of building smart cities is no doubt challenging but can be achieved if all stakeholders rise to the occasion with innovative thinking, planning and execution,\" he said.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-09T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:24:09.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
