The new Moff Android app is a free download and connects via Bluetooth to the Moff Band, the world’s first wearable smart slap bracelet for kids ages 3-9. By choosing sounds and play activities on the Moff app, kids wearing the Moff Band can move around and be active with realistic sounds that follow their arm movements. For example, as kids swing their arms, a whisk can become a tennis racket, a spoon doubles as a magic wand and pencils turn into drumsticks — the Moff Band encourages kids to exercise their imagination! “The Moff Band is the only children’s wearable that combines accelerometer, gyroscope and Bluetooth sensors with an app and gaming development platform,” says Aki Takahagi, co-founder and CEO, Moff Inc. “Today’s availability of the Android version of the Moff app ensures that kids and parents with smartphones or tablets — regardless of whether it is an Android or iOS device — can now enjoy hours of imaginative and active fun with the Moff Band wearable smart toy.”\nThe Moff Android app requires Android version 4.4 and greater and supports best-selling Android devices including Samsung Galaxy S4, S5, S6, Note Edge; Motorola Moto G; Google Nexus™ 4, 5, 6, 9; Sony Xperia Z, Z1, Z3, Z4.
