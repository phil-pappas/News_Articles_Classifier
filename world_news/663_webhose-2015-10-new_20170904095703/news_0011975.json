[Click to enlarge image] \nThe autonomous vehicle being developed by Toyota Motor Corp can now autonomously travel from an entrance of an express way to an exit while changing lanes and passing other vehicles. \nThis time, the company announced that it uses deep learning for the technology to recognize situations surrounding the autonomous vehicle. \nAs a situation in which image recognition technologies using deep learning are useful, Toyota cited a roundabout (a kind of intersection). In an intersection that connects more than two roads with a circular road, vehicles change their directions while running on the circular road in one direction. \nWith conventional image recognition technologies, it is difficult to predict which road each of such vehicles will exit to, according to Toyota. When a large number of images of vehicles running on a roundabout were studied by using deep learning, the estimation accuracy was drastically improved, the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:15:52.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
