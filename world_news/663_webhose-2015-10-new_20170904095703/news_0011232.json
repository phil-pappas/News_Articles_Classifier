Referring to the link below only 15% (yes, that is one five percent) of undergraduate students graduate - considering that many of these students are supported and that universities are subsidized in any case this means a significant waste of money.\nI remember when I was at varsity - you want to believe that all students take their studies seriously, but that is simply not the case - many are there for the partying and disappear after a year or two. And the poor student who only has 60% of her costs subsidized - stating she did not realize what the cost would be disqualifies her to study already. Take ownership of your life, get a job as a waitress, get a loan and repay that when you have graduated - many had to do that when I was a student. Stop playing the victim card.\nSo my question - how many of the protesting students are in fact on course to graduate in the allotted course time or graduate at all (never mind cum laude or anything like that)? If there are a high percentage of those we should listen, otherwise this is a diversion tactic (seeking excuses).\nWill free education work - I think not. People don't value what they get for free (consider state of free houses that are provided to people after a few years) - if students don't take their studies seriously when they have to pay part of the fees, how are they going to take it seriously when it is free - seems like it will be one extended holiday. Is the tax payer suppose to fund their parties (booze etc.) as well?\nIf there are anything that fails these students it is the school education system and their parents/support structures that should prepare them for student life.\nhttp://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/kids/only-15-of-sa-university-students-graduate-1.1531809#.Vim7Z34rJD8", "external_links": ["http://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/family/kids/only-15-of-sa-university-students-graduate-1.1531809#.Vim7Z34rJD8"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:17:54.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
