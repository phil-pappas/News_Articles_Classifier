With InStyle Virtual, we are elevating that access to a new dimension and are offering our readers the chance to virtually experience the moments that captivate 23 million women each month,” said Ariel Foxman, Editorial Director, InStyle and StyleWatch. \nInStyle Virtual premieres with a three-minute tour of a cover shoot starring record-holding, eight-time InStyle cover girl Drew Barrymore. Captured with Jaunt’s proprietary 360-degree, stereoscopic cameras and advanced 3D sound-field microphones, the content fully immerses viewers in the scene with complete freedom to look in any direction—as if they were actually there. \nDuring the 360-degree virtual reality tour, viewers are able to see Fashion Director Melissa Rubini style Barrymore in Stella McCartney, as well as feel that they are standing in Barrymore’s shoes as she poses for photographer Jan Welters. Barrymore, who wears Valentino on the cover, also speaks directly to the viewer and reveals some of her favorite makeup tips. \n“Virtual reality is enabling a new age of exploration. For the first time, anyone in the world can travel to New York City in an instant, stand on the set of a celebrity photo shoot and glimpse the magic behind the scenes,” said Jens Christensen, cofounder and CEO of Jaunt. “InStyle Virtual is a perfect example of brands, creatives and technologists coming together to engage audiences in entirely new ways.” \nTo experience InStyle Virtual, consumers simply download the JauntVR app on their smartphones and use a VR viewer. The app and viewer are available at a variety of price points, starting at $5. InStyle is also distributing free, branded cardboard viewers to select subscribers along with the November issue, and starting today, consumers can go to InStyle Virtual to sign up for a chance to receive a limited edition red viewer. \nInStyle Virtual will continue to unveil new experiences throughout the coming months, including a behind-the-scenes look at the inaugural InStyle Awards at the Getty Center on Monday, October 26.
