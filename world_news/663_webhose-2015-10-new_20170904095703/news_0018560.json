Two arms containing solar panels to power it for the next 15 years unfurled according to plan.\nDr Switkowski attended the launch, describing it as “loud, explosive and muscular”. He later said he was disappointed Australia had not embarked on its own space program, whereas countries such as Argentina had “produced what is demonstrably a successful space program”.\n“We do have to question how they have gone about it and can we learn from that process, and I think we can,” he said.\nDr Switkowski said it was ­inevitable NBN would have to either replace the Sky Muster satellite when it ran out of fuel in 15 years or lease capacity from newly launched satellites in order to keep up with the download demands of the bush.\nHe said it would also be possible to extend the reach of the NBN’s fixed wireless network to the nation’s most rural and remote areas as mobile technologies advanced.\n“By then there will be all types of new satellites and new providers. Broadband has become the fundamental infrastructure of the early 21st century so there won’t be any hesitation in staying a bit ahead of the curve,” he said.\n“With two satellites I think we have bought ourselves several years. And then in five years’ time, what is the requirement going to be and will there be an experience gap? In the meantime, we are stretching out the fixed wireless network.”\nDr Switkowski said Australia could model a future space ­program on the Argentinian ­approach.\n“They haven’t got the formula right yet, but the access to bright people, the nurturing of talent, the ability to put their ­aspirations into worthwhile ­national programs around space and nuclear energy mean that all of a sudden they are a feature on an international scale which we are not,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:41:45.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
