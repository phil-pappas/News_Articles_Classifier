BET bromodomain inhibition is an epigenetic mechanism that can regulate disease-causing genes. Apabetalone is the first and only BET inhibitor selective for the second bromodomain (BD2) within the BET protein called BRD4. This selective inhibition of apabetalone on BD2 produces a specific set of biological effects with potentially important benefits for patients with diseases such as high-risk cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, Orphan diseases, and peripheral artery disease, while maintaining an excellent safety profile. Apabetalone is the only selective BET bromodomain inhibitor in human clinical trials. Resverlogix's Phase 3 clinical trial BETonMACE in high-risk CVD patients with DM and low HDL is planned to commence in the fall of 2015. Resverlogix's common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: RVX). For further information please visit www.resverlogix.com .
