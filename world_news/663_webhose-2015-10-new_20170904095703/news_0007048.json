The company also announced the private beta launch of its Deep-Learning trading platform, Capitalico , that lets people build trading algorithms with few clicks and visually from historical chart.\nAlpaca fully leverages its Deep-Learning technology into personal investing sector with Capitalico , where even beginner traders can build their own trading algorithms intuitively without any programming. Existing algorithm building services always have involved programming which is not familiar for most discretionary traders and beginner traders.\n\"We saw an opportunity to support traders and to-be traders who understand and process the market data visually from looking at charts and technical indicators, and for them to backtest and automate their trading strategies,\" said Yoshi Yokokawa, Alpaca's co-founder and CEO. \"I am surprised myself how easy and simple the experience is to build complex trading algorithms on Capitalico by simply selecting a portion on historical chart without worrying anything about programming at all.\"\nCapitalico is now accepting signups to the waiting list for the early access to the service. Capitalico is scheduled to be available public as beta beginning of next year.\nAbout Alpaca\nAlpaca is a San Mateo based Deep-Learning startup enabling AI technology to automate professional human tasks. 2015 June, Alpaca made its debut with the easiest deep-learning SaaS for computer-vision \"Labellio,\" which was featured in NVIDIA's technical blog \"PARALLEL FORALL\" for its advanced backend technology used in the application to enhance the existing deep-learning capability to be faster and parallel.
