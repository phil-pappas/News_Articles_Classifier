Immunexpress's SeptiCyte® technology quantifies directly from whole blood specific molecular markers from the patient's own immune system – the \"host response.\" Detecting the host's septic immune response can diagnose sepsis earlier and more accurately than current sepsis diagnostics that focus on identifying the invading pathogen. Immunexpress's pipeline includes monitoring assays for readily available platforms, including point-of-care (POC) sample-to-answer platforms.
