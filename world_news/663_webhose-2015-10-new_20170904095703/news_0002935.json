Well, you can’t- but with Civitas Learning, you’ll come closer than ever!\nWe visited this Austin, TX company to see how they’re putting foresight and insight back into the hands of college students. Civitas Learning works with universities to collect and utilize data, predictive analytics and machine learning to power their apps.\nTheir standout app, Degree Map, helps college students plan their entire course of study from Day 1. It helps students plan and make the most of their education, and it’s a crucial tool that can be useful to any student in a day and age when higher education can be a quarter of a million dollar investment .\nWith Degree Map, there’s no more cramming classes in at the last minute during Senior year, or accidentally taking classes that won’t even end up counting toward your major. Degree Map provides powerful financial insights to help students understand the implications of making changes to their course of study. It has been instrumental in keeping students in school, especially those considering dropping out, by showing them how much more they’ll have to spend to finish their degree.\nTheir goal is to help a million more college students continue to learn and finish strong. We have a feeling they’ll make it happen. As their slogan goes, “Science, in the hands of smart and caring people, can change the world.”\nThis is the fourth episode of the new series “Disruptive,” which highlights disruptive innovators sponsored by Strayer Education.\nSubscribe now for more videos from Elite Daily: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=elitedaily\nProducer: Tracey Zane\nJunior Producer: Camille D’Elia\nProduction: Top Notch Cinema\nPost-Production: Top Notch Cinema\nMusic Courtesy of Extreme Music:\n“Cheeky Monkey”\nWritten by Sharx Killa\n“Get Smart”\nWritten by Dust Devil\n“Cinderella Complex”\nWritten by Michael Dennis Smith, Bruce Fingers and Billie Ray Fingers\nhttp://www.elitedaily.com\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily/videos?ref=page_internal\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/EliteDaily\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/elitedaily\nG+: https://plus.google.com/ +elitedaily\nWhat is Elite Daily?\nWe proclaim ourselves to be the voice of Generation-Y and never disappoint.\nAs the premier online destination for aspiring men and women alike, Elite offers a forum of peer-to-peer interaction in an increasingly digitalized world.\nThe site consistently delivers diverse content with a fresh, relevant voice that appeals to the divergent perspectives represented within our ADD generation.\nFor all video inquires contact: VideoContact @ elitedaily.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/elitedaily\nComments", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/U21rytRXJeM?&autoplay=1&rel=0", "https://plus.google.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily/videos?ref=page_internal", "https://www.facebook.com/brittonboy", "http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=elitedaily", "http://www.youtube.com/elitedaily", "http://twitter.com/EliteDaily", "http://instagram.com/elitedaily", "http://brittoncreativellc.com/make-your-investment-count/", "http://www.strayer.edu/new-homepage?MarketingCode=DG267"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:05:49.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
