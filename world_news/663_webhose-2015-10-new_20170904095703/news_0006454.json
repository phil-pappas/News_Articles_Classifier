The new solution provides a much better view of trips, data, and daily operating processes to operations managers, train crews, and customers - who are now finding it extremely easy to access new and important information from all railroads.\nNEPTUNE BEACH, FL (PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nShipXpress Inc., a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions for the logistics industry, announced that the Morristown & Erie Railway (M&E) has chosen the RailSync® product suite to manage its railway logistics.\nSince 1895, the Morristown & Erie Railway has been providing freight transportation services to Morris, Essex, and Union Counties in Northern New Jersey. They move commodities such as lumber, plastic, food products, and chemicals throughout North America in collaboration with other national freight carriers. M&E also provides rail services to the mid-coast of Maine as the Maine Eastern Railroad, and performs in-plant switching at the Bayway Refinery which is the second largest oil refinery in the East Coast.\n“M&E did not have visibility across their properties because their previous solution had each of their railroads in a separate database. Being a true SAAS single instance solution, we enabled real-time access of operational and revenue information across all properties. M&E’s management can make timely decisions with complete access to all this information even via mobile devices,” said Charith Perera.\n“The transition to the ShipXpress solution was smooth and their customer service was impeccable. The new solution provides us with a much better view of trips, data, and daily operating processes as our operations managers, train crews, and customers are finding it extremely easy to access new and important information from all of our railroads. We now have all of our properties using one system that tracks our revenues and operating expenses at a corporate level, which allows us to better monitor cash flows and make more cost-effective decisions. Another addition in the system that helped us improve our car hire payables process was the ability to see our liability on a daily basis,” said Chuck Jensen, VP & Chief Operating Officer of M&E.\nAbout ShipXpress Inc.\nShipXpress is a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions, enabling industrial and commodities businesses to efficiently operate and collaborate with their supply chain partners.
