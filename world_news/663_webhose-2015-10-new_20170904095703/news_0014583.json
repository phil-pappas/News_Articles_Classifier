He couldn’t publicly acknowledge that it was a major security breach at this stage of things, just no one would publicly say to someone who had accidentally stated some classified information: “Hey, that’s TOP SECRET, you idiot!” You never let the enemy know what you know about what he knows, at least not when it matters. It will be many years before that could happen, after we had mitigated the damage. Of course, we have to know what the damage was to begin with, which Hillary’s deletion of emails has made much more difficult. \nWhat puzzles me is the reportage. Fox states “The FBI is currently investigating whether classified information that passed through Clinton’s server was mishandled.” This is sloppy journalism. If classified information was sent and stored on an insecure system, it was mishandled, period. That isn’t anyone’s opinion. It’s in every Special Security Guide written in the computer age.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:35:59.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
