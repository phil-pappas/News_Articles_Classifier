Another attempted transfer of about $76,000 to a Philadelphia bank account failed. \nPenneco says the bank covered company losses; the bank is trying to recoup the money. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show the drilling company's bank, not the drilling company, is the victim of the alleged scheme; the bank covered the drilling company's losses. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
