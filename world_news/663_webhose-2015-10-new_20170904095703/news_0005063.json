The Society believes that building New Zealand’s research capability is best done by promoting excellence. \n\"Also, it is pleasing the see the definition of impact is much wider than economic returns, incorporating family, health, societal and environmental spheres.\" \nThe Strategy outlines investment in four areas: investigator-led, mission-led, industry-led and tactical funds. \n\"It is interesting to note that the Government seeks a short-term push on encouraging industry to invest in research and development, aiming to push New Zealand’s low levels of investment in this area up to 1% GDP over the decade. \n\"Overall, this should lift New Zealand’s total public and private investment in research and development closer to the proportion of GDP that other countries allocate. This is essential to position New Zealand to be a prosperous nation. \n\"Long-term, the government sees its primary role in the science sector to invest in mission-led and investigator-led research on behalf of the New Zealand public. It will be important to ensure that this supports stable career paths for researchers. \n\"We agree that additional investment in investigator-led research, such as the Marsden Fund, and mission-led research builds a strong research base in New Zealand and helps New Zealand attract and retain our brightest young people.\" \nThe strategy states that an annual system of performance reports as well as a comprehensive sector-wide evaluation, monitoring and reporting system will be introduced. \n\"We welcome this,\" Professor Bedford says. \"It will allow evidence-based decisions about whether current science investments are supporting excellence and generating impacts as expected.\" \nThe document signals other initiatives such as the establishment of regional research centres, developing a new strategy for international engagement and a major redesign of the contestable fund managed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Professor Bedford says. \n\"Overall, we think it’s a very helpful document, well set out with useful illustrations and comparisons to five other small advanced economy countries. \n\"It provides a clear signal of the intention to lift science investment for the benefit of all New Zealanders.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:05:54.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
