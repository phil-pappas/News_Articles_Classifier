However, these medications may have harmful effects, for instance a reduced growth rate in development and a shorter height in adulthood. \nIn this study, researchers from Kuopio University Hospital and University of Eastern Finland analysed information on the height, weight and asthma medicine intake of 12,482 Finnish children aged 0-24 months. The researchers found that children who used inhaled corticosteroids during the first 2 years of life were too short for their age. This result was more evident in children taking the asthma medicine budesonide for more than 6 months. \nMany factors that alter development in children, such as chronic illnesses and long-term use of oral corticosteroids, may cause a shorter than normal height in adulthood. Lead researcher Antti Saari said that their research shows a link between long-term treatment of ICS during infancy and stunted growth at or after the age of 2 in otherwise healthy children. \nSaari added that according to the research, they could only assess the impact of inhaled corticosteroids on growth in infancy until 2 to 3 years of age. The longitudinal impact of these medications is not clear and they would therefore like to investigate this further. \nThe research was presented at the 54th Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology Meeting.
