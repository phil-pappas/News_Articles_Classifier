Announced partners include Bonanza Media’s free-to-play Tribal Idol and PikPok’s Four Letters. After initial tests, both companies have committed to implementing the engine into additional apps. \n\"At Bonanza Media, we're always looking for ways to innovate and improve our user experience. As developers, we spend a lot of resources creating engaging games and acquiring new customers,\" said Chris Hewish, CEO of Bonanza Media. \"Lootsie is a strong part of our overall strategy with Tribal Idol and the rest of our portfolio. We strongly believe in the ongoing opportunity that loyalty and in-app rewards programs bring in terms of revenue and retention.\" \nWhether online or offline, loyalty programs create a critical narrative between the app and the user, which ultimately helps form a relationship between them. Every aspect of Lootsie’s loyalty solution was created to build loyal fans, increase engagement and provide a unique branded experience. For companies that already have an existing offline loyalty program, Lootsie is a turn-key solution to extend existing programs into their mobile apps. \nLicensing Lootsie’s newly launched white-label platform means mobile developers of all shapes and sizes can offer the same types of loyalty programs that Fortune 500 companies have been utilizing for decades, but without the development and maintenance cost. \nBenefits for App Developers include: Customize: Lootsie gives developers a completely customizable native front end and points system. Rewards look as if they come from the developers themselves. Revenue and monetization: Developers can leverage the marketplace to drive additional revenue through branded rewards while enhancing existing revenue streams. Rewards increase time spent in app, which increases engagement with in-app advertising and more money spent on in app purchases. Conversion and engagement: Loyalty drives more engagement and converts users 30x better (on average) than any other engagement mechanism. Simple deployment: API level integration means developers can be up-and-running with minimal asset and resource requirements; Available across all platforms. Curated Rewards Marketplace: Lootsie provides a fully curated marketplace with rewards from top tier brands for users to choose from. Developers can include their own branded rewards in addition to Lootsie supplied brand offers. \n“App developers and brands are always having to answer 'what’s next' and in the coming years almost every app will have some type of loyalty/reward system. It will be a core component to every publisher and brand’s engagement, retention and revenue strategy,” said Marc Mitchell, Lootsie’s co-founder and CEO. “Whether it’s a consumer app, fitness app, or a paper-toss game, every developer should start thinking about their app as an extension of their brand and loyalty as a crucial part of the user experience.” \n“We wanted to reward player loyalty in a real and valuable way. Lootsie provided the opportunity to give users real-world rewards for playing, which is an exciting new aid in user retention. And because Lootsie's White Label is highly customizable we were able to create a high quality, native experience that looks and feels good to the player. We’ve been so excited with the initial results that we’ve decided to integrate the White Label in several additional titles and create our own network to reward our users,” said Karah Sutton, Marketing and Advertising Manager at PikPok. \nFor developers looking for a more turnkey solution, Lootsie also offers a plug-and-play option.
