The only way to get to the market is on a shikara that you can hire from the shikara stands on the Dal Lake. Be warned, however, that you have to be up before dawn, because the market lasts just from 5 am to 7 am and if you opt for that extra snooze, you may well miss it. However, once you shake yourself out of your sleep and make your way to the boat, the shikarawala will seat you comfortably in his freshly washed little craft and you’re in for the ride of your life. Over the tranquil grey lake, peaceful in the early hours, you will hear the call of the mullah reading the Fajr (early morning prayer). The moon still shines above and the only other sound that you hear is the gentle splash of the oars of the shikara. You pass by the big houseboats that are still slumbering and make your way into the backwaters of the Dal. You can’t see much, but as your eyes start getting familiarised with the shadows, you see some floating shapes emerge — more people on shikaras — water dwellers who start their day early, and who most likely, are headed to the same destination as you are. You may hear a shikarawala’s song before you see him. He will pass you by with a cheery salaam and you politely reply. Around the same time the dawn starts to break and you will find a vendor draw up close to you, trying to send you flowers. “This is for you, sister…free” he will say as he hands you an over-bloomed dahlia. And then, he will peddle you seeds, bulbs and cut flowers. You are tempted to make a purchase, but there’s no guarantee that the flowers will bloom in your garden back home. Around this time you start noticing that the shikaras that are passing by are laden with vegetables — huge bottlegourds, gaanth gobi, green chillis, corn, brinjals and cucumbers. The sizes of the vegetables are pretty formidable but they’re garden-fresh, tender and gorgeously coloured. While some shikaras are groaning under the weight of vegetables, some may have just one variety — plucked from the water dweller’s vegetable patch. All the vegetables are wholly organic and picked only hours ago. Apparently, 1,250 acres of land surround the lake and are used for cultivating vegetables. The annual turnover is estimated to be in the range of Rs 35 crore, so it’s a thriving business. The floating market first caught the attention of a Japanese photographer who published it in a tourist guide in 1960. Since then, this charming place of commerce has been a favourite tourist experience. After about an hour (depending on which part of the lake you are approaching from) you came to the actual market. Shikaras mill around; Some are buyers and others sellers. The local vendors will also come to the shore of the lake to fill up their vans with the produce. It’s a direct sale from the growers to the retailers. Once the brisk business is done, the shikarawalas will relax, chatting and laughing, sharing a beedi and gossip before lazily paddling off. You can get off your shikara here and take pictures from a small bridge on the lake. It’s a veritable beehive of activity and noise. And it all gets over in an hour! You step into your shikara again. The ride back is another lovely experience. The sun is rising and you can now see the beautiful lotus plants growing on the lake; their wide green leaves holding shimmering droplets of dew glistening in the early morning rays. It’s likely that when you exclaim in delight at the pretty pink and white lotuses, your shikarawala will lean across and pick some for you. Keep your cameras ready to roll for now you can see local and exotic birds — the Great Blue Heron perched on wooden spokes thrust into the lake or a hawk on trees above looking for quarry. Swimming along your boat will be some sweet little water birds (Little Grebe) looking for small prey. In winter, you will get to see many migratory birds, though, of late, there have been some stories of these being killed. The lake is waking up by the time you head back, there’s some activity in the villages located in the backwaters and the houseboats that you will pass. You can now also see how the water dwellers have reclaimed land in the lake and created floating gardens, growing plenty of vegetables in the intensely fertile soil. It’s just about 7 am and you still have the whole day to yourself in the beautiful valley. If you’re in Srinagar, don’t let sloth keep you away from the floating vegetable market. It’s really quite different from your usual trip to the grocery store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:56:51.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
