Intel Corp. on Tuesday said sales growth in its server chip division will weaken as corporations cut back spending.\n“TSMC is facing a combination of weaker-than-expected demand for PCs and smartphones, record high inventory, and a lower share of iPhone chip orders compared to a year ago,” Warren Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said before the earnings release.\nThird-quarter sales of NT$212.5 billion met its Sept. 23 revised forecast and surpassed its own July projection for as much as NT$210 billion. Revenue was boosted by a positive exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, it said .\nOperating profit in the quarter was NT$78.4 billion, missing estimates for NT$79.3 billion. Gross margin, a key metric that assess revenue less the cost of goods sold including depreciation, was 48.2 percent in the period, compared with expectations for 48.4 percent.\nRevenue this quarter will fall to NT$198 billion to NT$204 billion, it also said last month. That’s below the NT$213 billion average of estimates at the time and on track for its first sales decline in four years.\nChairman Morris Chang said in July that the slow rate at which chip inventories were declining was “not a very good omen” for fourth-quarter sales.\nA continuing slowdown in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, prompted IDC in August to cut its forecast for global handset shipments. Growth in China alone will be just 1.2 percent this year, compared with 19.7 percent last year, it said.", "external_links": ["http://www.tsmc.com/tsmcdotcom/PRListingNewsAction.do?action=detail&language=E&newsid=THPGWQST\\", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150825005723/en/Worldwide-Smartphone-Growth-Expected-Slow-10.4-2015#.VhylNyuSdcB\\"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:03:20.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
