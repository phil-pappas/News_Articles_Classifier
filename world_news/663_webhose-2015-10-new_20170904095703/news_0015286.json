The FDA describes medical molding validation as establishing objective evidence that a given process will produce products that meet its preset specifications, without going through an intensive in-process testing and finished device testing.\nProcess validation is particularly important for the molding process since virtually everything appears to revolve around it. Medical molding is a strong sector in the manufacturing industry producing custom plastic components for various medical devices. These include components for blood analysis equipment, heart pumps, orthopedic tools, fetal heart monitors, EKG parts, catheters and custom knee braces, among other critical devices and equipment.\nSo process validation not only ensures the well-being of patients, but facilitates minimal wastage of resources by avoiding reworking which produces large amounts of scrap and cuts down on actual output. Validation also enables reduction in cost of quality products and successful product launches with fewer complaints and recalls, setting the standard for future product development processes.\nIt Doesn’t Come Easy\nAs with anything worthwhile, companies face various challenges in trying to get validation right. The fact is, it takes quite some time and a lot of work to get process validation right even for the most seasoned companies, so it should not be a point of discouragement for new medical manufacturing companies.\nSome of these challenges include:\n1. ‘Objective evidence’ Needed to Validate the Process Is Relative\nThe FDA definition of process validation is hinged on the presence of objective evidence. However, this does not refer to a particular standard raising the question of who finally determines the quality has been reached. It is impossible for the client, auditor, process technician, design engineer and quality rep to all agree on quality standards.\nGranted, the company or industry may set statistical standards for allowable variations in the process. However, this may not be taken into account by the designers when determining tolerances. The entire scenario can get rather chaotic.\n2. Creeping Elegances Can Impede the Process\nThis is the problem of ‘just one more thing’. Clients can sometimes make last minute requests for changes in their products which affect the entire system and validation process. It could also affect the functionality and usability of the end product which unfairly gives the process a poor reputation yet they were simply trying to satisfy client specifications.\n3. It Can Take Years\nThe process of ensuring that the parts are up to par can take a long time particularly for large scale operations. Noticing and then fixing problems arising along the ‘production line’ can take time when you have a large system to run.\n4. It Doesn’t Come Cheap\nProcess validation challenges the ‘business side’ of the company since it must put quality before profitability to ensure long-term success. The resources required to ensure this quality come at a cost that may be quite high initially.\n5. Product Launches Can Be Cancelled\nUnfortunately, this is a common occurrence, especially for companies that haven’t yet mastered process validation. It can be a major or minor issue with the product but if it does not meet the preset requirements, then it will not be cleared for launch.\nOnwards and Upwards\nDespite the challenges, there are companies that have overcome them to become leading authorities in the medical molding industry. Here’s how they did it.\nSet Up a Cross-Functional Team\nThis team should have a representative from quality compliance, design, procurement and manufacturing departments, led by a program manager who understands process validation and expectations, and can translate them internally to develop a standard and plan for success.\nAlong with the contract manufacturer and original equipment manufacturer, the requirements can be identified and documented for each stage of production. The team will then develop a plan along these requirements as well as defining project deliverables and quality standards for each of them.\nMake a Plan\nThe team should come up with a plan to succeed at validation. This will begin with deciding what you want to produce and the process to produce it. Determine product testing and risk reports before starting anything. Then make sure that all the workstations, automated processes and relevant machinery to produce this part are functioning optimally and set to the required specifications.\nRelevant personnel must also be identified and made familiar with the product. If necessary, personnel should be trained and provided with reference manuals pertaining to this training. Process capabilities and performance standards should also be set and documented along with equipment maintenance and repairs.\nDocument Your IQ, OQ and PQ\nValidation begins with the equipment which is why you must ensure your installation qualification (IQ). You should show that all the equipment as well as the facility are maintained and calibrated as expected. This should be an ongoing process so that you can produce documentation of previous calibrations that you can easily produce.\nOperational qualification (OQ) ensures that your equipment runs as expected throughout the entire process. This should be evaluated against established parameters and should include a full inspection of the first article from each process.\nProcess qualification (PQ) tests the stability and dimensional capability of the process during long runs at standard conditions. It shows if the equipment and process can consistently produce products that meet preset quality and function standards.\nAll of these processes should be documented in a validation master plan and should be run regularly in order to ensure that the process is working well.\nIt Can Be Done\nIf the original equipment manufacturer and contract manufacturer work together with the cross-functional team to develop and adhere to the quality plan, monitor the process and have regular inputs, then you should be able to have a smooth process validation experience.", "external_links": ["http://www.rscal.com/fda-process-validation/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:05:18.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
