All times in ET/GMT) JPMorgan Chase & Co will kick off bank earnings, posting third-quarter results and holding a conference call with stock analysts after the market closes. The company is expected to report a fall in trading revenue, but lower expenses could offset that.

(1145/1545) Intel Corp, the world's largest chipmaker, is expected to report third-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' average estimate, according to StarMine data. Intel has been hurt by weak demand for personal computers and has been expanding its line-up of higher-margin chips used in data centers. However, the PC business still remains a stronghold for Intel. Research firm Gartner said worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter as a stronger dollar made them costlier. Investors will look out for the benefits from cost cuts that Intel has been implementing to offset some of its revenue weakness.
