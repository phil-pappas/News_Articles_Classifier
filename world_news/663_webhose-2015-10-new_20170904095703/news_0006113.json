Wide ranging applications for the new “Serial Interface NAND” include such consumer applications as flat-screen TVs, printers and wearable devices, and industrial applications, including robots. Users can choose from a wide line-up of 12 products that offers three densities, 1Gbit, 2Gbit and 4Gbit; two packages, WSON [1] and SOP [2] and two power supply voltages. Samples shipment starts today and mass production is scheduled to begin with the 1Gbit products from December. Mass production of the remaining line-up will follow. \nCompatibility with the widely used SPI, which can be controlled with just six pins, allows the new “Serial Interface NAND” to be used as SLC NAND flash memory, with a low pin count, small package and large capacity. \nNOR flash memory is typically used in embedded applications for consumer and industrial devices. However, in order to realize extra functionality in embedded devices, demand is growing for larger memory densities for saving software (including boot up programs, firmware, and embedded OS) and data (including log data). This is driving demand for SLC NAND flash memory, which offers higher density and reliability and a lower bit cost than NOR flash memory. \nBy adding the “Serial Interface NAND” to its product line-up, Toshiba aims to meet wide ranging market needs and to expand the market for NAND flash memory. \nNotes[1] WSON: Very-Very thin Small Outline No Lead Package[2] SOP: Small Outline Package Outline of the New Products: Part Number", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:47:30.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
