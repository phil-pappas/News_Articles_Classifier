Rayburn believes that lack of compatibility is mostly on Amazon's end, not because Apple and Google are blocking the app. Advertisement \nApple and Google declined to comment. Amazon's move came just two days after Google introduced the second generation of its two-year-old Chromecast device, a stick that allows users to stream video from the Internet into their living room television sets. And it was just a few weeks ago that Apple announced it will release a long-awaited update to its Apple TV box later this month. \nBoth of those products -- as well as Google's digital streaming box, the Nexus Player -- will now be blocked from Amazon.com , but the retailer said it will continue selling \"excellent choices\" such as its own Fire TV devices, Microsoft's Xbox, Sony's PlayStation and devices from Saratoga-based connected TV pioneer Roku Inc. \nWhile Roku's boxes and streaming media sticks are among the most popular, the company -- unlike Apple, Google and Amazon -- does not provide its own streaming content and so is not seen as a major competitor for the broader digital \"ecosystem,\" Rayburn said. \nBloomberg Business was first to report the ban Thursday morning, citing an email Amazon sent to third-party sellers of the Google and Apple devices. \n\"Effective immediately, you may no longer create new listings for these products, and as of (Oct. 29), any existing listings for these products will be removed,\" Amazon wrote. \nAlthough Amazon has faced antitrust challenges over electronic book publishing, Rayburn could think of no example of the retailer refusing to sell products to hurt its rivals. Nor does he think the government should get involved. \n\"Amazon should be allowed to sell whatever they want, just like any other store,\" he said. \nMany analysts were perplexed by the decision and viewed it as an inconvenience that is unlikely to help Amazon or hurt Apple and Google. \n\"Like other corporate spats in recent years, the feud between Amazon and two of its competitors, Apple and Google, ultimately hurts the consumer but won't have a significant bearing on the businesses of any of the companies in question,\" wrote Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, in an email. \"Consumers who want Apple TV or Chromecast products will easily find them at retailers other than Amazon, including Apple and Google themselves, which sell those streaming products directly.\" \nApple sells its TV box in its own stores, Google sells its devices from its website, and major retailers such as Best Buy and Walmart sell both. \nGoogle's Chromecast recently surpassed Roku as the leader in the connected TV market, according to eMarketer, which says Chromecast has 22.8 million monthly users, Roku has 22.6 million and Apple TV has 17.7 million. The research group doesn't include Amazon's Fire TV on its list because the product is still too new. \nAmazon was a late arrival in the connected TV market but is swiftly seeking to catch up. Its Fire TV devices, developed in the Seattle company's Silicon Valley hardware research lab based in Sunnyvale, were first introduced last year. Amazon updated the line in September, adding an option for a voice-activated remote control. Another research firm, Strategy Analytics, published a report this summer asserting that Fire TV devices are rapidly growing in market share. \n\"I can understand them pushing hard into this space,\" said Colin Gillis, a tech analyst at BGC Partners. \"It's not exactly a consumer-friendly move but at the end of the day it's just noise.''
