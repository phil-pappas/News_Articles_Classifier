This system, which is being displayed at booth 10017, is designed to improve the performance of engine tests within the automotive industry.\nOffering noise-free measurement and precise process control, the PMX measuring amplifier system from HBM, is incorporated into the new platform and has been specifically developed to enable the continued development of the performance of current and future engines, in order to meet future standards based on their fuel efficiency.\nFeaturing expanded scaling and filtering options for recording torque, the torque sensor can be scaled in PMX using the polynomial characteristic curve or characteristic table with automated detection of clockwise/counter clockwise motion, to provide accurate results.\nHBM has also implemented the CASMA (Crank Angle Synchronous Moving Average) filer into the system. For PMX with a moving average over the angle of rotation, for example, the new filter design is used to form a crank angle synchronous moving average for determining cylinder-dependent torque distribution.\nPMX generates characteristic quantities such as power, mean and peak values and also torque using the PID controller. The PMX measuring amplifier system with its open communication interfaces combines with powerful HBM torque sensors to ensure efficient test processes for a range of automotive applications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:14:25.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
