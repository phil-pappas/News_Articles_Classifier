On October 14, 2015 , after the market closed, Imprivata issued a press release disclosing disappointing preliminary Third Quarter 2015 financial results. The Company further announced the unexpected delay of some Imprivata OneSign deals, which led to lower than expected revenue growth. The Company suggested that three factors contributed to the shortfall: the delay of certain large deals due to \"customer implantation schedules and available IT resources,\" a decline in product sales due to several deals that failed to close, and lower than expected sales to smaller hospitals. Shares of Imprivata were down 33.55% on intraday trading on October 15, 2015 .
