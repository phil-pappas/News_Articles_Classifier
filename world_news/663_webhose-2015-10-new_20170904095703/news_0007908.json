With two matches coming up this weekend, we expect two colossal rugby contests.\nIts an all out southern hemisphere semi- final.\nThe northern hemisphere will be watching with pen and paper in hand.\nThe mighty All Blacks are once again best described as a \"well oiled machine\". You cannot help but love their love for Rugby.\nHow ever prepared they always seem to be and how ready they appear this year.\nThe dream final for me would be NZ vs SA but I guess this is the big one for us. Send NZ home and our job is but half done.\nI thought Hyneke was near genius taking three Fly-halves until our clash against Wales. I just couldn't watch the last 20 minutes. We kept kicking the ball away and giving our hard earned possession away.\nThe Trie scored by Dupreez was enough to tear Hyneke's bookmaker ticket for a Welsh win up and throw it in the dustbin.\nI mean, surely after the first half he knew his game plan was poor. To continue the same plan of destruction in the second half was surprising. Too much for me to bare. If he tries that against NZ or the Auzzies we will be slaughtered .\nWe need to play like never before and we need a better game plan. Bruise them upfront and may not a lazy moment rest in any of our players. May they be filled with an intensity and commitment around the lose ball. Take the opposition out of play and patiently gain ground. Enough to lay some drop goals where they belong.\nForget elaborate play and forget these high kicks please. Its taking us away from our strengths. Wales outplayed us in the air, Imagine what the NZ and Aussies will do.\nAnyway, It seems we are left to hope for a miracle to win this weekend and nothing less the weekend there after.\nI will be cheering the Puma's all the way this weekend. May they stop the ever tenacious Aussies dead in their tracks.\nThe Argentinians are owning their own sense of passion and flare for the game and are lovely to watch.\nTearing the Aussies down is going to be fun to watch.\nWhat utter despair for NZ and Aussie fans this weekend if the most passionate of sides succeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:30:43.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
