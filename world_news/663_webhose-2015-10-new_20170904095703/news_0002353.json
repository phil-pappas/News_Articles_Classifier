Another session featured participants representing a group of Jordanian startups that tackled the issue of growth in the digital gaming industry in Jordan. The summit also featured a session that shed light on the issue of how to \"Tap and Grow into International Markets.\" On the sidelines of the summit, an exhibition was held featuring Jordanian digital gaming startups and indie developers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:46:42.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
