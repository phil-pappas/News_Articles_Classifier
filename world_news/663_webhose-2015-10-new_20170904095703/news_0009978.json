Patheon executives, technical and scientific experts attending CPhI ICSE Worldwide will be available to discuss the company's full services and capabilities. \nTwo Patheon experts will present at the Speaker's Corner on Wednesday 14 October. \nVice-president of global PDS scientific excellence Marshall Crew will discuss how to optimise solubilisation strategies and unlock the potential of promising drugs in his presentation 'The story of solubilisation: new data and insights on the past and what lies ahead.' \nLow solubility is a growing issue in the successful development of pharmaceutical products, and solubility outcomes can be unpredictable. \nCrew will explore the scientific expertise that is required to ensure success for these increasingly complex formulations, and the multiple technologies available to address solubility. \nVice-president of global alliance accounts Joe Principe will present 'Mitigating uncertainty in demand forecasting with flexible capacity solutions' at 2:30pm. \nPharmaceutical companies develop forecasts to estimate future needs, but predicting performance in a market filled with competing products that do not yet exist is problematic. Principe will discuss several ways to provide cost-effective flexible manufacturing capacity.
