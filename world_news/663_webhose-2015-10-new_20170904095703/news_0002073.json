Shaban Bantariza, a government spokesman, told reporters in Kampala Friday that the purportedly classified document cited by Privacy International wasn't an authentic government document. \nBut Francis Mwijukye, an aide to opposition leader Kizza Besigye, said the report proves it is \"time for Ugandans to say enough is enough.\" \nPrivacy International's report said FinFisher spyware was deployed against opponents of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni during protests in 2011. \nThe group published what it said was a leaked Ugandan presidential briefing which said \"hordes of data\" had been gathered by the spyware.
