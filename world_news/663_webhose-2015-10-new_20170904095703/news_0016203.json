Photo: Jay Maidment\nThe \"Mjölnir\", from Norse mythology and repurposed by Marvel, can only be lifted by a worthy hero. In this case, only the tech wizard can lift the hammer — so long as it's resting on a metal surface. When switched on, the electromagnet creates a strong magnetic field, clinging to the metal surface below so it feels too heavy to lift.\nAdvertisement Pan asked passers-by in Los Angeles to lift the hammer in a YouTube video, with some amusing results. As soon as anyone grabs the hammer, it switches on the electromagnet and locks in place.\nOf course, when Pan goes to pick it up, it recognises his thumb and turns the electromagnet off so he can lift it. Great party trick.\nThe replica hammer. Photo: YouTube\nOne bloke did succeed in gaming the replica hammer, however, simply by sliding it off the metal man-hole cover it was sitting on and onto the adjacent concrete. Ta-da!\nPan also made a cool weapon from the famous Naruto manga series for his little brother. It's called a Rasengan — a ball of blue energy that hovers above the palm of the hand.\nThis time he talks us through in detail how he made it, using batteries and switches repurposed from remote control cars, a couple of motors, some LEGO and some LED lights. It's a fair bit simpler than the hammer.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGHK6yeuU5w"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:16:55.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
