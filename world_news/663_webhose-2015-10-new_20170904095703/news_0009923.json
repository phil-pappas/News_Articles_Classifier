Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not.\nZoe Krupka news.com.au TAKE a good look at your friend. In person, face to face. Then take a look at your friend on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Do the two pictures match up?\nIf they’re actually human, chances are that your pal’s online profile is different in some key ways to their in person real self. Given two minutes warning of someone coming over, most of us will clear our crap out of the lounge room. We want to make a decent impression. Pretend we’re always tidy.\nAnd online, the opportunities for a little profile tidying are endless. This is not news to anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock since the 90s. The problem is, if you’re trying to find love, all the airbrushing of your real, messy self might help you find people who are happy to visit, but it’s not going to help you find someone who wants to stay the distance. If you want to find real love online, it’s time to stop treating yourself like an AirBnb.\nTinder is one of the most popular online dating apps for smartphones. Source: News Corp Australia\nOnline dating has a very long and chequered history. As far back as the 60s and 70s, psychologists and matchmaking gurus were trying to build programs to help singles find their perfect match. They had two main ideas that haven’t changed despite the fact that we’ve gone from computers the size of office buildings to smartphones smaller than a cronut: offer a pool of people as big as possible and look for compatibility.\nThe problem for most of us, is that we’re so concerned with appealing to as wide a group of people as possible, that we often miss out on the compatibility part, and this may mean we end up going on more dates that go nowhere . While we’re busy cropping our photos, editing our real interests and softening our hard edges to attract as many potential mates as possible, we’re making the age old mistake of keeping our real selves in the closet, thinking that love can only come if someone doesn’t really know who we are.\nThis is frustrating for the geeks with the algorhythms , because of course they need the real stuff to help you find the real thing. If you’re not brave enough or self-aware enough to describe yourself accurately, no one who might be really interested will ever be able to find you.\nI once spent a hysterical session with a very depressed client who was finding it incredibly hard to write his online dating profile. How could he talk himself up? He felt worthless. We decided that the best thing might be for him to start with what he felt were the deepest and darkest truths about himself. So he wrote about everything from his bad posture, bald patch and low self-esteem, to his irritability and his aggressive and offensively hairy Persian cat.\nThe result was so bleak it was side splitting. He’s a really talented writer. We laughed together – a very rare event during that terrible time – while we tried to imagine who might reply.\nOver the coming months I encouraged him to make it a little more realistic, and as he began to feel a bit better he was able to include some loveable things about himself too. When he finally posted it, it was a totally recognisable portrait – a real picture of him, depression and all. And when he began to go on dates, he didn’t have to do any pretending. His profile had done a lot of the hard work of breaking the ice, almost forcing him to be himself.\nOnline dating can give you a safe time-delayed space to experiment with being courageous enough to be your real self. You get to experiment with new ways of being. And if your old ways involved some hiding, online love hunting can give you an opportunity to write the real stuff in unreal time, giving you the chance to work up to a face to face with someone you’ve already told the truth to.\nIf you can avoid the temptation to tidy up your profile and risk being real, you’ll have a much better chance of finding someone who might fall in love with that reality. So be safe , but keep it real.\nZoe Krupka is a psychotherapist with experience in relationship counselling.
