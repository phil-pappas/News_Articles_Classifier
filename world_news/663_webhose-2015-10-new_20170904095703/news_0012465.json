These rich people come and go. Even when they still have their money, you’ll never know where they are because they have so many houses. Check out the big lists, like the Forbes billionaire list. Look for some Old Money. The reliable Old Money is nowhere to be found. It’s gone, displaced by billionaires so young they haven’t voted in more than two presidential elections.\nIt’s all New Money. Easy come, easy go.\nThere was a time when only Texans believed that Old Money was anything left from last week. But today that’s how it is across the country. New Money, which can be lost in a nanosecond, is in.\nSo, I ask again: Do we really want most of the money that supports government coming from people like this?\n“You betcha!” is the common answer. “We should round up all those basketball players, Fortune 500 executives, unicorn startup guys, IPO princes and hedge fund managers. Then we’ll tax ’em until they get reacquainted with the Dollar Menu at McDonald’s!”\nBut maybe we ought to give that idea a bit more thought.\nThis year our government will spend $1.1 trillion operating what’s called the discretionary portion of the federal government. And while it’s called “discretionary,” a word that implies it’s pretty much a matter of casual choice, it isn’t. Lots of people would call that spending pretty essential. It includes Medicare and health, veterans’ benefits, education, transportation, and energy and environment.\nMuch of that $1.1 trillion comes from the federal income tax. Some of it comes from the corporate income tax, which is, for the most part, another basket for rich people’s money. And still more comes from our favorite source, the place we go back to again and again.\nThe trouble with debt Yes, I’m talking about borrowing. We’re good at it. We’ve been doing it for decades, and these days, the more we do it, the lower interest rates go. I mean, is this a great century to be alive, or what?\nSkeptics can consider this. At the end of the 1998 fiscal year, total federal debt was $5.5 trillion and the total interest cost of that debt was $363.8 billion. By the end of fiscal 2014, total federal debt had soared to $17.8 trillion, but the interest cost of that debt was only $430.8 billion. That’s an increase of only 18.4 percent while the debt more than tripled. If borrowing were an Olympic sport, the USA would shut out the competition.\nMost of the money that sustains our government comes from rich people and borrowing. That’s not a very stable condition. A major recession, and government tax revenue would collapse as companies cut dividends and capital gains plummeted. In a major recession, even excessive executive compensation could disappear. And borrowing money, at any interest rate, could get a bit difficult.\nSo, much as I would love to jump on the “tax the rich” bandwagon, we probably need to do something different.\nThe numbers Some readers, no doubt, will be reluctant to believe that we depend too much on the rich for the money that sustains our government. So let’s consider some figures from our beloved IRS.\nIn 1987, the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid 24.8 percent of all income taxes. But by 2012 they were paying a whopping 38.09 percent.\nThe top 10 percent paid 55.6 percent of all income taxes in 1987 but paid 70.17 percent of those taxes in 2012.\nThe top 25 percent paid 76.9 percent of all income taxes in 1987 but paid 86.42 percent in 2012.\nThe odd part here is that when we talk about the top 1 percent, the threshold income is $434,682. That’s a hefty number if you live in Des Moines or Fargo, but it will barely get you indoor plumbing and running water in Manhattan or San Francisco.\nThe reality is that millions of ordinary Americans don’t understand that you can join the top income ranks simply by being a two-earner couple. You’re in the top 5 percent of taxpayers with an income of $175,817. And you’re in the top 10 percent with $125,195.\nThe real money — the big money — is at much higher levels. At the one-tenth of 1 percent of all taxpayers level (or one taxpayer in a thousand), the income threshold is a whopping $2,161,175.\nNow that’s real money. Just don’t expect the same people to have it every year.\nScott Burns is a syndicated columnist and a principal of the Plano-based investment firm AssetBuilder Inc.
