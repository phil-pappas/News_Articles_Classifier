The overall mobile phone ownership in the state stands at 83.6 per cent in urban households and 52.6 per cent in rural households.\nIn fact, the national average of proportion of households headed by a millennial and owning a mobile is marginally higher than the households where the family head is a senior citizen.\n\"It is evident that the power of mobiles is leapfrogging with progression of technology and communication... The second wave of mobile revolution in India has already begun, but will reach its full potential only if access can be extended even further and deeper,\" said Tata Teleservices Ltd. president (mobility) Elango Thambiah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:30:03.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
