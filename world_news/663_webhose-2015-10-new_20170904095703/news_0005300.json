Photo: http://www\nThere are some cunning ways to get BMW audio on a Hyundai budget, you just have to think hard and find a co-operative hi-fi dealer.\nWhen I bought my first stereo, I wanted sound quality at least as good as my dad's system, one I had been using for years, but I had nowhere near as much to spend. I started by buying the cheapest amplifier wearing a premium brand. These base models often incorporate some of the good tech that makes such brands famous. They don't pump much power but they frequently make very sweet music.\nThen I bought a cheap turntable and I had the dealer add a high-quality arm and cartridge. There was a lot of rumble at first (it sounds like an underground train approaching) but putting the turntable on a folded-up blanket fixed that.\nAudiophiles can experience top-rank headphone quality for around a grand. Photo: Supplied\nI couldn't afford any speakers even remotely good and my amplifier wouldn't have driven decent speakers properly anyway, so I didn't go there; I bought a great pair of headphones. The sound? I had difficulty believing I had got so much for so little.\nAdvertisement The headphones were the key, and great headphones have been part of my system ever since. It's still a truth of h- fi that if you want the best sound quality you can get without taking out a second mortgage, headphones are the way to go, and I've recently listened to some beauties around $1000; a lot of money for headphones, but speakers with this sound quality, this involvement and this much sheer pleasure would cost 10 times that.\nFor $1000, you'll get about the best headphones there are before getting caught up in the law of diminishing returns. From here, the next step up is, for many musical purists, electrostatic headphones – and good ones start around $1500 to $2000. These have a delicacy and airiness that lots of people love, others dislike their mild bass response. There are more expensive conventional headphones too, but the improvement in sound is not sufficient to justify the extra cost unless you're a dedicated (and well-heeled) purist.\nI started out with Sony's $999.95 MDRZ7s , bulky and reasonably heavy, but very comfortable with an excellent clamp pressure to hold them nicely in place without undue pressure on your head. The ear pads form a comfortable, airtight closure around the ears, which is part of the reason the bass gets down so low.\nThese have an amazing range, claimed to go from four Hertz to 100,000, which is from earthquake-low to highs way beyond audible. The bass gets right down there but it's beautifully defined and there's brilliant accuracy on the decay of thunderous notes, always an acid test.\nThe mids and highs are nicely balanced with first class definition and spaciousness. Musical nuance is the strong point here. Great if you're into dance, rock and practically anything contemporary.\nThese and the Audeze (I'll get to them soon) have split headphone cords to reduce crosstalk, or the signal from one channel interfering with the signal from the other, and with the Sonys, the plugs screw into the headphones. This means if you forget you're wearing them and walk away (and I still do this) you'll take the stereo with you. There's also a balanced cord for use with a headphone amplifier Sony makes specifically for these, the PHA3 at $1099.95.\nGrado's $899 RS1e differ a little in that like the Audeze (I'm getting there), they're open-backed, meaning that they don't cocoon you from the outside world, but you will hear the doorbell. The earcups​ are finished in mahogany, which makes them look stunning. The bass is not strong but for classical music, these are superb. Try them out first; you may not like the grilles over the drivers being in contact with your ears.\nAudeze has a fine reputation in premium headphones and the open-backed EL8s, at $999, are the cheapest the brand offers. These are high-tech and borrow ideas from electrostatics for a fine and beautifully defined top end, while the bass is still powerful. The cost is weight and size, although comfort is excellent, with generous earcups and a beautifully padded headband with clamp pressure that's just right. These are great all-rounders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:07:23.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
