Google has a fun feature for you. \nSimply type in “fun fact”, “fun facts” or “I’m feeling curious” into the search box and a random fact will appear, such as “Can a kangaroo jump backwards?”, which they can apparently, if only for a “very small distance”. \nIf you’re even more curious to learn some new facts, you can also hit the “ask another question” button to unleash an endless list of random trifles. \nDid you know, for instance, that Tarzan’s real name is actually John Clayton, Viscount Greystoke? \nAnd that after being built in 1886, the Statue of Liberty took 34 years to turn completely green? \nOr that there are about 3 million shipwrecks on the ocean floor, according to the UN? \nAnd that the chicken nugget was invented by a food science professor at Cornell University called Robert Baker? \nGoogle also provides a link to where the information has come from, allowing you to check its validity. \nUsing its inbuilt encyclopedia, Knowledge Graph, Google pools each of the informative fripperies directly from other sites, which include National Geographic, Wikipedia and New York History. \nThe feature joins a host of kooky search features including: “I’m feeling playful”, which directs you to recent Google Doodles; “I’m feeling generous” directing you to a number of charity projects; and “I’m feeling Stellar”, taking you to Google Earth. – The Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:09:08.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
