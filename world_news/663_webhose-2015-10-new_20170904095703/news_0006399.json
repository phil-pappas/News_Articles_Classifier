Proposals relating to a wide range of manufacturing operations are encouraged, including both subtractive and additive processes, forming, bonding/joining, and laser processing. Of particular interest are proposals that relate to the manufacture of equipment and facilities that enable the production of energy products. Competitive projects will propose hypothesis-driven research that advances the frontiers of knowledge in relevant areas. Proposals submitted to the MME program should include a clearly articulated research (not developmental) objective and a coherent plan to accomplish the stated objective. Both experimental and theoretical work are supported. All proposals must include a statement outlining the societal benefits of the proposed activities, including the proposed research, in a separate section labeled ÂBroader Impacts of the Proposed WorkÂ.Proposals accepted for consideration in the MME program must be fully compliant with the most recent version of the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG). Persons submitting proposals to the program should review the GPG (http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg) as it is updated frequently and submission requirements change. Investigators wishing to serve on a proposal review panel should send an email to the Program Director with a short biographical sketch, a list of areas of expertise and a link to their home page. REU/RET supplement requests should be submitted by March 31 each year.
