Online shoppers are increasingly reliant on consumer-generated reviews on everything on Uber rides to hotel rooms to buying iPhone cases on Amazon. About 45 percent of consumers consider product reviews when weighing an online purchase, compared to 31 percent of consumers that consider product information, according to Forrester Research.\nSo retailers have tried to crack down on paid-for bogus reviews in a variety of ways. In April, Amazon sued several sites that offered to produce reviews. In the current litigation, the company is going after writers of the reviews themselves who have accounts on freelance marketplace Fiverr.com. They don't name them in the complaint because they're working to determine their identities.\nAmazon says the writers of the fake reviews are liable for breach of contract because they violated Amazon's terms of service.\nIn a statement Amazon said the complaint is not against Fiverr.com but against individuals selling reviews and says the vast majority of the reviews on its site are authentic.\nFiverr said in a statement that it actively removes services that violate its terms of use and respond to any reports of inappropriate content.\n\"The challenge of merchants soliciting illegitimate reviews is one that faces all marketplaces and online platforms,\" Fiverr said in a statement. \"In fact, in our own marketplace we restrict reviews to only those who we can verify have actually purchased a service.\"\n___\nThis story has been corrected to state the lawsuit was filed in King County Superior Court, not Washington State Superior Court.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:46:30.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
