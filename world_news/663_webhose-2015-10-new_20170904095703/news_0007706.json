Third quarter 2015 EPS from continuing operations was $1.47 compared to $1.65 in the third quarter 2014. Third quarter 2015 EPS from continuing operations included, as expected, a $0.09 unfavorable impact associated with Raytheon|Websense (RW) acquisition accounting adjustments discussed in further detail below. \n\"I'm very pleased with our strong revenue growth and cash flow generation in the third quarter,\" said Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. \"The Raytheon team remains focused on driving future growth by developing and delivering innovative solutions that address our global customers' most complex challenges.\" \nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for the third quarter 2015 was $1.1 billion compared to $0.4 billion for the third quarter 2014. The increase in operating cash flow from continuing operations in the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to favorable working capital in the quarter and the timing of cash taxes. Year-to-date operating cash flow from continuing operations was $1.5 billion in 2015 versus $1.2 billion for the comparable period in 2014. The increase in operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2015 was primarily due to the timing of required pension contributions and the collection of the eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office, which was resolved in the first quarter 2015, partially offset by higher cash taxes.
