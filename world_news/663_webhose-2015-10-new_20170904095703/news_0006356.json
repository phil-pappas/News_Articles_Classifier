Its client base consists of retailers, contractors, developers as well as architects and designers. \nMr. Ghazele said the products are sourced from reputable manufacturers from around the world with its main product lines being Villeroy & Boch, Grohe, Pavigres, Eliane, Tredex all of whom have well-earned reputations as leaders in their industry. \nHaiflow is the fashion leader when it comes to the latest innovative designs in the industry as it offers to clients a variety of products that cater not only to their individual needs, but also their budgets. \nMr. Ghazele said the stress of Ghanaians travelling to Europe and other continents to buy products is over as the company has brought these products to the door-steps of Ghanaians and prospective buyers. \nThe company has also renovated its showroom on the Spintex road in order to serve its customers better. The General Manager therefore urged customers to come to the newly renovated showroom for their quality products that meet their needs. \nHe said they do regular research on the market to know the taste of the Ghanaian consumer so every product in the showroom is designed to address the needs of the consumer. \n“Haiflow is dedicated to maximise the value we offer to each customer every day. The Haiflow team is constantly looking for ways to improve as we are committed to quality,” he added. \nHe said the company will in the next five years open additional six branches to the already four existing ones in the country to serve the general public irrespective of where you are. \nMr Ghazele added that the company will continue to educate the public to know the benefit they will derive in purchasing their products in order not to settle for inferior products.
