Kerry and Lavrov will hold discussions later on Friday with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The American and Russian diplomats will also hold a meeting that will seek to reduce the violence between Israelis and Palestinians that has spiraled in recent weeks.\nThe Obama administration is hoping to restart a diplomatic process to stop the Syrian civil war and usher an end to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. US officials believe Mr Assad is incapable of leading Syria due to his violent crackdown on political opponents that has included the use of chemical weapons and barrel bombs, according to international observers.\nMr Kerry stressed the need for a political solution in Syria during meetings he held on Thursday in Berlin.\n\"We agree on [the] criticality of keeping together all of the institutions of the government [in Syria] and of engaging in a political process, because everyone has agreed there is no military solution,\" Mr Kerry said before a meeting with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. \"One thing stands in the way of being able to rapidly move to implement that, and it's a person called Assad -- Bashar al-Assad.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has doubled up his support for the Syrian dictator over the past month by launching airstrikes against rebel forces seeking his overthrow. The Kremlin has closely coordinated its military operations with the Syrian regime and its other international backers, Iran and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah.\nThese combined forces have reclaimed territories in Syria previously lost by the Assad regime to the insurgents.\nMr Kerry and other US officials have expressed hopes the Russians will agree to a political transition that will eventually see Mr Assad exit Syria's political scene, even if he's allowed to remain in office through the political transition. Mr Assad met with Mr Putin on Tuesday in Moscow to discuss the Syrian conflict.\nMr Lavrov was asked ahead of his meeting with Mr Kerry on Friday if Moscow was open to a political transition in Damascus. The senior Russian diplomat refused to comment.\nSaudi Arabia and Turkey are major backers of insurgent groups that have been fighting against the Syrian regime. Mr Kerry has said a political solution is only possible if the Middle East's major political and military powers sign on.\n\"This meeting is not meant to suggest that there are just four parties here; there aren't,\" Mr Kerry said on Thursday. \"But there are some very specific issues that we want to discuss which then lead to a broader participation.\"\nMr Putin said Thursday that he had received permission from Mr Assad to offer support to rebels in Syria who are prepared to \"really fight\" against Islamic State extremists. It wasn't immediately clear which opposition groups would fit the Kremlin's criteria.\nMr Assad himself and members of his regime have called on rebels to join regime forces in fighting Islamic State on many occasions over the past couple of years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:41:14.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
