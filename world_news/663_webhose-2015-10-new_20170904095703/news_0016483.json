The Company offers customers a convenient way to shop for a wide selection of products at attractive prices through its www.lightinthebox.com , www.miniinthebox.com and other websites and mobile applications, which are available in 27 major languages and cover more than 80% of global Internet users.\nFor more information, please visit www.lightinthebox.com .\nInvestor Relations Contact\nChristensen\nMs. Xiaoyan Su\nTel: +86 (10) 5900 3429\nEmail: ir@lightinthebox.com\nOR\nChristensen\nMs. Linda Bergkamp\nPhone: +1-480-614-3004\nEmail: lbergkamp@ChristensenIR.com\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nLightInTheBox uses non-GAAP net revenues, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP loss from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted ADS, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP net revenues is net revenues excluding foreign exchange impact on net revenues. Non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit excluding foreign exchange impact on net revenues. Non-GAAP loss from operations is loss from operations excluding foreign exchange impact on net revenues and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net loss is net loss excluding the foreign exchange impact on net revenues and share-based compensation. Non-GAAP net loss per basic and diluted ADS is non-GAAP net loss divided by weighted average number of basic and diluted ADS, respectively. The Company continuously monitors the impact of currency exchange rates on net revenues given that it is a global company and has exposure to a variety of currencies. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2014, there was a significant impact on net revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Due to the nature of its business, the Company believes that excluding the impact of such fluctuations more appropriately reflects the Company's results of operations, and provides investors with a better understanding of the Company's business performance. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of foreign exchange impact on net revenues and the non-cash impact of share-based compensation adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of foreign exchange impact on net revenues and non-cash share-based compensation expenses, which have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's net loss for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" at the end of this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
