Only on AP: Clinton server ran software that risked hacking 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON (AP) — The private email server Hillary Rodham Clinton used while secretary of state was connected to the Internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers.\nAn Associated Press review found her server used remote-access software that allowed connections directly from the Internet. Such software was also the target of industry and government warnings about its security vulnerabilities.\nThe new details provide the first clues about Clinton's computer setup when she used it exclusively for her State Department correspondence. The AP found at least two other devices on Clinton's home network in New York whose purposes were unclear.\nClinton has since apologized for using the server. She has yet to detail how well it was secured, or if it received regular software updates that could have protected it from intrusions.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/06/8782212/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/40/06/8782212/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-13T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:45:46.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
