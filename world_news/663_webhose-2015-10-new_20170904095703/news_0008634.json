Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an important component of modern therapy for diabetes mellitus. SMBG has been recommended for people with diabetes and their health care professionals in order to achieve a specific level of glycemic control and to prevent hypoglycemia. SMBG works by having patients perform a number of glucose tests each day or each week. The primary growth factors for the SMBG market is the increasing global diabetic population; increasing awareness among the diabetes population, increasing spending on healthcare, active reimbursement policies and the technological advancement aimed at minimal and non-invasive testing methods.Self-monitoring of blood glucose can help both patients and their healthcare professionals better adjust to therapy and assess the responses to therapy. United States , Russia and United Kingdom are the top three leading countries in the Global SMBG market.China is at the fourth spot being closely followed by Italy with XX percent market share in the same year.Test Strips account for maximum share of the SMBG market. Blood glucose meter is the second leading product segment while lancet captures the least share of the SMBG market.The market for SMBG products has a lucrative future ahead because of the growing incidence of diabetes, increasing healthcare spending and growing awareness regarding diabetes and its implications.
