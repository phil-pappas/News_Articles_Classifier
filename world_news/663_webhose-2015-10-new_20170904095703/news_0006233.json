(NASDAQ: ORMP) ( http://www.oramed.com ), a developer of oral drug delivery systems, announced today that the Company's patent for its invention, titled \"Methods and Compositions for Oral Administrations of Proteins\" has been allowed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nNadav Kidron , CEO of Oramed, stated, \"This is an important milestone which paves our entrance into the US diabetes market which is the largest single diabetes market worldwide.\"\nAbout ORMD-0801 Capsule for Type 2 Diabetes\nORMD-0801 has the potential to create a new paradigm in the treatment of diabetes by oral delivery of insulin at an earlier stage of treatment, potentially slowing disease progression and delaying or even eliminating late-stage complications. Orally administered insulin should bring with it enhanced patient compliance. In addition, intestinally absorbed-oral insulin actually mimics insulin's natural location and gradients in the body by first passing through the liver before entering the bloodstream.\nAbout Oramed Pharmaceuticals\nOramed Pharmaceuticals is a technology pioneer in the field of oral delivery solutions for drugs currently delivered via injection. Established in 2006, Oramed's Protein Oral Delivery (POD [ TM ] ) technology is based on over 30 years of research by top scientists at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center. Oramed is seeking to revolutionize the treatment of diabetes through its proprietary flagship product, an orally ingestible insulin capsule ( ORMD-0801 ). Having completed multiple Phase IIa clinical trials, the company has started its Phase IIb on type 2 diabetes under an Investigational New Drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In addition the company is developing an oral GLP-1 analog capsule ( ORMD-0901 ).\nFor more information, the content of which is not part of this press release, please visit http://www.oramed.com\nForward-looking statements: This press release contains forward-looking statements. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when we discuss that our US patent is an important milestone which paves our entrance into the US diabetes market, that ORMD-0801 has the potential to create a new paradigm in the treatment of diabetes, potentially slowing disease progression and delaying or even eliminating late-stage complications, that orally administered insulin should bring with it enhanced patient compliance or revolutionizing the treatment of diabetes with our products.
