The shipping company typically transports everything from textiles to food and tech products, but also transports items which cannot fit into a standard-sized shipping container, such as trains and over-sized machinery. By 1970, Hapag Lloyd merged with Norddeutscher to form what is now called Hapag-Lloyd AG. \nThe total valuation of Hapag-Lloyd AG is said to be worth as much as several billio dollars after the company launched an IPO to list shares onto the Frankfurt and Hamburg stock exchange. \n(Source: Hapag-Lloyd AG / YouTube)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:57:25.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
