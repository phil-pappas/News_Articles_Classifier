Andrew Meares \"[It] prohibits the imposition of customs duties on electronic transmissions, and prevents TPP Parties from favouring national producers or suppliers of such products through discriminatory measures or outright blocking.\"\nThe Australian government will no longer be allowed to force global companies like banks and medical providers to store customer details in local data centres as part of its agreement to join the Trans Pacific Partnership.\n\"TPP also bans 'forced localisation' - the discriminatory requirement that certain governments impose on US businesses that they place their data, servers, research facilities, and other necessities overseas in order to access those markets,\" the office of the US Trade Representative said.\nThis means US technology giants like Uber and Google will be able to sell services to customers around the world without establishing local infrastructure – potentially slashing the amount it costs them to reach local consumers.\n It could also have a negative impact on independent Australian data centre providers like NextDC and Macquarie Telecom, which have long spruiked their local facilities as a key selling point.\nAustralian Retailers Association executive director Russell Zimmerman told Fairfax Media it remained unclear whether the TPP would hurt local businesses.\n\"It's too early to say how this will affect retailers in Australia,\" he said. \"There's always a risk of [harm] unless barriers are also lifted for Australian retailers going overseas.\n\"We've got to see how this all plays out. Hopefully this will be good for retailers in Australia.\"\nChoice Magazine director of campaigns and communications Matt Levey said the full text of the TPP should released for judgement by the Productivity Commission.\nThe TPP could potentially lead to a harsher copyright regime that lacks the balance of the fair use system currently used by Americans, he added.\n\"Fair use is a set of principles that say it's okay to use copyrighted materials in certain circumstances [and it's] more flexible for new technologies and more consumer friendly,\" he said.\n\"Not having one might result in harsher penalties for consumers.The devil will be in the detail here.\"\nThe TPP also includes provisions designed to help telecommunications companies access infrastructure around the world. This could theoretically open up the market to new competitors.\nEverything from access to poles and wires to the allocation of spectrum – the electronic airspace used by mobile networks – and global roaming prices will be covered by the TPP.\nBut the summary released by the parties to date does not have enough specific detail to show if the changes will help or hinder Australian businesses and the business case of the national broadband network.\nThe official text in the 30 chapters of the TPP text will be finalised by officials before being publicly released in the coming weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:25:09.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
