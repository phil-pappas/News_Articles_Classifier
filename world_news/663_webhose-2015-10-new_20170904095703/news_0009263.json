That error resulted in an undeclared allergen, wheat, being present in products labeled as gluten free at levels above the FDA gluten-free standard.\" \nGeneral Mills has begun testing completed products, and included flour-handling protocols at all its facilities in order to avoid such problems from occurring again. \n\"We sincerely apologise to the gluten-free community and to anyone who may have been impacted. We care deeply about making safe, nutritious, gluten free products more widely available, and we've worked very hard to ensure our products are gluten free. Today we must acknowledge that we failed to meet that commitment for a time, and we're recalling all affected products as a result,\" he added. \nThe FDA stated that they did not receive reports of anyone being hospitalised, or of any deaths due to consumption of the recalled products. \nThe agency had conducted lab tests, which indicated 43 parts per million (ppm) of gluten in one sample of Honey Nut Cheerios. However, for a product to be considered as gluten-free, it must contain less than 20ppm of gluten.
