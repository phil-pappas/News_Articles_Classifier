The refugee crisis is another scale of problem, though.\nBut the London tech scene is trying its best. Developers and entrepreneurs have held a conference and a 'hackathon': a day-long session to try and create apps that address the refugee crisis.'\nIt's called \"Techfugees\", and your cynicism could be forgiven. \n\"It's not about making tech people feel good about themselves,\" says Dr Asif Qasim.\nPlay video \"Special Report: Views On Refugees\" Video: Special Report: Views On Refugees \"There are a group of a couple of hundred people upstairs who have left their day jobs to come and do something useful.\"\nDr Qasim is the founder of MedShr, a tool for doctors to share diagnoses with colleagues, which he is offering to those working with refugees.\nDaria Taylor runs Incredibly, a tech start up that employs 12 people and is a sponsor of Techfugees.\nShe wanted to get involved because of her own experience: she was a refugee, fleeing Russia 15 years ago as a child.\nShe spent three years as an illegal immigrant in the UK, before being granted asylum.\n\"The power of technology and what it gives to wider society is the power to put the message across a lot faster, and give access to the information they desperately need,\" she says.\n\"The reason I personally wanted to be here is that I think many people don't understand what a refugee is.\n\"For me, if we could find a tech solution that could help educate wider society around what a refugee is and what sort of struggles they go through, that would be a huge achievement.\"\nThe teams at the hackathon have three challenges.\nOne, build a way for refugees to reunite with friends and family.\nPlay video \"Zuckerberg On Refugee Connectivity\" Video: Zuckerberg On Refugee Connectivity Two, build a tool for recording crimes and war crimes that are going unreported.\nThree, build a way for Syrian refugees to have a democratic voice.\nThere are some good ideas. A digital platform for registering refugees across Europe, already in place in four locations in Greece.\nA service for free visa and migration advice, tailored towards Syrian refugees.\nAn online map of smuggling networks which includes the costs charged by people traffickers, to give refugees contemplating the journey better information.\nThe migration crisis is the biggest movement of people across Europe since the second world war. But unlike other crises, many refugees are digitally active. \n\"The reason this crisis is different to previous ones is that we feel very connected to those people, because we can connect to them, we can speak to them, and if we want to help them, we can help them as well,\" says Sadaf Ahmed, who runs the Musafair Collective, which provides aid to refugees on the ground in the Calais 'jungle'.\nSmartphones and social media play a crucial role in this crisis: they let refugees stay in touch with their families, and are a vital source of information.\nRoutes are planned using Facebook, swapping advice and contacts.\nThat doesn't mean technology will solve this huge problem. But Techfugees could help with some of the smaller ones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:08:37.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
