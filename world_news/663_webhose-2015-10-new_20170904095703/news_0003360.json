Seven centers are first in the nation to order Leksell Gamma Knife® Icon™, which features the first integrated stereotactic cone beam CT imaging, online adaptive dose evaluation and planning enabling the most accurate delivery of frameless and frame-based treatments. Icon was designed to enable treatment of virtually any target in the brain - from refractory essential tremor and complex vascular malformations to multiple metastases - while delivering the lowest dose to healthy tissues. \nThe first US Icon installations will be: Emory St. Joseph's Hospital ( Atlanta, Georgia ), University of Virginia Health System ( Charlottesville, Virginia ), Roswell Park Cancer Institute ( Buffalo, New York ), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ( Houston, Texas ), Miami Cancer Institute at Baptist Health South Florida ( Miami, Florida ), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ) and Gamma Knife of Spokane ( Spokane, Washington ). \nGamma Knife Icon is the sixth generation of the company's Leksell Gamma Knife system, a technology that has been in use worldwide and continually evolving since the 1980s. In the United States , Gamma Knife is the most commonly used radiosurgery platform for the brain [ 1 ] , is the most clinically proven technology for cranial indications [ 2 ] and offers the lowest dose to normal tissues [ 3 ] - [ 7 ] . \n\"UPMC has partnered with Elekta since the first 201-source Gamma Knife - the fifth worldwide - was installed in Pittsburgh in 1987,\" says L. Dade Lunsford , MD, Lars Leksell Professor of Neurosurgery at UPMC and consultant to Elekta. \"Each of the six generations of Gamma Knife has resulted in improvements in the outcomes and efficiency of brain radiosurgery, and we have pioneered their use. We are pleased to add the first US complete Gamma Knife Icon system with anticipated installation in early 2016. Icon will add new methods of non-invasive cranial immobilization, while preserving standard immobilization technologies - used in more than 14,500 patients at UPMC - for patients with brain tumors and vascular malformations located in critical brain regions.\" \nAccording to Peter J. Rossi , MD, Medical Director, Radiation Oncology at Emory St. Joseph's Hospital, the upgrade of its Leksell Gamma Knife® Perfexion™ system to Icon presents new opportunities to treat patients with lesions more suited to a frameless, multi-session approach. \n\"Patients with lesions such as small metastases have benefited from the high precision, reproducibility and targeting ability of our Perfexion system, but with larger or more critically located tumors it can be better to fractionate their treatment,\" Dr. Rossi explains. \"With the Icon system, we will have the best of all worlds. We can maintain the unparalleled precision to treat tumors with the lowest possible radiation exposure to healthy tissues, while at the same time opening up the possibility to confidently treat without the stereotactic frame over more than a single session. These indications include acoustic schwannomas and complex meningiomas that may be close to hearing and visual anatomy, respectively, and large pituitary lesions, for example, that require the accumulation of a large dose over multiple sessions to protect healthy brain tissues.\" \n\"Leksell Gamma Knife Icon establishes a new international standard for precision radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy for targets within the brain and head and neck,\" adds Christopher M. Lee , MD, Research Director for Gamma Knife of Spokane and Cancer Care Northwest. \"We look forward to the new innovations in patient comfort, precision and speed of treatment, on-demand adaptability with regard to patient dose, as well as the novel cutting-edge motion management features. This technology will be practice-changing for our group, and is a great enhancement to overall patient care.\" \n\"We are pleased that these world-class centers - many of which also have access to stereotactic linear accelerators - have recognized the value of this latest generation Gamma Knife system as their system of choice for brain radiosurgery,\" says Bill Yaeger , Elekta's Executive Vice President, Region North America. \"The unique motion management and imaging technologies in Icon reinforce the level of precision for which Gamma Knife technology is renowned - making Gamma Knife microradiosurgery even more accurate for particularly challenging cases.\" \nTo learn more about Leksell Gamma Knife Icon, visit http://www.careforthebrain.com .
