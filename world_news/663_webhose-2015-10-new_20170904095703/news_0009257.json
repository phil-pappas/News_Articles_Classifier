Based on a solution developed by IBM software engineers seeking to debug Node.js applications in Bluemix, this capability is now available to developers through the definition of a single Bluemix variable and a re-staging of the application. Developers can access a full description of this capability and how-to instructions in the Bluemix Developers Community blog. This feature is part of App Management, a set of development and debugging utilities that can be enabled for Liberty and Node.js applications on Bluemix. IBM launched Bluemix with a $1 billion investment in 2014, and has grown rapidly to become the largest public Cloud Foundry deployment in the world. The open-standards-based Bluemix catalog includes over 120 tools and services spanning categories of big data, mobile, Watson, analytics, integration, DevOps, security and Internet of Things. IBM Bluemix was recently shown to be the \"developers' choice\" of PaaS and is growing 10-times faster than the overall PaaS market, according to research firm ESG. \nContact: Erin Lehr, 212-671-9363 \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/media-alert-new-ibm-bluemix-feature-enables-nodejs-apps-to-be-debugged-in-the-cloud-using-popular-open-source-utilities-300156986.html \nSOURCE IBM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:48:41.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
