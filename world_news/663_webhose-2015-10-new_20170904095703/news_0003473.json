Credit: iStock \nCurtin University researchers have developed an innovative robotic hand exoskeleton which can be made cheaply using a 3D printer and could potentially cut down on rehabilitation visits for patients. \nWhen people injure a finger, the digit generally has to be immobilised so it can heal. \nThe patient then has to start gradually moving the injured finger to get it back to normal. \nUsing relatively inexpensive 3D printing, the Curtin team's exoskeleton can be customised to the patient's hand . \nThe battery-powered device will eventually gently move the fingers to assist full healing. \nThe idea for the device came about when Curtin's Department of Mechanical Engineering mechatronics engineer Dr Lei Cui met renowned performance artist Professor Stelarc who has an interest in 3D printing and the human body. \n\"We wanted to use 3D printing technology to print the articulated linkage of the device in one piece, with no assembly work needed,\" Dr Cui says. \nThe hand was developed with the help of mechatronics engineer Anthony Phan, who worked on it as part of his final year mechatronics thesis project. \nOther members of the research team include Professor Garry Allison and David Parsons of Curtin's Faculty of Health Sciences. \nDr Cui says the robotic exoskeleton , called the Assisted Finger Orthosis, can be customised to a person's hand using 48 parameters. \nSmall linear motors, powered by battery, can be programmed to move the finger as part of the rehab process.
