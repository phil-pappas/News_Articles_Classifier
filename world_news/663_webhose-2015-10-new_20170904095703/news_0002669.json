Published: 16 October 2015 11:21 AM \nYahoo Account Key is a new feature rolled out yesterday, that promises to take the pain out of remembering passwords. \nIt only works on Yahoo accounts but, if you have them and also have a smartphone running the Yahoo mail app, you'll potentially never need to type in your password again. \nOnce an account and a smartphone are linked, logging into Yahoo on a desktop or any other device should be simple. \nJust enter the Yahoo ID and a push notification will appear on the linked smartphone. Accept the notification and the login is complete. The account is accessible and there was no need to type in a password. \nYahoo Account Key is part of the latest update to the Yahoo mail app and is available to download now for Android and iOS. â€“ AFP-Relaxnews, October 14,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:32:07.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
