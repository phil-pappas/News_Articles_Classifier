Effective trade secret protection requires companies to think beyond technological solutions to address employee, contractor and third party behavior. The service – CREATe Leading Practices for Trade Secret Protection – features an initial online assessment measuring the maturity of existing systems in place to protect trade secrets. It poses questions relating to categories ranging from policies and procedures, security, risk assessments, third party management, training and dedicated employee resources to monitoring and corrective actions. The 90-minute assessment is followed by a discussion and independent evaluation by a CREATe.org expert. The final step is an improvement program including recommended actions to address top vulnerabilities.\nThe new service complements two additional CREATe Leading Practices services – one addressing broader intellectual property protection; and the other focused on anti-corruption. The CREATe Leading Practices services are based on best practices from global companies, international guidelines, academics and other experts. The services take a ‘management systems’ approach and feature many of the same business process categories found in quality management, health and safety and other programs that companies have implemented over the years.\n“The rapid pace of innovation, digitization of corporate assets and today’s highly mobile workforce make protecting all forms of intellectual property a challenge,” stated Pamela Passman, President and CEO of CREATe.org. “In our work with global companies on IP protection, we identified a need to do a deeper dive on trade secret protection. This service, along with our eLearning course on Protection of Trade Secrets, offers companies a systematic way to ensure there are business processes in place to address not only security but also the human side of trade secret risks.”\nTo learn more about CREATe Leading Practices and request a demo, email: info(at)CREATe(dot)org.\nAbout the Center for Responsible Enterprise And Trade (CREATe.org)\nThe Center for Responsible Enterprise And Trade (CREATe.org) is a non-governmental organization dedicated to helping companies and their suppliers and business partners reduce counterfeiting, piracy, trade secret theft and corruption.
