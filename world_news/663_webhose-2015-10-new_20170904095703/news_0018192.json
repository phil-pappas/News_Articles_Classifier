Middlesex University expects students to save an average of Â£450 ($681). The institution will be working with Kortext, which provides the digital textbook platform, and John Smith's, a university bookseller. Under the four-year agreement, students will receive one free digital textbook for each class during the new academic year. Undergraduates typically take 12 classes, so they'll receive 12 books over their three-year program of study.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:59:10.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
