We used its thoroughly tested parsers and were able to focus on developing software that identifies security vulnerabilities in hardware designs.\" \nLeveraging Verific's Parser Platform, Prospect reads a register transfer level (RTL) description of the design and performs a thorough analysis to uncover a broad range of vulnerabilities. It does so by automatically generating SystemVerilog assertions and instrumentation from a high-level description of the security properties. \n\"Security is becoming an increasing concern and we applaud Tortuga Logic's security experts for tackling this problem,\" says Michiel Ligthart, Verific's president and chief operating officer. \"The founders' decision to choose our parser platform enabled the early release of this significant new toolset and keep system designs secure.\" \nVerific's Parser Platforms are in production and development use today at companies worldwide, from cybersecurity startups such as Tortuga Logic to established Fortune 500 semiconductor vendors. Applications vary from analysis, simulation, formal verification and synthesis to emulation and virtual prototyping, in-circuit debug and design-for-test. Parser Platforms are distributed as C++ source code and compile on all 32- and 64-bit Unix, Linux and Windows operating systems. Its Parser Platforms include support for SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL and UPF, and provide C++, Python and Perl APIs. \nAbout Tortuga Logic Tortuga Logic, Inc. , part of the emerging Design-for-Security market, has the goal to solve security-specific problems, minimizing security breaches in hardware and systems by automating the process of verifying their security properties. It has developed a comprehensive Hardware Security Design and Analysis Toolkit, transforming the way hardware designers and system architects test the security of hardware designs.
