That review is expected to last several months.\nClinton said she is skeptical that consumers would benefit because \"too often the companies end up pocketing profits rather than passing savings to consumers.\"\nClinton said if elected she would strengthen the antitrust enforcement arms of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission and appoint \"aggressive regulators\" to address concentration in the health care industry and other sectors.\n___\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://twitter.com/KThomasDC", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:53:34.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
