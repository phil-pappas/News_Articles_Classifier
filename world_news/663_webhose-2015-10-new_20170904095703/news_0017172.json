This incredible new product is the Swiss Army Knife of fishing rods. It’s multifunctional, small, durable, and offers an award-winning design. Imagine being able to travel anywhere in the world with a fishing rod, and never having to worry about damaging or breaking it. Users can swap parts according to what method they are using and what fish they are trying to catch. The minimum size of the smallest version for transportation is only 25 cm or ten inches.\nCompact Fishing System’s patent pending, compact fishing rod allows users to equip all existing reels thanks to the removable trigger. Made from stainless steel spring poles, CNC machined – sea water-resistant 6061 T6 – aluminum reel seat, hardwood handles, and uses no plastics. The result is a truly unbreakable fishing rod, which is made to last for several decades. However, before everyone can enjoy this compact, modular fishing rod, Compact Fishing Systems needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise €10,000 by November 15, 2015. The funds will go towards production and manufacturing.\nTo help bring this innovative fishing rod to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by April 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Compact Fishing Systems reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Szabolcs Németh\nTitle: designer\nemail:\nWebsite: http://wor.my", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wormy/compact-fishing-systems"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:23:46.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
