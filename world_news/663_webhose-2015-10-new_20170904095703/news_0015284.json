Concerns have however been raised over the safety of students living off campus after fears of xenophobic attacks surfaced, with the looting of foreign-owned shops in Grahamstown East earlier on Thursday.\n\"We had some issues in the townships, but there is no need to panic yet. But we felt it would be best to move the foreign students living there, out of potential harm's way,\" Magubane said.\n\"We have already started moving students over, and have received a lot of help and assistance from fellow students.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:44:51.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
