Taking up one-third less space than standard SO-DIMMs, supporting up to 16GB densities and providing high data rates up to 2.4GB/s, the Mini-DIMM is ideal for dense networking and telecom system boards. Mini-DIMMs, by design, provide extra power and ground pins which improve signal integrity and reliability further cementing them as a useful alternative to SO-DIMMs. \nOEMs using DDR3 Mini-DIMMs today for networking, telecom, industrial, and storage applications now have a migration path to DDR4. For customers still in the design process, SMART offers a DDR4 Mini-DIMM-to-DIMM test adaptor which allows for Mini-DIMM system testing on standard DDR4 systems that use DIMMs. \nFor more information on SMART's DDR4 Mini-DIMMs, please contact SMART's Director of DRAM Product Marketing, Arthur Sainio, via email at Arthur.sainio@smartm.com or visit www.smartm.com . \nAbout SMART Modular Technologies SMART Modular Technologies is a global leader in specialty memory solutions serving the electronics industry for over 25 years.
