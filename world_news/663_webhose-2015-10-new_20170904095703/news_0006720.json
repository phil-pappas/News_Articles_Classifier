SanDisk shares rose 4.6% to $78.62 premarket and were trading under $60 a share earlier this month ahead of media reports about a possible sale.\nWestern Digital slipped 3.8% to $72 premarket and has lost about a third of its value so far this year. Both companies also reported better-than-expected results for their latest quarters on Wednesday morning.\nWestern Digital is facing challenges to its core hard-disk-drive businesses from flash and solid-state drives, or SSDs, and acquiring SanDisk could be a hedge and a driver of new growth.\nThe acquisition comes about three weeks after an arm of China's Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. agreed to pay $3.78 billion for a 15% stake in Western Digital-- the latest U.S. tech company to scramble for politically connected Chinese partners amid the difficult business environment.\nFor its part, SanDisk, a major maker of flash-memory chips, had benefited from the explosive growth in demand for products such as smartphones. But its results have lagged behind recently amid a variety of problems, from product-qualification delays to lower-than-expected sales of enterprise products.\nCompounding its problems was Apple Inc.'s decision to start designing its own controller chips and buying Samsung chips instead of SanDisk's SSDs.\nWestern Digital CEO Steve Milligan will serve as chief executive of the combined company, which will be located at Western Digital's base in Irvine, Calif. Upon closing, SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra is expected to join the Western Digital board.\nWestern Digital said the deal is expected to add to earnings within 12 months of closing, and it will achieve annual synergies of $500 million within 18 months. Pending the closing, the company expects to continue paying its quarterly dividend and will suspend its share buyback program.\nWestern Digital said it would pay $85.10 a share in cash and 0.0176 shares of its stock for each share of SanDisk if the Tsinghua investment closes first. If that deal hasn't closed or has been canceled, it will pay $67.50 in cash and 0.2387 shares.\nThis year has been especially busy for deals in the semiconductor industry, coming as the stock market has penalized chip companies that don't show they can improve profit margins, a tough task in a mature industry subject to fierce price pressure.\nAmong the deals that have been reached in recent months, Avago Technologies Ltd. offered a rich $37 billion for rival wireless-chip maker Broadcom Corp., and Intel Corp. agreed to buy Altera Corp. for about $16.7 billion.\nEarlier Wednesday, Lam Research Corp. said it agreed to buy KLA-Tencor Corp. for about $10.6 billion, another sign of how slowing growth and rising costs have led to frenetic consolidation.\nIn separate statements Wednesday, Western Digital previewed stronger-than-expected revenue for its latest quarter, and SanDisk logged smaller-than-expected declines in earnings and revenue.\nWrite to Lauren Pollock at lauren.pollock@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n 21, 2015 08:05 ET (12:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:13:54.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
