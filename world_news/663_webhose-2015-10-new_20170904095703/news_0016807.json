Someone has to pay for it. The South African government biggest budget expense is already education and SA government bonds are already on the brink of junk bond status suffering from a decade of financial mismanagement.\n The SA economy is struggling in the post resource boom world and government revenue is under pressure. The government does not have the money, so what expense should be cut back to pay for your education? Welfare? Aged pension? Secondary education? Police? Make your pick as corruption and BEE/AA are sacred cows.\nWhat happens when tertiary education is free? (1) Without any financial consequences from failing, or benefits from excelling e.g. bursaries,. there is no incentive to work hard and excel. A free education is not valued. (2) Students will not view education as an investment and therefore will not seek a return on the investment.\n They will study courses where there is no prospects for gainful employment (e.g. Arts and not Engineering). The economy will suffer from skill shortfalls, (3) If tertiary institution's are under pressure, they cannot retain or recruit the best professors with competitive salaries and the quality of our tertiary education institutions deteriorate.\nSouth African already do not have a single tertiary institutions in the Top 100 anymore and our institutions struggle to even maintain their current ratings. Without top professors, our research will not be on the cutting edge and we will not be able to develop technological advances to compete in a global economy.\nGraduates are some of the best paid individuals in SA society and as tertiary education is an investment in their own future, they should pay for their own education.\nI suggest that we increase the cost of tertiary education to reflect the cost of providing the education, provide limited places for each degree based on a merit rating system adapted for socio-economic circumstances that reflects the needs of the economy and then provide these deserving students with a government backed loan that needs to be repaid through the tax system as soon as the student find employment.\nThe interest on these loans should be at least the same interest rate as what the government is paying on bonds. This will provide students will access to education, an incentive to work hard and excel without compromising the tertiary education system or bankrupting the government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:48:26.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
