Taking a page from that book, the company has now announced the much more compact Osmo – a hand-held motor-stabilized 4K camera. \nThe Osmo was first previewed in prototype form at CES this January, where it was called the Inspire 1 Handheld Camera Mount – that's because it was intended to utilize the exact same camera as the Inspire 1 drone, with users just swapping the one camera between the quadcopter and the mount. \nThat still can be done with the Osmo, although it does now come with its own removable Zenmuse X3 4K/30fps camera, which has been optimized for use with the new system. Users can also go with DJI's higher-spec'd X5 and X5R cameras, if they're working on more professional projects. \nThe device's 3-axis motorized gimbal automatically adjusts the pitch, roll and yaw of the camera, allowing it to maintain a smooth, level shot while its user carries it by hand (or has it mounted on something, such as the handlebars of their bike). This feature even allows it to capture long-exposure 12MP stills or time-lapse video without the use of a tripod, as long as the user keeps it reasonably still while shooting. \nThe Osmo can also also perform motorized pans and tilts on command, via button controls on the handle. These controls can additionally be used to switch between shooting modes, to start and stop recording, and to automatically capture panoramic stills – the user just holds onto the handle, while the camera pans around 360 degrees. \nCamera/gimbal settings and other more advanced features can be accessed via an app on the user's smartphone, which is held in a built-in mount. This also allows the phone to be used a viewfinder/playback screen. When removed from the mount, the phone can additionally be utilized to remotely-control the Osmo from a distance of up to 25 meters (82 ft). \nPower is provided by a lithium-polymer battery, that should be good for about one hour of shooting per charge. Audio is recorded via a built-in mic, although an external mic can also be plugged into its 3.5-mm audio-in port. \nThe DJI Osmo is available now, priced at US$649. Optional extras include a bike mount, selfie stick and tripod.
