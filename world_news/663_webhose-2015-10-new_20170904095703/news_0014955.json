These evergreen conifers are the highest trees on earth. Image courtesy Save The Redwoods League.

Moreover, locally unique weather patterns such as fog may influence projected climate trends in the future,\" he says. \n\"Coast redwoods have endured climatic changes over thousands of years. We are encouraged by our RCCI research, which shows that redwood trees continue to grow, even under warmer conditions, and will thrive further north into Oregon.\" \nWritten by Miguel Fernandez, Healy Hamilton and Lara Kueppers and entitled \"Back to the Future - using historical climate variation to project near-term shifts in habitat suitable for coast redwood,\" the study sifts through the range of climate change predictions from global circulation models and analyzes which ones are most likely to occur in coastal California's future. \n\"Current global climate models often fail to capture climate change's impact on local weather patterns,\" says Fernandez of the University of California and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv). \"This data is critical to predict how individual species, like the coast redwood, will cope with climate change.\" \nFernandez's team of researchers used historical climate extremes as indicators of short- and medium-term changes in future climate and modeled coast redwoods' geographic distribution in the smallest discernible detail. \n\"This approach is particularly suitable for regions such as North America's West Coast, where local conditions strongly influence climate,\" he says. \nThis is the seventh study funded by Save the Redwoods League's RCCI, a $4 million, multi-year research program whose mission is to study coast redwood and giant sequoia ecosystems in a changing world. Eight scientists from Humboldt State University, UC Berkeley, and UC Merced have undertaken research for RCCI producing four peer-reviewed papers since 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:22:33.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
