This weekend Prestige Academy & God.TV competed in the Gun Run race in Mouille Point. Doing a fun run is but one of the things we can all tick off on our bucket-lists.\nSure, everyone can jog around the block but the fun lies in companionship whilst doing the race.\nRunning with a chatty friend; having them motivate you makes it all worthwhile.\nEven though the competition was tough the crowd was hungry to start and we hopped on the bandwagon.\nWhat a fun day it was! Pushing ourselves to the limit never felt as good as when we crossed that finish line.\nAnd we’re just normal people doing something which made us feel extraordinary. Next time we’ll take on the half marathon challenge!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:07:30.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
