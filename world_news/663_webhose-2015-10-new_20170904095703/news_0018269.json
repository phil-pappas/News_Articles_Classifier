Laurene Jobs called Leo DiCaprio and said: ‘Don’t do it.’ Laurene Jobs called Christian Bale and said: ‘Don’t [do it].’”\nRelated: Steve Jobs review: Fassbender excels but iWorship required if you're to care\nA separate source at Sony Pictures, which eventually passed on making Danny Boyle’s film, said: “She reached out; she had a strong desire not to have the movie made. But we said: ‘We’re going to move forward.’ My understanding is, she did call one or two of the actors.”\nSteve Jobs, which will hit US cinemas on limited release this weekend as it builds anticipation for an expected Oscars run, is debuting in a very different form than might once have been expected. As well as the shift from Sony to Universal over budget concerns, Boyle eventually replaced David Fincher in the director’s chair, and Michael Fassbender stars in place of DiCaprio and Bale, both of whom were reported last year to have passed on the role of Jobs for unspecified reasons.\nBoyle’s film, based on a screenplay by the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Social Network, Aaron Sorkin, has drawn positive reviews from critics after debuting at the Telluride film festival last month. But as well as opposition from Laurene Jobs, it has been criticised by Apple’s current chief executive, Tim Cook , who described the biopic (and recent documentary The Man in the Machine) as “opportunistic” during an appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert earlier this month.\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Guardian’s Nigel Smith discusses Steve Jobs at the Telluride film festival.\nBoyle presents Jobs as a driven genius who struggled at times with personal relationships. His refusal, for many years, to recognise his first-born daughter (Lisa) from a relationship with high-school girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (played by Katherine Waterston in the film) plays a central part in the narrative.\nThe Hollywood Reporter piece alleges Apple refused to license its famous 1984 commercial for the film, though Boyle was ultimately able to include it via fair use laws. Meanwhile, Disney refused to allow the use of a clip from its ABC television division, Jobs having once sat on the studio’s board.\nRelated: iSorry: Aaron Sorkin apologises to Apple's Tim Cook over Steve Jobs biopic\nThe British designer and current chief design officer for Apple, Jony Ive, has accused Boyle’s film of hijacking the tech icon’s legacy. Speaking at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in San Francisco, Ive said he had not seen Steve Jobs , but was aware that members of the Apple co-founder’s family had left screenings profoundly distressed at the biopic’s approach.\n“There are sons and daughters and widows and very close friends that are completely bemused and completely upset,” he said, in comments reported by The Verge . “We’re remembering and celebrating Steve Jobs’s life and at the same time there is this perfectly timed movie and I don’t recognise this person.”\nIve admitted Jobs “had his triumphs and his tragedies like us all”, but said his former colleague was having his “identity described, defined by a whole bunch of other people”, and this was a personal struggle for him.\nIve described Jobs as a man with a keen sense of the “civic responsibility to make something good”, who was concerned about making “a contribution to humanity and to culture”, adding: “I just think it’s important to remember that you could have somebody that didn’t ever argue, but you wouldn’t have the phone you have now.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c68v%2Fsfb&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c68v&picture=", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/09/06/20150906JOBS_FromGuAmRM.webm", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEq1qwos0w4", "http://www.telluridefilmfestival.org/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/a-widows-threats-high-powered-829925", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46adc0bf299d390686157029a27f849035bb9da3/147_0_2655_1497/1000.jpg?w=640&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=4524c17560e5b2872c7b938d81b1fc82", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/09/06/20150906JOBS_FromGuAmRM/20150906JOBS_FromGuAmRM.m3u8", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/flash/components/mediaelement/f70092081235f698081e268fecea95e4/flashmediaelement.swf", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/09/06/20150906JOBS_FromGuAmRM-16x9.mp4", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/09/06/20150906JOBS_FromGuAmRM_3gpLg16x9.3gp", "http://gu.com/p/4c68v", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/09/06/20150906JOBS_FromGuAmRM_3gpSml16x9.3gp", "http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/7/9476391/apple-jony-ive-steve-jobs-legacy", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Steve+Jobs+premieres+at+Telluride%3A+what+did+the+audience+think%3F+%E2%80%93%C2%A0video&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ffilm%2Fvideo%2F2015%2Fsep%2F06%2Fsteve-jobs-premieres-at-telluride-what-did-the-audience-think-video&media=", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Steve%20Jobs%20premieres%20at%20Telluride%3A%20what%20did%20the%20audience%20think%3F%20%E2%80%93%C2%A0video&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c68v%2Fstw"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:19:56.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
