The long-haul business would be reduced by 10 percent.\nThe French airline also wants to cancel its order for Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, the sources added. Air France-KLM has 19 787-9 and six 787-10 jets on order.\nEurope's second-largest network carrier is seeking to cope with pressure from low-cost competition in Europe and Middle East long-haul carriers, and is at loggerheads with its main pilots union, the SNPL, over its plans.\n(Reporting by Simon Carraud, Jacky Naegelen and Cyril Altmeyer; Writing by James Regan ; Editing by Brian Love and Louise Heavens)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:20:15.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
