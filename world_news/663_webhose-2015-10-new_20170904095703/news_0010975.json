Twitter \nIf webpages are written correctly, hopping onto a website on your mobile can be a simple process, however, or unoptimised sites browsing them while on your smartphone or tablet can become a chore. That’s why Google started to take into account mobile friendliness when indexing websites earlier this year. However, in an effort to further improve the mobile web, Google has something else up their sleeves. \nIt’s called the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project a new initiative which hopes to make mobile web browsing a much more instant experience. It’s an open source initiative that restricts certain elements of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce lighter Web pages, which Google say “are optimised to lead instantly on mobile devices.” \nIn tests, Google revealed that when using a simulated 3G connection and a simulated Nexus 5 , AMP Project showed improvements between 15 to 85 per cent. \nIt’s a very clever and simply way to make sure the web is optimised, but at the same time it’s also very limited. For example, the AMP HTML which sits at the core of it all, minimises HTTP requests and only downloads images when they’re likely to be seen, which is great, but at the same time third-party JavaScript is a no go, so certain ads and other JavaScript elements may be incompatible. CSS will also be constrained, with transition, filter, and animation properties being removed, also CSS will also be limited to 50,000 bytes. \nIt’s definitely a positive move from Google, providing the resources to make your mobile web page super friendly. But at the same time it could cause a few headaches for some web developers. \nDespite this, many websites are on board, including Buzzfeed, The Huffington Post, and Condé Nast are also on board, as well as popular CMS platform, WordPress. Analytics companies, such as Chartbeat, Parse.ly, and Adobe, are on board with all of this too. \nFor more information, you can head to the AMP Project website which has a pretty hefty FAQ.
