Rather than go to sleep when the sun set, they often lit fires and stayed up late.\nGetty Baffling: This chap probably got around the same amount of sleep you do\n\"All three groups have pretty much the same sleep duration and pretty much the same timing of sleep,\" said Professor Jerome Siegel from the University of California, Los Angeles, who led the study.\n\"This gives me reasonable confidence that they reflect the common human biology and they are not a function of their particular situations, which are different,\" he said.\nThe only factor which did influence was temperature - the team found that on average the tribes slept for 55 minutes longer during the winter.\n\"What is absolutely clear is that they don't sleep more than we do,\" said Professor Siegel.\nIn fact, according to the authors of the study, the common complaint that the \"modern world\" reduces our ability to sleep has been recorded as far back as the 1880s.\nOf course, there are plenty of modern gadgets available to help you sleep better .\nPoll loading â€¦\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822%2815%2901157-4", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-16T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:32:17.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
