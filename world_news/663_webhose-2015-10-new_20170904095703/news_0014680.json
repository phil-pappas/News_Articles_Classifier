Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said the country could be in for major “adjustments” on climate change policy by 2017, ahead of a major UN convention in Paris on the issue. \nIt comes as French Ambassador Christophe Lecourtier said the “planets are becoming more aligned” ahead of the Paris summit where 200 nations will meet to set a new version of the Kyoto Protocol that could have a huge impact on every area of Australian life. \nSo far, 146 countries representing 87 per cent of global emissions have submitted a plan for the event, which is expected to deliver an agreement on how to create a “low emission, climate resilient and sustainable future” that will prevent global temperatures rising more than two degrees — the line in the sand against the worst impacts of climate change. The Adani mine in Queensland could provide the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions a year as Norway and Sweden combined. Australians are sun-lovers, but how hot do we want it to get?

Environmental groups fear the Adani mine will be a disaster for the Great Barrier Reef. The massive project is still waiting on financial investment.
