The course, Computer Storage Systems, will be taught by Doug McCallum, a former storage engineer with Oracle and Sun Microsystems, and will focus on advanced storage technology. The course will be open to \"exceptional undergraduate students and graduate students,\" according to Nexenta. \nGita Alaghband, professor and chair of Computer Science and Engineering at CU Denver, said the partnership will help teach students \"how to approach technology based on the needs of today’s enterprises.\" Technology is changing rapidly and many companies are transitioning to cloud-based virtual technology. \"Nexenta’s knowledge of open source and software-defined technology should help our students to gain a higher level of expertise, so, as new storage engineers, they can hit the ground running when they start their first jobs,” said Alaghband in a prepared statement. \nNexenta is currently developing other courses in partnership with San Jose State University and expects to begin offering the courses in the near future. \nFaculty or administrative staff at other universities or institutions that are interested in participating in Nexenta's Higher Education Program should contact the company's vice president of Marketing and Strategy, Jill Orhun .
