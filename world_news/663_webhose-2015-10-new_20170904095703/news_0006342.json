This addiction reduces their performance in making honey, and they are forced to come back to the same plant even though it offers relatively less nectar than the decaf sources. “What I think it does is make them exploited pollinators,” Margaret Couvillon at the University of Sussex, UK says. “The plants are tricking them into foraging in ways that benefit the plant, not the bee.” To test this further, Couvillon’s team fed the bees caffeinated solution with the right concentration of nectar in it. The bees had little tags stuck to their bags for easy identification. After three hour, they were back in the same spot, in need of the high. “These poor bees came back for four or five days afterwards, and they were kind of desperate,” Couvillon says. The bees continued to search for caffeine instead of the nectar required to make honey.
