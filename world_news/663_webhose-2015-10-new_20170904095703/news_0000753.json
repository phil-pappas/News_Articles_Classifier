It’s not a bad idea — just a bit oversold. But the crucial thing is to tie exports to a sustained push for renewable energy, including subsidies needed — for now — to keep America on the clean-energy path serious people know is necessary.\nIndustry-friendly analysts largely agree the direct effects of lifting the ban would be minor. “It would lift the price for American crude a few dollars,” Oslo-based Rystad Energy analyst Per Magnus Nysveen said. “Pump prices would not necessarily be affected, as refined products are already exported and thus are connected to international crude markets.”\nRealistically, if the ban goes, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude CLX5, +1.98% , which reflects U.S. oil sloshing around a confined market, will converge with the Brent crude price LCOX5, +1.06% that the rest of the world follows. That’s about $3.75 more per domestic barrel if WTI goes all the way to Brent’s price. The rule of thumb from consulting firm IHS CERA has been that a $10 jump in crude translates to about a quarter-per-gallon price hike at gasoline stations.\nSo the ban would cost you maybe 9 cents a gallon — it’s as if the average American gave back the one-week price drop this Labor Day. Drivers ignore such micro-fluctuations all the time.\nIn exchange, the industry would add 50,000 barrels a day of production (on a base of 9.4 million), and maybe $1 billion in added investment in exploration, Nysveen says. That wouldn’t be likely to put much of a dent in the 100,000 jobs the industry has shed this year.\nBottom line, for all the noise the bill is attracting in Washington, it’s not that important.\nExcept for one thing.\nAnd that one thing is the ability of this much-coveted piece of legislation to leverage a broader energy deal of the kind I proposed in this space last November. An op-ed by Gregg Easterbrook in The New York Times made almost the same case this week.\nCertainly business lobbies are dying to get the export ban lifted. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is touting the bill as key to everything from gas prices to geopolitics, citing an IHS CERA claim that a free market in oil would add 1 million jobs, far more than Rystad’s analysis.\nIf so, liberals should ask, what are we bid?\nAnd the ask should be extended support for renewable energy — as an unusually comprehensive new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance demonstrates at once how much that support is needed, and how rapidly it is beginning to pay off.\nNew Energy Finance finds that solar and especially wind are already cost-competitive with fossil fuel-based electricity in parts of Europe. In the U.S., we’re not there yet. Globally, the average cost of onshore wind power fell to $83 per megawatt hour, compared with $75 for coal-fired juice in the Americas and $82 for gas plants. Solar is more expensive globally, but is cheaper than coal and gas in some U.S. states at least some of the time.\nOne way that’s been done is with the help of tax credits that were allowed to expire last year, which reduce the risk of new wind and solar projects.\nNo less a Republican economic sage than presidential nominee Jeb Bush — whoops! — has called for letting these credits expire in a few years, claiming they’re unnecessary, a bit of intellectual legerdemain Donald Trump might call “low energy.” But they’re not: No less a Democratic-leaning economic sage than Warren Buffett, who has invested billions in wind energy in Iowa (caucuses, anyone?) has said subsidies are still crucial to the economics of renewables.\nBush is 180 degrees wrong: The inflection point renewables are at calls for stepping on the gas, not slamming the brakes.\nThe tax subsidies cost only about $5 billion a year, and have tripled wind-and-solar electricity generation since 2008. Renewables lobbyists want them extended for two years in the year-end bills to keep the government from shutting down again. Five years would be smarter. President Obama wants to make them permanent — as lifting the export ban would be.\nThe deal is simple: One of yours for one of ours.\nOil gets its worldwide market, which eliminates an artificial constraint on U.S. prices. The future gets low-carbon power whose cost advantages will grow over time.\nIn a Washington that functions, this is an easy deal to make. But is that the Washington we’ve got?\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/buffett-puts-wind-in-berkshires-sails-1414084146", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/opinion/why-can-the-epa-regulate-smog-but-not-greenhouse-gases.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region&_r=0", "https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=4663"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:06:29.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
