This will add to the attractiveness and profitability of participating ports.” \nWatch a video on the progress of Peel Port Liverpool2 container terminal \nThe Saab VTMS system will allow controllers to accurately guide vessel traffic under all visibility conditions, even when ports are extremely busy. \nThe system receives real-time information from latest design radars, AIS and CCTV sensors and combines the information into a consistent traffic overview of all vessel movements. \nGary Hodgson, COO of Peel Ports, said: “This significant investment in customer service will enable the Statutory Harbour Authorities of Ardrossan, Clydeport, Heysham, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheerness to further advance safety and efficiency of all aspects of Vessel Traffic Management.” \nSaab’s V3000 VTMS is already installed in more than 70 traffic centres worldwide, including the ports of Rotterdam, Shanghai. \nFact File: Peel Ports is strategically located to serve the whole of the United Kingdom.
