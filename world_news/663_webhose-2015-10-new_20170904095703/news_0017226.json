One of the air force’s five KC-30A multi-role tanker transport planes conducted 59 successful hook-ups with the F-35A at Edwards air force Base in California, including five where about 20,000 kgs of fuel was transferred during the four-hour-long mission. Picture: Supplied Both systems are being used during the aircraft’s deployment to the Middle East under Operation Okra where the tanker is refuelling a variety of coalition aircraft from the US, UK, France and Australia.\nRAAF chief Air Marshal Leo Davies said the KC-30A was an essential force multiplier.\nHe said midair refuelling was critical for the global reach of RAAF aircraft, people and equipment.\n“Refuelling between the KC-30A and F-35A is an important step towards the KC-30A’s achievement of Final Operational Capability (FOC) and represents continued progress in the development of the F-35A,” Air Marshal Davies said.\n“This achievement is significant because the future of Australia’s air combat capability is reliant on the successful partnership between these two aircraft and our ability to be interoperable with our international partners,” Air Marshal Davies said.\nImportant step ... RAAF chief Air Marshal Leo Davies said the KC-30A was an essential force multiplier.
