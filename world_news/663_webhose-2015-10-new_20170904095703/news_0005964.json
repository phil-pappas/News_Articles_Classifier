The social media service has matured it's reaction-based \"Like\" feature with emojis. Instead of simply \"liking\" something, Facebook users will soon give thumbs-up, show hearts, or use a mixture of faces to express themselves. Called Facebook Reactions, the new feature will go live on Friday across the social media platform. The move comes after years of user demand for a \"Dislike\" button to give parity to their ubiquitous \"Like\" feature. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has felt such an addition would not be social, which is why the company has excluded it. Now the matured \"Reactions\" will give people an emotional but technologically familiar way to express their feelings towards a Facebook post with emojis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:33:06.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
