Net profit rose to £ 85.9 million from £ 64.8 million.\nShares rose as much as 9% in early trading in London.\nARM said 3.6 billion of its chips were shipped during the period, up 20% from the same period the previous year.\nThe company said it expects group dollar revenue for the full-year to be in line with market expectations.\nChief Executive Simon Segars said ARM has benefited from the growing use of a new chip that is used in smartphones, digital televisions and other products and that commands higher royalties than other chips. ARM chips are being used in an increasingly diverse range of devices, including energy efficient smartphones and computer servers, he said.\nARM receives royalty fees from every sale of a device containing its chips and from licensing its technology to its customers.\nNumis analyst Nick James said told The Wall Street Journal that while the overall results were broadly in line with expectations, the market was pleased by the strong 37% rise in royalty revenue, which had been an area of concern among some analysts, offsetting weaker licensing revenue. Analysts tend to focus on royalties because licensing revenue varies from quarter to quarter due to the timing of deals.\nARM's technology is used in 95% of smartphones, 80% of digital cameras, and 35% of all electronic devices, according to its website.\nWrite to Rory Gallivan at rory.gallivan@wsj.com\n 06:35 ET (10:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:09:57.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
