Itâ€™s going to be around content, enhanced services, building a unique Apple Music that can separate itself and build a moat around the iTunes franchise,\" Ives said. Apple does have two major strengths that will play in its favor as it entices new members and edges closer to Spotify in terms of market share. \"I think at one point in late 2016 they could come close to catching Spotify from a market share perspective because 1 billion iOS devices and the [strength of the] brand,\" Ives said. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:02:42.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
