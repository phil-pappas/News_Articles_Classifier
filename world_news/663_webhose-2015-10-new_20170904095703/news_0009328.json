When the error was revealed in January, the Antiquities Ministry quickly called a press conference where Eckmann said he and an Egyptian team could fix the epoxy-job and avoid permanent damage.\nThe 3,300-year-old pharaonic mask was discovered in Tutankhamun's tomb along with other artifacts by British archeologists in 1922, sparking worldwide interest in archaeology and ancient Egypt.\nIt is arguably the best-known piece in the museum, one of Cairo's main tourist sites, which was built in 1902 and houses ancient Egyptian artifacts and mummies.\nEckmann said that during the restoration, experts would conduct a detailed study of the mask's ancient manufacture technique that had not been done previously to determine what materials and techniques were used.\n\"We are using this chance to gain new information about the manufacture,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820028/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/25/8820032/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/25/8820038/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820028/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820031/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/25/8820038/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820030/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820030/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/32/8820403/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820027/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820031/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820027/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820026/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/24/8820026/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/32/8820403/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/25/8820032/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:53:26.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
