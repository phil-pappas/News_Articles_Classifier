The novel, the first installment of a trilogy, is now available on amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com .\nHemingway, a nonfiction author who has earned his reputation for tackling challenging subjects with clarity and insight, has now applied these literary talents to a work of fiction. Reimagining the life of Jane Austen, a literary icon beloved by readers around the world, The Marriage of Miss Jane Austen examines how a serious romantic relationship would have changed her as a person and a writer. The approach uses historical fiction to provide a thoughtful, in-depth look at what life was really like for women in the early 1800s.\nThe love story takes the heroine out of Austen’s balls and country houses of rural England and plunges her into what the Regency era was really about: great explorations and scientific advances, political foment, and wars that were among the longest and most devastating in European history. The characters become bound up in these outside events even as they become bound together. The novel imagines a life for Austen in which she opens her heart to a man as independent, as passionate and as complicated as she is herself.\nEarly reviews of The Marriage of Miss Jane Austen have been very positive:\nWhat if Austen, who penned so many classic love stories, found her own romantic match? Ashton Dennis fits right into the Austen universe, while this Jane remains true to life, an intelligent and determined young woman. The writing is Austen-ian, and Hemingway has a talent for witty banter and wry observations that would make Elizabeth Bennet proud. An enjoyable first novel in an imaginative, well-researched series. —Kirkus Reviews\nHemingway’s book [places] a very human Jane into a vibrant, turbulent England that is seeking new ideas but also fighting the Napoleonic Wars. He captures the energy of the times, while also writing with the irony and sly humor of Jane Austen herself, complete with the stylistic language of the Regency period. This is truly a worthy addition to the Jane Austen legacy, a story sure to please all Austen fans. —Blueink Starred Review\nA skillful portrayal of an early nineteenth-century literary icon takes this historical romance on an imaginative journey of the soul. Insight and intuition, along with meticulous research, have created a believable version of her character in this tender story of Ashton and Jane. Excellent character development enhances the plausibility of the scenario. Background, motivation, eccentricity—everything that constitutes a personality allow these fascinating people to step off the pages in lifelike form. Bright, colorful descriptive passages establish a sense of place, building atmosphere and mood. Hemingway immerses himself in [Austen’s] unique world—a stylistic tribute that evokes the genteel atmosphere of the period. —Julia Ann Charpentier, Foreword CLARION Reviews, 4 stars\n[An] engaging and remarkably convincing romance. Wry, observant, laconic—much like Jane Austen herself, without ever dipping into pastiche or mimicry. Hemingway, with the lightest touch, builds up a thoroughly convincing alternative history for Jane. [A] thoughtful re-imagining of Austen’s love life. —Joceline Bury, Jane Austen’s Regency World\nThe common theme between The Marriage of Miss Jane Austen and Hemingway’s nonfiction is the handling of complex subjects in a clear, intelligent and creative manner. As a nonfiction author, Hemingway has worked with a number of thought leaders to produce insightful books on topics as diverse as corporate culture and ethics; business, the Internet, and mobile technology; retail branding strategies; and the cognitive potential of the brain. He is best known for partnering with Gates, then Microsoft’s CEO, on the #1 best-selling book Business @ the Speed of Thought.\nHemingway will be signing books from 3:45 to 5:45 pm, on Saturday, Oct. 10, in the Galt House Grand Hall at the JASNA conference.
