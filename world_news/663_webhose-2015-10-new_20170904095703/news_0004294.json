But the quarterly results, which topped Wall Street expectations, were substantially better after stripping out factors such as currency exchange rates and a prior decision to reduce Microsoft's smartphone sales.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft said revenue from its Azure cloud service more than doubled, while revenue from Office 365, the cloud version of its popular productivity software, jumped nearly 70%.\nChief Executive Satya Nadella has tried to boost its cloud businesses, which offer recurring revenues rather than the one-time sales associated with its conventional businesses. He estimated Thursday that the company's combined cloud businesses are running at an annual revenue rate of $8.2 billion and are on track to hit a $20 billion target.\n\"Cloud continues to be the Rock of Gibraltar for Microsoft,\" said Daniel Ives, a FBR Capital Markets analyst. \"This was a source of strength yet again in the quarter.\"\nBetter than expected net and cloud-services revenue pushed shares up 8% to $51.88 in after-hours trading after gaining 83 cents to $48.03 in 4 p.m. Nasdaq trading.\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, Microsoft took roughly $8.4 billion in write-downs and other charges related to its ill-fated purchase of Nokia Corp.'s handset business, announcing that it would lay off 7,800 people.\nThis week, Microsoft took steps to cut about 1,000 more workers, or about 1% of its global workforce, a person familiar with the situation said.\nThe company, best known for its PC operating system, released the new Windows 10 version in the latest quarter as a free download. Mr. Nadella estimated that more than 110 million devices are now running the software.\nPartly because of the new product, Microsoft said it managed to do better than others in the PC market last quarter. Its sales of Windows software sold on personal computers declined 6% in the quarter ended in September.\nMarket watcher International Data Corp. estimated earlier this month that PC overall shipments fell a larger-than-anticipated 11% in the third quarter while rival Gartner Inc. said shipments declined 7.7% from a year ago.\nThe quarter ended Sept. 30 was the first with results from three operating divisions designed to emphasize its mobile and cloud businesses.\nRevenue in a new unit called the Intelligent Cloud rose 8%, or up 14% excluding currency effects. \"We are poised to seize the opportunity of the largest technology shift of our generation with the enterprise cloud, \" Mr. Nadella said during a conference call.\nAnother division, called More Personal Computing, declined 17%, or 13% in constant currency. The drop mainly reflects changes in the company's phone sales strategy and the slower PC market.\nThe Microsoft Productivity and Business Processes unit that includes Office products posted a revenue decline of 2.8%.\nOverall, Microsoft reported a quarterly profit of $4.62 billion, or 57 cents a share, up from $4.54 billion, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue decreased 12% to $20.38 billion from $23.2 billion a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, excluding factors such as revenue deferrals from introducing Windows 10, per-share earnings were 67 cents a share and revenue was $21.7 billion.\nOn that basis, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected per-share profit of 59 cents and revenue of $21.03 billion.\nWrite to Don Clark at don.clark@wsj.com and Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 22, 2015 19:20 ET (23:20 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:12:38.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
