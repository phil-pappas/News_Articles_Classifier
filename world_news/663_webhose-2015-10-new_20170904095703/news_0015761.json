Hope was attacked by poachers in the first week of May 2015. The poachers darted her with tranquillising drugs and hacked off her horn, leaving her for dead. The attack is one of a series of losses suffered by Lombardi Nature Reserve in the last month. After the attack, Hope was transferred to Shamwari Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape to receive further treatment. Major surgery was performed on 18 May by Dr Gerhard Steenkamp of the University of Pretoria and a veterinary team to fit the protective plate that can be seen covering the wound. Hope is being cared for by Saving the Survivors, an organisation which works specifically to save rhino that have been victims of poaching attacks. South Africa has see \nThe rhino poaching war in KwaZulu-Natal has reached new levels of intensity, with almost 55 poaching attempts in local reserves each month. \nWildlife rangers and KwaZulu-Natal security agencies detected 93 rhino poaching incursions in May alone – more than three attempts each day. \nAlthough most attempts were foiled, 13 rhinos were killed that month. \nTen days ago, Ezemvelo also found eight dead or wounded rhinos in the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park. \nAs a result, Ezemvelo is now experimenting with several new strategies and sophisticated technology to halt the onslaught. \n“We can’t reveal much about these strategies, but we are almost at tipping point, where the rate of deaths overtakes the birth rate. Once that happens it’s the road of no return,” said acting chief executive David Mabunda \n“The details are not available for distribution, but the technology allows rangers access to real-time data about whether the animals are being poached and immediately sends out alerts in the event that a rhino is dehorned. \n“This technology is designed to dramatically revolutionise the fight against poachers by reducing reaction time and allowing the scene to be pinpointed with greater accuracy.” \nOther security measures included better access control, enhanced surveillance and top-of-the-range digital communication systems. \nBut he acknowledged there were problems securing a helicopter surveillance service. Three service providers had responded to recent tender invitations but had not been able to meet Ezemvelo’s specifications. \nMabunda said the agency hoped to invite tenders for a 12-month helicopter surveillance contract before the end of the month. In the meantime, Ezemvelo was exploring the option of acquiring its own small fleet of helicopters. \n“Choppers are not a panacea to rhino poaching, but you need them for quick response and also for intelligence-driven operations.” \nMabunda also urged the courts to impose much heavier sentences on rhino poachers. \nHe noted that criminal prosecution of Dawie Groenewald and several other rhino horn suspects had not been finalised four years since the initial arrests. Instead of firearms, several recent poaching cases in Hluhluwe-Imfolozi now involved the use of dart guns and tranquilliser drugs. \nHe also acknowledged alleged rhino horn trader and former Ezemvelo trail ranger Bheki Msweli had been killed in a skirmish with wildlife and security agencies in Thanda private game reserve about two weeks ago. “The individual you mention had been tagged previously,” said Mabunda, adding that all staff involved in rhino operations had to undergo integrity testing.
