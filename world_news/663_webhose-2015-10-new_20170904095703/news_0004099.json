This program intends to equip ESET MSP partners with the tools they need for simpler licensing and management and reward them for their growth by decreasing licensing costs as their volume of business increases.\n\nCommenting on the need for managed services in the region, Pavol Balaj, EMEA Business Development Lead at ESET, said, \"Managed services are playing a vital role in various industry verticals because companies can manage their IT needs more economically, and focus on their core businesses rather than IT infrastructure. This is an attractive security alternative for all verticals, starting with finance, healthcare, government and manufacturing, and now growing rapidly also in retail, utilities, media and entertainment.\"\n\nESET's main focus for this new program are existing Managed Service, Managed Network, Cloud, Hosting and Application providers who would like to build their offerings on award-winning security solutions from a global vendor, as well as VARs and LVARs who plan to start offering managed services in addition to their current core business offerings.\n\nPradeesh VS, General Manager at ESET Middle East said, \"We have combined best-of-breed technologies, with a forward-thinking approach that enables our MSP partners to easily leverage and scale our security solutions across their customer base. They can now move to a simplified and more profitable daily-billing, monthly-invoicing model that enables them to pay only for the seats that have actually utilized. Most significantly, they will have the flexibility to add or remove licenses without needing to contact ESET.\"\n\nThrough the ESET MSP Administrator Web-Console, providers can create, enable and disable sites and manage product quantities from a single and easy to use interface. ESET believes regional partners will welcome the program's flexible billing model which allows them to aggregate their clients in order to enjoy volume pricing benefits. The program gives MSP access to the entire range of ESET home and business solutions covering endpoint security, file security, and mail security for all popularly used platforms.\n\nThe company will also attract MSPs to its program via the ESET Remote Administrator. The ESET Remote Administrator supports managed services while remaining Remote Management Module (RMM) agnostic, thus allowing administrators to remotely access and control their antivirus implementations without constraining the administration server to run on a specific vendor or hardware configuration. At the same time, MSPs can leverage ESET's RMM plugins to integrate with industry leading solutions such as Kaseya and LabTech.\n\n\"We will also simplify on-boarding of our MSP partners by providing them with a wealth of resources including marketing materials, competitive intelligence and other collateral. And through it all, they can be assured of our locally delivered world-class support,\" concluded Pradeesh. \n\nAbout ESET \nSince 1987, ESET has been developing record award-winning security software that now helps over 100 million users to Enjoy Safer Technology.
