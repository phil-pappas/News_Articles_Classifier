This European study is a follow-on to an earlier identical study looking at the US, China and Latin America and has revealed both interesting similarities as well as significant differences between the regions. This study is designed to help vendors with an interest in stimulating the market with the ability to print from mobile devices. It seeks to address the needs of users that want and need to print from multiple locations, or while they are on the go, and what problems they face. This report seeks to help vendors address these concerns so that the users of their devices will be able to print as often as they want.\nInfoTrends has found that printing from mobile devices has the strong potential to add to total print volume. In fact, half of those surveyed with mobile devices want to print from their mobile phones and nearly all of these respondents wanted to do so for personal reasons. However, InfoTrends has identified several barriers that currently inhibit this potential from being reached.\n“Knowing where to find an accessible printer” was the most popular response for barriers to printing for personal purposes followed by “technical connectivity problems to the printer.” It appears that there is a definite opportunity in Western Europe for more mobile print-compatible printers to be placed in homes, workplaces, and alternative locations. “Public transit locations—such as airports, bus stations, and train terminals—are particularly important print locations for mobile device users,” says John Shane , Director of InfoTrends’ Communication Supplies Consulting Service . “Given the nature of travel and the reasons why people are there, these places could potentially charge a premium for printing services. There are also far fewer public transit locations and some are hubs, which could make coverage easier.”\nInfoTrends also recommends encouraging mobile device vendors to make it possible for mobile devices to connect to two Wi-Fi sources at the same time. It can be cumbersome to disconnect from one source and connect to another to print before reconnecting to the first. This could possibly alleviate some of the technical connectivity problems that people face when printing from a mobile device.\nTo learn more about Mobile Devices and the Impact on Print – Europe , please visit our online store or contact Scott Phinney at 781 616 2123 or scott.phinney(at)infotrends(dot)com.\nAbout InfoTrends\nInfoTrends is the leading worldwide market research and strategic consulting firm for the imaging, document solutions, production print, and digital media industries.
