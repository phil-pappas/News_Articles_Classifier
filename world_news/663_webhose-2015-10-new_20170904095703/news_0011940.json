This new feature enables Spanish-speaking patients to easily sign-in at their healthcare facility. \nThe HIPAA compliant kiosk is web-based and requires only Internet and power connections. Patients enter their name and other information using the touch screen and all of their responses flow directly into PatientTrak. \nThe kiosk also identifies the patient appointment and adds the patient to the arrival queue. Staff can view patient status including arrival right from their office computers or large flat screen monitors. \nThe kiosk is compatible with virtually any Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system via an industry standard HL7 software interface. \n\"Many of our current and prospective customers have stated the need for a Spanish language kiosk and we are happy to provide them with this critical function,\" says James W. Hermann, President of Lumin Medical, makers of PatientTrak. \"It is very important that patient information is clearly communicated and captured during the patient access process and the Spanish language option certainly supports that,\" says Hermann. \nAbout PatientTrak : PatientTrak is the leading provider of patient tracking, staff communication, text messaging and visibility solutions for healthcare. Using only a web browser, the PatientTrak system allows health facilities to easily track patients' wait times, status, and treatment providers.
