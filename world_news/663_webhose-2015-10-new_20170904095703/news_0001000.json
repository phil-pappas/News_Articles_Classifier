Lax sanitary practices in the preparation and storage of food products endanger public health.\" \nThe authorities collected environmental swab samples from three areas of the company's facility, which were allegedly found to be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes. The inspection also apparently revealed poor sanitary practices in the facility, which may have lead to cross-contamination between finished and raw food products. \nThe frozen crab products were seized by the US Marshals Service from warehouses in Lakeville, Massachusetts, which were being monitored by the FDA. \nAccording to court documents, Rome Packing is presently in receivership. \nLast May, the firm recalled its Ocean's Catch brand of minced crab meat, and almost five months later, recalled the Ocean's Catch brand of crab legs and other crab meat products over concerns of listeria contamination. \nUS attorney Carmen M Ortiz said: \"In partnership with the FDA, we are working to ensure food safety. Lax sanitary practices in the preparation and storage of food products endanger public health. Where necessary, we will intervene to prevent contaminated food from reaching consumers.\" \nUS FDA associate commissioner for regulatory affairs Melinda K Plaisier said: \"Thanks to the collaboration between the FDA and the Department of Justice, we have ensured that the adulterated crab produced by Rome Packing doesn't make its way to consumers.\" Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:13:08.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
