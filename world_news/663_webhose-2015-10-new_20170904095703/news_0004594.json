He has been CFO of Wal-Mart's international division since January 2014.\nBiggs had previously been CFO of Walmart U.S. and held senior positions in the Sam's Club division before that.\nWal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon also came from the international business.\nThe company said last month it had found a \"material weakness\" in its controls over accounting for leases, which allowed for misapplication of accounting standards related to sale-leaseback transactions.\nHowever, the company said management believed related adjustments to its financial statements would be immaterial for all periods.\nThe world's largest retailer reported profit below estimates for the second straight quarter and cut its annual profit forecast as it copes with higher labor costs, a squeeze on pharmacy margins and sliding sales at its Asda supermarket chain in Britain.\nHolley, 59, will serve as an executive vice president in a transitional role until Jan. 31.\nHe has been the CFO since December 2010.\nThe company's shares were trading slightly up at $66.97 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:19:25.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
