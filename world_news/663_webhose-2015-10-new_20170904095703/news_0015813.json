The EU has set out to reduce emissions 40% by 2030 compared to 1990.\nAn OECD analysis of 44 countries and the EU, responsible for more than 80% of greenhouse gas emissions, showed that emissions have decreased relative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The decrease was due in part to national policies, including cutting subsidies for fossil fuels.\nBut the cuts are not enough to achieve the temperature cap that has been set out by scientists as crucial to avoid climate change's worst effects. A UN agreement drafted in advance of an upcoming climate summit in Paris also sets a hard temperature increase limit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:06:38.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
