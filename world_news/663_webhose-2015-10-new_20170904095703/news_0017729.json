It said the theft was limited to shopper names, email and delivery ­addresses, but credit card, passwords and other sensitive financial information was locked up.\nThe breach was the second shock in as many days for the 177-year-old department store after it announced the sudden departure of chief executive Iain Nairn, who had been in the role for only 14 months.\nThere is no link between Mr Nairn’s exit and the online security breach, David Jones said.\n“David Jones has today advised its customers that a third party recently exploited vulnerability in its website to extract limited information about some of our customers,” the department store said in a statement yesterday.\n“The information obtained was restricted to customer name, email address, order details and mailing address. No credit card information, financial information or passwords were obtained. David Jones does not store any financial information on its website.”\nEarlier this week, general merchandise chain Kmart told its customers its online operations had been hacked, with the Australian retailer saying the data stolen was limited to names, email addresses, delivery and billing addresses, telephone numbers and product purchase details.\nDavid Jones uses IBM as an online platform provider, and it is believed Kmart also has its online infrastructure provided by IBM.\nIBM spokeswoman Sandra McMullan did not return phone calls yesterday.\nDavid Jones said it had reported the incident to the Privacy Commissioner at the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and to the Australian Federal Police.\nIn 2014-15, the OAIC received 110 voluntary data breach notifications, a 64 per cent increase on the previous year.\nNikki Parker, vice-president at online security firm Covata, said Australian businesses could no longer act as spectators while companies elsewhere, especially the US, were victims of hackers.\nShe said cyber criminals now were looking to Australia’s shores for easy prey.\n“I think it’s a huge problem and something Australians need to stop burying their heads in the sand and saying it’s not in my backyard — it’s happening here, and cyber criminals are attacking globally, will attack global businesses and that means Australian businesses need to be aware of that,” she said.\nMs Parker said traditional firewalls and other security tools were not enough to fend off hackers, with encryption now a key weapon to protect confidential data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:10:01.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
