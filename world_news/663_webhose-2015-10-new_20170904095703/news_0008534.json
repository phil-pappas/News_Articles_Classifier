There’s a brand new camera out there that’s pushing all competition out of the frame. The L16, by a company called Light, has 16 different circles on its front. If this thing’s pointing at you, there’s not escape.\nBehind each circle is a 13MP camera module and the L16 can summon every bit of image information to generate one massive image...52 megapixels big. From a basic point and-shoot, that’s unheard of! No wonder then Light founder Rajiv Laroia is calling it “a silent revolution”.\nWhen compared to other cameras, Light claims the L16 will pack in more details and yes, can thrash today’s phone cameras. But with an asking price of $1,699, it’s rather expensive too and since the company is planning to make just a thousand of these, it will be rare too! What could be better though? Add a phone function to it, perhaps?\n Camera L16 light Also Read Tipped: Nexus 6 – Motorola – August Selfie-centric phone among new Microsoft offerings Ideas to lighten your brother’s pocket this Raksha Bandhan Apple looks all set to fight bendgate with the next iPhone", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/19L16-CAMERA-1.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/19L16-CAMERA-1.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/technology-latest/article/l16-16-cameras-one-camera", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:52:59.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
