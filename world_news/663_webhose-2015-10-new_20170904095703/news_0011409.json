But, this private community faces huge challenges as they balance the preservation of their traditions with the benefits of a thriving tourist economy. Known for their traditional values and shunning of modern technology, the Amish are hugely popular with Asian tourists – who make up the largest percentage of visitors to the area.\nMuch of life for Lancaster’s Amish has gone unchanged for centuries. Rural Pennsylvania has long been the setting for a dependable livelihood for this farming community, but with some 8.2 million visitors to the area last year, tourism is also playing its part.\nSome estimates put the economic impact of the Amish at US$1.5 billion, but for the religious group, known for its rejection of modern possessions and technology, it is still business as usual. The Amish community in Pennsylvania accounts for some 50,000 people, and they have traditionally made their living through farming in particular crops of corn and tobacco. Best estimates are that two thirds of visitors to Lancaster County are there because of their interest in the Amish way of life – a fascination that’s not without its problems.\n“People come in here and want to take my picture all the time, and sometimes it makes me feel like a circus freak or a zoo animal,” said Rosie, a former schoolteacher. But even this tight-knit, traditional community has branched out beyond its farming roots.\nAttraction towards the Amish community continues to grow as its population goes up with an average of seven children per family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:40:26.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
