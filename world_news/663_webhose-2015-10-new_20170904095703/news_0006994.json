When confronted by security guards, the two climbed into a Jeep marked with the paper’s logo, aimed for and struck two Tesla employees, one of whom was trying to write down the Jeep’s license plate number, according to the company.\nOne Tesla employee was knocked to the ground and suffered bleeding cuts to his arms, the Palo Alto company said, in a post on the official Tesla blog.\nThe newspaper, for its part, posted a brief story about the incident on Friday. But the description is a bit different.\nThe paper mentions only one employee, photographer Andy Barron , who has been with the Gazette-Journal since 1998. According to the paper, Barron was arrested by the Storey County Sheriff’s Office and booked on a charge of battery with a deadly weapon.\n“We take this situation very seriously and it is under investigation at this time,” the newspaper’s publisher, John Maher , said.\nThe paper also reports that a rock had been used to shatter the Jeep’s driver’s-side window, and the driver’s seat belt had been cut in half.\nAcquisitions\nCondé Naste buys Pitchfork\nCondé Nast, the publisher that owns magazines like Vogue and Vanity Fair , said Tuesday that it had acquired Pitchfork Media, the company behind the independent music website and quarterly magazine, for an undisclosed sum.\nPitchfork, founded in 1995, has long been one of music’s independent voices, known for unearthing up-and-coming artists, and for its in-depth reviews. The acquisition will take immediate effect.\nWells Fargo buys 3 GE units\nGeneral Electric said Tuesday that it is selling three of its corporate lending and leasing units to Wells Fargo, the latest step in the industrial conglomerate’s campaign to shed its financial units so it can focus on its core businesses.\nThe companies did not disclose the purchase price, but said the three businesses being bought have about $32 billion in loans and leases. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.\nThe three businesses are part of GE Capital, the financial unit that GE is selling in pieces to focus on its industrial roots. The businesses — commercial distribution finance, North American vendor finance and corporate finance — give loans to manufacturers, dealers or other companies. The three businesses have about 3,000 employees.\nWells Fargo said the acquisitions strengthen its presence in key commercial-lending markets. It’s the second recent deal between the companies — last month, the banks’ railcar finance, leasing and fleet management unit agreed to buy GE Railcar Services from GE Capital for undisclosed terms.\nEarnings\nJPMorgan profit up 22%\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. saw its third-quarter profits rise 22 percent from a year earlier, helped by a significant one-time tax benefit. But the bank’s results still missed analysts’ expectations as revenue declined in all of its core businesses.\nThe largest U.S. bank by assets said Tuesday it earned $6.27 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, up from a profit of $5.13 billion a year earlier. On a per share basis, the bank earned $1.68, compared with $1.35 per share a year earlier. Removing one-time items, including a $2.2 billion tax benefit from issues related to the financial crisis, JPMorgan said it earned $1.32 a share, which missed analysts’ estimates of $1.37 per share.\nChronicle News Services", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:51:23.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
