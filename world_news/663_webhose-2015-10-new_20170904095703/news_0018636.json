Kate Brown, U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio commended the small town of Roseburg for coming together to help the victims of Thursday's shooting at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College.\nBrown said more must be done to prevent bloodshed but that \"today is not the day.\" She says it's time to help the community heal\nWyden echoed her comments, adding that ending massacres will require compromise.\nMerkley, who grew up in the area, thanked first responders and said one of those who died was the great-granddaughter of his first cousin.\n___\n11:27 a.m.\nA student who worked on stage productions with the gunman who killed nine people at an Oregon community college says he was a normal guy, if a bit nerdy.\nAlex Frier, stage manager for plays at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College, says Christopher Harper-Mercer was a production assistant responsible for building sets last semester.\nIt wasn't clear if he was enrolled at the college in the small town of Roseburg, but she and some students say they thought he was taking classes.\nFrier says Harper-Mercer didn't really interact with her much, but he'd typically wear funny sunglasses.\nShe says: \"He was a typical Roseburg kid, kinda nerdy, kinda out there.

But by Dec. 11, 2008, he was discharged for failing to meet the minimum administrative standards.\nGarrett did not say which standards Harper-Mercer failed to meet.

Officials identified the killer as Chris Harper-Mercer. He died after a shootout with police.\nHe isn't believed to have a criminal history.

He says investigators will release details on the number and types of weapons later Friday.\nOfficials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer and say he opened fire at the college Thursday, killing nine people and wounding seven others before dying during an exchange of gunfire with officers.\nHanlin also says investigators went door to door in the neighborhoods near the college and the shooter's apartment to try to learn more details.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:23:48.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
