Getty Images Share on twitter by David Ramli Singtel-Optus has signed a three-year deal with Cricket Australia to stream matches to its customers.\nAs first revealed by Fairfax Media , certain Optus users will be able to access the Cricket Australia Live Pass from October 29, which gives them the ability to watch matches. This typically costs $29.99 a season.\nThe sports rights deal is part of a big drive by Optus to sign content partnerships with companies like Netflix that can lure customers away from rivals including Telstra and TPG Telecom.\n\"This partnership with Cricket Australia marks a significant milestone for Optus as we transform to become a content-led telecommunications provider,\" Optus chief executive Allen Lew said. \"Increasingly, customers look to Optus for an experience they can't get anywhere else.\n\"Our focus on premium content will play an important role in our strategy as we seek to differentiate ourselves.\"\nAs part of the deal, Optus will also get access to Australian cricket players for promotional purposes as well as tickets that can be handed to customers and partners.\nEligible Optus customers on its newer mobile plans will be allowed to stream the Cricket Australia matches without it counting against their download allowances.\nBut the matches will be available for watching within Australia only.\n Cricket Australia previously signed a content deal with mobile carrier 3, which in turn became Vodafone Hutchison Australia. But its efforts to give customers live match videos did not gain traction, because smartphones like the Apple iPhone had not been released.\nVodafone Australia ultimately dropped Cricket Australia in 2012 as it went through a transformation program.\nCricket Australia has aggressively moved into the digital space, including a move to sell rights to British broadcaster BT Sports in August that will make the Cricket Live app available to BT's 5.2 million subscribers.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-10-22T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:24:29.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
