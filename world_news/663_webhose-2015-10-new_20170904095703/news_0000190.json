The video service is introducing the paid YouTube Red subscription on October 28. Upon debut, the service is due to have 99 percent of the content that people search for, Robert Kyncl, YouTube's chief business officer, said this week, suggesting that ESPN's official content isn't a major draw. \n“ESPN is not currently part of the Red service,” the sports network said in an emailed statement. “Content previously available on the free YouTube service will be available across ESPN digital properties.” \nYouTube has advised partners that their clips won't be viewable on the public, ad-supported service if they don't participate in the paid commercial-free version. Holdouts can keep videos hosted privately, allowing them to become public once a deal is reached. \nThe trade publication Variety reported on the disappearance of the clips earlier Friday, citing the rights issues. – Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:51:56.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
