PDG possesses the resources and experience to address large scale development projects, long-term regulatory strategies and complex non-clinical and clinical issues. \nThe company is acutely aware of the commercial hurdles faced by drug companies and has a keen sense for knowing which development projects might work and the ones that will not. PDG's drug development input is backed by years of industry experience. Research and development, drug candidate selection and early stage proof-of-concept \nIntroducing new drug products to the US market in the current regulatory environment is a complex undertaking that can be both lengthy and expensive. However, much of the cost and effort required to bring a drug product to market may be eliminated through the employment of strategic development principles at the front end. \nPDG will help you identify the earliest point in the drug development process where the evidence suggests a reasonable likelihood for success, as well as an absence of key causes of failure. Critical to the effort is the company's integrated review of crucial areas such as safety, efficacy, pharmacologic, commercial and FDA regulatory concerns. Meetings and ongoing interface with FDA (pre-IND, end of Phase II, Pre-NDA meetings) \nDespite the availability of guidance meant to assist sponsors, FDA meetings can be intimidating and unproductive. As such, many sponsors fail to get the most benefit from them. Successful FDA meetings will help you avoid costly delays, secure FDA's opinions and buy-in on your project and contribute to a solid relationship with FDA. The Pre-IND Meeting is a relatively low-cost and strategic early determinant of the critical path for your product's development. \nSuch meetings can help identify and resolve early development issues encountered specifically in the areas of toxicology, pharmacology and formulation/CMC. Meeting with FDA staff contributes to prevention of clinical holds and provides useful information in the compilation and submission of an IND. In short, strategically planned and professionally facilitated Pre-IND Meetings increase the chances for success of your development program. Sourcing vendors and suppliers for CMOs, CROs, API suppliers, clinical and non-clinical laboratories \nYears of service to the pharmaceutical industry has taught PDG that supplier / vendor selection, audit, qualification, contract negotiation, and oversight are critical to a successful drug development program. PDG routinely helps its clients develop these important resources including clinical research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) & component suppliers, clinical and non-clinical laboratories. \nThe company also maintains oversight and relationships with such third-party organizations to ensure their adherence to sponsor protocols, schedules, budgets, GCPs, GLPs, and GMPs as applicable. Comprehensive management of NDAs, including 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2), 505(j), supplemental NDAs \nDr Blume and PDG personnel have been engaged in more than 150 NDA and ANDA applications for a range of new and generic drugs, in addition to numerous nonprescription projects. However, PDG's responsibilities do not end with submission assignments, but continue through post-approval strategies in support of safety and compliance. \nThese responsibilities include periodic reporting (PADERs/PSURs), post-marketing safety surveillance, literature reviews and signal detection, as well as currency of professional labeling, patient labeling, Medication Guides (REMs) and promotional labeling. \nPDG helps develop strategies for optimizing drug safety, leveraging its professional experience as a pharmaceutical and FDA regulatory consultant. Clients are guided through the development of commercial and clinical strategies to optimize safety and ROI throughout their drug product's lifecycle. \nPDG provides assistance to clients from the initial idea presentation to the FDA, covering areas that include: Pre-IND / pre-NDA / end of phase II meetings IND / special protocol assessment (SPA) First-in-human through Phase IV studies NDA compilation and submission, including all CTD sections Supplemental NDAs Ongoing NDA maintenance / FDA interactions Nonprescription concerns:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:42:08.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
