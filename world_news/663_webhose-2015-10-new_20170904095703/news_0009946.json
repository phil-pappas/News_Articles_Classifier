Teradata Corporation logo.   Teradata significantly enhances performance and ease of use when executing analytics that span the Teradata® Unified Data Architecture™ ANAHEIM, Calif. , Oct. 20,   (Teradata 2015 PARTNERS User Group Conference) - Teradata (NYSE: [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdWRHVnlZV1JoZEdFdVkyOXRMMXdpSUhKbGJEMWNJbTV2Wm05c2JHOTNYQ0lnZEdGeVoyVjBQVndpWDJKc1lXNXJYQ0krVkVSRFBDOWhQZz09fA==]]), the big data analytics and marketing applications company, today announced both software and hardware innovations that increase ease of use and manageability of its leading Teradata® Unified Data Architecture™ (UDA), and accelerate agile decision making. The Teradata ® QueryGrid™: Teradata Database-to-Presto software will enable cross-platform SQL queries to be initiated from Apache ® Hadoop™ or the Teradata Database. In addition, Teradata is the first to streamline data exploration and analytics by integrating a Teradata Database, Teradata Aster Analytics, and Hadoop in a single Teradata ® UDA Appliance. As streams of data swell and new types of analytics emerge, organizations are challenged with limited budgets and parsing the myriad of technology choices. Without an architectural vision, organizations can easily build data centers with disjointed technologies that hinder progress. Teradata addresses these challenges with the Teradata UDA, an analytic ecosystem that orchestrates technologies by taking advantage of their highly differentiated capabilities and economic benefits. \"Since Teradata introduced the UDA over three years ago, we have seen rapid adoption of this approach,\" said Oliver Ratzesberger , president, Teradata Labs. \"Our new products will further our customers' ability to develop the most flexible, integrated, and powerful analytics platform in the world. These enhancements will significantly increase performance and make it easier to execute analytics that span Hadoop and Teradata. And the Teradata UDA Appliance will allow customers to realize the comprehensive value of the UDA in a single cabinet.\" Teradata QueryGrid™ Now Supports Presto Teradata QueryGrid is the only software that optimizes analytics across the enterprise. It takes a unique approach to multi-system analytics by giving users a seamless, self-service experience. The new Teradata QueryGrid™: Teradata Database-to-Presto software allows users to work with big data in a more interactive manner, providing the ability to use ANSI SQL to query data in Hadoop and Teradata. Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. With the new Teradata QueryGrid™, users can now initiate and complete cross-platform queries from Hadoop with processing pushed down into the Teradata Database. Or, the query can be initiated from Teradata and the processing is then pushed down into Hadoop. The addition of Presto software further expands the breadth and value of the Unified Data Architecture and provides users with significantly faster response times while leveraging existing SQL tools and skills across the analytic ecosystem. Teradata announced open source contributions and a committed roadmap to Presto in June 2015 designed to increase Presto adoption. In September 2015 , Teradata announced accelerated availability and commercial support for enterprise class Presto ODBC/JDBC drivers. The drivers fill a key enterprise requirement by facilitating the connection of Presto with mature business intelligence tools and data-driven applications. Teradata UDA Appliance The Teradata UDA Appliance is the first enterprise-class appliance to enable a flexible combination of the Teradata Database, Teradata Aster Analytics, and Hadoop to meet customer workload requirements. All software is installed into one cabinet, providing the advantages of an analytic ecosystem in a smaller data center footprint. The Teradata UDA Appliance is a fully configurable analytic ecosystem, which can be deployed as a Teradata Unified Data Architecture. The appliance can easily adapt to the customer's requirements to promote data-driven decisions on large, fast-moving structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It supports an open model for data acquisition and discovery, and integrates data from all parts of the organization, while matching a variety of workload requirements to the right data sets. The Teradata QueryGrid: Teradata Database-to-Presto software and the Teradata UDA Appliance will be available globally in the first quarter 2016.
