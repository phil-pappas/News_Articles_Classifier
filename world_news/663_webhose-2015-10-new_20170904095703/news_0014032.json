She cling-wrapped his car so he Post-It noted her vehicle. Picture: Facebook\nVera Bertola Macarthur Chronicle Campbelltown THIS was the prank that had drivers along the Hume Highway south of Sydney wondering what was going on when they spotted a little silver car encased in cling-wrap.\nIt followed a social media meltdown over the weekend over a car parked at Mt Annan, slathered in yellow Post-It notes.\nNow a connection between the two “incidents” has been revealed after Tanya Heath posted on facebook that it was actually “revenge” pranking between herself and her good-humoured 19-year-old son Drew Barns.\nMrs Heath said after she cling-wrapped Drew’s car, he plotted payback by waiting until she had gone away for the weekend and stickered her motor vehicle.\nMs Heath and her son played practical jokes on each other. She cling-wrapped his car so he Post-It noted her vehicle. Source: Supplied\n“He had me in hysterics,” she admitted to the Macarthur Chronicle, after he tagged her in a facebook video to show her his handywork.\n“I did ask him to take them off so they didn’t damage the paintwork.”\nThe teenager obliged, but he had one more surprise for his mother.\n“When I went to get my car, he’d filled it up with those playcentre foam balls,” she said with a laugh.\nMrs Heath said the good-natured banter between herself and Drew started on their mobile phones.\n“He took my phone and changed the contacts, so when I rang my husband I was actually ringing my girlfriend,” she said.\n“So I changed Drew’s contacts to Disney characters. He was getting phone calls from Buzz and Woody and Snow White.”\nThe stakes were raised when Mrs Heath got her hands on some shrink cling-wrap for pallets a couple of weeks ago.\n“I was waiting for an opportunity when he was at home and not going to work ... it took me about half-an-hour and I cling-wrapped his car.”\nIt didn’t register when Drew rang her and casually asked where she was parking her car.\n“We’ve got a truce on cars now,” Mrs Heath said. “Revenge? Definitely.”\nOriginally published as Son’s revenge prank stuns motorists.\nOriginally published as Family’s sticky car revenge prank Jump back to top", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/1cfd40d07e1eadac7cdac7256d46037b?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ca706654b1a3478edf634c48792e39c5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f009162c69327b5aa3c21b494e3cada0", "http://news-whistleout.s3.amazonaws.com/News_Deals_300px.html", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/macarthur", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/macarthur/mt-annan-mother-tanya-heath-and-son-drew-barns-behind-practical-joke-car-decorating-pranks/story-fngr8h70-1227563223250", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:28:16.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
