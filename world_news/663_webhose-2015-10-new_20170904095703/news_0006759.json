Idle Smart is in production and expects commercial availability by January 2016. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277934 \nIdle Smart helps fleets run at peak efficiency by actively managing idle time and battery voltage levels in addition to helping prevent cold starts during the winter months. With the new Android platform's features, fleets now gain immediate access to results and operational data to assess performance and, as importantly, to make instant system parameter changes - by individual truck or fleet-wide. Idle Smart delivers a clear operational picture with the tools to make the needed daily changes to immediately optimize fleets. Having the ability to make changes quickly and easily from anywhere at any time saves fleets valuable time and money. \nIdle Smart: Connect. Customize. Control. \nIdle Smart extends a fleet operations team's control by incorporating the features most frequently asked for by customers - remote device management and operational performance diagnostics and reporting. \"Fleets always are asking for more actionable data and our new platform delivers on that need. Idle Smart's desktop reporting and diagnostics shows fleet-specific performance data, while the remote management platform allows fleets to actively and immediately respond to that information to drive immediate improvements. Whether it's frequent starts due to a degraded battery, or too much idle time based on the truck's specific route, our new Idle Smart platform allows fleet managers to see issues immediately and instantly make the necessary changes. As every fleet knows, just one slight tweak can mean significant and immediate savings,\" said Jeff Lynch, president of Idle Smart. \nThe new solution also was redesigned with drivers in mind. \"Aside from reducing downtime by keeping batteries charged and eliminating cold starts, Idle Smart now gives drivers more control without sacrificing fleet performance,\" said Lynch. \"For example, fleet managers can give drivers flexibility with temperatures in the cab. Fleets can set a temperature parameter so that drivers can have the flexibility to alter temperatures to their preference within plus or minus a few degrees. Idle Smart also helps trucks consistently stay on the road, which gives drivers more money in their pockets. Overall, drivers have more control and uptime which creates a better overall experience while staying within operational performance guidelines.\" \nIdle Smart helps to identify low performance issues and allows fleets to be more proactive with day-to-day operations. This is especially helpful with seasonal maintenance as fleets can easily start to winterize their vehicles. \"There is no need come off the road to change settings at terminals. Idle Smart allows fleets to remotely change and set parameters in real-time,\" Lynch continued. \"This allows fleets to handle seasonal or geography-specific issues without having to reroute or pull a truck offline.\" \nIdle Smart also has simplified the installation process by leveraging information across OEMs and by standardizing steps within the installation process. Idle Smart remains maintenance free and still weighs less than five pounds. Idle Smart works across all OEMs, and from its inception, was designed to work with other technologies in mind. The solution works as a stand-alone technology or as part of a mix of technologies within a fleet. \nThe Android-based product will be readily available by January and the company is currently taking orders for 2016 fleet purchases. Idle Smart will maintain its current tiered pricing structure ranging from $900 to $2500 per unit based on volume commitments. Idle Smart pays for itself monthly in terms of fuel saved, as well as provides an overall financial payback of 12-18 months for fleets. \n\"Having Idle Smart's remote management and diagnostic tools helps avoid costly issues. With the new Idle Smart platform, fleets are getting the most from their drivers while building high-performance fleets,\" Lynch said. \"We often ask our customers, 'How much are you spending to save?' As importantly, what is the value of the time wasted with out-of-service trucks that cause late loads and driver downtime and dissatisfaction?\" \nFor more information about Idle Smart and the Idle Smart Android platform, please visit www.idlesmart.com or call (913) 744-IDLE (4353). \nAbout Idle Smart \nIdle Smart allows trucking companies to keep fleets of all sizes running at peak efficiency.
