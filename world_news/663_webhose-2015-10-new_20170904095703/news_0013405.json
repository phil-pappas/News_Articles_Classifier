But the air date and title for the\nupcoming \"Sherlock\" Victorian special have themselves remained a mystery -- until now.\nOn Saturday, BBC One debuted an updated trailer , along with confirming an air date and title for the episode.\nThe 90-minute special will air on January 1, 2016, both on BBC One in the UK and on PBS in the US. This comes as a sigh of relief for American fans who usually have to be extra-careful to avoid spoilers from the UK audience that gets to see \"Sherlock\" earlier.\nThe special will also get a theatrical release in select venues around the world, including China .\nThe one-off special set in 1890s London is titled \" Sherlock: The Abominable Bride .\" The episode is co-written by series creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss.\nThe updated trailer shows the same footage from the previous trailer of Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) hunting down clues to unlock the secrets of another mystery.\nWe also see glimpses of Mary Morstan, also known as Mrs. Watson (played by Amanda Abbington), as well as Mrs Hudson (Una Stubbs).\nIf that wasn't enough good news, BBC One also confirmed that series 4 of \"Sherlock\" will start shooting next spring. \"Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss are busy writing away right now,\" BBC One tweeted Saturday.\nSeason 4 will take Sherlock and Watson into \"deeper and darker water than ever before... The Game is on -- again!\" Gatiss said of the next season earlier this year.\nBut for now, all we can do is watch this trailer over and over again until we finally find ourselves glued to a TV or a screen theater on January 1.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/sherlock-miss-me", "http://deadline.com/2015/10/sherlock-china-theatrical-release-1201589580/", "https://twitter.com/BBCOne/status/657913473737871360", "https://twitter.com/BBCOne/status/657909741440626688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://youtu.be/nk86jSLufLs", "https://twitter.com/BBCOne/status/657911790509105152", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nk86jSLufLs", "https://twitter.com/BBCOne/status/657926160026873856", "http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/25/93547dd1-62e5-4375-8b6e-2035f46e19d8/resize/570xauto/0e7b4b613b68a4c260fdd192ef550be7/sherlockcard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T19:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:09:00.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
