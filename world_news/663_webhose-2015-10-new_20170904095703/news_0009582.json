Everything from augmented reality glasses to smartwatches are making it seem as though “Star Trek” and “Back to the Future” might not have been as out-there as we previously believed.\nGoogle Glass has already seen a beta generation tested among thousands of users. While that device was retired, it looks as though the company hasn’t given up on augmented reality glasses and that it is more than likely working on a new generation of devices that may even be able to display 3D holograms for the wearer.\nSimilarly, recent rumors swirling around Amazon have indicated that the online marketplace that has always had a love for cool tech, may now be working on its own augmented reality glasses to enhance the online experience of its shoppers and, quite certainly, to provide an entirely new way to shop at its marketplace. As mentioned by Julie Campbell, mobile technology reporter, “Amazon is getting into this augmented reality smartglasses industry at a time that it is still in its early infancy…” but then alludes to a product that might be already in early stages of saturation, “There are even those that have already come and gone”.\nAddiction to smartphones and similar gadgets is already spreading across the country and around the globe as has been shown by the explosive growth of the backup external battery charger market . People simply can’t live without having their devices powered up and usable on any given day. With wearables evolving at a staggering rate, this trend of tech dependence and addiction is only likely to continue.\nMoreover, it is also likely to completely change the face of marketing. Digital and mobile is already overtaking marketing strongholds such as newspapers and even television. As geolocation technology – with geo-targeting and geo-fencing – become increasingly commonplace, combining those techniques with upcoming sci-fi-like wearable technology such as smartglasses will open up a massive number of possibilities within this advertising revolution.\nMajor players and startups alike are banking on the popularity of smartwatches, augmented reality glasses and devices that haven’t yet moved beyond the prototype stage (such as tech that is actually implanted in the body). At this speed, the cool tech of the future will soon be the top gadgets of today.\nContact Information:\nMogix Accessories\nwww.mogixaccessories.com\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
