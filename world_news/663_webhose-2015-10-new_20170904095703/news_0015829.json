Forward redemptions as a percentage of SS&C GlobeOp's assets under administration on the SS&C GlobeOp platform have trended significantly lower since reaching a high of 19.27% in November 2008. The next publication date is November 20, 2015. \nPublished on the 15th business day of the month, the SS&C GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator presents a timely and accurate view of the redemption pipeline for investors in hedge funds on the SS&C GlobeOp administration platform. Movements in the Indicator reflect investor confidence in their allocations to hedge funds. Indicator data is based on actual investor redemption notifications received. Unlike subscriptions, redemption notifications are typically received 30-90 days in advance of the redemption date. Investors may, and sometimes do, cancel redemption notices. In addition, the establishment and enforcement of redemption notices may vary from fund to fund. \nSS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Performance Index Base 100 points on 31 December 2005 Flash estimate (current month) -1.56%* Year-to-date (YTD) 4.53%* Last 12 month (LTM) 5.32%* Life to date (LTD) 118.06%* *All numbers reported above are gross \nSS&C GlobeOp Capital Movement Index Base 100 points on 31 December 2005 All time high 150.77 in September 2013 All time low 99.67 in January 2006 12-month high 149.53 in December 2014 12-month low 144.51 in July 2015 Largest monthly change - 15.21 in January 2009 \nSS&C GlobeOp Forward Redemption Indicator All time high 19.27% in November 2008 All time low 1.85% in January 2012 12-month high 5.87% in December 2014 12-month low 2.08% in July 2015 Largest monthly change 9.60% in November 2008 \nAbout the SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund IndexÂ® \nThe SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Index (the Index) is a family of indices published by SS&C GlobeOp.
