But just how much can you trust those reviews? \nA new lawsuit in which Amazon accuses more than 1,000 people of offering to post bogus glowing write-ups for as little as $5 apiece might give you pause. \nThe case, filed in Washington state court Friday by the nation’s biggest online retailer, casts light on what appears to be a burgeoning practice: the commissioning of paid, fake reviews that masquerade as testimonials from ordinary people. \nFake reviews are nothing new to online retailing, and Amazon is far from the only big company affected. Yelp’s restaurant reviews and Trip-Advisor’s hotel ratings long have been a target of critics who claim that merchants can easily post positive reviews of their own businesses. \nAmazon’s legal counteroffensive, however, appears to be one of the most- aggressive attempts yet by a major U.S. e-commerce company to fight back. \nIts lawsuit alleges that individuals would write five-star reviews about products they never even tried, and plotted with product makers to subvert Amazon safeguards that are meant to bolster confidence in the website’s reviews. \n“Suing the reviewers is a way to discourage them from doing it again,” said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. “They’re trying to make a statement that you can rely on the integrity of the reviews on the site.” \nThere are powerful incentives to plant fraudulent reviews. \nAbout 45 percent of consumers consider product reviews when weighing an online purchase, according to Forrester Research. Two-thirds of shoppers trust consumer opinions online, according to research by Nielsen. \nFor small businesses, it can be more economical to pay for positive reviews than to buy advertising.
