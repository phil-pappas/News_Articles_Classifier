Sales rebounded briefly in 2014, reflecting purchases by businesses as Microsoft phased out support for its aging Windows XP software.\nBut conditions have softened again in 2015, which some analysts have linked partly to customers waiting for Windows 10 and Skylake, the sixth generation of Intel Corp.'s Core processor family that is expected to boost performance and reduce power consumption.\nBoth firms said Thursday that many users opted to upgrade existing PCs with the Windows launch rather than purchase new hardware. Gartner added that it expects the Windows 10 rollout to bolster holiday sales, while IDC said the new software and chips \"may represent the most compelling reason we've had in years for consumers to upgrade their PCs.\"\n\"Whether this compulsion translates into actual sales remains to be seen,\" IDC researcher Linn Huang said.\nCompanies also struggled to limit price swings as shifting currency exchange rates inhibited PC shipments in the quarter, according to IDC. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar against local currencies made PCs pricier in the global market, leading to double-digit declines in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan and Latin America.\nWorld-wide, Lenovo was the top shipper, with at least 20% of the market, followed by H-P, Dell Inc., Apple Inc. and Acer Inc., according to both firms. Lenovo showed strong growth in the U.S., with market share there rising more than 20%, offsetting weakness in Europe and Japan, the firms said.\nOverall in the U.S., both firms said, H-P held the top spot with about 28% of the market, followed by Dell, Apple and Lenovo. IDC had Toshiba Corp. fifth in the U.S., while Gartner had Asustek Computer Inc. in that spot.\nWrite to Anne Steele at anne.steele@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"Apple, Inc.\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n 08, 2015 17:55 ET (21:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:23:49.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
