There's a new app that can come to your rescue. 'NearGroup' allows Android and iPhone users to connect with their neighbours without giving up their mobile number. \nHaving a three-month old Facebook account is mandatory to download the app. This way the app ensures that only verified users connect on NearGroup. The user's Facebook account also needs to have at least 50 friends in their list. Currently, it is available only for Delhi and NCR residents. \n\"NearGroup is India's 1st mobile-app where users can group-chat with verified neighbours. All they have to do is select their locality and start chatting with neighbours. We can make India a better place by allowing neighbours to help, exercise, volunteer, carpool and hangout with each other,\" NearGroup founder Prashant Pitti told Businesstoday.in. \nPitti claims the app has notched over 3,500 downloads within a week of its launch. \nThough the user needs to sign in via his or her Facebook account, the details of the account are not shared on the app. \n\"We wish to keep only genuine-users for good-quality of discussion on NearGroup. Hence, we have made Facebook login a mandatory feature. Our team manually checks each user's Facebook profile before approving him/her to be part of NearGroup. Anything objectionable on their Facebook-profile (any graphical-content, any hatred-post, non genuine profile-picture, random tagging, objectionable language, etc) can be one of the few reasons for their non-approval,\" Pitti, an IIT-Madras graduate, said. \nFrom security reasons, users are allowed to change their location only after a period of three months. Any person getting 10-15 spams is blocked by the app. \nGoogle Play store has given a user rating of 4.2 to the NearGroup app.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:14:37.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
