That showed an increase of 15% at constant currencies, beating analysts expectations of a non-IFRS operating profit of €1.5 billion for the quarter, according to a recent poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal.\nRevenue rose by 17% to €4.98 billion, from €4.25 billion last year, helped by new cloud subscriptions.\nSAP Chief Executive Bill McDermott has over the past year accelerated the company's move away from on-premise software to Internet cloud based offerings through a series of acquisitions. The company last year purchased for $8.2 billion U.S.-based Concur Technologies, a cloud expense management software provider, making SAP the second-largest enterprise cloud-service provider by revenue behind Salesforce.com Inc.\nSAP is slated to report full results for the third quarter on Oct. 20.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042\n 12, 2015 22:15 ET (02:15 ", "external_links": ["http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:12:57.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
