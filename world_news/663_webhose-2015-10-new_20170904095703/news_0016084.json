This is thanks to the efforts and insights of the renowned design firm Ammunition, the studio that was also behind the Polaroid Zip instant photoprinter and Polaroid Cube and Polaroid Cube+ lifestyle action cameras. With the Polaroid Snap, Ammunition created a sense of continuity between classic Polaroid cameras and current Polaroid products such as the Polaroid Zip and Polaroid Cube .

The ZINK-enabled Printer uses heat to activate and colorize cyan, yellow and magenta dye crystals embedded in the paper. The result is full-color, high quality, long-lasting and smudge-proof images without ink cartridges, ribbons or toner. \nThe 2X3\" photo prints in just under a minute so consumers can instantly share the photo with their friends and family.
