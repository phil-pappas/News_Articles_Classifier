A similar system was installed in Allen Fieldhouse in 2014. \n\"When our customers head out to the stadium or fieldhouse to cheer on the Jayhawks, we want them to have a great network experience throughout the game no matter what they're doing - making a call, sharing pictures on social media, downloading apps or surfing the Internet,\" said Nancy Garvey, Vice President/General Manager AT&T Greater Midwest. \"We're continuing to invest in our wireless network on KU's campus to help customers stay connected from the hardwood to the gridiron.\" \nBut it's not just sports fans who will benefit from AT&T wireless upgrades. AT&T plans to further improve connectivity at KU by installing additional DAS throughout the campus. The wireless build out which started in 2013 and continues will eventually cover academic buildings and residence halls on the KU campus and additional KU Athletics facilities, including Hoglund Ballpark, Anschutz Pavilion and the Horejsi Family Athletics Center, as well as buildings on KU's West Campus, such as the Lied Center. The AT&T DAS is open to other wireless companies, providing improved coverage to all students, faculty, staff and visitors if their provider elects to join the DAS network. \nThe network upgrade consists of strategically placed antennas that distribute AT&T's wireless network coverage throughout each respective venue. It can provide stronger, more consistent wireless coverage to customers, so they don't have to worry about their service getting stuck in a traffic jam of other people's calls, texts and posts. \nAT&T constantly invests in its network to give customers the high-quality services they need to stay connected. AT&T is also adding the latest network technology, such as small cells, to ensure customers have wireless service where they need it most. \nDAS technology helps improve customers' wireless service by shortening the distance a request must travel. It's also expected to help improve call reliability and mobile Internet access to help customers make the most of their AT&T devices . \n\"KU students, faculty and staff are using their mobile devices more than ever in their academic and personal lives. Our focus is on providing our customers with the ability to work, study and communicate wherever and whenever they want, because today's world is about flexibility and creating new ideas when inspiration strikes. Partnering with AT&T on this multi-million dollar project has greatly expanded wireless capabilities on campus at no cost to KU,\" said Bob Lim, KU chief information officer. \nThese investments help to ensure that Kansas residents get the best possible experience over the AT&T network, whether at home, at work or on the go. AT&T's network has the nation's strongest LTE signal,** and AT&T also has the nation's most reliable LTE network.*** \nOver the past six years (2009-2014), AT&T invested more than $140 billion including investments in its wireless and wireline networks, acquisitions of wireless spectrum and operations. Since 2009, AT&T has invested more in the United States than any other public company. In a September 2014 report, the Progressive Policy Institute ranked AT&T No. 1 on its list of U.S. \"Investment Heroes.\" \nFor more information about AT&T's coverage in Kansas or anywhere in the U.S., visit the AT&T Coverage Viewer .
