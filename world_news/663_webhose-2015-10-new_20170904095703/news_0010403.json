Shah has also been booked for his \"chara chor\" (fodder thief) barb against Prasad.\nPrasad was also locked in a slugest with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the former's 'Hindus also eat beef' remark.\nAt a poll rally in Bihar yesterday, Modi trashed Prasad's explanation that he had made the remark--that had triggered a controversy-- under the influence of \"shaitan\" (devil).\n\"I wonder the devil got only his (Lalu) body to enter. I want to know how the shaitan got the address (of Lalu). The devil got no other body in entire Bihar, India and the whole world except that of his. And he also welcomed the devil as if some relative has come,\" Modi said.\nIn a sharp retort today, Prasad called Modi a \"Brahma Pishach\" (super demon).\"If I am a 'shaitan', he is a 'Brahma Pishach' (powerful demon spirit as described in ancient Hindu texts),\" he said.\nDuring poll rallies, Modi described Prasad's RJD as a party signifying \"Rojana Jungle Raj Ka Dar\" and its ally JD(U) \"Janata ka Daman aur Utpidan (Oppression and Suppression of People)\".\nHitting back, JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar said BJP means 'Badka Jhutha Party' (party of big liars) and 'Bhartiya Jumla (platitude) Party'.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:50:47.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
