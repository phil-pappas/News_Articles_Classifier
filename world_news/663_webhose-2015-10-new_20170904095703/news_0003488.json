Pocket built and delivered a 500-cell site CDMA cellular network that grew to 385,000 subscribers before being sold in 2010 to Cricket Communications (now owned by AT&T). In 2008, Houdinisoft created the \"flashing\" industry using a SaaS model to unlock and reprovision CDMA devices allowing them to operate on a different network. Since inception, the company has converted three million devices for more than 20 North American CDMA MNOs.
