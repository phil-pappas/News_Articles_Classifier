The publications said Monday their sites were attacked after they ran stories about university students being forced to go to a public prayer attended by President Alexander Lukashenko and his 12-year-old son. \nMost Belarusian media are under either direct or indirect government control. \nBelarusians go to the polls this Sunday to election their president. Authoritarian Lukashenko has been in office since 1994 and is widely expected to be re-elected. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
