We can all do better to educate and inform those considering IVF on the risks of a multiple birth and what options are available to them. And we know that lack of insurance coverage for this medical procedure can affect their decision making.” The studies show that targeted education regarding risks of multiple gestation and benefits of eSET through multiple channels, earlier discussions on transfer order, and emphasizing the potential health risks to offspring are key areas of opportunity to influence a patient’s acceptance of single embryo transfer (SET). In addition the study evaluated demographics and found patients living in the Midwest may be least likely to have eSET and may benefit most from increased education. Despite the data that demonstrates multiple pregnancy rates are associated with more adverse health outcomes to infants along with increased risk of pregnancy and birth complications(1), the practice of eSET is still underutilized. Women who are electing single embryo transfer represent less than 9% of all IVF cycles.(2) In addition there is also significant economic burden, recent published data has shown the healthcare costs (up to one year post birth) of twins to be 4 times, and triplets 18 times, more than the costs of a singleton birth. “Our company puts the patient at the center of everything we do,” said Gina Bartasi, Chief Executive Officer, “therefore, we embrace these opportunities to better understand the patient perspective so that we can help provide relevant and meaningful programs to support patients undergoing IVF.” The results are based on a nationwide IVF patient survey that was conducted by RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association and sponsored by Progyny. Five abstract presentations will be presented by University of Iowa Hospitals who completed all the analysis.
