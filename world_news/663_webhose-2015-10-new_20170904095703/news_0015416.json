Liberals and Clinton supporters are jubilant. Mainstream outlets also confidently declared Clinton the winner.\n“As a matter of pure political theater, yesterday’s Benghazi committee hearing was a victory for Hillary Clinton and an overwhelming defeat for House Republicans,” write NBC’s Chuck Todd and Mark Murray . “The hearing was, in a word, boring. And that’s exactly what Clinton wanted,” Chris Cillizza declared .\nBut what about conservative media? In such a politicized setting, with many liberals having already absolved Clinton of any wrongdoing in the September 11, 2012, attacks that killed four Americans in Libya, and many conservatives having already deemed her guilty of something , does that divide translate into the media response? Put another way, are declarations of Clinton victory another evidence of press bias?\nMaybe not.", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/hillary-clinton-clears-october-hurdles-n449911", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/22/hillary-clinton-triumphed-at-the-benghazi-committee-by-not-losing-her-cool/"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:45:32.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
