The latest Light ID Solution will also make a debut in the region along with the other products at the Panasonic booth. The technology lets users retrieve information from LED lighting and signage panels through a high speed visible light communication.\n\nAccording to Yasuo Yamasaki â€œ Director, System Solutions and Communications Division, PMMAF, \"Panasonic's smart solutions will be the revolutionary innovations for businesses. We have crafted these concepts with diligence in order to address queries of maximum industry verticals, while keeping in mind the pace at which industry trends are moving. This year at GITEX, our products will excel in terms of design, simplified user interface, cost effectiveness, easy maintenance and effective outcomes. \" \n\nPanasonic has developed the Light ID Solution technology using an LED as the light source for smartphones to read the optical ID signals containing various kinds of information. In this mechanism, ID is transmitted from LED light source (digital signage or LED illumination) and corresponding content is then downloaded from the server. This technology boasts the key advantage of easier detection unlike image reading methods such as QR codes or AR markers. It has immediate recognition ability when a smartphone camera is pointed towards an LED light source. With a higher transmission rate, the Light ID enables decoding of information at a rate surpassing that of smartphone video recording.\n\nPatricia Nazarian, Business Development Manager, PMMAF, adds, \"The latest Light ID Solution only requires users to download an app onto their smartphones. It then uses the phone's image sensor (camera) to receive light id and read it using the app. This solution also supports transmission rates that are couple of hundred times higher. The signal source is a flashing white LED of several thousand hertz and it can be installed in digital signage as a backlight as well as spotlights for purposes like details of art in museums and products in stores.\"\n\n\"Panasonic has specifically developed the Light ID Solution for retail stores, museums, tourist hubs, malls, etc. It can be used to supplement descriptions of goods in stores and as a solution for obtaining information from signs that use LED light source. This new technology is several times faster than previous systems and can capture more detailed information and receive multilingual explanations from digital signage with more efficiency. \" Patricia informs.\n\nFor a live demo, please visit the Panasonic's GITEX Booth - A3-5 at Hall 3, Dubai World Trade Centre. \n\nAbout Panasonic \nPanasonic Corporation is a worldwide leader in the development and engineering of electronic technologies and solutions for customers in residential, non-residential, mobility and personal applications.
