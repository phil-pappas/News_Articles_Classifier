But what if apart from having fun in the ocean you could contribute to the cause of decreasing pollution in the oceans? Wouldn’t it be great? Doing something good and that too while having a good time? Well UC Riverside is giving you the chance to do just that. An electrical engineer professor Mihri Ozkan along with her husband and fellow electrical engineering professor Cengiz Ozkan, with Ph.D. students Daisy Patino and Hamed Bay have designed ‘The Sponge Suit bikini’ which absorbs pollutants from the ocean as its wearer swims around in the sea. The material used for the purpose is called Sponge. It is designed for cleaning up oil and chemical spills and desalinating water. It is a water-repelling and highly porous carbon material that is light and flexible. It absorbs everything except water, and can absorb up to 25 times its own weight, depending on the density of the material absorbed. The team disclosed in a written statement: “The form of the Sponge Suit is inspired by the super-porous, mesh-like structure of the Sponge material. The final form of the 3D print shell was obtained through the various iterations of the same undulating form. The filler amount and the allocation were identified by creating several design alternatives, considering the form and the ergonomics of the human body, while pushing the limits in translucent swimwear design.” Related Posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:53:12.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
