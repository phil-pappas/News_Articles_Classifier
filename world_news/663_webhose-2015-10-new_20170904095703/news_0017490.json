(JASDAQ:6769, “THine”), the global leader in high-speed serial interface and provider of mixed-signal LSI today announced its collaboration with Novatek Microelectronics Corp. (Taiwan Stock Exchange:3034, “Novatek”) in high-definition camera solution for various applications including drive recorder markets by licensing its V-by-One ® HS technology. THine, collaborating with Novatek, delivers values of smarter interface performance and less system costs. \nV-by-One ® HS technology has been developed by THine to make internal display interfaces smarter and accepted as de facto standard for 4K televisions and many displays with high definition. Today wide applications, such as consumer electronics, in-vehicle infotainment, surveillance cameras, robotics, document processing, and amusement, enjoy its value of fewer cables and costs with high-speed performance. \nDrive recorders also require avoiding the increase of cables between cameras and processors while markets demand higher-definition images. Under such situation, THine has licensed its V-by-One ® HS technology to Novatek with valuable camera SoC and market shares to solve these problems. Camera systems can adopt the combination of THine’s V-by-One ® HS products at camera sensors and Novatek’s application processors with THine’s V-by-One ® HS receiver IPs, to reduce the number of cables drastically, for instance, up to just one pair for full-HD pictures with using brand-new THCV231. This combination enables to reduce total costs of the camera systems and parts counts. \n“THine’s V-by-One ® HS is widely penetrated as an essential high-speed interface for high-definition images such as 4K,” commented Novatek, “The collaboration between THine and Novatek will deliver greater system solution that never seen to drive recorder markets.” \n“Novatek, the leader of valuable SoC, is an important licensee of V-by-One ® HS and, through the collaboration, wider potential customers are expected to enjoy V-by-One ® HS’s real values and obtain more advantages of their camera systems,” said Kazutaka Nogami, THine’s President and CEO. “THine will continuously collaborate with valuable partners such as Novatek, and deliver the value of V-by-One ® HS to global customers.” \nKey benefits of V-by-One ® HS High transmission quality with high performance equalizer High data transmission quality solving cable skew problems with high speed Serializer / Deserializer using clock data recovery technology Lower electro-magnetic interference with clock embedded transmission, no reference clock at receiver Reduction of total cost and board space by optimizing cables and connectors Seamless transition to V-by-One ® HS minimizing change of device input/output and peripheral design Lower energy consumption with variable transmission speed: 600 Mbps to 4.0 Gbps \nAbout Novatek Microelectronics Corp. \nNovatek Microelectronics Corp. is a world-class leader in developing and delivering innovative flat-panel display driver ICs and SoC solution and services based on its advanced technologies. Headquartered in Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, Taiwan, Novatek is Taiwan's second largest fabless chip design company traded on Taiwan Stock Exchange market with the stock code: 3034.
