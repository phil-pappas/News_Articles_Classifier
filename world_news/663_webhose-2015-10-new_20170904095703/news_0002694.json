Deep Learning features the development of complex, multi-layered non-linear algorithms based on neural networks to achieve breakthroughs in object, facial, image and speech recognition, as well as machine translation, big data insights and natural language processing. The impact of deep learning development affects nearly every industry including security, digital communication, retail, finance and applications surrounding IoT (the Internet of Things).\nAMAX’s Deep Learning Engines are the most dominant Deep Learning platforms on the market, trusted by today’s leading researchers and developers as the key to Machine Learning breakthroughs. The product line features both workstations and high-performance servers specifically designed and developed to fast track Deep Learning algorithm development. Powered by NVIDIA Titan X GPUs, they deliver up to 28 TFlops of single precision computing in the workstation and up to 56 TFlops in the 4U rackmountable server platform. All systems come preloaded with standard Ubuntu 14.04 as well as Caffe, Torch, Theano, BIDMach, cuDNN v2, NVIDIA-qualified driver, NVIDIA® CUDA® Toolkit 7.5, as well as NVIDIA DIGITS software, a powerful design, training and visualization tool for building neural networks for image classification. AMAX also provides an option for integrating NVIDIA Tesla K40 and K80 GPUs in its Deep Learning Engines.\nSample applications which can massively benefit from the superior performance of AMAX’s Deep Learning Engines include but are not limited to Image Recognition, Facial Recognition, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Action Recognition, Machine Translation, Neural Network Architecture Development, Bioinformatics, Big Data Insights and IoT Sensor Processing.\n“Deep Learning is a pivotal field of data science that will change the way we relate to the world and the way the world will intuitively relate to us,” said Julia Shih, VP, AMAX. “Since programming and training machines is a compute-intensive process, we developed the most powerful Deep Learning engines available to shorten the machine learning curve and give programmers a fast track to breakthroughs. What would otherwise require days of processing can now be done in hours.”\nAMAX’s Deep Learning Engine workstation will be showcased in Booth #J16 at IP Expo. AMAX will also showcase Facebook-inspired OCP (Open Compute) platforms—highly-efficient and modular building blocks for data center and cloud infrastructure, including OpenStack, Hadoop, Ceph Storage and CPU-intensive or GPU-based High Performance Computing applications.\nTo learn more about AMAX Deep Learning Engines, OCP Solutions or its full menu of professional services for server-to-reack level data center deployments or OEM manufacturing, please visit AMAX booth #J16 at IP EXPO 2015, or visit http://www.amax.com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13004764.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13004764.htm"], "published": "2015-10-07T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:40:20.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
