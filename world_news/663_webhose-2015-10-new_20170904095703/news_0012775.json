This led him to speculate that first-born children enjoyed a special level of attention from their parents that allowed them to thrive intellectually. Half a century later Alfred Adler, an Austrian psychologist, made a similar argument relating to personality. First-born children, he thought, were more conscientious, while the later-born were more extrovert and emotionally stable. Many subsequent studies have explored these ideas, but their findings have been equivocal—some supporting and some rejecting them. Now a team led by Stefan Schmukle of the University of Leipzig, in Germany, has collected the most comprehensive evidence on the matter yet. Its conclusion, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is that Adler was wrong, but Galton may have been right.\nThe main problem with previous studies is that they have been, in several ways, too small. This would be true even if the statistics needed to analyse them were simple, but they are not. Distinguishing birth-order effects from those caused by family size complicates matters, meaning still bigger samples must be analysed to obtain meaningful results. And one particular approach often used, interviewing individual family members about themselves and their siblings, has generally been restricted (for reasons of cost) to one interview per family, with researchers using these lone interviews to collect all the information they need. Not only does this restrict the sample size, it also introduces an obvious source of bias.\nIn this section Stellar work Nuclear proliferation Who’s the number one son?

These data sets, though collected for other purposes, included personality and intelligence tests run on 20,186 people at different stages of their lives. The American tests were on those aged between 29 and 35. The British tests were conducted on 50-year-olds. The German tests ran the whole span of adult life, from 18 to 98.\nDr Schmukle and his colleagues knew that the large numbers involved meant they stood a good chance of detecting even quite small birth-order effects on personality or intelligence, if they existed. They also knew that, by working with surveys from three countries, and with such a wide range of ages, they would diversify the data and iron out confounding variables.\nBirth order, they found, had no effect on personality: first-borns were no more, nor less, likely than their younger sibs to be conscientious, extrovert or neurotic. But it did affect intelligence. In a family with two children, the first child was more intelligent than the second 60% of the time, rather than the 50% that would be expected by chance. On average, this translated to a difference of 1.5 IQ points between first and second siblings. That figure agrees with the consensus from previous studies, and thus looks confirmed.\nIt is, nevertheless, quite a small difference—and whether it is enough to account for Galton’s original observation is moot. In any event, it is clearly not deterministic. Galton was the youngest of nine.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20151024_STP003_0.jpg", "http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/10/14/1506451112"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:56:39.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
