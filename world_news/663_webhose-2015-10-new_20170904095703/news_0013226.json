Sadly, few schools still effectively use data as a pathway for solutions to complex learning challenges in the classroom,” said Alvin Crawford, CEO of KDS. “Using Data for Meaningful Classroom Change is a cost–effective and scalable solution to help educators identify opportunities for growth and implement changes in their practice that can lead to personalized learning.”\n“Building data literacy gives educators the confidence and hands-on training that are imperative to improve the quality of their instruction,” said Diana Nunnaley, Director of TERC’s Using Data Initiative. “This comprehensive course provides the framework that school districts need to develop a shared understanding of their students' data, which can lead to dramatic shifts in the school's culture and overall performance.”\nAbout Knowledge Delivery Systems\nKnowledge Delivery Systems (KDS) is the leading provider of research-based, blended-model strategic professional development solutions for districts, schools, and teachers.
