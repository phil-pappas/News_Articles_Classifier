This collaboration offers a number of benefits to today's leading enterprises by combining real-time graph processing with the capabilities of IBM hardware to scale up and out like never before. \nAs the world's leading graph database, Neo4j helps business leaders not only manage larger volumes of data and generate insights from their data relationships, but also act on those insights in real time. However, applying those insights in real time at the point of touch requires the ability to support extremely high transaction capacities with massive volumes of data at scale. \nEnter Neo4j on POWER8, a collaboration between Neo4j and IBM engineering to provide the world's most scalable graph database platform capable of storing and processing graphs of extremely large size all in-memory -- shattering all previous real-time scalability limits. \nOnly IBM Power Systems can provide up to 56 terabytes of extended memory space with CAPI flash architecture on a single machine, accommodating graphs of never-before-seen size and scale. \nIBM Power Systems built with POWER8 processors are optimized for a broad range of data workloads, and are extremely well suited for processing graph data. IBM Power Systems deliver cost-effective, high-performing and agile IT infrastructure so enterprises can leverage the most advantage from their diverse data sources. \nWith today's release, enterprises can now overcome their big data challenges both with Neo4j to extract meaningful, real-time insights from data relationships, and with POWER8 that allows them to scale their graphs to massive proportions. \nExamples of enterprise applications that would most benefit from Neo4j on POWER8 include: Master datasets connecting organizational, customer and product data together with user activity, all inside a single graph Inventory or supply chain management data for global enterprise manufacturers Detecting sophisticated fraud across billions of international real-time transactions, whether for insurance, banking or e-commerce Monitoring national or international IT networks for outages, dependencies and impact analysis IoT applications to manage the vast number of direct and indirect connections between devices, users, locations and transactions \nNeo4j officially supports Linux on IBM Power Systems beginning with Neo4j 2.3 , which is generally available starting today. Additionally, Neo Technology and IBM are now accepting beta test participation for POWER8 with CAPI Flash, which will begin in Q4 2015.
