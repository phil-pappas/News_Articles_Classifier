However, there was no passengers or crew on board as an engineer conducted routine landing checks before the plane was scheduled to fly from Singapore to Hong Kong, airline officials said.\nThe airline said in a statement that the nose gear of an Airbus A330-300 “retracted while the aircraft was undergoing a landing gear system check.”\n“There were no passengers or crew on board when the incident happened. One engineer, who was on board, was not injured. Singapore Airlines will be cooperating fully with the authorities in their investigations,” the statement added.\nIt said the damage to the aircraft would be assessed after it is removed from the gate.\nThe collapsed plane had been in service for more than six years, according to records. Its maiden flight was in April 2009.\nThe plane had been due to serve flight SQ890, scheduled to depart for Hong Kong from Singapore’s Changi Airport at 7:35 a.m. It had arrived from Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport early in the morning.\nAnother plane was used for the flight to Hong Kong, taking off more than 40 minutes after the scheduled departure time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:28:16.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
