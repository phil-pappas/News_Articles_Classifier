Fast services, and BT in the UK which is in the final stages of trials.\nMr Cross said in a statement, “We are very excited about the potential that G. Fast offers — it has the potential to give us tremendous flexibility in delivering very fast speeds to end-users in a wide range of different environments.\n“This is fantastic news for our end-users as G.fast can deliver exciting new services such as symmetrical speeds which will offer new possibilities for both residential and commercial end-users. We look forward to working alongside our global peers to further develop our understanding of this great technology.”\nNBN has been using equipment from Alcatel-Lucent during the trials, specifically, the 7368 Intelligent Service Access Manager (ISAM) Optical Network Terminals, 7368 ISAM CPE with integrated reverse power, and 5520 Access Management System.\nSean O’Halloran, President and Managing Director, Alcatel-Lucent Oceania said his company’s share NBN’s ethos that no one technology fits all.\n“This trial represents a growing momentum as more service providers recognise the potential of G.fast,” he said.\nNBN said retail service providers (RSPs) will begin testing G.fast capabilities next year with commercially available services expected to arrive in 2017.\nThe G.fast trial is another component of the Coalition’s multi-technology approach and shadow communications minister Jason Clare last week said that greater deployment of the technology that relies on fibre being pushed closer to premises highlights why Labor’s fibre-focused NBN strategy was right all along.\nMr Clare has said that Labor will dismantle the fibre-to-the-node component of the network if it wins the next federal election and Labor’s shadow parliamentary secretary assisting with digital innovation and start-ups Ed Husic told The Australian that fibre has to be the priority when it comes to connecting Australian households.\n“Because that’s the ultimate hands down best technical solution that will deliver a much stronger platform than what’s on offer at the moment,” he said.\nWhile he acknowledged that the HFC network will be important, he warned that they have a limited footprint.\n“You might be able to get more out of it, but it’s restricted to two major capital cities. It isn’t the answer for the rest of the country. If we gain office we’ll obviously do a stocktake and have a clear map of where they’re actually at.”\n“The lesson we’ve learned from when the Coalition was in opposition, they made all sorts of promises to make it faster and cheaper. And they’ve failed on both those counts,” Mr Husic added.\nThe news comes as NBN chief executive Bill Morrow revealed last night the company bought 1800 kilometres of new copper to be rolled out in fibre-to-the-node deployments, worth $14 million.\n“We don’t have enough data to quantify, but where we have had to do remediation, it’s where seals around joints are defective or there has not been enough copper in a sheath to serve properties,” Morrow said.\n“There is also new copper to the node from the pillar. Ideally, we would place the pillars next to the nodes, but in some cases we’ve had to place it a couple of houses down.\n“That’s new copper between two pieces of furniture, and that’s a part of the build.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:35:32.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
