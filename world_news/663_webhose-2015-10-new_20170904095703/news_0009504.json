Kolo Medical will showcase the first three transducers available to ultrasound manufacturers using SiliconWave transducer technology, designed to deliver an unprecedented level of performance in the areas of ultra-high resolution imaging at the IUS meeting (Booth #11). Kolo Medical is dedicated to providing a full suite of capacitive microfabricated ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) for medical ultrasound imaging by leveraging advanced semiconductor technology and the most advanced CMUT technology.  Compatible with existing and next generation ultrasound systems, the proprietary SiliconWave transducer technology delivers an unprecedented level of performance in the area of ultra-high resolution and ultra-wide bandwidth imaging for such applications as thyroid, breast, small-parts, muscular-skeleton, and vascular. \nKolo Medical has been collaborating with Verasonics, Inc., the leader in research ultrasound, to refine the final design and performance of one of Kolo Medical's transducers.   According to Lauren Pflugrath , CEO and President of Kirkland, Washington -based Verasonics, \"CMUT technology has the potential to set a new standard for transducer performance.\"\nAt the IUS Meeting, Kolo Medical will show the SiliconWave technology and its results in an oral presentation in the CMUT Design Session at 1:00PM on October 22, 2015 .\n\"During the last few decades, every aspect of medical ultrasound systems has been revolutionized by advances in semiconductor technology with the sole exception of the ultrasound transducer,\" said Dr. Yongli Huang , President of Kolo Medical. \"Kolo Medical's proprietary CMUT technology eliminates the drawbacks associated with the PZT technology, and our ultra-high performance SiliconWave probes are truly moving ultrasound imaging into the silicon age.\"\nTraditional ultrasound transducers have been developed from a ceramic material known as PZT. The production of PZT transducers relies on outdated machine-shop manufacturing methods. The hand-built process is complex, creating inefficiencies in many critical areas, i.e. poor yield and uniformity. The intrinsic shortcomings of PZT technology include low bandwidth and heat production, which in turn, impose technological limits to further improvements especially as the industry moves towards high-frequency and 3D/4D imaging. \nThe CMUTs resemble tiny silicon drums, each smaller than the width of a human hair, that are fabricated on a silicon wafer and incorporated into the transducer giving superior acoustic response that forms the basis for better medical images.  Micromachined transducer systems such as CMUTs overcome the fabrication limitations of bulk piezoelectric-based transducers. High-frequency, high-resolution transducers are potentially easier to fabricate with CMUT technology, which could make ultrasound available for a wider range of applications.  \nThe development of CMUT technology was initiated many years ago by a team at Stanford University that included the Kolo Medical founders.  As the result of Kolo's years of independent research and development, the SiliconWave transducers of novel designs overcome many initial CMUT limitations, such as in sensitivity. Kolo's SiliconWave transducers are fabricated in a commercial MEMS foundry, leveraging advanced semiconductor fabrication technology such as photolithography and thin-film deposition and etching. With the ability to control the vertical geometries of the transducer, such as thin-film thickness, with nanometer accuracy, Kolo attains sub-micrometer lateral resolution with ease.  Combining the power of innovative designs and superb fabrication capabilities, the SiliconWave CMUT transducers are proven to reach unprecedented yield, uniformity, and performance standards.\nAbout Kolo Medical\nKolo Medical is the world leader in the next generation of semiconductor ultrasound transducer technology.
