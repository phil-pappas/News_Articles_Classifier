ACCU-Curve series thermistors are available in a wide range of resistance values, with tight tolerances of +/- 0.2 degrees C between 0 degrees C and 70 degrees C and fast thermal response times. \nProviding designers with faster, less-expensive alternatives to RTD probes and thermocouples --- without compromising on accuracy -- ACCU-Curve series devices deliver the tight tolerances required for temperature measurement in critical medical instrumentation, and they can be potted in a variety of housings for temperature compensation circuits in industrial and automotive applications. \nOffering diameters of 2.4 mm and 32 AWG tinned-copper leads, the epoxy-coated thermistors are available in four resistance values at 25 degrees C -- 2.252 k ohm, 3.0 k ohm, 5.0 k ohm, and 10 k ohm -- with a dissipation constant of 1 mW/ degrees C and thermal time constant of 10 s. \nThe devices are available direct or through distributors such as Digi-Key and Mouser. Samples and production quantities of the thermistors are available now, with factory lead times of 12 weeks. \nFor more information or to request a sample, visit www.ametherm.com . Or call 800-808-2434 (toll free in the United States) or 775-884-2434 from outside the U.S. and Canada. \nAbout Ametherm Ametherm, headquartered in Carson City, Nevada, was founded in 1994 and specializes in inrush current limiting power thermistors for circuit protection in the power market industry. Ametherm's devices are some of the highest rated in the industry and provide the widest range of inrush current protection available.
