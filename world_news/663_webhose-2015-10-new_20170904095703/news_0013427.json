And Bill Gates may no longer be the richest person in the world. \nIt depends who you ask, though: Bloomberg and Forbes maintain rival \"richest people in the world\" trackers. \nBezos was rewarded for Amazon's ( AMZN , Tech30 ) second consecutive quarter of surprise profits . The stock soared 10% and is trading at an all-time high. He is now the fifth-richest person in the world, according to both lists. \nThe surge bumped Bezos' overall wealth by almost $5 billion overnight. He's now worth more than $55 billion. \nYou'd think that Bill Gates would have had a big boost too. Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) shares are at a 15-year high after the company wowed investors with surprisingly strong cloud sales . He's no longer Microsoft's biggest individual shareholder (No. 35 on the list, Steve Ballmer, is), but Gates still holds a lot of Microsoft stock. \nYet Zara founder Amancio Ortega overtook Gates, according to the Forbes list. Shares of Zara parent company Inditex are surging, sending Ortega's wealth up more than $2 billion over the past day. Meanwhile, Gates' value actually fell by $1 billion. \nGates is still No. 1 on the Bloomberg list. \nThe shuffling of the billionaires leaves the Koch brothers behind. The 51-year-old Bezos leapfrogged over the brothers on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:24:05.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
