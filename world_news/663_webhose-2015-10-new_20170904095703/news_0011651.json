It is done during a real time MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan that clearly shows suspicious sites. When done by an expert radiologist using a highly powerful magnet, only a minimum number of needles are used to sample suspicious abnormalities. \nDr. Dan Sperling , Medical Director of the Sperling Prostate Center, has performed thousands of MRI-guided biopsies since he began offering them over six years ago. \"Traditional prostate biopsies are guided by ultrasound, which does not show suspicious tissue changes,\" says Sperling. \"Doctors take 12 or more random needle sticks because they don't know what they're aiming for. The prostate becomes a human pincushion. It can be painful and cause side effects. Prostate cancer is the only tumor malignancy diagnosed by blindly taking samples that can miss aggressive cancer, or oversample indolent disease. We have solved that problem.\" \nSperling explains, \"Our advanced multiparametric MRI-guided procedure, done in the bore (tunnel) of our MRI machine, is easier on patients. It allows precision placement of each needle only into any suspicious area seen on the scan. Our diagnosis is most accurate because we target where the most dangerous cancer cells can lurk. With correct diagnosis, patients can safely make informed treatment choices, including active surveillance.\" \nInternational studies such as Kaufmann, et al. (2015) demonstrate up to twice the diagnostic accuracy over standard biopsies. Another recent technology, fusion guided biopsy, approaches real time MRI accuracy only when targeting includes additional random needles—up to 12—as with blind biopsies. \nTo guide prostate biopsies, Dr. Sperling's Center uses a scan called multiparametric MRI done on a 3 Tesla (3T) magnet, which produces extremely high definition images of prostate anatomy and unusual changes. In addition to greater accuracy and patient comfort, patients diagnosed with a single focus of cancer may qualify for his minimally invasive Bluelaser™ focal treatment with minimal-to-no side effects. \nAbout Sperling Prostate Center \nSperling Prostate Center ( New York , Florida ) is the leading U.S. center for 3T multiparametric detection, diagnosis and image-guided focal treatment of prostate cancer. www.sperlingprostatecenter.com \nVisit us at https://www.facebook.com/SperlingProstateCenter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:39:40.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
