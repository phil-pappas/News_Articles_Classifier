Maybe someday there will be a system that charges 100 percent device-and cable-free, but not yet. \nWith the PowerGo-Go system, your iPhone 6 is housed in a shock absorbent magnetic charging and data transfer case that is Apple certified. The case looks great and gives you 100-percent access to your touchscreen, volume and controls. It's also screen-saver friendly. \nKeep in mind that the case is a pass-through for the power to get to your device. It is a little bulkier compared with other cases since it has a Lightning port to plug into your phone. \nThe back of the case is the key, with a 3/4-inch target where you magnetically attach your charging source. \nI first tried the USB cable, which has a standard USB connection on one end for connecting to any USB power source. The other end has a magnetic end, which snaps onto your case. \nWhat makes it even more amazing is when you connect the USB port to your computer, you can transfer photos, music and any other data while charging. \nOther pieces of the system are a wireless battery, charging cradle and a car charger set. \nThe 3,000 mAh portable battery (8 mm in thick. 32 ounces) gets charged with the cable mentioned and USB power source. Once it's charged, throw it in your computer bag and when your iPhone 6 needs a boost of power, connect them magnetically and charge away. \nThe Car Charging charger attaches to your dashboard or windshield and lets you snap the case on the multi-angle base for charging and easy rotation for viewing handsfree from any angle. \nAn included cable attaches to your 12 V (cigarette) port and the other end to the charging pad for additional power. \nThe Charging Cradle is a base to sit wherever you do most of your charging. Just have it charged or plugged into a USB source and then put your iPhone 6 on and off the base at will. \nAfter a few days of using it, I wondered how I kept my phone going without it. \nwww.powergogo.com, $35 for the case and cable, or $60 for the case, cradle and cable, $78 for the car charger set, case, cable and cradle \nThe Cube will change your mood, it's that simple. \nIt's a plug-in mood and utility light that gives you up to a powerful 100 lumens of soft-white light. \nIt's probably the most innovative and versatile night-light I've seen, with all its settings and usefulness. \nMeasuring 2-by-2-inches cubed, you can put it on a nightstand, under a bed, campsite or anywhere you need illuminated for safety, security or just add instant mood to a room. \nIt runs on the three included AAA batteries, which are accessed by removing a battery door on the bottom. \nA push button lets you cycle through the light mode settings or remove the diffuser and you'll instantly have a spotlight. The six settings include; low, high, medium, color changing, color lock and an emergency flash mode. \nThe emergency mode will last up to 48 hours. \nThe Cube is even splash-proof with an IPX4 rating. \nhttp://enevu.com $29.90, available in pure white, matte black, cyan blue and pink color bases \nContact Gregg Ellman at greggellman@mac.com.
