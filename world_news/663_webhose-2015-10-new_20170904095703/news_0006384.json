Credit: WA Police \nWhile he's usually fighting Perth's crooks and thieves, over the past week WA police dog Rumble has been battling a mysterious infection resulting in seizures. \nFollowing tests for stroke, infectious diseases and cancer, as well as an MRI to check for structural damage to the brain or spinal cord, Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital has now diagnosed the much-loved eight-year-old German Shepherd with meningoencephalitis. \nA combination of meningitis and encephalitis, the condition involves inflammation of the meninges—the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord—and inflammation of the brain itself. \nWhile incidences of meningitis, encephalitis, and encephalomyelitis are generally low in dogs, owners should be watchful for warning signs such as fever, neck rigidity and spasms. \nPets suffering from meningoencephalitis may also exhibit depression, blindness, seizures, agitation, lethargy and weakness/paralysis. \nMurdoch Senior Lecturer in veterinary emergency and critical care Dr Claire Sharp says Rumble is responding well to treatment. \n\"While Rumble's condition is improving he still has a long way to go and is not out of danger yet,\" she says \n\"Recovery may take weeks to months and he may never return to full fitness.\" \nThe cause of Rumble's illness is currently unknown, which is not surprising, as the condition's origins are often difficult for vets to detect.
