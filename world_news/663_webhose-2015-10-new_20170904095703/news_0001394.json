(AP) â€” The president of the University of California system has convened a committee of administrators, faculty and students to look at how complaints against tenured faculty are handled across the 10-campus system. The San Francisco Chronicle reports ( http://bit.ly/1QAvENd) Friday that the move comes just days after famed UC Berkeley astronomer Geoffrey Marcy resigned his professorship after an investigation found he sexually harassed several female students. Between 2001 and 2010, he reportedly gave massages and other unwanted attention to at least four female students. President Janet Napolitano said Thursday the committee will look at how accusations are investigated and judged, and how professors are disciplined. Emails to Marcy seeking comment weren't returned. He apologized last week, but the university faced growing pressure to fire him. The committee will report its recommendations by Feb. 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:30:50.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
