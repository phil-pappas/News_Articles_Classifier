The numbers were first disclosed by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to Chinese media during a trip to Beijing last week.\nChina’s sales could match the U.S. in five to six years, Musk said in an interview with the official Xinhua News Agency last week. The automaker is targeting to start sales of its Model X sport utility vehicle in the country during the first half of next year, tapping on demand from consumers that have made the higher-riding vehicles the fastest-growing segment.\nChina accounted for about 11 percent of Tesla’s global deliveries in the third quarter. The company won approval last month from the Beijing municipal government to enter a special license plate lottery system for electric vehicles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:08:55.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
