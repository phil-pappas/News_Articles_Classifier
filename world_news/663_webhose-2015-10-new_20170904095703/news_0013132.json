Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has revealed its first collaboration with Ninebot and Segway, a self-balancing scooter called Ninebot mini. \nThe Ninebot Mini resembles a Segway with its two-wheel design and follows Xiaomi's investment in Ninebot and Ninebot's subsequent acquisition of Segway. \nBuilt from magnesium alloy that Xiaomi says is aerospace-grade, it can hit speeds of up to 16km/hour and can go 22km on a single change. It is able to handle a 15-degree uphill incline and weighs less than 13kg. \nIt comes in white and black and is said to be tailored to fans of Xiaomi's Mi: it can actually be controlled by smartphone. \nThe Ninebot mini will be available in China priced at RMB 1999 – or about US$315 (RM1,340). – AFP, October 20, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:20:37.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
