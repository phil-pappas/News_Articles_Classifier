I get a steady 60 Mbps download speed on my primary desktop computer (thanks to Comcast), but on my laptop I get far slower speeds. The laptop picks up my Wi-Fi signal from upstairs and, here's the problem: The speed varies day to day. Yesterday and today the download speed is a steady 3 Mbps, but on other days (all day) it's around 20 to 25. ... What would cause such a pattern of download speeds? Variations during the day I can understand, but variation between days? â€” Harry Puncec, Lakewood\nA: Harry, you're a smart guy. How do I know this? Because as many readers who ask a question, I often reply with suggestions or questions to determine what exactly is happening. I told Harry to check for other wireless interference (cellphones, microwaves and garage-door openers travel on the same 2.4 GHz frequency), see whether neighbors are streaming movies, check the router age (products do get old) and call Comcast to get its explanation.\nHarry did that also, but he researched further to figure out how to optimize his new, dual-channel Linksys AC1200+ router.\nAdvertisement He figured it out: He needs to use both bands of the dual-band router.\n\"Once working, I deliberately selected the 5 GHz band and got the best speed,\" he wrote.\nFewer devices use the 5 GHz band (look for 802.11ac compatibility in your PC, phone, tablet), so there's less interference. That could explain the speed jump.\nAlso, there might be some channel bonding going on. Essentially, data travel through various invisible tunnels from the router to your device. Channel bonding merges two or more tunnels to increase data flow. If you spot a setting on the router to expand the channel to 40 MHz instead of the regular 20 MHz, pick the higher. You should get better speeds, as mentioned in Linksys' dual-band router manual .\nThis doesn't necessarily improve the distance of the signal. Harry figured that out, too. He moved the router.\nHarry moved it away from the glass pad on the floor, which also can impact the signal strength, as can walls, mirrors and metal office furniture .\n\"Moving the router even 6 inches away from the pad doubled my speeds downstairs,\" he said. \"My routine speed on my laptop now averages around 30 Mbps, well over the 3 Mbps I was getting when I first wrote.\"\nHis last tip: Upgrade the router's software.\nGood work, Harry. For that, I'm putting your picture in the paper!", "external_links": ["http://www.linksys.com/us/support-product?pid=01t80000003cgXOAAY", "http://downloads.linksys.com/downloads/userguide/WRT610N_V20_UG_NC-WEB.pdf", "http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1329709&seqNum=3"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:44:02.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
