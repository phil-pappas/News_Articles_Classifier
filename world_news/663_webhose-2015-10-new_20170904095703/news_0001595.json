Modern technology has changed how we work and our approach to employment, yielding more flexible work arrangements but also blurring the lines between our work and personal lives. Today's workforce is experiencing burnout at greater rates than ever before and we're not taking the best care of ourselves. As a result, we're depleted, overwhelmed, and disengaged from both our professional and personal lives. There's a better way. And that's why Virgin Pulse is presenting Virgin Disruptors: Creating New Ways to Work , taking place at Zappos.com headquarters in Las Vegas on October 19, 2015 . \nVirgin Pulse is bringing together esteemed business leaders and scientific experts to explore how companies can win by transforming the way we work. Joining Chris Boyce , CEO of Virgin Pulse, at the event are: Tony Hsieh , CEO, Zappos.com; Jean Oelwang , President, Virgin Unite; Dr. BJ Fogg, PhD, Director, Persuasive Technology Lab, Stanford University ; Patty McCord , Former Chief Talent Officer, Netflix; Brian Robertson , Founder, Holacracy; John Bunch , Holacracy Implementation, Team Zappos.com; Scott Heiferman , CEO, Meetup; and Carolyn Kopprasch , Chief Happiness Officer, Buffer. \n\"When people are their best selves in all aspects of life, they're more engaged and productive at work. And that's good for business,\" said Chris Boyce , CEO of Virgin Pulse. \"We're no longer the 9-to-5 society our parents and grandparents knew. Employers must create and cultivate new ways to work that are in sync with modern life and the needs of today's workforce, and that ultimately help people be their best selves. Any company's ability to attract and retain top talent, and compete to win, depends on it.\"\nBe part of the movement to create new ways to work.
