Our technology offers real-time, layer-by-layer analysis to ensure compliance to production specifications.” \nPrintRite3D INSPECT and DEFORM software modules can now be used in combination for embedded, stand-alone, or third party platform-independent installations. \nDEFORM is expected to be delivered to Honeywell in October and will be shipped to Sigma Labs' global EAP participants as appropriate. \nSigma Labs’ EAP remains open to new entrants and offers many benefits to users looking to obtain objective evidence of compliance to design intent, conduct rapid qualification, and create value through process control and optimisation. \nMark added: “The launch of DEFORM – and its first installation, with Honeywell – represents the achievement of a major milestone for the metal AM industry. Sigma Labs is pleased to help pioneer the advancement of In-Process Quality Assurance in this rapidly-evolving space.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:30:49.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
