Paul Jeffers by Ben Potter Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's obsession with \"disruptive technologies\" is on the money, KPMG Australia chairman Peter Nash says. And KPMG Australia is putting its money where the Prime Minister's mouth is.\nThe firm launched one of the six start-ups that KPMG's global venture capital fund ploughed its $US85 million Fund 1 into – a customer data analytics company called Customer Compass – out of its Sydney office.\nMr Nash told The Australian Financial Review the mining boom had left Australia complacent about innovation and technology.\n\"In the long term the winners will be those that are at the forefront of innovation and technology, and I think Australia needs to be at the forefront or participating in the forefront – but we are not there yet,\" he said. \"You don't have to be at the bleeding edge, but you sure as heck have to be close to it.\"\nProfessional services firms are increasingly seeking an edge via disruptive start-ups and alliances.\nKPMG Australia has also set up KPMG Marketplace, where clients can bid for the idle hours of KPMG staff. EY has a similar initiative. Deloitte aligns with disrupters, then buys in where it can, and has a refer-a-friend program – \"Find Like Minds\" – that saves recruiters' fees and delivers better matches.\nKPMG Capital's Fund 1 is closed. KPMG Capital – a KPMG company based in Houston and funded by the global professional services network's national member firms – aims to raise $US200 million to 300 million in Fund 2.\nFund 2 will also invest in disruptive technologies that are needed by KPMG clients and can be delivered more rapidly via start-ups than by KPMG developing them in-house, Mr Nash said.\n KPMG Australia agreed to sell Customer Compass to KPMG Capital Fund 1 because it made more sense for KPMG to own the company globally, he said.\nThe company deals with \"a classic big data problem\" faced by corporations. They have millions of pieces of information about how they are interacting with their customers spread over separate \"legacy\" customer service systems. It only takes one of several interactions to go wrong to sour the customer's experience, says Anthony Coops, lead partner in KPMG Data and Analytics.\nCustomer Compass provides an analytical tool to collate the data and report back to the company on it so they can see where things are going wrong and work out how to nip it in the bud.\nThe technology is at proof-of-concept stage, with live trials funded by KPMG Capital running in several jurisdictions including some large Australian corporations to \"build out and refine the technology\", Mr Coopes said.\nThe other five start-ups in the Fund 1 portfolio range over social media trends and profiles, third party (suppliers) risk monitoring and \"near real time\" cybersecurity.\nAstrus allows banks and other customers to monitor suppliers and other third parties whose issues or conduct could adversely hurt the customers' reputation in the market from publicly available information anywhere in the world.\nMr Coops said regulators had evolved to the point where they expected banks and other corporations to monitor third parties that can affect their own reputations constantly, rather than just at the start of the relationship or at periodic intervals.\nAstrus is being rolled out by KPMG member firms \"to help our customers better understand related risk profiles\", he said.\nBottlenose is a social media monitoring service that helps customers get immediate feedback about trends and brewing sentiment on social media that affects them directly – say, with a poorly received new product – or via related third parties, such as sponsored sporting events, clubs or players.\nNorse Corp is a Silicon Valley cybersecurity company that monitors the internet, lays \"honey traps\" and offers early warning of cyberattacks that could put a financial services company or government at risk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:19:02.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
