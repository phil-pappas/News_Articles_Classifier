Kendall Hunt , Chairman and CEO of VASCO. \"The first line of defense, and too-often the first line of failure, happens at the login process. If we make it easier and more secure for users to login, we can make great strides in improving security and reducing losses.\" About The FIDO Alliance The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org , was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.
