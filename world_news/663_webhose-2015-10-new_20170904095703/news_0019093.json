Total revenue was approximately $4.2 million. The primary reason for this shortfall to guidance was an unexpected and temporary decline of mature product revenue, which totaled approximately $1.3 million. \nNew product revenue was approximately $2.9 million. Increased shipments of sensor processing and display bridge solutions were offset by a larger than expected decline in smart-connectivity solutions. Sensor processing solutions are expected to increase again in Q4 2015. \nDue to lower mature product revenue, and a notable increase in display bridge shipments to Samsung, we anticipate reporting non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 30%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be reported in line with guidance at approximately $5.7 million, and the non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be reported at approximately $0.08. We anticipate cash usage of approximately $3 million, which is at the low end of the guidance range. We expect a quarter-ending cash balance of approximately $23.4 million. \n\"While the temporary decline in mature product revenue was disappointing, our strategic initiatives are progressing in line with our expectations,\" said Andy Pease, president and CEO of QuickLogic. \"We have shipped the first samples of our revolutionary EOSÂ™ sensor processing system, and continue to anticipate initiating production shipments during the first half of 2016. We are also particularly pleased with our recent design win at Runtastic, and we look forward to announcing more design wins with customers that have high brand recognition in the U.S., Europe and Asia.\" \nQuickLogic will release Q3 2015 results after the markets close on October 28, 2015. A conference call to review these results, update strategic progress and provide guidance for Q4 2015 will follow this release. \nThird Quarter 2015 Earnings Announcement \nQuickLogic has scheduled a conference call to discuss the company's earnings results for its third quarter of fiscal 2015 on Wednesday, October 28, 2015, at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time / 5:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.
