Then I come back to res, and this ignorant kid says education \"Must be a privilege\". \"People must not be lazy. They must work hard and get bursaries.\", he said as if they are enough. Does he even have an idea of how many people deserve to have got bursaries, but couldn't since they are limited. Has he ever got an email saying: 'We regret to inform....\" and they will tell you about the number of applications they receive and their limited funds for that particular year. I don't think he has ever got such an email.\nNow I have to remind those who are attending (or those who attended) proper schools where everything is provided (some even got the extra classes and extra tutorial classes) which is something that doesn't happen to us from rural schools. It may seem odd, but all those who get above 65% in all their subjects in rural areas are hard-workers, for the services they have are quite not efficient. Another thing, the exams are all the same at the end of the year. They don't say rural people must write different exam papers, because they did not have what those in urban areas have.\nThere is nothing wrong with attending a proper school (And it's all everybody wishes) but what's wrong is the misjudgement. Now they get to varsity and they have got money. So they attend extra classes for money, because let's face it, course chows! I have also attended a few of those classes, they are costly (about R300 per module) but worth it. So if you don't afford such classes and end up passing with a 55% you are not a hard-worker? (I am talking specifically about Engineering modules, maybe if you doing BA we can think otherwise--Haha!).\nWhat I could tell from that guy, is the fact that he actually doesn't understand the situation. He doesn't know what it is to have no computers in your school; given an assignment, you go to the library and only to find they have no books relating to the subject you are researching or if there is, it's one or two. A computer cafe at that time, costs R20 per 30 minutes.\nBut I'm glad there was another guy (of the same kind) who also tried to tell him about his story and the fact that bursaries are limited. And we also can not forget the fact that there is no balance in the way in which bursaries are distributed among courses. Engineers are mostly secured than any others. What then about those doing BA? Are all of them affording to pay by themselves? I don't think so. We can't be selfish about education and say it should be a privilege, unless we redefine the word 'privilege'. Now I say that as someone who is from and has worked at an organization that deals with students in rural areas. I have seen and understand the situation.\nI believe in working hard, but working hard also goes with the aid one gets. It is one's responsibility to go extra miles to get the help with his/her studies. But then, you ask yourself one thing: How many people offer help for free, specifically to those who don't afford paid tutorials? I am one of those saying education should be free (some research has shown the feasibility, It's just that they won't tell you). When education is free, then they can increase the standards and the criteria in which they select students to study at a tertiary institution. That is when we can then say it is a 'privilege for hard-workers' but for now it is a 'privilege' for those that can afford.\nWhen he was about to leave, he said: \"You not working hard enough to get a bursary, bruh.\" Nx! How many extra classes he attends? I know, 90% of them you will find in those paid extra classes. If you don't even have the money to buy food and pay your outstanding tuition fees, then where are you gonna get the money to attend extra classes? If education could be free, then I assume more than 5% of people can then afford to pay for extra classes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:28:52.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
