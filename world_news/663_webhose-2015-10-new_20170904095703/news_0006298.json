We will not compromise with anything that may bring harm to our children in schools.\" \nThe persistent smog has afflicted large swathes of Southeast Asia for weeks, sparking health alerts, numerous school shutdowns and affecting flights. \nThe pollution is on track to be the worst on record, surpassing the $9-billion damage recorded in 1997. \nClose to half of Malaysia's 52 pollutant monitoring stations around the country registered \"unhealthy\" air quality on Sunday. \nSix stations, including one in Kuala Lumpur registered \"very unhealthy\" levels, with one area in the outskirts of the capital hovering close to the \"hazardous\" level. \nWhile Malaysia, Singapore and large portions of Indonesia have for weeks choked on pungent smoke from forest fires on Sumatra Island, the Philippine island of Cebu also suffered its seventh straight day of haze on Saturday. \nMonsoon winds blowing northeast from the Indonesian blazes could have carried the smog, state weather forecaster Romeo Aguirre told AFP. \nMeanwhile, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said on Sunday he hoped Indonesia could discuss long term measures to tackle the crisis. \n\"We hope its commitment is not only on paper or mere statements pleasant to the ears, but through implementation which could end all haze problems,\" he was quoted as saying by Bernama. \nThe worsening haze has also affected key sporting events in the region. \nThe Singapore leg of the FINA World Championships -- swimming's World Cup -- which included four-time US Olympic gold medallist Missy Franklin, was called off. \nOne of Malaysia's biggest marathons set for Sunday was also cancelled because of health fears for the 30,000 runners, and local football league matches have been shelved. \nPhilippines suspects week-long haze from Indonesia fires Manila (AFP) Oct 3, 2015 - The Philippine island of Cebu suffered its seventh straight day of haze on Saturday, the weather bureau said, as Southeast Asian countries battle pollution suspected to emanate from illegal fires on Indonesian plantations. \nMonsoon winds blowing northeast from the Indonesian blazes towards the direction of the central Philippines could have carried the smog, state weather forecaster Romeo Aguirre told AFP. \n\"We suspect that this haze is from Sumatra. It is unusually thick,\" Aguirre said. \nHaze from local pollution is common in Cebu, home to four million people, but usually disappears within a day. The current cloud of pollution blanketing the city in a blueish-grey veil is into its seventh day, though it has thinned considerably. \nThe haze was thickest on Monday, halving the normal range of visibility to five kilometres (three miles) around the same time typhoon Dujuan was forecast to pass over Cebu, Aguirre said. \nThe environment department is expected to conduct further tests to confirm the smog's provenance, he added. \nMalaysia, Singapore and large portions of Indonesia have for weeks choked on pungent smoke from forest fires on Sumatra Island. \nThe fires are on track to be the worst on record, surpassing the $9-billion damage from a similar incident in 1997, NASA warned on Friday. \nThe forest fires blanketing Southeast Asia are on track to become the worst on record, NASA has warned, in a crisis that has seen thousands of people seek medical treatment, flights grounded, and schools closed. \nMalaysia, Singapore and large expanses of Indonesia have suffered for weeks from acrid smoke billowing from fires on Indonesian plantations and peatlands that are being illegally cleared by burning. \nThough the crisis grips the region nearly ever year during the dry season, scientists predict the current outbreak could surpass 1997 levels, when out-of-control fires sent pollution soaring to record highs in an environmental disaster that cost an estimated US$9.0 billion. \nHerry Purnomo, a haze expert at the Centre for International Forestry Research, told AFP on Friday that the dry season was not expected to peak in Indonesia's Sumatra island until next month. \n\"It's not over yet,\" he said, adding the economic cost of the \"horrendous\" fires would be as bad as 1997. \nIf the dry conditions continue, the region could be enveloped in even denser smog. \n\"Conditions in Singapore and southeastern Sumatra are tracking close to 1997,\" Robert Field, a Columbia University scientist based at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, was quoted as saying by the US science agency earlier this week. \n\"If the forecasts for a longer dry season hold, this suggests 2015 will rank among the most severe events on record.\" \nPressure on Indonesia from its neighbours has intensified this year as the fires have raged on. \nSingapore officials have reacted with outrage to Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla's comments that neighbouring countries should be grateful for good air quality most of the year, and that Jakarta need not apologise for the crisis. \nTo battle the blazes, Indonesia officials have deployed more than 20,000 troops, police and other personnel to fight the fires through waterbombing and chemically-induced rainfall. \nAn El Nino weather system has made conditions drier than usual in Indonesia, but authorities are hoping much-needed rains will arrive within a month to finally douse the blazes. \nIt could be too little too late in Malaysia, where farmers have complained of poor yields due to the haze, and in Singapore where the government has launched legal action against companies blamed for farm and plantation fires. \n- 'Double catastrophe' - \nAuthorities worry air quality in Singapore, which improved Friday to the lower end of the \"unhealthy\" range after heavy rains overnight, could worsen again depending on the wind direction. \nIn Malaysia, where weeks of fog-like white-gray smoke has forced repeated large-scale school closures out of health concerns, there are fears the prolonged dry season could spark fires, compounding the disaster. \n\"That will be a double catastrophe,\" said Lim Teck Wyn, who organised a protest march to Indonesia's embassy in Kuala Lumpur over the haze. \nThe annual haze crisis has persisted as plantations expand to meet rising global demand for products like palm oil, a key ingredient in a vast range of everyday consumer products. \nThe fires smoulder beneath the surface of carbon-rich peatlands, feeding off vast quantities of fuel, making them extremely difficult to curb as millions of tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions are released into the atmosphere. \nThe NASA-linked Global Fire Emissions Database has estimated around 600 million tonnes of greenhouse gases have been released as a result of this year's fires -- roughly equivalent to Germany's entire annual output. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:34:59.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
