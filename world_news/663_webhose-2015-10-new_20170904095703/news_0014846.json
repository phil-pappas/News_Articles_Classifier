Defense lawyer En Sovann says Yem Chhrin faces up to life in prison if found guilty of murder, intentionally spreading HIV — the virus that causes AIDS — and practicing medicine without a license. Yem Chhrin, who appeared Tuesday in a provincial court in Battambang town for the five-day trial, was arrested last December. He was taken into protective custody, fearing revenge lynching by residents of Rokka village, where at least 106 of the 800 people tested were found to be infected with HIV. Of them, at least 10 people are reported to have died.
