This is the first unified communications solution on the market capable of onsite, cloud, and hybrid UC systems on a single platform. The webinar, “ How to Keep your UC Options Open with ShoreTel Connect” is scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 15 from 1:15-2:15 CT. It will be jointly conducted by ITsavvy’s Director of Unified Communications for the Advanced Solutions Group Dennis Gorecki and ShoreTel’s Director of Product Management Edward Wright.\nGorecki explained, “This is the most significant update that ShoreTel has offered in their history. Previously, like other UC providers, they only offered a system that required separate platforms for onsite and hosted services. Now it can all be on the same platform.”\n ShoreTel Connect is built on a single software code that lets users design their UC system as a:\n Managed service from the Cloud Self-managed hardware system or a Hybrid deployment (some locations and applications are managed from the Cloud and others are managed onsite)\nWith a single click, ShoreTel Connect provides an intuitive collaboration experience that can easily escalate conversations from an IM, to a call, to an online meeting, to a web desktop share (with or without video). The single code base makes it easy to add, change, or update. It also eliminates the need for plug-ins, complicated set-ups, and multiple application windows and passwords.\nIn March, InfoWorld’s Galen Gruman blogged, “If a single provider can solve all these issues over time, we get the advantage of unified user account management and easier switching of the conversation from one mode to another.” This webinar will demonstrate how ShoreTel’s Connect is addressing this.\n“ShoreTel is the first UC provider that offers one platform for onsite and Cloud,” Gorecki added. “It is not available from any other manufacturer at this time. This solution makes it easier to manage unified communications and it also makes it easier to scale. Anyone involved in unified communications should be very interested in participating in this webinar.”\nShoreTel Connect is an excellent solution for organizations of all types and sizes that want the customization and control of an onsite solution with the easy management of a hosted solution. ITsavvy's ShoreTel certified UC experts are available to consult and work with companies that are interested in this new technology.\nThe webinar is part of a continuing series of ITsavvy webinars featuring the company’s own experts and leading technology manufacturers. Registration is open to IT professionals. Five webinar attendees will receive a free 10200 universal battery charger.
