(CATS-OTCQB). The full 56-page report is available on Crystal Research Associates' website at www.crystalra.com .\nCatasys, Inc. (or \"the Company\") provides big data–based analytics and predictive modeling–driven health management services for health plans. These services aim to improve member health while simultaneously lowering insurer costs for underserved populations. Catasys' On Trak ™ integrated solutions serve individuals who have behavioral health disorders that exacerbate coexisting medical conditions, resulting in higher hospital admissions and emergency room (ER) visits.\nThe Company has developed analytics for identifying which individuals on an insurance plan are \"high utilizers\" with impactable costs due to having behavioral conditions such as substance dependency or anxiety disorder. Catasys targets these patients with its proprietary direct outreach capability to enroll them in the On Trak ™ patient-centric treatment program. On Trak ™ integrates evidence-based medical and psychosocial interventions in a 52-week outpatient program that has shown a 50%+ reduction in total costs for members enrolled in its programs—stemming from decreases in hospital stays, ambulance usage, and ER visits. The Company has entered into contracts with several insurance providers for On Trak ™, which is now available in 10 states, including through Aetna/ Coventry , Humana, Centene, Fallon Health, Health Alliance Medical Plans, and Reliant Medical Group. Collectively, this entails approximately 2.3 million Commercially Equivalent Lives (CELs). Catasys' pipeline includes 10 million additional CELs, with 4 million in advanced discussions. CELs are a metric of growth potential, as increasing CELs may represent future contracts and increasing future enrollment.\nBe the first to hear about Crystal Research's new report releases and upcoming media coverage.
