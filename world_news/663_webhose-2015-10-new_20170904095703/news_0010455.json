We programme and recommend new TV shows and movies from preschool through their teen years and into adulthood.\" \nNew content will include new stories from LEGO Bionicle and LEGO Friends plus DreamWorks Animation's all-new original family sitcom, Dawn of the Croods. Netflix is also broadening its offering for tweens and teens with the live action show Lost & Found Music Studios, action-comedy Buddy Thunderstruck and anime inspired Glitter Force.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:27:57.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
