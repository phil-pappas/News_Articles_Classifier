Related Programs The intent of this program is to strengthen the capabilities of the U.S.in accelerator science & technology for discovery science, medicine, industry, energy & environment, and security applications. Nonprofit organizations described in section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that engaged in lobbying activities after December 31, 1995 are not eligible to apply for funding under either Track. In accordance with 2 CFR 910.126, Competition, eligibility for award under each Track is restricted as follows: Track 1: Accelerator Stewardship Topical Areas Applications for activities in Track 1: Accelerator Stewardship Topical Areas will be accepted from all responsible domestic organizations capable of meeting the objectives of this FOA, with the exception of U.S.Department of Energy National Laboratories.For DOE National Laboratories, there is a separate, companion announcement (LAB-16-1438). Track 2: Long-Term Generic Accelerator R&D Applications for activities in Track 2: Long-Term Generic Accelerator R&D will only be accepted from regionally-accredited U. S. academic institutions or domestic nonprofit organizations subject to section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Applicants that are not domestic organizations should be advised that Individual applicants are unlikely to possess the skills, abilities, and resources to successfully accomplish the objectives of this FOA.Individual applicants are encouraged to address this concern in their applications and to demonstrate how they will accomplish the objectives of this FOA.
