By automating highly complex and time-consuming manual procedures, the Company's solutions deliver a better way for institutions of any size to perform sophisticated genetic testing for organisms and genetic-based diseases. Through its strong molecular biology capabilities, the Company is focusing on those applications where accurate, rapid, and actionable test results are needed most, such as managing infectious diseases and cancer. For more information, visit http://www.cepheid.com . \nUse of Non-GAAP Measures \nThe Company has supplemented its reported GAAP financial information with non-GAAP measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and transaction costs, and amortization of purchased intangible assets. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.The Company's management uses the non-GAAP information internally to evaluate its ongoing business, continuing operational performance and cash requirements, and believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors as they provide a basis for evaluating the Company's cash requirements and additional insight into the underlying operating results and the Company's ongoing performance in the ordinary course of its operations. \nThese non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Company believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with its results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the Company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. \nAs described above, the Company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: \nStock-based Compensation Expense. This consists primarily of expenses for stock options and restricted stock under ASC 718 (formerly SFAS 123(R)). The Company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because it is a non-cash expense that the Company does not believe is reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Further, as the Company applies ASC 718, it believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of ASC 718 on its results of operations. \nAmortization of Debt Discount and Transaction Costs. The Company incurs amortization of debt discount and transaction costs in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes issued in February 2014. The Company excludes these amounts because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Company's issuance of debt and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company's business. \nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets . The Company incurs amortization of purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions. The Company excludes these amounts because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from the Company's prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of the Company's business. \nForward-Looking Statements \nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are not purely historical regarding Cepheid's or its management's intentions, beliefs, expectations and strategies for the future, including those relating to projected future growth, future revenues, future net loss/income and profitability and future number of fully-diluted shares, including on a non-GAAP basis, strategic investments, platform features, the breadth and speed of test menu expansion, geographic expansion and market segment expansion.
