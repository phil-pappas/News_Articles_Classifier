DFL Digital Sports develops and provides tailor-made digital solutions for the DFL. Jörg Banholzer, Director of Technology at DFL Digital Sports GmbH, explains: ‘Each match day, we source thousands of photos from various different resources, such as stock photo agencies or photographers. These images have to be published near-live in suitable quality for different platforms. Controlled publishing of video coverage of all games on match day, all with different rights, can be a real challenge. With CELUM, we now have a centralized solution for our Digital Asset Management System challenges.’\nDFL’s external partners or license holders can access exclusive media content via a web portal. This content is managed in CELUM and automatically delivered to the portal. For editorial purposes, the solution supports comprehensive keyword management and targeted search possibilities for images and videos (e.g. all free-kick photos of Bayern Munich Star David Alba from the season 2013/2014).\nMichael Kräftner, CELUM CEO, says of the new clients at DFL Digital Sports: ‘The German Soccer League is the best soccer league worldwide and is one of the largest sport leagues in the world. Through our partnership with DFL Digital Sports, we are happy to be part of an organization that inspires thousands of viewers each week with their images and transported emotions. Our clear goal is to support the complex daily business of DFL Digital Sports in the best way possible.’\nUsing CELUM software, DFL Digital Sports can now centrally control the publishing of images and video content across various channels (web, mobile, app) in several countries.\nCELUM provides a ‘single source of truth’ solution for all media content at DFL Digital Sports, making them an integral part of the new digital framework at DFL, which also includes the FirstSpirit Content Management System from CELUM’s partner company e-Spirit.\nFurther Information:\nhttp://www.celum.com\nhttp://www.dfl-digital-sports.de\nAbout CELUM:\nCELUM is a globally leading developer of marketing technology software for Enterprise Digital Asset Management and Marketing Content Management.\nCELUM software products already boast over 700,000 users over 700 companies in 35 countries.
