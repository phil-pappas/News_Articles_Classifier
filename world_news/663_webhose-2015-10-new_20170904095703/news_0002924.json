The paper shows how technology from Qosmos can help network equipment, platform, middleware, and software suppliers build the application-aware network needed to deliver high performance vCPE applications.\nVirtual CPE is one of the 10 original Network Function Virtualization (NFV) use cases in a list (1) developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the standards body in charge of NFV. With vCPE, communication service providers install basic customer premise equipment (CPE) at the subscriber site, and deliver more advanced CPE service functions from a data center in a central office, point of presence (PoP) or other central location. This approach reduces costs, simplifies CPE deployments and increases service agility. Services such as DHCP, firewall, NAT, routing, VPN, etc. are delivered by virtual network functions (VNFs) running at the communication service provider data center as virtual machine (VM) instances configured for each broadband subscriber.\n“There is a lot of excitement about vCPE in the communication service provider community because of the ability to deploy services faster with substantial cost savings,” said Erik Larsson, VP Marketing at Qosmos. “Successful deployment of vCPE will depend on application awareness and processing performance. Qosmos technology provides the fundamental building blocks for these new network architectures and for the profitability of new services through shorter delivery times at lower operational costs.”\nSystems integrators and solution vendors can leverage the Qosmos Classifier® to rapidly build vCPE solutions for service providers, data centers, and enterprises. The Qosmos Classifier is a standalone software component, which classifies traffic flows in real time for further processing. It is designed to enable any type of service combination while optimizing networking and infrastructure costs.\nFor full details, please see the Intel Network Builders and Qosmos Solution Brief:\nUsing Service Classification to Build an Application-Aware NFV Infrastructure for vCPE Services\nThe solution brief is free and can be downloaded from the Qosmos website:\nhttp://www.qosmos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Intel-Qosmos_vCPE-Solution-Brief_2015.pdf\nYou can also pick up a copy at the Qosmos and Intel booths at the SDN & OpenFlow World Congress in Dusseldorf, 12 – 16 October 2015.\n(1) Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV); Use Cases (PDF download: http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv001v010101p.pdf )\n-Ends-\nAbout Qosmos\nQosmos leads the market for Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and network intelligence technology used in physical, SDN and NFV architectures.
