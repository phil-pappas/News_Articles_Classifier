The funding round will enable the company to commercially release AGILE Research, its new label-free, quantitative, affordable research tool for small molecule and protein analysis. The company is also using the funds to lay the foundation for AGILE Lyme investigational product evaluation and market clearance. \n\"It's amazing how far we've progressed in our technology and product in only 20 months and with just the funds raised so far,\" says Nanomed CEO Ross Bundy . \"Our current focus is finalizing AGILE Research product design, and we'll be evaluating its performance with the CDC and Stanford University this fall. We expect to launch the product early next year for commercial use to study proteins of interest.\" \nThe CDC and Nanomedical Diagnostics have entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to evaluate direct electronic detection of Borrelia burgdorferi antigens for a new Lyme disease diagnostic system. Lyme disease research is also a focal point in the Stanford collaboration. \n\"This company is applying a very novel and powerful technology to a current hot issue-- personalized healthcare,\" says CEO and President of Serra Ventures Tim Hoerr . \"Nanomed has a bold, expansive vision, but the team has built interim products and revenue opportunities on the road to their end goal of putting information in people's hands to make educated health choices.\" \nWith the launch of AGILE Research in early 2016, Nanomed will be releasing the world's first commercial graphene biological field effect transistor (BioFET) sensor. By linking biology directly with electronics, AGILE Technology provides easier sample processing, portability, and cost efficiency, crucial features for personal health innovations. \nFor more information about Nanomed or AGILE Research, including pre-sale opportunities, visit www.nanomedicaldiagnostics.com . AGILE Research is slated to launch early 2016 for research use only, and it is not intended for clinical diagnostics. \nAbout Nanomed \nNanomedical Diagnostics (\"Nanomed\") is based in San Diego, CA , and began in late 2013 with the goal of empowering individuals with the information needed to take their healthcare into their own hands. Our focus is practical products and applications that enable personalized healthcare by improving diagnostic ease, speed, and cost. \nNanomed is the first biotech company to combine expertise in biology, nanotechnology, surface chemistry, engineering, and manufacturing to create practical and scaleable graphene biological field effect transistor (BioFET) products. Our ongoing mission is applying our cutting-edge capabilities to supply affordable monitoring and diagnostic platforms that empower individuals to make informed choices today for a healthier tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:57:56.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
