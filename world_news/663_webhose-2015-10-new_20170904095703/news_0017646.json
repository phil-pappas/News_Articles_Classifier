(NYSE Paris:SESG) (LuxX:SESG), a world-leading satellite operator with a fleet of over 50 geostationary satellites, today announced a multi-year contract with Softwire Digital Solutions who will be utilising SES capacity to implement countrywide e-learning solutions in Nigeria. \nSoftwire Digital Solutions, a provider of IT and capacity building services in Nigeria, has been chosen by the Nigerian Government as one of several to implement a number of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) projects, with the aim to bridge the digital and information gap that exists in the rural areas of Nigeria and provide more e-learning facilities to the underserved areas. Softwire will be utilising capacity on SES's NSS-10 satellite for the deployment of this ICT project, under the financing of the Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF). \n\"We are proud to be associated with SES, as they have the expertise and the technical know-how to help us achieve our goals in Nigeria,\" commented Dalo Edetanlen, CEO Softwire Digital Solutions Limited. \"Our partnership ensures that we will deliver quality service to our clients, particularly the USPF. We hope to leverage this relationship to expand our business and become one of the leading ISPs in the country,\" Edetanlen concluded. \n\"Many governments and public institutions on the continent have already begun to develop broadband policies to address this digital inequality, but again are hindered by costs, infrastructure and inaccessible, non-urban populations. Satellites have vast coverage and a reach that's undaunted by mountain, desert, jungle or savannah. Digital communications and broadband Internet are increasingly important to Nigeria and the continent's social and economic development. Our satellite broadband technology is able to deliver a wide range of services across Nigeria's non-urban population, to help drive growth and knowledge transfer,\" added Ibrahima Guimba-Saidou, Senior Vice President, SES Commercial in Africa. \nFollow us on:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:31:01.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
