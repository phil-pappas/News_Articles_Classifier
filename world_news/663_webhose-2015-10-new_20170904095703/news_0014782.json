Budget cuts are seen everywhere and it has now become a reality whose strain is felt by all working in the organization. Those who deal directly with public safety are the ones who suffer the most. They are those who respond to life and death situation. When they have less resources to manage the critical demands it becomes that much more of a challenge to manage their equipment and medical supplies. \nThere are heavy demands on public safety as it relates to \"readiness\". There are daily, weekly, semi-annual, annual checks and balances to make sure that all aspects of running an EMS or Fire Department are in tact-this is a very demanding process, and unfortunately today is typically paper based. Paper based solutions leave us with lots' of paper, writing that can be deciphered, data entry which is prone to error, in this day and age of technology there are certainly better and far more efficient methods to data capture, and while bar code is still a good method, RFID lends itself extremely well because of its speed, and durability of the Tags. By implementing better processes, you are able to significantly improve productivity, cut inventory costs, better tractability of assets as in cradle to grave tracking, and much more. \nDiligent management is the key to perfection and when it comes to saving a life, even the smallest things matter a lot. Hence, effective management and an updated inventory are necessary to make sure no item is missing from the list as a critical medication if not available at the time of patient care can prove fatal. There are times when monitors stop working, a plug is missing or fails during use. These are things that an agency needs to consider and should be on point when they need to respond to an emergency effectively. \nLife for all becomes easier with EMS. It would be perfect to have all the tools, medical supplies, station inventory, assets, vehicles all in one place for management. Things will be easier to trace and you will know when or where a product is finished or missing. Here you can see which medication is on hand, when it expires, where it is, and when is it the time to order, this even helps to pull the order together. \nThe EMS inventory management system serving various ambulance, managing more that 50 stations, and 10-30 fire vehicles also bring along the cost-effective benefits. In addition there is time savings, and peace of mind being the bonus points. When we use web-based management tools with bar code scanning we can automate some manual processes, increase the level of accountability, and reduce the amount of data errors. \nManagement is a tough task especially when there is equipment and medical supplies involved. There is no chance of missing out on the minutest details. Agencies that work in the public safety depend heavily of effective risk management and its essential tools to make sure all the things are managed efficiently and more lives are saved every day. \nWriter Ted Kostis has written various articles on Asset tracker and Inventory Management.
