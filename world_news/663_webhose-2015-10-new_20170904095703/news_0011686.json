Bloomberg by Matthew Garrahan There was a time not long ago when the news business was a roaring economic success. Newspapers sold millions of copies, companies paid large sums to advertise in them and proprietors of successful titles made bags of money. The news hit the streets one day and was fish and chips wrapping the next. Everything was simple.\nThen the internet came along and turned the industry on its head. Most organisations initially opted not to charge for their content online, convinced that they could offset declining circulation and print advertising revenues with digital advertising. This never happened. Digital advertising rates failed to come anywhere close to print rates and the industry continued to stagnate. The Guardian and Daily Mail have persisted with a free online access strategy, but most large circulation dailies ranging from the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, to The Daily Telegraph and The Times in the UK, have implemented digital paywalls.\nThere are still plenty of free news sites out there, such as the Huffington Post, which offer content without the need for a subscription and attract large online audiences. But as the owners of free news sites know, lots of digital readers do not always translate into advertising revenue. The argument has been won for newspaper websites; now paywalls are on the agenda for news sites born on the internet.\nBusiness Insider, which was acquired by German media group Axel Springer last month for close to $US390m, is on course to be one of the first digital news operations to erect a paywall around some of its general content. Jon Ore, Business Insider's product manager, said in a recent blog post that the company was planning a broad \"subscription offering\" for readers \"who prefer to pay us directly\".\nSweeping changes to the online advertising market mean other free news sites may follow suit. Sir Martin Sorrell thinks all newspapers should charge for content: the chief executive of WPP, the world's largest advertising group said this week that paywalls were \"the way to go\".\nThe problem, he says, is the lack of growth in digital advertising - an issue that is likely to get worse as ad blocking software grows in popularity. Ad blockers pose a real threat to the revenues generated by news sites. Meanwhile, rampant online ad fraud and the fact that brands often do not know whether their campaigns are being seen by real people, has shaken confidence in an industry that could do without the additional anxiety.\nWhat other options do free sites have? Making their sites inaccessible to computers or smartphones that have installed ad blockers is one option. City Am, the free London morning business paper, became the first UK title to take this step this week, launching a trial scheme that bars computers with ad blocking from viewing its content.\nBut others in the industry have expressed concern at this tactic, comparing it to the music industry's early lawsuits against consumers who had downloaded pirated music. \"Going after people who want your product is never a good idea,\" says one executive.\n Paywalls do not work for every title. In the US, there are few instances of regional metropolitan dailies being able to build large subscription businesses. Tribune Publishing, which owns titles including the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun, had 70,000 digital-only subscribers across its entire portfolio at end of the second quarter. It will need to sell more - or find other revenue streams - if it is to prosper.\nCould a paywall work for Business Insider? Its mix of free, irreverent business news, slideshows and content pulled and repurposed from other sources has won it a large online following. The Pew Research Center's State of the News Media report this year found that Business Insider had the fourth-largest audience among digital news sites: only Huffington Post, BuzzFeed and Bleacher Report had more readers. Ken Doctor, an industry analyst, expects Business Insider to introduce a metered model that will apply only to its most active and regular users: casual users are unlikely to be asked to pay. Business Insider's consideration of a paywall is a reminder that news sites need money \"to continue to do high-quality journalism that people depend on\", he says.\nWith Facebook, Google and Apple paying more attention to the news business, the industry's prospects are certainly not as bleak as they were a couple of years ago. But with online advertising facing a rocky future, free news sites that do not have deep-pocketed backers need new revenue streams. They will not bring the industry back to its heyday, but paywalls may ensure its survival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:17:24.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
