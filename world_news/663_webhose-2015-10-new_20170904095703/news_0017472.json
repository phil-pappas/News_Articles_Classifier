But not this way.\nOn Wednesday, the group Draft Biden released an ad that supposedly explained why Americans need him as president. It’s mostly about the death of Biden’s wife and daughter in 1972, and the way he found “redemption” through his surviving sons—one of whom, Beau, died of brain cancer this May. The ad closes with Biden saying some extremely vague things about Americans being “on the cusp of some of the most astonishing breakthroughs in the history of mankind,” and their responsibility to “translate those unprecedented capabilities into a greater measure of happiness and meaning.”\nRelated Story The Curious Case of the Biden Leak\nDavid Axelrod called the ad “tasteless” and “exploitative.” It was also vacuous. That same day, Politico reported that Biden himself had leaked to Maureen Dowd the story that his dying son Beau urged him to run.\nBiden’s office vociferously denies the Politico report. And there’s no evidence the vice president or his aides helped craft the ad. But if Biden isn’t trying to build a presidential campaign around his family tragedies, he’s sure given a lot of people that impression. It’s not just the Draft Biden folks and Maureen Dowd. Last month another Times columnist, David Brooks, wrote that Beau Biden’s death gives Biden “a formation story … a story line that begins outside of politics with some experience or life-defining crucible moment.” For Biden, it is “a story of dual loss … Out of that loss comes a great empathy, a connection to those who are suffering in this economy and this world. Out of that loss comes a hypercharged sense of mission.”", "external_links": ["http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/david-axelrod-draft-biden-ad", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/10/07/did-politico-even-contact-bidens-office-for-blockbuster-leak-story/", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/joe-biden-beau-2016-214459", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e6mzH0Y4G8", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/opinion/david-brooks-the-biden-formation-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:44:43.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
