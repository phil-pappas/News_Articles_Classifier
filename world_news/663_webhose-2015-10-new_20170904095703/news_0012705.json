The FCC has designated that unlicensed spectrum is available for everyone -- using any technology -- and continues to be crucial to the evolution and growth of mobile communications. It is important for all participants in the unlicensed space, both existing and new entrants, to coexist and play well together. \"Permission-less innovation\" means that new technologies should be encouraged to leverage unlicensed spectrum to drive a competitive mobile marketplace that provides for ubiquitous connectivity in the burgeoning Internet of Things market. Wi-Fi is a critical component of wireless networks and provides important connectivity for consumers. New technologies using unlicensed spectrum need to work cooperatively with Wi-Fi today, tomorrow and into the future. Likewise, current-generation technologies must accommodate new innovative technologies that also operate in unlicensed spectrum. Together, the unlicensed policy framework and permission-less innovation are a resounding success, producing a continuously evolving stream of new technologies, devices, apps, products and services. Consumers depend on unlicensed spectrum for a variety of uses -- Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, telematics, consumer electronics, and manufacturing -- and benefit when new innovations in the unlicensed space improve and enhance their rapidly increasing digital demands. The best way to address spectrum congestion is a strategy of abundance and sound policy. Unlicensed spectrum is one of several important components to meeting consumers' demand in broadband, both mobile and fixed. The federal government must continue to make additional spectrum available for unlicensed use. \nChris Pearson, President of 4G Americas, stated, \"4G Americas supports the principles and rights behind innovation in unlicensed spectrum and understands its importance for meeting wireless data demands. Our organization encourages the efforts to develop new and creative ways to maximize the potential of unlicensed spectrum for the benefit of connected users.\" \nIn supporting these principles, 4G Americas emphasizes the importance of good spectrum stewardship on the part of regulators in allocating both licensed and unlicensed spectrum to meet rising data demand. The industry itself must also play a part in developing and deploying technology that fairly supports consumers' ability to have a great experience when using their devices regardless of the radio access technology in use. \nEVOLVE (EVOLVEmobile.org) is a coalition of mobile and technology companies and associations working together to promote the consumer benefits of innovations in unlicensed spectrum. The founding members include Competitive Carriers Association, CTIA - The Wireless Association, Alcatel-Lucent, AT&T, Qualcomm Incorporated, T-Mobile and Verizon. \nAbout 4G Americas: Unifying the Americas Through Mobile Broadband Technology \n4G Americas is an industry trade organization composed of leading telecommunications service providers and manufacturers.
