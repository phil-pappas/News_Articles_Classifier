Dering Hall, a trailblazing experiential shopping site that hit the scene in 2011, is expanding and re-launching with a new look and feel and a whole suite of enhanced services and sources. The site, which was founded by industry veteran Peter Sallick and top interior designer Steven Gambrel, was created to improve sourcing access for the design trade and savvy consumer. An early contextual commerce site, Dering Hall blends inspiring editorial content with its curated roster of home furnishing sources.\nLuxury design resources, previously only discoverable in the halls of of design centers, artisan studios, and designer ateliers, in the US and abroad, are now even easier to shop with Dering Hall. The new site boasts more than 500 curated brands--each with their own robust product offering, a special design-trade program, enhanced search functionality and sharing capability, as well as smart project management tools. These are complemented by compelling editorial and inspirational imagery from top designers and architects to make the search for the right object powerful from the get-go. As part of the strategic re-design, the Dering Hall team has grown, with several new talented staff members joining the ranks, including staff in Europe to further enhance its international offerings.\nSite co-founder Peter Sallick, CEO of Waterworks and founder of the Design Leadership Network, remarks, “When we first had the idea for the site, it was in response to Steven’s real need to easily and seamlessly search for furnishings across a wide range of insider sources. The reaction to Dering Hall was so positive from day one. We have been in constant contact with our passionate and engaged users, listening and responding to their needs. We’ve embraced this input and our evolution will ensure that the search for the finest design is always an useful, exceptional experience and that the search results are fantastic, delivering that ‘wow factor.’”\nAccording to Andrea Rubelli, CEO of Donghia, “Since the beginning, we have been excited by the idea of an online design center that really performs, allowing users to discover preeminent brands and designers in one effortlessly-navigable, smartly-designed place. When we heard of Dering Hall’s plans to further refine the site this fall, including strengthening and augmenting the merchandising, shop-ability and search-ability of its fabrics and wall-coverings section, we immediately jumped at the chance to add hundreds of our products to the platform.\"\nDering Hall is now equipped with new search filters and tags so that designers and consumers can shop by style, materials, location, and lead times and can save discoveries in sharable project folders. There's also enhanced ways to follow favorite brands and design professionals, as well as a special design-trade login for trade-only pricing and benefits. Sallick adds, “Right now it is all about shop-ability as we've refined and strengthened our merchandising. Like most tech companies, we are planning a series of accelerated iterations that build on this key aspect including the addition of more specific shopping tools, filters and tags for smart sourcing of rugs, fabrics and wall coverings this month.”\nAs part of the relaunch, Dering Hall has stepped up its partnerships with tradeshows, design centers and leading industry events, offering a virtual counterpart to live experiences, which widens access and audiences for participating brands. To that end, it is bringing its popular Wired & Inspired Virtual Showhouse series to key US markets including Atlanta, Los Angeles, High Point and Boston. Dering Hall has also expanded into the European market--with new companies joining each week—and had a larger presence at Decorex International in London this fall.\nFull of inspiring content, the site will continue to deliver daily editorial features in the new Dering Hall Journal. It will feature “Shop The Look” articles and inspiring editorials created by the Dering Hall team, as well as media contributors from over 80 design and shelter outlets. An exclusive gallery of top interior designers and architects completes the picture, allowing members to search for design talent and ideas from the foremost names in the industry.\nOther fall tradeshow and showroom partnerships include: Maison et Objet, What’s New, What’s Next at New York Design Center (NYDC), Thomas Lavin, Boston Design Market at Boston Design Center (BDC), High Point Market, San Francisco Fall Antiques Show and WestEdge. Dering Hall will build on the success of its first Wired & Inspired virtual Showhouse with additional events in key markets.\nAbout Dering Hall\nDering Hall is the premier shopping site and discovery platform dedicated to exceptional, high-end design.
