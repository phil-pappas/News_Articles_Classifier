The Apptive® platform will help meet growing demand for mobile solutions among mid-market retailers & B2B merchants, with compelling benefits for merchants and their customers: -Richest, most convenient shopping experience\n-Push notifications for timely engagement\n-Simplified ordering via Apple Pay, Android Pay, and other digital wallets\n-Improved customer service & repeat ordering\n-Integration with loyalty, CRM and in-store systems\nThe Apptive acquisition complements Unbound’s Mobile Presence® platform, used by hundreds of merchants for mobile and tablet sites and digital pop-up stores. Unbound’s growth has been dramatic: adding more than 100 customers every year, Unbound Commerce solutions are now used by more than 600 merchants. Customers include major brands such as Finish Line, Sears and Rockport.\nThrough the Mobile Presence and Apptive platforms, high-end, custom mobile solutions previously available only to large retailers are now available to mid-market clients. “Our customers are companies who want to get the most from mobile,” affirmed Keith Lietzke, co-founder and VP Marketing & Bus Dev. “We like creating customized solutions for our clients, while making them cost effective by leveraging our technology investments, and our experience in serving hundreds of merchants.”\nConcurrent with the acquisition, Unbound has doubled its size and moved into new headquarters in Newton Upper Falls, MA. Originally built in 1889 and home of the Gamewell Alarm Company for almost a century, the historic building at 88 Oak Street now houses the Chestnut Street Business Center – home to high tech, engineering and healthcare providers. Unbound has also expanded its software development and sales staff to meet new demand and Apptive team members have moved to Boston to join the team.\n“Through our new app-build capabilities, more merchants can take advantage of delivering deeper mobile commerce engagement,” said Srinivasarao Nandiwada (NSR), co-founder and CEO of Unbound Commerce. “Mobile sites are great for expanding reach and acquiring new customers. Mobile apps, by contrast, deliver richer, more satisfying interactions to the retailer’s best customers.”\nOut-of-the-box integration is provided for Shopify, Demandware, Magento, Big Commerce, Yahoo, Volusion, 3dCart and other popular e-commerce platforms, making commerce-enabled app development fast, affordable and effective for retailers of all sizes. Unbound also offers full custom app development for enterprise clients seeking a totally custom app experience for their customers.\nAccording to Internet Retailer, sales via mobile apps are on the rise, growing 69% to $59.86 billion in 2015 from $35.48 billion in 2014. A recent survey by Adobe showed that 57% of consumers preferred to use apps when completing a purchase compared to 43 percent for the mobile web.\n“We are truly excited to become a part of Unbound Commerce.” says Chris Belew, CEO of Apptive. “This is one of those situations where the combined company is greater than the sum of its parts. The Unbound platform together with the Apptive platform creates a powerful and unique solution in the eCommerce industry. The combination will enable us to build on our market leadership and to enable even more brands and retailers to succeed in the age of smartphones and tablets.”\nAbout Unbound Commerce\nWith more mobile and tablet commerce deployments than any other solution provider, Unbound Commerce is the industry’s #1 provider of mobile solutions for mid-market online retailers.
