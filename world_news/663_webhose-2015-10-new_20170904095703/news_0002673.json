Silverman’s partnership with Dart also includes the re-release of three of his catalog titles, I’d Rather Be Dreaming , May All Good Things , and Streaming Video Soul (with Eclectica). \nDart Music is designed to handle the complex metadata of classical music. Using Dart Music for digital distribution, classical artists can pay a flat rate to disseminate their music worldwide, just like other genres, without giving up a percentage of their royalties. The long-term vision of Dart Music is to capture more complex metadata so the important information traditionally associated with classical pieces can be a part of the digital experience. \n“ Resonance 2.3 ” is the first of three musical portraits for solo electric violin. Silverman’s riff-laden and melody-infused compositional style is as unique as his instrument of choice -- an electric 6-string violin. The beautiful soundscapes of “Resonance 2.3 ” take the listener on a journey beyond genre. Learn more about Silverman’s creative process here . \n“Enter Dart Music. They figured out how to organize the metadata so independent artists have instant accessibility. Thank goodness for these musically inspired high-tech data geeks,” said Silverman. \n“Technological development has always been at the core of what drives innovation in art music. No composer or performer has infused the advancements of the last 20 years more elegantly and successfully than Tracy Silverman,” said Dart Music founder Chris McMurty. \nSilverman stands as the leading electric violinist in the world. A graduate of Juilliard and a former member of the Turtle Island String Quartet, Silverman has made it his mission to spread the word of the electric violin through constant teaching opportunities and workshops around the country. Silverman also tours regularly, both as a soloist and with other musicians such as Roy “Futureman” Wooten, Philip Aaberg, and Mike Block. Tonight, he will be featured in a much-anticipated performance of Nico Muhly’s Seeing is Believing at Carnegie Hall with the American Symphony Orchestra. \nAbout Dart Music \nDart Music, the first fully automated digital distribution platform for classical music offering classical musicians and labels an effective, affordable option to make their music widely available and discoverable.
