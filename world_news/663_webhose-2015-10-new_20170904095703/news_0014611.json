There were loud cheers from people when KCR, as Rao is popularly known, rose to speak.\nModi, in his speech earlier, hailed Naidu's gesture in personally visiting KCR's house to invite him.\nCentral minister M Venkaiah Naidu congratulated KCR and Naidu for sharing the dais for the first time after the division of Andhra Pradesh. He said the states may have separated for administrative convenience but the Telugu people remain united.\nHe said the two chief ministers have shown the way that the two states could work together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:30:45.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
