Davidson, who was named a part of Women Tech Founders’ Leadership Council, will be speaking briefly at the organization’s next local event scheduled for October 19th at 1871 in the Merchandise Mart.\n“Both the tech and commercial real estate industries have historically attracted few women, however, over the past 15 years; women have transformed these male-dominated industries,” said Davidson. “Female executives are beginning to break barriers becoming mentors, and allowing millennial entrepreneurs to see the opportunities for women across both industries.”\nAccording to CoStar data, less than 15 percent of commercial real estate brokers are women. In comparison, Terri Brax, CEO of Women Tech Founders, notes that less than 10 percent of all startups are led by women, which also reflects the percentage of women who act as venture capitalists.\nTechnology, “is a tremendous opportunity for entrepreneurial and talented women,” said Brax. “We’ve created this community in an effort to ultimately overcome the challenges women have faced in founding tech companies and to support our fellow tech-entrepreneurs.”\nAccording to Brax, with the support of influencers like Lisa Davidson and Savills Studley, Chicago now ranks as Forbes’ leading city for female tech founders with 30 percent of startups being women led, climbing from only three percent in January, when Women Tech Founders was launched.\nThe upcoming conference being held October 19 at 1871 is entitled Women Founders: Using Tech to Change the World. It will showcase emerging female tech influencers from around the world, including speakers Roya Mahboob, from Afghanistan, who was introduced as one of Time's Top 100 Most Influential People in the World;” veteran female tech leader, Desiree Vargas of GiveForward.com; and Kristi Ross of Dough and Tasty Trade.\nFor more details, visit: http://womentechfounders.com/ .\nAbout Savills Studley\nSavills Studley is the leading commercial real estate services firm specializing in tenant representation.
