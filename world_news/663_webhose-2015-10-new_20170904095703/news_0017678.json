Our goal is to connect Hassad to Zamboecozone. With food products we have in Region 9 and ARMM areas, there is huge potential that there will be a programme or project with Hassad,” said Baddiri.\n“Our Halal industry is in infant stage and with Zamboecozone and investors like Hassad, will fast-track progress and promotion of the Philippine halal industry,” he added.\nWith the Asean Integration, there is a need for the Philippines to catch up with countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia with regard to the halal market.\nBeing largely dependent on food imports, Qatar is seen as a viable market for halal products from the Philippines.\n “As you know, Qatar’s food security is important. It imports 95 percent of its food and Mindanao can serve as supplier of food,” said Philippine Ambassador Wilfredo C Santos.\nHaving recently launched Kulinarya Qatar, an initiative to promote Philippine tourism via Filipino cuisine, Santos believes having a robust halal industry can turn the Philippines into a destination of choice for tourists from Qatar and the rest of the GCC.\nAside from making halal food available in hotels and food establishments, there is a need to provide additional facilities such as prayer rooms to attract more tourists to the Philippines, he added.\nBaddiri said Lao had met Philippine Department of Tourism Secretary Ramon R Jimenez, Jr who is keen to develop the Philippine halal industry with respect to tourism.\nWith regard to education, Lao said they wanted to harness partnerships by expanding the scholarship exchange programme to include other areas.\n“In the past, scholarships were in the religious aspect such as Shariah, Theology and Islamic Studies. We are interested to do that but we want to up the ante by not just focusing on theological and religious skills but scientific and technological skills as well,” she said.\n“We had several graduates from Middle Eastern countries who are learned theologians but when they come back to the Philippines, they lack employment opportunities,” she said, adding these graduates can be trained in other areas such as engineering and Islamic finance.\nThe delegation will meet Qatar Foundation officials tomorrow and discuss endowments and scholarships.\n“This is a good beginning and we will try to find out ways wherein the Philippines with NCMF and counterpart agencies and institutions like QU can work together and help each other in promoting shared interest,” said Baddiri.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:23:15.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
