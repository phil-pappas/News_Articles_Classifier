Amir Halevi, the tourism ministry’s director general, said 98 percent of tourists have remained in Israel since the current violence began, although some have avoided the capital. El Al said that so far it has not seen cancellations. Fattal and Dan hotel chains said there have been “small numbers” of cancellations in Yerushalayim. Tel Aviv and Eilat are less affected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:43:02.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
