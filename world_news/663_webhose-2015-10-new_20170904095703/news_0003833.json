Lab Rescue of the LRCP is an example of a small organization that has achieved big things with iMIS:\nLab Rescue of the LRCP uses iMIS to manage all of their donor data. They chose iMIS in part because they could also use it to manage web content, their online store and self-service options on their website. Everything is integrated in one system, which helps them maximize their time. Since Lab Rescue started using iMIS, donor satisfaction levels are way up, partly because they can now easily send out thank yous and other regular communications faster and more frequently. Their small volunteer staff doesn’t have to juggle with numerous different spreadsheets any longer; they have more time for dog placements and fundraising, including a monthly giving program that offers a brand-new revenue and donor cultivation stream for the organization.
