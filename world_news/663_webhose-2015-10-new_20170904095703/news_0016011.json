The new partnership will enable Redington Value to distribute CyberArk's Privileged Account Security Platform across the Middle East and Africa region. \n\nCyberArk, the recognised market leader in Privileged Account Security, aims to prevent hackers from entering the system through a breach of administrator or key account holder privileges. The company's approach is to eliminate the advanced cyber threats, especially those that use privileged user credentials to attack the heart of the enterprise.\n\nMarketed with a slogan that it is dedicated to stopping attacks before they stop business, CyberArk proactively secures against cyber threats before attacks can escalate and do irreparable damage.\n\n\"A leader in the area of privileged access management, CyberArk offers a strong portfolio of products. Redington's wide presence in the region and focus on the value-add model aid the market expansion of CyberArk's security solutions in the region, especially among key strategic verticals such as banks, oil and gas companies and other financial and public institutions,\" says Ramkumar Balakrishnan, President, Value Distribution at Redington Gulf.\n\nCyberArk has gained a significant market share within a few years, gaining popularity as a security solutions provider that protects organisations from cyber attacks, which have made their way into the network perimeter.

Our Privileged Account Security Solution addresses the challenges of protecting privileged accounts and an organisation's sensitive information. Our partnership with Redington Value is crucial as it gives us the much needed exposure in this market to distribute our key solutions.\" \n\nThe company hopes to benefit from Redington Value's wide coverage of enterprise customers and resellers within the whole of Middle East and Africa (MEA). \"The partnership with Redington Value is a perfect match for our requirements.
