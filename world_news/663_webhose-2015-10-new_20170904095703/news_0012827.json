This education programme will also include a Digital Encyclopaedia, Virtual Labs -- a unique visual and interactive way of learning. \nAs part of this partnership, Flow customers will receive the basic education package at no additional cost with their Broadband service and will be able to upgrade at exclusively discounted prices. The education content will be available seamlessly across a Flow Study website, exclusive Flow Study apps, as well on the Flow Video On Demand TV platform. \n\"This is yet another demonstration of our commitment to technology investment for the development of the region,\" said John Reid, President of C&W Consumer Group. \"Through initiatives such as One on One we have a tremendous opportunity to provide our customers with access to high quality education tools across multiple platforms that would have otherwise been costly and unattainable,\" he added. \nReid also said, \"We went through a vigorous process to determine which provider had the best overall education solution in the region. Our quest led us to One on One, and we are truly delighted to be able to deliver the best to our customers.\" \nRicardo D. Allen, President & CEO of One on One Educational Services, also noted, \"We are very excited about this partnership with Cable & Wireless/Flow. This will propel our education programme to new heights, new markets and provide access that was considered unattainable.\" Allen further explained that in just a few years, his Company has enabled over 2,000 students in Jamaica alone, to enhance their performance at the CSEC/CAPE examination. He stated that several students have gained scholarships and grants toward their tertiary education. \nAllen added, \"Our vision has always been to expand our business model through enabling greater access to our products as well as to continue in our effort to create even more online learning content which we will be doing through this deal. Cable & Wireless Communications is the market leader in the Caribbean for the provision of mobile, broadband and TV and therefore this deal fits nicely into our strategic objective to educate students anywhere, at any time. Through this deal, in addition to Internet access, students will be able to prepare for their exam from the comfort of their living room, on their TV, or on-the-go via Flow's mobile platform. \nThe partnership is expected to continue the efforts of past initiatives of One on One to reduce the cost of education and increase the participation rate of children, and adults in learning. \"Our objective is to have everyone learning something; now it's GSAT, CSEC & CAPE and tomorrow it may well be CPA, ACCA & CFA. Wherever there is learning, Flow & One on One will be your partner,\" Allen stated. \nAbout C&W Communications Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (CWC) is a full service communications and entertainment provider, operating in the Caribbean and Latin America.
