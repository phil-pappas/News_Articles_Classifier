The addition of VoLTE strengthens reliability and failover mechanisms for VoIP-based phone systems. \nVoLTE is a standard, data-only technology that carries voice calls over the new LTE data network. Operators are in the early stages of deploying the technology, but adoption is gaining ground. \nVoIP Armor directly addresses and solves the problems of inconsistent voice quality and reliability of VoIP calls by creating an adaptive self-healing IP tunnel that adds reliability and protects against any negative network conditions such as starvation, loss, latency and jitter. It is available as a standalone appliance as well as built into Mushroom Networks' patented, flagship Truffle Broadband Bonding solutions, which aggregate and intelligently orchestrate multiple Internet access lines. The technology leverages two or more Broadband Bonded Internet links to protect the VoIP packets against loss, delay and jitter as well as against starvation from other cross traffic. The end result is that VoIP calls are highly reliable and consistently achieve high call quality. VoIP Armor also boosts simultaneous call capacity because of the increased WAN bandwidth of the bonded Internet lines. By adding VoLTE support, enterprises now have unmatched reliability for their VoIP-based systems and they no longer have to rely only on wired transport technologies such as DSL, cable, fiber, MPLS and others. \n\"With VoLTE support in VoIP Armor, enterprises can now take advantage of LTE based data connectivity for their voice communications, and they'll benefit from the self-healing features built into VoIP Armor device,\" said Cahit Akin, CEO of Mushroom Networks. \"In other words, a phone call will not be disrupted--even during wired line failures--because the VoIP traffic will seamlessly follow the LTE connection without dropping the call.\" \nAbout Mushroom Networks \nMushroom Networks, Inc., is a privately held company based in San Diego, CA, providing patent pending Broadband Bonding solutions to a range of Internet connection applications.
