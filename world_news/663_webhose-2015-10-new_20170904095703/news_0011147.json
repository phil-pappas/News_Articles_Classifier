If I turn my head, a headtorch illuminates the moist, rough walls of the narrow passage. Then I emerge in a wood. I turn my head to see a strange biomorphic statue behind me. Everything is real here, but none of it is real at all. The woods, the tunnel, the sculpture are completely three-dimensional and as I look around, the view changes as it does in real life. My headtorch picks out new, detailed bits of earth or bark, or a menacing shadow. This is exactly like walking in the world. But it is all an illusion.\nI take off the headgear. I’m back in an art gallery. Canadian artist Jon Rafman has created the surreal landscape I just explored with Oculus Rift, the headset that is expected to make virtual reality commercially real when it is put on the market. It’s worth visiting Rafman’s exhibition to get a free taste of this astonishing new stage in the digital revolution. Back in the early 90s, everyone thought virtual reality was about to take over the world. No film was complete without someone wearing a visored helmet and waving their arm about like a fool . But it turned out to be the internet that changed the world, while games simply turned to Renaissance perspective to make the flat expanse of a screen seem deep and spacious.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jon Rafman, Sculpture Garden (Hedge Maze), 2015, seen through Oculus Rift headset.\nThat is surely about to change. Oculus Rift really works. It will obviously alter the world of gaming, and it points the way to new possibilities in cinema, too. It really does put you in a simulacrum of real space that can be explored in all its eerily solid details.\nBut what will it offer art? Rafman is one of the first artistic users, but his efforts are not altogether convincing. His show at the Zabludowicz Collection in London is a sprawling exploration of some fairly cliched ideas about culture and technology. It is full of interactive gimmicks: you can shut yourself inside cabinets to watch his films, or even lie in a bath of plastic bubbles while sordid imagery flickers by. This would be fine if he was saying something more cogent and original, but the main message I received was that the information age is chaotic, confusing and crazy. I already knew that.\nThe best bit by far is his Oculus Rift experiment, which you reach at the centre of a dark labyrinth populated by bizarre sculptures. Putting on the headset and entering a virtual world is unsettling and undeniably novel.\nBut it’s the technology itself that is astonishing; the artists are the people who invented Oculus Rift. The scenario the artist has created is OK, but ultimately just a brief excursion into the surreal territory already explored much more scarily, without the help of Oculus Rift, by David Lynch or David Cronenberg.\nWell, fair enough. It is an experiment.\nRelated: Oculus Rift virtual reality headset will ship in early 2016\nSo Oculus Rift offers incredible possibilities for science fiction and horror cinema, not to mention brainless action films. Wait until James Cameron gets his hands on this shit. But what about artists?\nJames Turrell is one who might be able to go beyond what any games developer can dream up. Turrell’s light installations disrupt the senses and disorient you. Could he, or a much younger artist of his calibre, create an Oculus Rift experience that will truly blow your mind?\nI’m sure Olafur Eliasson and Mat Collishaw could also make something really beautiful or scary happen in this spookily real, unreal world.\nI am looking forward to it. Until then, it’s back to drinking three espressos in the Tate Britain cafe and staring at a Bridget Riley painting for kicks.", "external_links": ["http://www.flickeringmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/james_cameron_avatar1.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/8/1444324036373/46a46424-0815-4e12-a2e9-47869b212a44-1020x612.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=19bdd373e6dc95120f79d4b73853c519", "http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/virtual-reality/34409/the-top-12-virtual-reality-movies-of-the-1990s", "http://www.zabludowiczcollection.com/exhibitions/view/jon-rafman", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Oculus+Rift+will+change+the+world%2C+but+can+it+change+art%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fartanddesign%2Fjonathanjonesblog%2F2015%2Foct%2F08%2Foculus-rift-jon-rafman-art-virtual-reality&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F8%2F1444324036373%2F46a46424-0815-4e12-a2e9-47869b212a44-1020x612.jpeg", "http://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/anoraklynch4.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/8/1444324036373/46a46424-0815-4e12-a2e9-47869b212a44-1020x612.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=e8de663d828f256b6ac5dcc15141737b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/8/1444324036373/46a46424-0815-4e12-a2e9-47869b212a44-1020x612.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=13f541e166d71d582c43b290a287f5be", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2015/10/05/the-oculus-rift-is-going-to-be-very-expensive-at-launch/", "http://www.artists4parisclimate2015.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Olafur-Eliasson-12.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d5gm%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d5gm&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F8%2F1444324036373%2F46a46424-0815-4e12-a2e9-47869b212a44-1020x612.jpeg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Oculus%20Rift%20will%20change%20the%20world%2C%20but%20can%20it%20change%20art%3F&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d5gm%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/8/1444324036373/46a46424-0815-4e12-a2e9-47869b212a44-1020x612.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=74323be643ce067a36e3785ab6b9cbb7", "http://jamesturrell.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fh_bridgetsbardo-1400x1000.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:12:44.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
