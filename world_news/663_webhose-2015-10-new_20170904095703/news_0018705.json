More than 4,800 gamers aged 7-54 were surveyed Aug. 24-Sept. 19 for the rankings. Rankings take into account consumer awareness, purchase interest, purchase urgency consumer rating and other factors.\nSeveral other new chapters in popular game series are highly desired including Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate (Ubisoft, Oct. 23) and Fallout 4 (Bethesda Softworks, Nov. 10), both of which drew 95% anticipation ratings and will be released for PS4, Xbox One and PCs.\nA screen shot from the video game 'Halo 5: Guardians.' (Photo: Microsoft/343 Industries)\nHalo 5: Guardians (343 Industries, Oct. 27) got a 100% rating among games coming only to Xbox One. Thus, Black Ops III \"is the most anticipated title releasing on multiple platforms this holiday season, but on the Xbox One platform specifically, Halo 5 has slightly higher anticipation,\" said Scott Pitchford, Nielsen Games' director of research and client consulting.\nOther much anticipated games include Need for Speed (Electronic Arts, Nov. 3, PS4, Xbox One), which had a 92% rating, Star Wars: Battlefront (EA, Nov. 17, PS4, Xbox One, PCs) with an 88% rating, Rise of the Tomb Raider (Square Enix/Crystal Dynamics, Nov. 10, Xbox One) at 80% and Rock Band 4 (Harmonix/Mad Catz, Tuesday, PS4, Xbox One) at 76%.\nWith the growing hype around Star Wars , it might surprise some that Need for Speed is more anticipated than the upcoming Star Wars: Battlefront game.\n\"There is certainly a lot of buzz around anything Star Wars right now, and Battlefront was a popular franchise during it’s relatively brief existence 10 years ago,\" Pitchford said. \"Having been dormant for a long while, combined with the fervor for Star Wars , it makes sense that it would rank highly, and it does. But Need For Speed is a long-standing mainstay in the racing genre, and the franchise itself has been around for over 20 years. And while it hasn’t been terribly long since the last release, the brand did take a year off last year, and this will be the first Need for Speed title on the 8th Generation consoles. So I can understand why the anticipation for it might be a little higher than usual this year.\"\nThe most anticipated PlayStation 4-only game: Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection (Friday). And the most anticipated game for Nintendo's Wii U is Yoshi's Woolly World (Oct. 16).\nA chart showing Nielsen's Game Rank findings for fall 2015.
