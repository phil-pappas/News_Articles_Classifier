Joshua Dowling News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nDIEHARD Holden fans have pushed sales of V8 Commodores to new heights two years before production is due to come to an end. \nMore than one-third of all Commodores sold today is a V8, but that ratio is expected to increase as buyers get in before it’s too late and collectors snap them up to put away for keeps. \nThe latest Commodore SS is powered by the same V8 that was once used by the Chevrolet Corvette, and Holden engineers fitted a “sound enhancer” to pump more of the V8 roar from the engine bay into the cabin. \nHolden has confirmed there will not be a V8 in the next generation 2018 Commodore, which is expected to be available only with four-cylinder or V6 power. \nWhich is why News Corp Australia took the last of the breed on a symbolic journey from its birthplace — the end of the assembly line in Elizabeth — to its spiritual home, Mount Panorama, ahead of this weekend’s Bathurst 1000 race.

Source: News Limited \n“I think the Commodore helped keep GMH alive in Australia at various times,” says Richards. “You’ve got to remember there weren’t as many cars on the market back in those days as we have today. There were Ford families and Holden families. But now we’re spoiled for choice.” \nHolden V8 Supercar hero Mark Skaife says the end of Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon manufacturing in Australia within a couple of years is “a travesty”. \n“They are the best value rear-wheel-drive sedans in the world. But Australians today aren’t buying enough of them,” says Skaife. \n“The car market is too congested, there are too many models to choose from. But we won’t realise what we’re missing until they’re gone.” \nThis reporter is on Twitter: @JoshuaDowling", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:54:47.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
