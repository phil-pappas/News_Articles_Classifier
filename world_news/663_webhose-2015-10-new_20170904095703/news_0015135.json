TWAIN-compliant scanners? Check and check. \nQuantum of Paperless \nThe advent of today’s audit “document container” applications has transitioned every aspect of audit production into a digital format. The key to successfully using these engagement applications is to make sure your personnel have the optimal equipment with them to work digitally. image capture equipment and remote communications capabilities. \nFirms have experienced how dual monitors improved overall productivity within the office and it is time for auditors to take that advantage into the field as well. \nAccording to the AAA 2015 Paperless Benchmark Survey, 74 percent of firms were already doing this and it is expected that this percentage will increase as accountants also use their tablets as an additional screen. As the tax department upgrades to triple or dual oversize monitors, older flat-panel monitors are available for the audit team to take into the field or portable units such as Lenovo’s LT1421 and HP’s U160 are utilized. Firms should always pilot a mobile monitor as firms that purchased budget monitors have in the past found them to have inadequate brightness options, be too bulky to transport and have poor screen clarity. \nWhile it is preferable to have clients transfer files electronically to the firm, a number of supporting documents are not available to the auditor until they are on site and meeting with the client. For those documents that are only in a physical format, the audit team should have access to a portable scanner that can capture images at a speed of at least 10 pages per minute. \nTraditionally, firms have standardized on the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX series , which has been cost-effective and portable. One problem is that the ScanSnap has not been “TWAIN” compliant. TWAIN capabilities allow a scanned image to be edited as a document rather than as an image and today’s audit engagement tools can import TWAIN documents directly into the index. \nThis has led a shift to firms either buying the more expensive Fujitsu fi series scanners or to other portable scanners such as the Canon DR series that are TWAIN-compliant. Both scanners come with a full version of Adobe Acrobat, which helps offset the cost of the scanner. \nFinally, it is critical that firms provide Internet connectivity to all audit team members so that they can access firm resources, synchronize their audit binders and enter time and expenses daily. \nOften, clients provide audit teams with a usable Internet connection. When clients provide access it is a good idea to outline the parameters in the engagement letter. In any audit engagement of more than a few days, firms need to provide alternative access through the digital cellular networks if the client cannot provide usable access. \nUSB or integrated air cards and mobile \"hotspots\" provide Internet access at speeds from 100Kbps to over 1Mbps, which is effective if the firm has remote access through a cloud-based application, a direct link to their office workstation (via remote desktop access) or a more robust solution such as Citrix or Remote Desktop Server for a larger number of users. \nNewer tools such as smartphone \"hotspots\" and the Novatel MiFi allow up to five auditors to share one connection. \nRECOMMENDED ACTION: Outfit audit teams with appropriate digital tools and training to work effectively in the field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:47:43.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
