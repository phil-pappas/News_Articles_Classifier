A new survey from global cybersecurity association ISACA suggests a major confidence gap about the security of connected devices between the average consumer and cybersecurity and information technology professionals. \nAccording to the consumer segment of ISACA’s 2015 IT Risk/Reward Barometer , 65 per cent of Australian consumers are confident they can control the security on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices they own. Yet according to 7,016 global IT and cybersecurity professionals who responded to a parallel survey, only 22 per cent feel this same confidence about controlling who has access to information collected by IoT devices in their homes. This number (19 per cent) is even lower among Australian IT professionals. Globally, 72 per cent of IT and cybersecurity professionals say manufacturers are not implementing sufficient security in IoT devices. \nMore than 80% of Australian consumers consider themselves somewhat or very knowledgeable about the IoT and the average estimated number of IoT devices in their home is six. Smart TVs, fitness trackers and smart watches are the most wanted devices to purchase in the next 12 months. \nThe Hidden IoT \nISACA’s survey of IT and cybersecurity professionals depicts an IoT that flies below the radar of many IT organisations – an invisible risk that is underestimated and under-secured. Among the Australian respondents: 61 percent believe their IT department is not aware of all of their organisation’s connected devices (e.g., connected thermostats, TVs, fire alarms, cars) 72 percent estimate the likelihood of an organisation being hacked through an IoT device is medium or high 57 percent think that the increasing use of IoT devices in the workplace has decreased employee privacy \n“In the hidden IoT, also invisible are the countless entry points that cyber attackers can use to access personal information and corporate data,” said Christos Dimitriadis, Ph.D., CISA, CISM, CRISC, international president, ISACA, and group director of information security, INTRALOT. “The rapid spread of connected devices is outpacing an organisation’s ability to manage and safeguard company and employee data.” \nISACA’s consumer research suggests that Australian consumers are likely to value businesses that demonstrate their expertise in cybersecurity best practices: 93 per cent of Australian consumers say it is important that data security professionals hold a cybersecurity certification if they work at organisations with access to the consumers’ personal information. \nISACA established Cybersecurity Nexus (CSX) to help organisations develop their cybersecurity workforce and help individuals advance their cybersecurity careers. Details on CSX 2015 conference and the new CSX Practitioner certification: https://cybersecurity.isaca.org . \nISACA’s annual Risk/Reward Barometer polls thousands of IT and cybersecurity professionals and consumers worldwide to uncover attitudes and behaviors, and the trade-offs people make to balance risk and reward. Results: www.isaca.org/risk-reward-barometer . \nISACA ® ( isaca.org ) is a global nonprofit association of 140,000 professionals in 180 countries.
