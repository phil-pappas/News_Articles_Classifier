Joined by Battelle, a research and development firm based in Ohio , they gave people a glimpse into the future of transportation. \nThe two areas they've been working on are self-driving cars and \"connected\" vehicles -- smart cars that use sensors to warn drivers of danger. \nGannett Fleming President Bob Scaer said his dream is to use a phone to call his car to pick him up. Then his car would drive him to his destination while avoiding traffic and prolonged stop lights. Finally, his car would drop him off and park itself. \nWhile that dream is still a few years away, smart car technology is being used in vehicles and may get more integrated into vehicles. How 'Connected' Cars Can Improve Driver, Pedestrian Safety How 'Connected' Cars Can Improve Driver, Pedestrian Safety \nWhat Gannett Fleming and Battelle are working on would connect vehicles to the environment around them, including other vehicles, traffic lights, emergency responders, crosswalks and more. \nFor example, they outfitted a small bus with the sensor technology and drove it through a setup intersection with someone crossing. \nA pedestrian symbol popped up on a large screen that told the driver that someone was crossing. The color of the symbol changed from yellow to red if the driver dangerously continued to operate toward a pedestrian. \nRobert Zimmer, a senior systems engineer with Battelle, called the connected set-up \"WIFI on steroids.\" \nEric Rensel, with Gannett Fleming, said the technology being developed are meant to make driving safer. On average, 40,000 people die a year in vehicle collisions in the United States. \n\"A lot of the changes are subtle changes,\" Rensel said. \"I think the auto makers intend to phase this technology into their fleet in future model years.\" \nZimmer estimated that vehicles will begin being connected with one another through sensors, hardware and software within five years. Auto manufactures, Zimmer said, are planning to install smart car technology into their upcoming vehicles. \nRensel said the installation of smart car technology could become mandatory in the future, like seat belts and antilock brakes. \"From what I've seen at trade shows and industry shows, research on this has been done for a number of years but advancements in technology... is allowing a lot of this to come to fruition,\" Rensel said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:05:35.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
