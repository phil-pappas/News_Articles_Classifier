Credit: University of Leicester \nThe University of Leicester announces today the signature of a contract to develop an innovative new type of X-ray mirror for a telescope to be flown on an orbiting observatory to be launched in 2021. \nThe Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a joint Chinese-French satellite observatory. Designed to study the most powerful explosions in the Universe out to the era of the first generation of stars, SVOM will locate hundreds of gamma-ray bursts signifying the deaths of massive stars. \nUniversity of Leicester scientists with its Space Research Centre instrumentation and engineering staff in the Department of Physics and Astronomy have developed a unique capability to make a new kind of super-light-weight X-ray focussing optic. \nTraditional X-ray mirrors for space telescopes are made of solid glass or metal and weigh tens of kilograms or more. The new 'Lobster' X-ray mirror for SVOM weighs just one kilo, and so is much easier to launch into orbit. \nProfessor Julian Osborne, who is leading this work at Leicester explained: \"Lobsters and similar animals use reflecting mirrors to focus light in their eyes, unlike the lenses used by people. We can make man-made Lobster-type mirrors with the very high degree of smoothness needed to focus X-rays, and make them robust enough to survive the rigours of a rocket launch.\" \nThe Lobster X-ray optic derives from recent work by the Space Research Centre at the University in making a novel X-ray instrument to study the surface of the planet Mercury. This Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) will be launched by the European Space Agency for its seven-year journey in 2017. Both MIXS and SVOM use square-pore micro-channel plate focussing units made from glass, although MIXS has a more conventional optical design than the SVOM Lobster. Professor Mark Sims of the Space Research Centre said \"The design, construction and test of such micro-channel plate optics have been studied by the Space Research Centre for over a decade.\" The MIXS Flight Model. Credit: University of Leicester \nThe University of Leicester team has secured a contract from the French Space Agency, CNES, for the manufacture of a Lobster X-ray focussing optic for SVOM that has a value of £3.8M. The final version of the optic to be launched will be delivered to CNES at the end of 2019. \nSVOM will continue the work of finding gamma-ray bursts currently being done by the US/UK/Italian satellite Swift, which is now in the 11th year of its life. Scientists at the University have been making world-leading breakthroughs in the discoveries of gamma-ray bursts in the Swift era, and are looking forward to the new capabilities that SVOM will bring. \nHead of Department, Professor Paul O'Brien, said: \"SVOM will be launched at a very exciting time, when new ground-based observatories will enable us to learn more about these fascinating objects that will be located by SVOM. We will be working with our French and Chinese colleagues to continue to learn more about these vast explosions.\" 31 minutes ago 0 Worldwide hunt to solve the mystery of gamma-ray bursts February 16, 2008 \nUK space scientist Emeritus Professor Alan Wells is to speak at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston in February on International Cooperation in Developing Swift and its Scientific Achievements. Student shows James Webb Space Telescope will be able to observe afterglows from earliest gamma-ray bursts May 15, 2014 \nA 25-year-old PhD student from Perth, Australia, has had his research recognized by NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute for its contribution to their upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), to be launched in 2018. Swift satellite gets ringing endorsement from NASA May 28, 2014 \nAn astronomical satellite, of which the University of Leicester and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory of University College London are key partners, has received a ringing endorsement from NASA. Mystery of rare five-hour space explosion explained September 17, 2014 \nNext week in St. Petersburg, Russia, scientists on an international team that includes Penn State University astronomers will present a paper that provides a simple explanation for mysterious ultra-long gamma-ray bursts—a ... How gamma ray telescopes work September 22, 2014 \nYesterday I talked about the detection of gamma ray bursts, intense blasts of gamma rays that occasionally appear in distant galaxies. Gamma ray bursts were only detected when gamma ray satellites were put into orbit in the ... Launch of India's first ever black hole space observation satellite September 24, 2015 \nResearchers from the University of Leicester have been involved in the development of the first ever Indian satellite dedicated to astronomical observations, including of black holes, which will be launching from the Satish ... Recommended for you X-ray emission from massive stars October 26, 2015 \nMassive young stars are known to emit strong X-rays. Unlike the X-ray emission from lower mass stars, however, which arises in stellar photospheres, the X-rays from massive stars are thought to result from powerful shocks. ... Missing gravitational waves lead to black hole rethink October 21, 2015 \nHuman understanding of galaxies and black holes is being called into question after an 11-year search for mysterious gravitational waves—famously predicted by Albert Einstein 100 years ago—failed to find anything. In unexpected discovery, comet contains alcohol, sugar October 23, 2015 \nComet Lovejoy lived up to its name by releasing large amounts of alcohol as well as a type of sugar into space, according to new observations by an international team. The discovery marks the first time ethyl alcohol, the ... Astronomers peer inside stars, finding giant magnets October 22, 2015 \nAstronomers have for the first time probed the magnetic fields in the mysterious inner regions of stars, finding they are strongly magnetized. Most earth-like worlds have yet to be born, according to theoretical study October 20, 2015 \nEarth came early to the party in the evolving universe. According to a new theoretical study, when our solar system was born 4.6 billion years ago only eight percent of the potentially habitable planets that will ever form ... Final kiss of two stars heading for catastrophe October 21, 2015 \nUsing ESO's Very Large Telescope, an international team of astronomers have found the hottest and most massive double star with components so close that they touch each other.
