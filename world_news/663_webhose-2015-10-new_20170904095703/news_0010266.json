In addition, rapidly changing market dynamics, deregulation and cyber-asset protection requirements are forcing Utilities to consider new technology solutions.\nThe demand for secure serial to Ethernet equipment in substations is rising as power utility and distribution companies move to satisfy their NERC CIP requirements. These devices must conform to the demanding environment conditions found in these locations such as: Electric & Magnetic Fields, Electrostatic Discharge, Conducted High Frequency Electrical Transients, High Energy Power Surges and Ground Potential Rise during ground faults.\n“Legislation designed to increase data protection and security means that Utility companies need to restructure their systems,” comments John Feeney, COO at Perle Systems. “To accomplish this they need technology designed to meet emission, immunity and safety approvals required for substation IT equipment.”\nPerle IOLAN Electric Utility Terminal Servers are designed to meet the harsh environments associated with power substations. IOLAN’s are used to connect any serial based equipment including protective relays to Ethernet. Industrial Temperature Media Converters are also integrated in many large Utilities to extend copper infrastructures over Fiber.\nA partial client list and case studies of how Perle technology is used in the Utility sector can be found on Perle's website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:13:22.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
