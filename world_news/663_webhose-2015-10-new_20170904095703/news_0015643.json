The boy suffered bites with pronounced marks on his eyes, cheeks, legs, stomach and back on Friday (Sept. 25).\nThe boy's parents told the television station that the day care provider waited four hours to contact them, doing so only after the marks did not fade. The day care provider, who was not identified, told a reporter that she contacted the baby's parents within a few minutes of discovering the bites.\nTexas' Child Care Licensing agency shut down the woman's day care on Monday (Sept. 28) after an investigation revealed she had been operating for about eight years without a license. She has not been booked with any criminal charges, but the San Antonio Police Department is looking into the matter.\nThe incident bears similarities to a case that occurred in Westwego when then 22-month-old Carson Dufrene suffered 11 bites on his body on his first day at an unlicensed day care in Westwego.\nWestwego Police arrested day care operator Kayla Bellanger on July 13 and booked her with child desertion, accusing her of not properly supervising the children in her care. Bellanger has not been formally charged by the district attorney's office, according to Jefferson Parish court records. Carson's parents also filed a civil lawsuit asking for damages.\nRead the full report about the San Antonio case at kens5.com", "external_links": ["http://www.kens5.com/story/news/investigations/i-team/2015/09/29/unlicensed-day-care-operation-shut-down-after-infant-bitten-27-times/73042950/"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:46:02.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
