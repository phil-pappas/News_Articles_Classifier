(NASDAQ:NTGR) ( www.netgear.com ), a global networking company that delivers innovative products to consumers, businesses and service providers, is expanding its portfolio of next-generation DOCSIS® 3.0-compatible cable products that support the most extreme broadband speeds and service tiers offered by major U.S. cable Internet Service Providers. The new NETGEAR CM600 High Speed Cable Modem ( www.netgear.com/cm600 ) is designed for cable Internet subscribers who want the industry’s fastest cable Internet download speeds for better HD and 4K streaming and gaming. \nThe NETGEAR CM600 High Speed Cable Modem with a Gigabit Ethernet port has the latest DOCSIS 3.0-certified 24x8 channel bonding modem technology that supports extreme Internet cable download speeds up to an incredible 960Mbps.* It’s a great option to ensure you can scale up to the highest Internet cable speed that your service provider offers. Step up your home network performance to improve HD video streaming, high-speed online gaming, and faster downloads. \nCable Internet bandwidth is shared with other cable subscribers in your neighborhood, so you may see decreased performance during peak usage times. However, having a high-speed cable modem like the new NETGEAR CM600 (which supports 24 download bonded channels simultaneously) means that you have a fatter “pipe” for Internet traffic as compared to your neighbors with a cable modem that only supports four download bonded channels. As a result, during peak hours the fatter pipe will help you receive the subscribed data speed of your cable service. \nAn additional benefit is that the CM600 modem will pay for itself in about a year. By owning your own modem, you’ll avoid your Internet provider’s monthly modem rental fee and save money over time. \n“Your cable provider is upgrading its Internet infrastructure to provide faster and faster cable Internet speeds. To take full advantage of it you need the right cable equipment to support it,” said Sandeep Harpalani, NETGEAR’s senior director of product marketing for Retail Networking Products. “Our CM600 Cable Modem is a very easy way to upgrade your home cable equipment. It not only enables you to scale up to faster Internet cable speed tiers, but also ensures that during peak hours you don’t see any degradation in performance,” he added. “This is an extremely wise investment for ensuring you always get the best Internet speed from your cable provider.” \nThe CM600 High Speed Cable Modem is abest-in-classCableLabs®-certified DOCSIS® 3.0 cable modem that provides a connection to high-speed cable from major U.S. cable Internet providers like Comcast XFINITY® and more. It provides ultra-fast cable speedswith 24x8 channel bonding that supports 24 download and 8 upload channels simultaneously. The CM600 supports IPv6 and is equipped with a Gigabit Ethernet LAN port, so you’ll benefit from faster wired speeds when connecting your computer or your wireless router. What’s more, XFINITY customers can install the CM600 without a service call thanks to the CM600’s fast, web-based self-activation capability. \nPricing and Availability \nThe CM600 High Speed Cable Modem is available now from major retailers in stores and online, at an MSRP of $129.99 in the U.S. \nMore Information \nVisit the website at www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/cable-modems-routers to find a NETGEAR Cable Family device that’s a match for your budget and Internet needs so you can experience easier and faster home networking.
