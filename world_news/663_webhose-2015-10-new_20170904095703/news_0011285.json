Over the next 10 years, the Authority plans to more than triple that investment, calling for another $152 million in improvements.\nCurtis Foltz said: “In order to ensure efficient processing of cargo, our capacity must remain higher than current demand. To that end, we will be improving Brunswick facilities serving each of our major business sectors here, including automotive, breakbulk and bulk cargo.”\nIn one of those projects, the GPA intends to add a fourth berth to serve ro/ro cargo at Colonel’s Island Terminal.\nThe GPA has submitted a permit request to the US Army Corps of Engineers for the new berth, and hopes to begin construction in 2016.\nJimmy Allgood, Vice Chairman of the GPA, said: “Served by eight ocean carriers, Colonel’s Island Terminal offers three modern Ro/Ro berths and four on-terminal auto processors, handling cargo for more than 60 auto and heavy machinery manufacturers.\n“With 281 ha in use and 259 ha permitted for expansion on Colonel’s Island, GPA can easily accommodate additional Ro/Ro business.”\nThe GPA is currently preparing 16 ha on the south side of Colonel’s Island to be pad-ready for new port customers.\nThe 2016 fiscal year projects include additional earthwork on the south side of Colonel's Island, the next phase of the Anguilla Junction Rail Yard expansion, the first phase of a berth upgrade at Mayor's Point, and East River Terminal improvements.\nJames Walters, Chairman of the GPA, said: “Another important infrastructure improvement is the maintenance dredging that must be funded by the federal government. Securing sufficient funding for Brunswick harbor maintenance is our top priority right now.”\nCurtis Foltz concluded: “Brunswick’s deepwater terminals turned in another solid year in all cargo sectors. Colonel’s Island, Mayor’s Point and East River provide efficient, cost-effective links to overseas markets for U.S. factory and farm production.”\nFor all the latest on Georgia Ports, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:32:07.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
