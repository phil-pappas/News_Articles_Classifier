Wearing a face mask might not be the whole picture in terms of limiting our exposure to hazardous air pollution – a new study by John Kissel and colleagues suggests our skin, the largest organ in the human body, might be capable of absorbing certain health-damaging chemicals at the same, if not higher, rate as our lungs.

Participant age was also found to be significant. “The uptake of DEP by the 66-year-old is five times greater than that of the 27-year-old, while the uptake of DnBP is seven times greater.” \nDespite the small sample size and somewhat artificial study conditions (e.g., the subjects were allowed to only wear shorts), these findings, especially when coupled with earlier research, which indicates that phthalate levels may build up in our bodies over many years, is certainly a cause for concern. \n“[I]f the whole body is exposed, then even low rates of exposure can deliver what turns out to be nontrivial amounts of these chemicals,” said Kissel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:38:29.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
