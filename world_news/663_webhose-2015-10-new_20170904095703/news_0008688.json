He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules that bar officials from speaking to journalists without authorization.\nPrime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has said that the main focus of the investigation into the blasts is the Islamic State group. He said Wednesday that the PKK were also under suspicion.\n\"As the investigation deepens, and based especially on certain results we have obtained through Twitter accounts and IP addresses, we can see that both Daesh (IS) and the PKK are groups that are likely to have played an active role,\" Davutoglu said.\nAnalysts, however, expressed skepticism about claims of the PKK's involvement, given that the attack targeted Kurdish activists.\nTurkish authorities on Wednesday imposed a ban on reporting on the details of the investigation.\nThe two suicide bombings struck at the heart of the capital just weeks before Turkey holds a national election on Nov. 1, following an inconclusive election in June and after a summer of violence that has claimed hundreds of lives.\nNo one has claimed responsibility but the attacks bore similarities to an attack in July that killed 33 people and which has been blamed on IS.\nThe two suspects allegedly posted tweets that said: \"The bomb will explode in Ankara\" and \"What if (the Islamic State group) explodes (a bomb) in Ankara?\"\nTurkey's Interior Ministry said Ankara's police chief and two police chiefs in charge of security and intelligence in the city had been suspended, apparently pending the outcome of an investigation into possible security flaws.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:11:11.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
