Movers and shakers of the world economy are trying to close in on the magic number of $100 billion a year to fight climate change \nBut while development banks could indeed do more, governments should not be let off the hook, climate experts say. \n\"Multilateral institutions can do more, but countries must also do more,\" said UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's point man on climate change, Under-Secretary General Janos Pasztor. \nInternational charity Oxfam's climate policy expert Isabel Kreisler echoed that view, saying: \"Both the multilateral banks and governments should pay more.\" \n'All that glitters...' \nResponding to such appeals, the Inter-American Development Bank pledged Thursday to increase climate finance from about 14 percent of lending to between 25 and 30 percent by 2020. \nAnd the Asian Development Bank announced last month it would increase climate finance from $3 billion to $6 billion, directing 30 percent of its lending toward green projects. \nPierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, meanwhile said he would pile \"positive pressure\" on European Union members to rise to the occasion in Peru, particularly the 10 countries that have yet to make pledges on climate funding ahead of the Paris talks. \"Multilateral institutions can do more, but countries must also do more,\" says UN point man on climate change, Under-Secretary General Janos Pasztor \nBut is $38.2 billion more even enough? \nSome activists are critical of the OECD's calculations, saying part of the $61.8 billion in climate funding it reported should not have been counted. \n\"All that glitters isn't gold,\" Oxfam's Kreisler told AFP. \nShe said supposedly \"green\" funding such as agricultural projects had been counted even when not directly linked to fighting climate change. Oxfam says supposedly \"green\" funding such as agricultural projects has been counted even when not directly linked to fighting climate change \nActivists have also criticized the OECD for counting too many loans, which will have to be repaid, saying more of the $100 billion should be in the form of grants. \n\"There are still problems with the accounting method, which includes a lot of loans,\" said Denis Voisin, of the Nicolas Hulot Foundation, a French environmental group. \n\"For now, the OECD report is a report for the countries of the north.... And that's great. But now all countries need to get involved in this process,\" Pasztor told AFP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:26:35.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
