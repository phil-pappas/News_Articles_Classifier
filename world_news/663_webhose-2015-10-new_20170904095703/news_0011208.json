DUBLIN, IRELAND, October 24,   devolo, the leader in Powerline communication solutions is expanding into the Irish energy market. Data transfer via Powerline with devolo G3-PLC technology, which uses the frequency band between 150 and 500 kHz, provides the energy sector with the best network coverage, excellent bandwidth and perfect building penetration. Joint pilot tests with Vattenfall Metering GmbH and a variety of German network operators have resulted in impressive results using G3 Powerline technology for wide area network (WAN) communication in the smart grid. Topics in this press release: - The roll-out in Ireland: Hardware and Logistics - Data transfer via power line to every corner of the distribution network - Safety and data privacy in Smart Grid The roll-out in Ireland: Hardware and Logistics Ireland has ambitious goals in the smart grid field: 2.2 million smart meters will be installed in all households and SMEs by 2020. This will lead to more transparency as well as an estimated 2.5% decrease in electricity consumption. It will also form the basis of an all-Ireland wide smart grid which will enhance reliability as well as increase the use of fluctuating energy sources. As the leading European company in Powerline communication solutions, devolo has already sold over 25 million adapters within Europe. No other G3-PLC technology has undergone such comprehensive, hands-on testing to date. With many years of experience and market leadership in the Powerline business, devolo AG has a global supply chain that stands for the highest quality and reliability. Additional production capacity of nearly unlimited proportions can be set up in less than four months at the manufacturing sites. \"With multiple manufacturing locations, logistics centres worldwide and plenty of experience in high-volume markets, we are perfectly prepared for entering the Irish market\", explains Heiko Harbers, CEO of devolo AG. Data communication over existing power lines (power line communications, or PLC) is a central communication technology in a smart grid. The benefits of Powerline technology compared to wireless technologies and telecommunications networks are especially great in wide-branching distribution networks, like Ireland's. With G3-PLC technology in a frequency band of 150-500 kHz, not only is the necessary data rate achieved without difficulty, but so is the required range. With this in mind, devolo, the Powerline pioneer, has been producing the \"G3-PLC modem 500k\" for data communication in the electricity distribution network as a batch series product since the beginning of 2015. Data transfer via power line to every corner of the distribution network The data transfer via power line with G3-PLC technology with the use of the frequency band between 150 and 500 kHz enables a reliable data transfer without any issues. It provides the Energy sector with the best network coverage, excellent bandwidth and perfect building penetration. The previous successful pilot test with Vattenfall Metering and two other German distribution network operators was the largest test of G3 Powerline technology to date, and included 1,000 G3-PLC modems from devolo. \"The G3-PLC modem 500k has no problem transmitting data through buildings. However, WAN communication using wireless technologies would not have been possible due to the solid construction of the office complexes and shopping centres,\" explains Dr. Michael Koch, adding, \"Through this extensive pilot test, devolo has demonstrated that G3-PLC technology in the frequency band of 150 to 500 kHz has the requisite bandwidth for smart metering. In addition, all of the metering points in the network cluster are accessible without repeaters, which saves network operators both time and money.\" Safety and data security in Smart Grid In addition to data communication, data security is also a key aspect within the smart grid sector. devolo recognised this issue early on, and over a period of several years has developed great expertise in secure handling of data. For the German market, devolo has added the \"devolo smart meter gateway\" to its product portfolio, which is to be launched next year. Another complement to the product portfolio next year will be the \"devolo control box\". It allows network operators to control decentralised energy suppliers and prosumers, users of photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, electric vehicles and thermal storage heating systems, and thus maintain stability of the mains supply network. devolo's increase in workforce and expertise has brought with it a multitude of new possibilities in research, development and marketing in the Smart Metering and Smart Grid area. \"We are using this clear focus to underscore our commitment to the energy revolution and the accompanying conversion of the mains supply to a smart grid throughout Europe\", explains Heiko Harbers, CEO of devolo AG.
