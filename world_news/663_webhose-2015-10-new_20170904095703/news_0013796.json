Air-supported conveyors for food produce \nAerobelt air-supported conveyors are available in a variety of sizes and capacities to transport food produce, such as barley, rice and sugar. \nBelt widths range from 300mm to 1.8m, while conveyor lengths range from a few metres to several hundred metres and are available in a single or multi-stage configuration. \nConveyor tonnage rates vary from a few tonnes per hour to more than 2,000t per hour. Fan-produced air-cushion belt conveyors \nAerobelt's conveyors are air-cushioned belt conveyors. The belt is carried on a film of air, which is blown by a small fan into the air box (plenum) under the conveyor belt. Each fan is sufficient for approximately 200m of belt conveyor. \nThe amount of air-holes in the trough, the air pressure and the volume are customised to the produce being conveyed. \nThe standard construction material used is galvanised-steel; however, other installations have used stainless-steel for some or all components to meet hygienic, corrosive and abrasive environment requirements. Low belt friction and smooth movement air-supported belt conveyors \nThe non-conventional construction of Aerobelt conveyors offers low belt friction and smooth movement of produce, thanks the range's air-supported belt design. \nStandard belt conveyors disturb produce during conveyance to the extent that there is product loss, contamination and abrasion. \nAerobelt conveyors minimise product degradation when conveying large volumes, due to their fast and smooth conveyance. \nOther advantages of Aerobelt air-supported conveyors include: Produce can be conveyed at steeper inclines thanks to the low product disturbance Fewer moving parts offer quieter operation and less maintenance Improved safety with a physical barrier separating personnel and loaded belts Low power consumption offers smaller drives, reduced power requirements and lighter construction Reversible, single and dual-drive belt conveyors \nThe Australia-based company's conveyors are reversible, enhancing the efficiency of both directions of conveyor feed. \nAs required by individual applications, Aerobelt conveyors can reverse with a single or dual-drive. Food-grade belt conveyors \nUnlike their conventional conveyor equivalents, less expensive, lighter belts can be used due to the reduced working tension. Aerobelt conveyors can facilitate a variety of belt types, including food-grade belts, fire-resistant, anti-static (FRAS) belts and high-temperature belts (200Â°C). \nAerobelt also has a range of conveyors to accommodate concave and convex profile curves to follow the curves of existing conveyor support gantries; if required, concave and convex curves can be accommodated in the same conveyor. Air-supported belt conveyor supply, installation and commissioning \nAerobelt can supply its air-supported conveyors on a supply only, supply and commission, or supply, install and commission basis. \nThe company is flexible to meet customer specific requirements and provides redesign and reconfiguration of existing support steelwork and footings services to meet individual customers' project needs. \nAerobelt's portfolio of conveyors for the food industry includes a variety of standard conveyors with a number of options available as standard. About Aerobelt Australia \nAerobelt's engineers have a wealth of experience in all types of Aerobelt design, installation and maintenance.
