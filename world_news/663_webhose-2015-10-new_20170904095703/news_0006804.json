During these discussions, we have clearly communicated to Montage our belief that there are financing, regulatory and other risks associated with its offer that make Montage's ability to close a transaction uncertain and significantly less likely than closing a transaction with Diodes. The Pericom Board of Directors has a duty to its shareholders to consider the likelihood of completing a transaction in assessing the overall value of an offer, and it currently believes that the additional premium represented by the $18.50 per share price of the Montage offer, as compared to the Diodes transaction, is insufficient to outweigh the significant timing and deal certainty risks for Pericom's shareholders that are associated with the transaction proposed by Montage. \nMontage briefly acknowledges certain risks in its preliminary proxy statement; however, it downplays the magnitude of these risks and the potential impact to Pericom's shareholders. Of particular concern is the fact that Montage still has not been able to obtain sufficient financing commitments to close a transaction or demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood that it will be able to obtain such commitments in a reasonable timeframe. The one-page financing letters from each of Bank of China Shanghai Pudong Branch and China Electronics Financial Co. Ltd. presented in the revised Montage offer simply fail to provide adequate assurance that Montage will be able to finance a proposed transaction with Pericom. Both commitment letters presented in Montage's revised offer are subject to broad conditions which provide the lenders with excessive discretion to withdraw their commitments. \nMoreover, Montage will need to obtain certain regulatory approvals to close the transaction that are not required under the Diodes Agreement, including approvals from governmental authorities in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan, and from the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. (CFIUS). Approvals from the required regulatory authorities are expected to take at least three to six months to obtain and may take considerably longer. In fact, the merger agreement proposed by Montage gives Montage up to one full year to obtain such approvals. Pericom has shared these concerns and others with Montage. However, to date Montage has been unable to adequately address those concerns and provide the requisite assurances that would give the Pericom Board confidence in Montage's ability to close a transaction. \nNevertheless, the Pericom Board is willing to continue discussions with Montage to determine if Montage can resolve the issues we have identified. While we remain open to further discussions with Montage, the Pericom Board reaffirms its recommendation to the Pericom Shareholders in support of the Diodes transaction, which it believes is currently the best course of action for our shareholders. Therefore, Pericom intends to continue to move forward with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with Diodes.\" \nCowen and Company is serving as independent financial advisor to Pericom, and Latham & Watkins is serving as the Company's legal counsel. \nAbout Pericom \nPericom Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: PSEM) enables serial connectivity with the industry's most complete solutions for the computing, communications, consumer and embedded market segments.
