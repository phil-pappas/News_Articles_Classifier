Rather than only deal with data on a transactional basis during the eDiscovery process, E-STET’s Insight Accelerator regularly turns data into actionable knowledge, allowing attorneys at law firms and corporations to take a proactive approach to issues like compliance, regulation, and litigation. Founded in 2007, with offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, E-STET provides eDiscovery and information governance solutions for AmLaw 100 law firms, corporations, and nonprofit organizations nationwide. E-STET has been promoting a more streamlined eDiscovery process with recent product and service releases, including Wind and Screen i/o .\n“We created Insight Accelerator because the process of getting relevant data to legal departments for compliance or for eDiscovery was incredibly inefficient,” said Michael Dunn , President of E-STET. “By having a single package providing a fixed-cost for technology experts, hardware, and software, a legal department will not only spend significantly less money on eDiscovery in the long-term, but will also be able to make more productive use of their data.”\nAnother stated goal of Insight Accelerator is addressing the issue of data security in the eDiscovery supply chain. Current practices entail corporations engaging with multiple law firms, who in turn retain multiple eDiscovery vendors for different projects. This results in corporations losing control of their data and an inability to account for data handling practices of subcontractors. Insight Accelerator, on the other hand, aggregates all of this data with one provider behind E-STET’s secure SOC II-certified data facilities, minimizing the likelihood of data loss and breach.\nAbout E-STET\nE-STET is a California-based legal technology company streamlining litigation through technology for corporations and AmLaw 100 law firms. E-STET’s cutting-edge team of lawyers and computer engineers enjoys pushing the legal tech envelope for its law firm and corporate clients with next-generation eDiscovery technology.
