Since the loan of his new bike cycling has become the strongest element in Reuben’s triathlons and he has successfully shaved 90 seconds off his previous time over a 10-mile time trial. Reuben has already produced a string of podium finishes this year with a third, two seconds and a first respectively. Next year it is hoped that he will compete in the highly competitive Youth Elite Series and his first Adult Triathlons (Super Sprint Distance). \nKieron Salter, managing director of KWSP added: “As a high performance engineering company that has worked with leading names in motorsport and high performance sport engineering, it was natural for us to take an interest in a local athlete who is showing huge potential. We’ve been delighted to have helped to make a difference to Reuben’s performance with the support and kind generosity of Boardman with whom we are also working with on some exciting projects soon to be announced. \n“We wish Reuben the very best of luck as he continues to compete and we’ll be following his career closely. We look forward to seeing him take an Olympic podium in the future, knowing that we had a part in his success.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:40:37.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
