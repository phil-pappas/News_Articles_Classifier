This comes days after similar action began at Wits University.\n\"The SRC is fully aware that a decrease in the national subsidy to all universities resulted in this required increase and will call on government to review their funding scheme to universities,\" spokesperson James de Villiers said in a statement.\nThe SRC said the university could do more to moderate the increase and to relieve pressure on students.\nUniversity spokesperson Susan van der Merwe said SU management would provide the SRC with a written explanation why the fee increase was essential. This was in addition to meetings and discussions that had already been held.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:06:10.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
