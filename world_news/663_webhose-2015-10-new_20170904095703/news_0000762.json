Specifically, two patients discontinued the trial due to gastrointestinal side effects, and one subject developed a hypersensitivity rash that required oral and topical steroids.\nWhile the number of patients receiving the treatment was small, with just 30 patients receiving a daily dose for seven days and 10 subjects getting a daily dose for 14 days, some patients consistently developed adverse reactions like nausea and abdominal distension, Mr. Yee said.\nHereditary angioedema, or HAE, is a rare, debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition resulting from a defect in the gene that controls a blood protein called C1 Inhibitor. Symptoms include episodes of swelling in the hands, feet, face, intestinal track and airway, with airway swelling potentially leading to death by asphyxiation and intestinal swelling resulting in severe pain.\nWith BCX7353, BioCryst seeks to \"wipe out HAE attacks,\" Chief Executive Jon Stonehouse said, by inhibiting plasma kallikrein and suppressing bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in HAE patients. The company has one other kallikrein inhibitor in development.\nAccording the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association, there are five treatments for preventing HAE attacks that have received Food & Drug Administration approval, though none are available orally.\nDyax Corp. has a potentially competing drug called DX-2930 in development, and RBC's Mr. Yee said BioCryst's results \"are good for Dyax,\" suggesting DX-2930 has the highest efficacy, least-frequent dosing and \"great safety [and] tolerability.\" Dyax, which has received fast-track designation for its treatment, said it plans to begin a late-stage trial by the end of the year. Dyax shares, up 60% this year, edged 0.3% lower Thursday morning.\nBioCryst shares recently traded at $9.04.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n 08, 2015 12:45 ET (16:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:27:05.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
