There are a few keyboards that combine these features, but the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard takes ergonomics to the extreme. The keyboard actually splits into two pieces so you can place the two halves wherever is most comfortable. It’s being crowdfunded on CrowdSupply right now, and it’s already put a big dent in its $200,000 goal. \nThe premise of the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard is that you’ll never have to move your hands from the middle row of keys. There’s no separate number pad, but there are multiple function layers that have a numpad, cursor control, F keys, and even mouse control. They’re really serious about not taking your hands off the keyboard. I’m not sure how accurate mousing with the keyboard keys will be, but you can try. \nThe Ultimate Hacking Keyboard works as a standard USB keyboard, but the configuration app lets you create application-specific keyboard maps and macros too. It comes in Windows, Mac, and Linux versions, or you can get the super-nerdy blank keycaps. The mechanical switches are also completely up to you. It uses Cherry switches and you can pick between, blue, brown, red, black, clear, and green. Each one has its own properties that make it ideal for different people. For example, the blues are clicky and tactile with low actuation force. The greens, on the other hand, are tactile and have very high actuation force. \nThe funding period ends on December 14th. Assuming it reaches the goal (and it looks like that won’t be a problem) the keyboard will be delivered to backers in July 2016. It’ll cost you $200 to reserve your own Ultimate Hacking Keyboard .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:38:50.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
