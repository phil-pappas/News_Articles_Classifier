A husband wanted to donate to his wife at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. A friend wanted to give a kidney to her buddy at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. A daughter wanted to help save her mother's life at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.\nThey weren't matches for their loved ones, but each was compatible to other patients through a paired kidney donation program.\nThe donors and patients met for the first time Thursday at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The meeting came three months after successful transplants July 22.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:35:36.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
