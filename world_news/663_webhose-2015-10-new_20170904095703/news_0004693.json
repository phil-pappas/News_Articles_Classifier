With strong uptake from researchers across the UK, as well as many attendees at the recent ESOMAR Congress in Dublin, the survey is already showing very clear trends in how researchers categorize themselves.\nWale Omiyale, SVP, Market Research at Confirmit, who is heading up the project, explains: “By taking our short, informal survey, researchers can get a clear idea of where they fit within the overall structure of the industry. Upon completion, they are given one of five personas based on their responses, the results of which have captured the imaginations of respondents across the spectrum.\n“While this is by no means a scientific study, it is producing some fascinating insights into how researchers perceive their roles and how things will change, for them and the wider industry, in the years ahead.”\nThe project has produced some thought-provoking and surprising insights into what researchers believe lies ahead for the industry. One respondent sees the future of Market Research as ‘ exciting for the researchers but frightening for their companies ,’ neatly capturing the challenges and opportunities being presented by rapidly changing technologies, methodologies and attitudes.\nThe survey has proved so successful in the UK and Ireland, that Confirmit has extended it to run in the US and Germany over the next two months. As well as taking the online survey, attendees at Research & Results, Germany (October 28-29) and TMRE, US (November 2-4) can get involved with the project by visiting Confirmit’s booth.\n‘What type of Market Researcher are you?’ will continue to run online until mid-November, following which Confirmit will announce key trends and findings from across the UK, US and Germany.\n###\nAbout Confirmit\nConfirmit is the world’s leading SaaS vendor for multi-channel Voice of the Customer, Voice of the Employee, and Market Research solutions.
