He documents how everyday technologies from smart cars to smart homes, are increasingly invasive in our lives and homes, threatening property and privacy rights.\n“Technology has transformed our homes, schools and workplaces, from castles to virtual prisons,” says Goel in the opening pages of the book. He continues, “Let’s band together and declare that our homes and workplaces are sacrosanct, safe from the prying eyes of the government, petty tyrants and dotcom billionaires.\nGoel will celebrate the launch of Unplugged Luddite’s Guide to Cybersecurity with a launch party at the Friars Club on Friday, October 16 from 6:00-8:00 PM.
