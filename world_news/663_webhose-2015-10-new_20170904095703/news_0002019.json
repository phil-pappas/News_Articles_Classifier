Added features include; HR-Outlier-Alert early warning (sends a text, email or tweet to those in the need), sourcing and discovery of (PDF, DOCX, Excel and HTML) file types/content and HR-RDBMS-Connector (allowing one interface and one set of Code to connect and Analyze/Discover Hadoop File Systems, MySQL, Oracle and Teradata). Other existing features include; Meta Data Roadmap, Data Compliance, Risk, and data business classification for Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). HadoopRevealed built these new features based on an analysis showing many businesses make the mistake of placing large amounts of data into Hadoop without the ability to perform BI and data mining to keep their companies competitive. The issue with Big Data is that Metadata is not stored with the files. Column types and data attributes are absent and the source of the data is often unknown. HadoopRevealed can solve these problems by interrogating Big Data and developing the needed missing pieces so that truly valuable reporting and data mining can commence. \"We see many organizations dumping huge amounts of data from the Internet Of Things (IoT), mainframes, servers and third party data into Hadoop, not realizing they are unable to do meaningful advanced analytics as expected,\" said Steven Meister, Founder of HadoopRevealed. \"Hadoop's difficulties with Metadata, key values and data types makes the data mining process almost oppressive. For this reason, it is important for companies to pair employees and consultants with sound methodologies and tools like HadoopRevealed with its new feature set to overcome Hadoop's limitations.\" HadoopRevealed-RDBMS-Connector allows one interface and one set of Code to connect and Analyze/Discover Hadoop File Systems, MySQL, Oracle and Teradata. HadoopRevealed-PDM does Data Discovery on the relational server, passes the analysis to HDFS, then completes the Compliance, Outlier and Data Discoveries on Hadoop, after you verify the datasets for compliance, accuracy and completeness, the complete datasets are ready to be migrated into Hadoop. HadoopRevealed-Outlier-Alert early warning sends a text, email or tweet to those in the need. Examples include predictive maintenance in a manufacturing scenario, when equipment might need repairs; Banking, when an unusually high cash withdrawal creates an instant flag for possible risk or fraud; and dozens of other business use cases when values that need monitoring are available and scheduled in a Hadoop File System. Gary Porter recently joined the HadoopRevealed team as an advisor. Mr. Porter has an extensive background as a global strategic alliance executive collaborating with global systems integrators and technology companies to deliver high value business outcomes. \"HadoopRevealed is the secret sauce that enables global systems integrators to deliver the promise of Hadoop to the Fortune 1000 in Banking, Insurance, Healthcare, Oil &Gas and Manufacturing\". Meister added that it is essential to supplement an effective toolset with the right personnel, commenting, \"Please, before starting any Big Data project, hire experienced management as well as technical resources immediately. Hadoop and Big Data can deliver extreme amounts of business intelligence, inexpensive storage and business analytics, but only when done properly. The key is to understand the other 'Tool Sets' needed to complement the strengths of Hadoop.\" About HadoopRevealed We created HadoopRevealed to be a key asset in companies identifying data compliance issues, risky data exposed, Outlier Discovery (Banking Risks, predictive maintenance in a manufacturing) and metadata to cut the time of data scientist's efforts down dramatically, also allowing the accurate delivery for ETL and business intelligence analysts and developers.
