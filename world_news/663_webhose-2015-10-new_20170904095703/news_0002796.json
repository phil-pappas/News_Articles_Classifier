In the latter case, we want the streets to have minimum dogs and feral cats that could harm us. We also need to limit the population for our beloved pets and the destructive pests lurking by. The problem to the current existing methods of sterilization is the cost, the labour and the carelessness with which they are performed. We are in need of an efficient and longer lasting solution. A team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology has discovered a method that could render animals sterile with a single injection. That’s it! One shot and they are sterile. This has been tested when the researchers gave the shots to mice; two months later, after their bodies had started producing enough antibodies, the mice were completely infertile. Muscle cells are one of the most longest living ones in the body, and that explains the lack of need for booster shots. This treatment could continue to show effect upto ten years.
