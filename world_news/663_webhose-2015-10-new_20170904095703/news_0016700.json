Authors, who first challenged the firm a decade ago, will not be amused. The 2nd US Circuit Court in Manhattan ruled Friday Google was not violating any copyright laws by digitizing books for its massive online library. The Authors Guild and various other writers challenged the company in 2005, contending that the digital book project might potentially eat into their profits. \nBut the court rejected the arguments of the plaintiffs that the Google Books program would affect their earnings by allowing readers free access to parts or snippets of the books in question. \nThe judges said the plaintiffs failed to show any material proof of loss in the protracted dispute. \nGood for hackers? \n“The pubic display of text is limited, and the revelations do not provide a significant market substitute for the protected aspects of the originals,” the court commented. \nThe judges reasoned that Google would only make available information about the books, and only snippets from them, without allowing access to substantial parts of the books. \nAuthors had also claimed Google’s scans would make it easier for hackers to make the books freely or cheaply available on the Internet. \nBut the Manhattan court ruled the scanning project did not expose writers “to an unreasonable risk of loss of copyright value through incursions of hackers.” \nhg/sri (AP, AFP)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:23:49.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
