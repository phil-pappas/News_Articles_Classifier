Margaret, 78, helps him get dressed, cuts up his food and helps him shave. “In the shower, sometimes he remembers what to do, sometimes he doesn’t.” \nWhile some find it upsetting to have to care for a spouse, the former Hoover manager says her husband “has never been a burden.” \n“I love him dearly,” she told news.com.au. “He was my only boyfriend. We’ve always been close, we worked together and were together 24/7. We never had children. \n“Other people find it more different because they haven’t been as close, they’ve been off living separate lives and are then called upon to do these very personal things. Some people with dementia can be very aggro. He isn’t, he absolutely lives in this second, he can’t remember two minutes ago. It’s an advantage and a disadvantage.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:12:23.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
