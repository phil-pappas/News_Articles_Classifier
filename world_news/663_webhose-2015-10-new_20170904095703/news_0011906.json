The Renesas RH850/D1x has been designed to address growing integrated automotive and ground vehicle dashboard markets. Altia’s HMI development software provide the capability to develop and deploy an attractive and intuitive user experience on this new Renesas platform.\nAmrit Vivekanand, Vice President of the Automotive Unit at Renesas Electronics America, said: “Renesas is committed to meeting the needs of our automotive customers with the best possible new technologies in silicon and solutions – and we have achieved that mission with the RH850/D1M MCU. Altia provides a finely-tuned solution for developing best-in-class user interfaces on the RH850/D1x, taking advantage of unique features of the 2D GPU that increase performance while reducing memory usage.”\nRenesas introduced the RH850/D1x Group as a highly scalable single-chip solution for the car instrumentation markets -- suited for car instrument clusters, head-up displays (HUDs), and other display applications. To support these domains, the RH850/D1x provides an optimized graphics system, providing high drawing performance and allowing developers at the same time to reduce memory footprint and CPU load. The RH850/D1x MCUs incorporate a large-capacity RAM (up to 3 MB) and offer four configurable hardware layers. The RH850/D1x market can span applications with typical automotive small/mid-size displays up to a resolution of 1280x480.\nAltia has a strong legacy for success in the global automotive and ground vehicle markets – and its graphical user interface development software is used by OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers worldwide to get first class displays onto the lowest cost, best performing hardware. True to its heritage, the Altia DeepScreen target for Renesas RH850/D1x makes the most of on-chip resources. Altia offers full support for all four visible layers using either the 2D rendering graphics pipeline or the Sprite engine of the RH850/D1x– providing WYSIWYG layer control multi display functionality using its innovative Layer Manager. Each layer can be configured flexibly to make use of the various RH850/D1x features aiming to optimize memory usage and drawing performance.\nFor more information about Altia’s code generation support for Renesas RH850/D1x, visit www.altia.com/d1x or email info@altia.com.\nAbout Altia\nAltia, Inc. is a software company that provides graphical user interface design and development tools that can be used from concept to final product code.
