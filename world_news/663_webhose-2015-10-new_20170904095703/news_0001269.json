This includes applications of LAMP-vax for treating peanut allergies as well as other research-stage products for food or environmental allergies. \n\"The LAMP-vax platform has enormous potential to broadly impact human health,\" said William G. Hearl, CEO of Immunomic Therapeutics. \"Our recent work in developing a new approach to treating allergies could be life-changing for allergy sufferers, including those who are at high risk for a strong reaction to peanut.\" \nAlso see: Immunomic Therapeutics licenses Hopkins-developed vaccine technology for $300 million ( The Baltimore Sun ) \nImmunomic received a $300 million upfront payment in the deal and also retains the rights to the LAMP-vax platform for other uses, including cancer immunotherapy. Through its license agreement with Immunomic, Johns Hopkins University will receive a portion of those proceeds, which are distributed to inventors, departments, schools, and the university. \n\"This deal shows the ability of Hopkins technology to be translated to products over time,\" said Neil Veloso, executive director of Technology Transfer, which is part of Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures. \nVeloso said it bodes well for the ongoing research and technology development at Johns Hopkins. \n\"The work that our inventors do now can lead to future Technology Ventures deals that have the ability to yield the same type of spectacular results,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:07:40.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
