So, without further ado, let’s meet Microsoft Lumia 950 XL and Blackberry Priv. For that kind of money, you would expect a close fight; and it seems like we will get a close fight after all. \n- Advertisement - \nCredit to both of them, they are debutants in their own way and both are expected to be released in November 2015. With the Lumia 950 XL, we are all set to get the first taste of Windows 10 – on a mobile device. \nJuly 2015, we already got a feel for what Windows 10 is all about on the desktop, now it is time to get it on a smartphone. Apps, games, and music are now stored in one place. \nThen we have the brand new Windows Store and your own personal assistant Cortana that helps to send reminders to all your Windows 10 devices. Office apps are easy to use on any screen size and Outlook Mail has the same rich editing tools as Microsoft Word. \nFrom Excel to entertainment, Windows 10 keeps your digital life in sync across devices. \nWhereas for the Blackberry Priv, it will be for the first time in the history of Blackberry/RIM – to have a third party OS. And that OS will be Android, with Lollipop 5.1 to be exact. \nWow! Finally they have succumbed to pressure and are set to convert even the most staunch of Blackberry users, and current Android users will love what is in store for them with this amazing flagship. Priv will have the authentic BlackBerry keyboard, legendary security, streamlined communications and productivity, combined with the wide world of Google Play store apps. \nIt has been engineered with the world’s finest technology, and packaged in an ultra-thin, ergonomically perfect device with a keyboard hidden by SmartSlide technology. \nSo how do they fare against each other? Let’s begin then. \nWith the Lumia 950 XL, it will be packing a polycarbonate body that comes with a body that measures 151.9 x 78.4 x 8.1 mm (5.98 x 3.09 x 0.32 in) and weighs 165 g (5.82 oz) which is definitely slim and light for a smartphone of this size. Then it will be sporting a 5.7-inch Quad HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~518 ppi pixel density. \nThis pretty much ensures that you get only the best in terms of display. It is further enhanced with the ClearBlack display technology and to top it all off; there’s the Gorilla Glass 4 to protect your precious. \nElsewhere on the Priv, it is set to have a body of 147 x 77.2 x 9.4 mm (5.79 x 3.04 x 0.37 in) and weighs 192 g (6.77 oz). Although not the thinnest nor the lightest, let’s not forget that it will be featuring a full-featured QWERTY keyboard that slides right out. \nIt will then be sporting a 5.4-inch Quad HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays an amazing 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~540 ppi pixel density. It also has a curved edge screen that adds to its premium look and feel. \nWith excellent display on both of them, you would want it to have excellent performance as well right? Spot on, as the the Lumia 950 XL will be equipped with the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset, an Octa-core processor made up of Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 430 graphics and 3GB RAM. \nMeanwhile under the hood of the Priv, will be the Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset, a Hexa-core processor comprising Dual-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A57 & Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 418 graphics and 3GB RAM. \nBoth are such beasts on their own, but it seems like the Lumia 950 XL just edges its opponents slightly by virtue of having a better chipset, two more cores and better graphics. Whatever it is, both of them can easily take on all apps and games that are out there in the market. - Advertisement - \nIn terms of camera, you can find the 20 Megapixel primary camera comes with Carl Zeiss optics and lets you take incredible pictures without having to adjust your settings. The moments you want to remember happen so fast. \nThat’s why the 20 MP sensor automatically reduces motion blur for producing much sharper and more detailed photos. And with unique features like triple LED natural flash and Rich Capture auto mode, challenging lighting conditions won’t stop you from turning magic moments into precious memories. \nWith more detail, better fast-action capture, and virtually seamless auto focus, 4K video is an exciting new way to record your life's magic moments. You can even pull high resolution still photos from your videos. \nAnd with the most advanced Optical Image Stabilization module yet, the effect of shaky hand movements while filming is dramatically reduced. \nAs for the Priv, be prepared to be mesmerized by its 18 Megapixel primary camera that is powered by Schneider-Kreuznach optics, and will be featuring optical image stabilization, autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. This will ensure you get the best possible out of a camera smartphone. \nOn top of that, there’s also the 2 Megapixel secondary camera for your selfies and video calls should you require. \nIt is hard to resist any Lumia device that is equipped with Carl Zeiss optics camera, which have long been regarded as one of the best in the industry. All we can say is to wait for both of them to be officially out, before we can test out both cameras before jumping to any conclusion. \nThe one thing that is similar with both the Lumia 950XL and the Priv is that, both will have exactly 32GB of internal storage and both can also be further expanded up to a whopping 200GB via the microSD slot. \nWhen we come to the battery side of things, their relative size is not that much difference either. We have Lumia 950XL with its Li-Ion 3340 mAh battery and then we have the Priv which will have a Li-Ion 3410 mAh battery. \nBoth should have no problem powering up the device for at least a day in between charging, but on the Lumia 950XL; it has the advantage of charging which means that you can get up to 50% capacity with just 30 minutes of charging. Then there’s the wireless charging which is a convenient way for users that gets thrown in for a good cause. \nDon’t forget that the Lumia 950 XL will be sporting the latest Windows 10 right out of the box. What this means is that it will be getting Windows Continuum which means that you can connect the phablet to a Microsoft Display Dock and Windows apps like Word, Excel, and Microsoft Edge scale up for a PC-like experience on an external monitor. \nIt is a quick and easy way to get the productivity benefits of a mouse and keyboard. Next we have Windows Hello Beta which is an incredibly personal and secure way to unlock your Lumia 950 XL – simply wake up your device, look directly at the screen, and the built-in infrared camera technology automatically authenticates you. \nElsewhere on the Priv, it will be accompanied by Android Lollipop 5.1 right out of the box. At this moment, we are not sure of whether it will get an update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0; just hang on there for a little longer. - Advertisement - \nWith a stunning 5.7” Quad HD display and a powerful octa-core processor, it’s the Lumia you’ve been waiting for. Get the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL that works just like your PC and push the limits of what is possible. \nWindows 10 and the 20 Megapixel Carl Zeiss camera makes for an excellent combination that will provide an unforgettable experience. \nSo what can we make out of the new Blackberry Priv? Being the first Blackberry smartphone being powered by Android, it is a huge decision being made by the people at RIM/Blackberry. It is a known fact that times are uncertain at Blackberry, and in times like these; sacrifices are necessary and a change seems to be the right move. \nWe all know how they have struggled for a long time in the past, and their luck might just change with the introduction of this smartphone. Pure class security as expected from a Blackberry device and a QWERTY keyboard, coupled with the excellent Quad HD screen, amazing hardware and a much more amazing camera – this could well be make or break time for Blackberry. \nThe Microsoft Lumia 950 XL is set to be released in November 2015 for $649 USD. It will be available in Black and White, not quite the vibrant Lumia that we used to know. \nThe Blackberry Priv is expected to be available in November 2015 for approximately $579 Euro or ~$659 USD and will be available in only black color.
