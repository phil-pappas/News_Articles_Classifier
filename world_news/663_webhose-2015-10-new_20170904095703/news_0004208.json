Chinese automotive 3PL to use JDA for transportation solutions Shanghai-based Anji-CEVA, which provides finished vehicle and parts logistics services to a major Chinese automaker, will use JDA's management, modeling, and planning solutions. By Eric Johnson | Friday, October 23, 2015 Anji-CEVA, a third party logistics provider serving the automotive industry in China, will implemented JDA Software’s transportation management solution, the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based software company said. Shanghai-based Anji-CEVA will use JDA’s Transportation Manager, Transportation Modeler and Transportation Planner solution. The 3PL’s services that include moving finished vehicles, inbound parts and aftermarket parts. Its primary customers are subsidiaries of the Shanghai Motor Group. “Historically, we have relied on time-consuming manual transportation planning processes,” Anji-CEVA said in a statement. “Not only do these manual processes slow our response times as conditions change, but they also limit our visibility of all our available resources in real time. This means that our truck fill rates, our number of loads and our routing plans may not be making the best possible use of all our resources.” The 3PL said increased automation through the JDA solution will enable the company’s planning staff to focus on higher-value activities. “Balancing logistics speed and efficiency with profitability is a challenge for every 3PL company in today’s volatile marketplace,” said Amit Bagga, regional vice president for Asia Pacific at JDA. “While Anji-CEVA has built a reputation as a 3PL leader in the Chinese automotive industry, today the company recognizes that it needs sophisticated, intelligent solutions to make the best decisions in a fast-paced, high-pressure business environment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:29:16.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
