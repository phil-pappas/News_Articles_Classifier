Gayatri Nayak & Saikat Das | 08 October 2015, 8:24 AM IST Share MUMBAI: If anyone had any doubts about where the future of retail banking is headed, here's the answer: wallets and similar stuff stored in handsets. Just as radios and tape-recorders have given way to downloads, it may not be long before debit and credit cards make room for wallets and other prepaid instruments, if the growth data from RBI is anything to go by.Though on a small base, the number of transactions through wallets and other prepaid instruments has more than doubled in a year to 5.3 crore in August from just 2 crore a year ago, outpacing the 30 per cent rise in credit cards transactions to 6.6 crore from about 5 crore.\"Wallets will gain traction as more merchants come into play. With the introduction of payment banks, prepaid instruments will have higher usage,\" said B Sriram, managing director with State Bank of India. \"Commercial banks like us will extend our focus to wallets (prepaid instruments or PPIs).\"With the younger lot more comfortable with handheld devices, it may be the only way to grow the retail business, reckoned analysts.While cash as well as paperless channels such as credit and debit cards and net banking are used to load cash in wallets, these prepaid instruments are emerging as the most preferred financial instrument for settling a payment transaction.Currently, they are more popular for settling radio cab services and other 'app'-driven transactions such as utility bill payments and online purchases of merchandises.However, wallets, which are used for small value transactions, can't really be compared with credit cards. Customers use cards for large-value transactions with a credit cycle of 45 days, adding to customer convenience. Wallets are expected to drive cashless transactions in a big way.\"Younger people are early users of this payment system,\" said Pramod Saxena, chairman and managing director of Oxigen Services, a payment solutions provider.\"Wallet transactions will rise significantly once cash-out system is incorporated in this payment system, which is now possible with the introduction of payment banks and business correspondent partnerships. Moreover, inclusion of more merchant services like hospital payments, taxes, ecommerce portals will help expand wallet use faster.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:38:53.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
