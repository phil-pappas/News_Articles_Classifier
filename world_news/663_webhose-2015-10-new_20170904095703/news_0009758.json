It somehow always seems to have what you need — and staff to help you find it, install it, and to do it yourself the right way. Fortunately, Bay Area residents have a lot of good hardware stores to choose from, according to Bay Area Consumers’ Checkbook and Checkbook.org.\nCheckbook surveyed more than 10,000 area hardware store customers (primarily Consumer Reports and Checkbook subscribers) and asked them to rate stores on advice, promptness of service, selection, and other criteria. Forty-six of the 170 stores evaluated received “superior” ratings for overall quality from more than 80 percent of their surveyed customers.\nOverall, the top-rated stores for service were independent firms. Big-box home centers receive substantially lower ratings for service quality. For example, Home Depot received “superior” ratings for “overall quality” from only 19 percent of its surveyed customers across all of the chain’s stores included in Checkbook’s evaluation, and Lowe’s and Orchard Supply both received such “superior” ratings from only 45 percent of their surveyed customers.\nThe big chains, however, did receive higher ratings than independents for “variety of products,” although many independents do a remarkable job offering variety in a small space.\nCheckbook also compared hardware stores on price — Checkbook researchers, without revealing their affiliation, collected prices on a wide array of products. Overall, Home Depot and Lowe’s had lower prices than any of the independents or other chains surveyed.\nBut prices varied greatly item to item, and there was substantial variation among independent stores — enough to make it worthwhile to shop around. For example:\n•Prices for a Weller 140/100-watt soldering gun kit ranged from $25 to $67.99.\n•Prices for a Black & Decker ½-amp Mouse detail sander (model MS800B) ranged from $34.97 to $62.99.\n•Prices for 50 feet of ½-inch Schedule L copper piping ranged from $69.95 to $194.50.\n•Prices for a 1.33-gallon bottle of Roundup weed and grass killer ranged from $14.99 to $31.99.\n•Prices for three 15-amp, 125-volt GFCI outlets ranged from $28.99 to $68.97.\nOne thing to bear in mind if you find an independent store that you like and trust: Many offer a discount of 10 to 20 percent for buying large quantities—for example, spending $500 or more on products over a couple of weeks. Also, some stores offer similar discounts for using a store credit card or charge account.\nFinally, you’ll want to check a store’s return policy. This is especially important in the hardware business, because it’s easy for shoppers to miscalculate a quantity or measurement — and not know it until months later when they try to use the product. Fortunately, Checkbook found that hardware stores’ return policies are remarkably liberal. For example, most stores will allow returns indefinitely if the customer presents a receipt and the item can be resold.\nLimited-time free access: The Chronicle is partnering with Bay Area Consumers’ Checkbook magazine and Checkbook.org, a nonprofit consumer group that rates various types of local service firms and professionals, to help you find the best services in the Bay Area.
