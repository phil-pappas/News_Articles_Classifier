(ALTR) said its third-earnings fell 48% from a year earlier as the chipmaker's revenue slumped.\nThe San Jose, Calif., company is in the process of being acquired by Intel Corp. (INTC) in a $16.7 billion deal. The long-discussed union of Silicon Valley chip makers aims to help Intel bolster its position in server systems and other equipment found in corporate data centers. The planned deal continues a wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry and will be Intel's biggest deal ever.\nAltera and Intel already are partners. Intel's factories make high-end semiconductors for Altera, which designs chips but uses other companies to make them.\nDuring the latest quarter global market conditions were quite varied, with some markets producing good growth, while others were weak, Chairman and Chief Executive John Daane said in prepared remarks on Thursday.\nTelecom and wireless sales improved quarter-to-quarter, though weak industrial markets contributed to a quarter-to-quarter decline in the industrial automation, military and auto market. Meanwhile networking, computer and storage sales grew sequentially.\nOverall, Altera reported a profit of $61.5 million, 20 cents a share, down from $118 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slumped 20% to $399.6 million.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of 30 cents and revenue of $429 million.\nGross margin fell to 66.5% from 66.8%.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 22, 2015 17:28 ET (21:28 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:51:06.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
