India has dropped its demands for the West to pay for climate change measures (that’s not entirely accurate), “and is now putting its economy on a path where it can increase its prosperity without a one-to-one increase in emissions.” That would be huge. \nOne Scientist’s Hopeful View On How to Repair the Planet \nUnlike most climate scientists these days, Johan Rockström is no catastrophist. The executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Center and author of a new book, Big World, Small Planet , Rockström believes that mankind still has the resourcefulness, the inventiveness, and the will to save itself and the planet. To be sure, climate change will wreak widespread change, not to say havoc, Rockström tells Yale Environment 360 . But “It’s not a journey where we are backing into the caves. It’s a journey of high technology, good health, of better democracy, and huge, multiple benefits that [go] well beyond saving the planet.” \nAfrica is growing fast—and yet it’s still wildly uncompetitive \nAnalysts and pundits have talked for years about Africa’s potential for an economic renaissance over the next couple of decades, in particular its potential as a vibrant market for renewable energy technology. Not so fast, says this analysis on Quartz , which is based on the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness List. “Fifteen out of the 20 lowest ranked economies were in sub-Saharan Africa. Only three [African] countries—Mauritius, South Africa, and Rwanda—were ranked above 70th place, out of 140 countries.” \nThe Ultimate Crowdsourced Map Of Punny Businesses In America \nAnd, off topic, in time for Columbus Day: we discovered this authoritative map from Atlas Obscura of hundreds of pun-named businesses nationwide. Looking for a barber shop called “Barberella”? Head to Hamtramck, Michigan. A nail salon called “Nail Me Good”? You got it, in Hazelwood, Missouri. How about a pub named after a Nobel laureate physicist? No problem: “Neil’s Bar,” in Houston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:20:43.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
