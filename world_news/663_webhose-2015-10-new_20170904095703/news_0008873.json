Presenting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that were approved by the member countries of the United Nations on September 25 to the Solve audience, Sachs argued that agreeing on such goals “will make a difference” by focusing much needed attention on the challenges.\nAmong the development goals are ones to make agriculture more sustainable and productive, as well as ones on “climate action” and “affordable and clean energy.” Sachs said that the upcoming UN climate change conference in Paris starting in November will be our “last chance” to keep global warming from manmade emissions below 2 °C, though success at the meeting is still uncertain. Our current systems of agriculture, he warned, are not sustainable, and agriculture is on “the front line of climate change. It’s the first sector that gets hit.” To keep the global temperature rise below 2 °C, he added, will “be a heck of challenge.”\nAnother goal is to reduce inequalities, including the growing income gaps that have been worsened by advancing digital technologies. To that, he said, the most important solution is “universal access to quality education.” \nStill, Sachs pointed to recent successes. Globally, only about 10 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty; in Africa it is down to 35 percent. “Technology has absolutely had a leading role,” Sachs said. “Nothing has been as important as the mobile phone.”\nGain the insight you need on emerging technologies at EmTech MIT. \nRegister today", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:25:17.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
