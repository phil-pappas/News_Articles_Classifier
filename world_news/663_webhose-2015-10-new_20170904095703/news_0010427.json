Demolition is expected to take four months.\nThe Multi-Purpose Building was the subject of an NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune investigation in July. Many faculty and staff who worked there after Katrina said dusty and moldy conditions inside the building affected their health.\nBetween November 2013 and February 2014, four professors who had offices inside the Multi-Purpose Building died -- two from breast cancer recurrence, one from heart disease and one from a pulmonary embolism. Experts said mold contamination in the building might have contributed to their deaths .\nIn July, the Federal Emergency Management Agency awarded SUNO $82 million in disaster recovery grants to build four new buildings on campus, including the Multi-Purpose Building. The building, which is 64,000 square feet, was built in 1993 and contains large lobby, a 1,000-seat auditorium, music rooms, offices and meeting rooms.\nAfter the storm, faculty and staff with offices in the building were relocated to FEMA trailers on the Lake Campus, which sits on higher ground. Three years later, in the summer of 2008, a contractor renovated the interior. The Office of Facility Planning and Control deemed the space safe to occupy that fall.\nSUNO said it has met with architects, state officials and the demolition contractor to make sure students, faculty and staff stay safe during the demolition process.\n\"The state's experts have examined the building for hazardous materials and determined that the building is cleared and ready for demolition,\" SUNO said in a statement.\n\"If any hazardous materials are found in the building, they will be handled and disposed of in accordance with the Department of Environmental Quality's procedures and best practices,\" SUNO said.\nTo limit the dust that escapes the demolition site, workers will spray the building with water as they knock it down. The process, known as the \"wet method,\" is often used during asbestos removal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:18:02.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
