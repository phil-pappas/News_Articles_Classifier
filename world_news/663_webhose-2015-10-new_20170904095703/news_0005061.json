A conspiracy theorist claims that singer Avril Lavigne has been dead for 10 years and has a body double acting in her place. Picture: Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images \nELVIS is still alive but sadly Avril Lavigne is dead, according to a recent conspiracy theory website about the Canadian punk songstress. \nThe “Sk8er Boi” singer died more than 10 years ago, claims a Brazilian blog, and she’s been replaced by a lookalike named “Melissa Vandella”. \nThe website, AvrilEstaMorta.blogspot.com (which means “Avril is dead” in English), compares numerous photos of the singer to “prove” that the real Avril Lavigne has been replaced by a fake, reports NY Daily News. Well spotted ... According to the conspiracy theory, these photos are proof that Avril Lavigne has been replaced. Picture: http://avrilestamorta.blogspot.com.br Mole evidence ...
