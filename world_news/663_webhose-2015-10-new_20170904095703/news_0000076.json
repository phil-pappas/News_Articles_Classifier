In addition to the U.S. and Canada, mobile campaign measurement is now unlocking value for clients in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK, with Brazil to launch by the end of the year. \nLeading global agencies, ad platforms, and industry organizations, including Videology, Unilever, TubeMogul, ROIx, Mobile Marketing Association, Microsoft, Melt DSP, GroupM, Amplifi and AdAudience now maximize their campaigns with a \"total digital\" view of audiences across computers, smartphones and tablets. This will allow for a clearer picture of how online and mobile interact together and independently, in a way comparable to TV. \n\"We have enabled the marketplace to transact on media with the highest quality, independent, apples-to-apples metrics across all devices,\" said Megan Clarken, EVP Global Watch Product Leadership, Nielsen. \"Adding mobile measurement to Digital Ad Ratings allows us to bring this same level of comparability to more markets, enabling a deeper understanding of campaign effectiveness.\" \nAs mobile usage continues to explode around the world, Digital Ad Ratings measurement offers clarity to clients who want to maximize their mobile advertising. For example, an analysis of mobile campaigns in the U.S. from July 2014 to March 2015 found that mobile campaigns reached their intended audience 49% of the time, on average. Similarly, the on-target percentage of Canadian ads viewed on mobile during May 2015 was nearly the same as it was on desktop computers: 44% and 47%, respectively. \nWith the addition of mobile measurement in Digital Ad Ratings internationally, the solution measures all ads, including video and display, for iOS and Android platforms. Nielsen will continue to roll out additional mobile measurement capabilities throughout 2016. \nCLIENT SUPPORT FOR DIGITAL AD RATINGS MOBILE MEASUREMENT \nAdAudience : \"Mobile as the most personal device is becoming increasingly important in the German market. Branding customers discover the Device more and more as a suitable advertising platform. Beside the development of new mobile advertising formats, we should place a focus on validation of mobile advertisements as well. We are excited to work with Nielsen to convince our clients in Germany of the potential that lies in mobile advertising,\" said Stefan Krotz, director of AdAudience GmbH. \nAmplifi : \"Mobile has become the first screen of media consumption for several of our advertisers' audiences and we support the introduction of Digital Ad Ratings on the mobile. This is an important step towards a cross-channel and de-duplicated audience planning,\" says Marina Coche, Publishing Director at Amplifi Display the Dentsu Network Aegis trading entity. \nGroupM (France) : \"Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings gives our customers the ability to connect desktop and mobile audiences. This is an important step forward and in line with the group's ambitions,\" said Alexandra Chabanne and Olivier Mazeron, co- presidents of GroupM CONNECT. \nGroupM (Australia): \"Up until now the mobile market has been slightly hamstrung by measurement issues in relation to audience and performance campaigns. But now being able to capture mobile audience verification data through Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings, it has the potential to be a game changer for the mobile market,\" said John Miskelly, Chief Digital Officer, GroupM. \"It allows planners to measure across desktop and mobile without having to isolate each channel. From GroupM point of view we have unparalleled insight into audience trends on desktop through Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings. We now look forward to overlaying mobile audience data to understand reach and frequency across multiple devices.\" \nMelt DSP : \"Mobile has been exponentially growing and with the ability to precisely measure reach, frequency and target assertiveness on mobile devices,\" said Guilherme Mamede, CEO, Melt DSP. \"For us at Melt, who currently use Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings, there are only reasons to celebrate the new functionality of this product.\" \nMicrosoft : \"Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings provides a reliable and accurate solution that changes the way digital media is bought, bringing increased clarity to digital advertising,\" said Erik-Marie Bion, Director of Online and Advertising, Microsoft France. \"The addition of mobile will enable an extension of its audit capacity but also help unify the management of expenditure across screens. We look forward to this new feature that will allow us to prove our ability to deploy across multiple screens, in addition to checking the quality of our targeting.\" \nMobile Marketing Association (MMA) : \"The Digital Ad Ratings extension to mobile is very good news for the Mobile Marketing Association (MMA), which seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of mobile advertising,\" said Nicolas Rieul, Rapporteur Mobile Advertising Committee at the MMA. \"Mobile can thus be measured today in the same way as its big brother Desktop.\" \nROIx : \"The mobile market grew on a high speed in the last few years in Brazil. It's an essential tool to impact consumers with offers and services in an intelligent, relevant and measurable way\" says Giovanni Faria, Roix's Business Development Director. \"The correct mobile measurement with Nielsen's Digital Ad Ratings will substantially contribute for the understanding of customer's behavior on its cross-channel journey, helping advertisers to better distribute its investments on advertisement.\" \nTubeMogul : \"TubeMogul was the first ad tech platform to integrate Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings (formerly OCR) into our software in 2013. This provided Brands and Agencies with the unprecedented ability to plan, buy, optimise and report against verified audiences for desktop campaigns,\" said Sam Smith Managing Director, Australia and New Zealand, TubeMogul. \"The launch of mobile measurement in Digital Ad Ratings in Australia is an exciting development, as it brings the market another step closer to the cross-screen dream. Our strategic alliance with Nielsen means Digital Ad Ratings will be available directly in the platform and is key to providing advertisers with the best tools to execute cross-screen brand campaigns.\" \nUnilever (UK) : \"The introduction of mobile measurement in Digital Ad Ratings is another step forward in digital accountability. The accurate people-based measurement that Digital Ad Ratings delivers has already brought a lot more transparency to digital media and allowed Unilever to make significant efficiencies to our media buys; both traditional and programmatic,\" said Paul O'Grady, Senior Communications Planning Manager, Unilever. \"The launch of mobile measurement will bring the same transparency and accountability to the mobile space, with metrics that help us ensure our ads are getting to the right people.\" \nUnilever (Brazil) : \"Mobile is an unquestionable communication tool and with exponential smartphone penetration we need a more accurate measurement of audience and, especially, a platform that can evaluate together the efficiency of PC and Mobile campaigns with the same metrics,\" said Sonia Leme, Media Research Manager, Unicell. \nVideology : \"In a converging media landscape, mobile plays a vital role for our clients as they target the rapidly growing number of consumers watching TV content on their portable devices. Data pulled from our platform showed a threefold increase in mobile video campaigns in Q2 2015 versus Q1 2015, but despite rapid growth, client feedback still cites measurement as a barrier to increased investments,\" said Chris Mooney, Head of Product Strategy APAC, Videology. \"The arrival of mobile measurement in Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings changes that. We have been eagerly awaiting its launch in Australia and look forward to working with Nielsen to provide our clients with robust data on total audience reach.\" \nABOUT NIELSEN \nNielsen Holdings plc (NYSE: NLSN) is a global performance management company that provides a comprehensive understanding of what consumers watch and buy.
