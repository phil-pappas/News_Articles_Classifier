More businesses are choosing AT&T Ethernet services to meet their networking and bandwidth needs. We've seen 1,300% growth in Switched Ethernet ports from 2010 to 2014. And demand is continuing to grow. Whether customers need last-mile connectivity, to connect multiple offices on a single network, or create a global virtual private network, we offer a solution. We're using the robust network assets we've already deployed to more than double our local Ethernet footprint. That means this next-generation service is more widely available for all of our customers, but we see it as a game changer for our small business and wholesale customers. With a quick turn-up time (generally 10 days or less), competitive price points, and symmetrical and asymmetrical speed ability, customers have more control of their network. \"We're delivering advanced and efficient Ethernet services to our customers,\" said Rick Hubbard , senior vice president, Business Product Management, [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTloWW05MWRDNWhkSFF1WTI5dEwyNWxkM012WW5WemFXNWxjM010Ym1WM2N5NW9kRzFzWENJZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCMFlYSm5aWFE5WENKZllteGhibXRjSWo1QlZDWlVJRTF2WW1sc1pTQmhibVFnUW5WemFXNWxjM01nVTI5c2RYUnBiMjV6UEM5aFBnPT18]]. \"In 2015, we expanded our Ethernet services significantly. We added major markets, gave customers more flexibility and introduced new lightning-fast speeds. This new feature is a large part of our strategy to move to an all Ethernet and Internet protocol (IP) network. We're giving our customers the benefits of Ethernet they've been asking for.\" The new Ethernet capability will support almost any network topology — from basic site-to-site connections to a fully meshed any-to-any configuration. It also supports VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) so that customers can control how their data flows between sites. Businesses can now determine if they are eligible for this new feature with our new Ethernet Qualification Tool (EQT) at [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQnpPaTh2ZDNkM0xtRjBkQzVqYjIwdlpXSnBlaTlsWW1sNmNYVmhiQzhqTDF3aUlISmxiRDFjSW01dlptOXNiRzkzWENJZ2RHRnlaMlYwUFZ3aVgySnNZVzVyWENJK2FIUjBjSE02THk5M2QzY3VZWFIwTG1OdmJTOWxZbWw2TDJWaWFYcHhkV0ZzTHlNdlBDOWhQZz09fA==]].
