Japan's Nikkei .N225 added 0.8 percent, while South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 rose 0.6 percent.\nThere was more evidence of the problems plaguing Asian trade flows with Japanese exports growing at the slowest pace since mid-2014, mainly due to weakness in China.\nWall Street offered little in the way of a lead with the Dow .DJI ending Tuesday 0.1 percent lower, while the S&P 500 .SPX eased 0.14 percent and the Nasdaq .IXIC 0.5 percent.\nThe S&P healthcare sector .SPXHC shed 1.5 percent, dragged by Allergan ( AGN.N ) and Pfizer ( PFE.N ), while a drop in IBM offset gains in companies that reported strong quarterly results such as Verizon ( VZ.N ) and United Technologies ( UTX.N ).\nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 4 percent in the third quarter, while revenue is expected to have declined 3.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nEconomic news from the United States was moderately upbeat as housing starts increased 6.5 percent in September to an annual pace of 1.21 million units, beating expectations for 1.15 million units.\nThere was also better news on bank lending in the euro zone as data from the ECB showed a further easing in credit conditions and improving demand for loans.\nThat might lessen the need for the ECB to immediately ramp up its 1 trillion euro asset purchase program.\nThe ECB's governing council meets on Thursday and markets expect it to highlight a willingness to act to boost inflation, but not just yet.\n\"The general consensus is that the ECB has been trying to moderate expectations this week, suggesting it's too early for discussion around extending the current QE program,\" said analysts at Citi.\nThe euro was a whisker higher at $1.1359 EUR= , but still hemmed in by support at $1.3300 and resistance around $1.1386. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.1 percent at 94.855 .DXY.\nThe New Zealand dollar NZD= hit a one-week low of $0.6737 NZD=D4 after a disappointing global dairy auction saw prices for the country's single largest export fall 3.1 percent.\nOil prices softened on speculation U.S. inventory data would only underline the extent of oversupply in the world. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will report official inventory data on Wednesday.\nU.S. crude slipped 32 cents to $45.97 per barrel, while Brent lost 18 cents to $48.53.\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:36:48.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
