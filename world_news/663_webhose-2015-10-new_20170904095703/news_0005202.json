Indeed, fintech has given London’s digital sector a global platform to showcase the city’s unique skills and innovation,” said TLA founder Russ Shaw. \n“I am now calling upon the business community to support our future high-growth verticals. With retail tech at the forefront, from fashion tech to food tech, clean tech to cyber tech, we are seeing emerging specialisms with the potential to transform the tech landscape in the capital yet again.” \nBut many still point to fintech as an area of success for London, with 86% claiming it is the only sector that London has a global competitive advantage in. \nRetail technology was chosen as the next possible growth area due to the number of accelerators and expertise already in place in London, and due to the impact that retail has directly on consumers across the capital. \nStephen Millard, founder of Eccomplished and lead of the TLA RetailTech working group, said: “London is already the retail technology capital of the world. Nowhere else has such consolidation of expertise, knowledge and accelerators all focused on driving growth in this sector. There is no doubt future world-beating retail technology companies are already operating in the city today.” \nOther areas of growth to focus on include the already thriving fintech sector and the internet of things, according to the TLA.

No other city is capable of consistently producing digital businesses of scale,” said TechUK president Jacqueline de Rojas. \n“To achieve our goal of becoming a world leading digital economy, we must now look beyond London to deliver the benefits of a fast-growing, productive tech sector right across the UK. The growing diversity of digital specialisms across the UK is testament to the unique relationship we have cultivated between private, public and financial sectors,” she added.
