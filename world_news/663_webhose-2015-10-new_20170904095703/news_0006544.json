This policy brief brings together the work of three school districts and university researchers to provide a rich picture of English learners’ experiences, opportunities and outcomes in school, and how states and districts can support students reaching their full potential.” \nThe report , published online Oct. 20, is part of series of policy briefs by Policy Analysis for California Education . It focuses on the education of California’s large English-learner population. \nUmansky is sharing the report’s findings Friday, Oct. 23, in Sacramento with legislators and other state government officials as part a seminar series held by Policy Analysis for California Education. \nThe restrictions on bilingual education began when voters passed Proposition 227. The issue is expected to be a ballot measure again in 2016. \nAn important finding of the new report, Umansky said, is that English learners have restricted access to core academic content in the state’s schools. In addition, they are much less likely than other students to take the core courses required for admission into four-year universities, and they are often enrolled in less-rigorous, slower-paced classes than English-speaking students. English learners also often face unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles and criteria for reclassifying out of English-learner status. \nFor more details, see the story “ California schools holding back English Learners ” on the website of the Stanford Graduate School of Education.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:22:53.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
