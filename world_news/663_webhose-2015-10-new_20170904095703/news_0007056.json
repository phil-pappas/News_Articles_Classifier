Two years later, he published a paper suggesting that rats depend on smell as much as taste to determine what food they like.\nIn a new study published in the journal Current Biology, Katz showed what happened when a rat’s sense of taste is shut down. Using an optical probe, he turned off the brain cells in the animal’s primary olfactory cortex that process taste signals from the mouth.\nThere was an immediate impact on the firing patterns of the neurons handling smell. In fact, the smell neurons were transformed so radically the rat could no longer recognise familiar odours.\nThese findings about the interdependence of taste and smell have led Katz to speculate that they are one single sense. He dubbed it the “chemosensory system”.\n“How things taste depends on a lot of other factors than what’s on the tongue. We think that taste and smell are part of one large system with two doors, the mouth and the nose,” Katz said.\nOther researchers have shown that sound, touch, and sight are also inextricably connected.\nThis leads Katz to believe that all our senses belong to a single system.\nKatz likened the brain to a computer fed an immense amount of data so it can generate a single, simplified finding. For the programme to run, information must be gathered through all the senses.\nBut we don’t realise this. We are only aware of programme’s final result, which is the illusion that only one sense is responsible for what we experience, according to Katz.\n 26, 2015 1:23 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:56:09.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
