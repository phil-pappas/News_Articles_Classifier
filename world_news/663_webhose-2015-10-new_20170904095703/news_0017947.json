Her campaign will use the first Democratic presidential debate in Nevada and another Republican debate next month in Colorado to organise house parties geared at garnering support among Hispanics.\nClinton's pitch will also extend to Hispanic lawmakers and elected officials, and will include an address next week to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's annual meeting in Washington.\n\"She's shown a deep commitment to the issues that Hispanics care about over a long period of time. This isn't somebody who showed up, decided to run for president and then a lightbulb came on and she decided to reach out to the Hispanic community,\" said Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, who will campaign for Clinton in Nevada following the October 13 debate in Las Vegas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:22:51.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
