There are consistent levels of danger within operator networks across the world and unauthorized access to the SS7 network can cause significant financial and reputational damage to the operator community. Fraudulent roaming configurations can cost operators millions of dollars without any opportunity to recapture this revenue. Without appropriate preventions put into place, operators are allowing adversaries to know exactly where a subscriber is at any given moment and to intercept and reroute device communications, listening to every call and reading every text message. The financial and reputational risks that operators are putting themselves under is unnecessary and needs to be addressed. \n“Through our analysis of SS7 traffic we’ve detected numerous types of SS7 requests and responses being received and sent from one operator network to another,” said Cathal Mc Daid, Head of AdaptiveMobile’s Threat Intelligence Unit. “From the Americas to MENA, Europe to APAC, the operator networks analyzed have all shown evidence of suspicious SS7 activity. We’re working with operators to secure their networks as none are exempt from these types of attacks.” \nSitting at the heart of more than 75 operator networks worldwide, AdaptiveMobile protects one-fifth of the world’s subscribers, witnessing in excess of 30 billion mobile events every day from across the globe and is uniquely placed to identify, protect and remediate against the widest range of threats attacking mobile networks. Approaching the SS7 vulnerabilities with a tiered approach, the Company uses a comprehensive SS7 Firewall, advanced reporting and the knowledge of its industry-leading Threat Intelligence Unit to identify and combat against emerging threats. \nMc Daid will present his findings from the Company’s Threat Intelligence Unit through a global webinar on October 20 th .
