(CWS), a leader in solutions for noise analysis in complex chip designs incorporating analog blocks, today announced that Luc Burgun has joined its board of directors. CWS has devised a new approach based on harmonic analysis to control and manage complex noise issues throughout the development cycle of chip designs targeting advanced silicon on insulator (SOI) and bulk process nodes. With Burgun’s appointment, CWS sets new ambitious goals to expand its product portfolio and accelerate the company’s growth. \n\"Luc’s solid EDA expertise and proven ability to grow companies will give us significant insight and direction,” said Brieuc Turluche, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer. “We look forward to his assistance to take CWS to the next level.\" \nPreviously, Burgun co-founded Emulation and Verification Engineering (EVE), a leader in the electronic design automation (EDA) space, and was the company’s president and chief executive officer for twelve years until the company was acquired by Synopsys in 2012. At EVE, Burgun oversaw the development of hardware emulation systems built on several hundred field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that were used to verify the world-class designs of a major processor company. Burgun is currently chief executive officer of NovaSparks ™, the leading FPGA market data company. He pursued college degrees in computer science and electronics, and holds a Ph.D. in logic synthesis for chip designs. \n“Fast run-time, accurate analysis and high scalability set WaveIntegrity TM , CWS’s flagship product, ahead of the competition,” explained Burgun. “It has been successfully deployed at three major semiconductor companies, and is ready for prime time. I am thrilled to join CWS and look forward to building momentum for the company.” \nAbout CWS \nCWS is the leading provider of noise modeling tools for complex chip designs incorporating analog blocks, targeting SOI applications or advanced bulk process nodes including 28nm and below. CWS unique harmonic analysis approach allows for controlling and managing noise issues throughout the design cycle up to and including board design. Packaged in ‘easy-to-deploy’ software bundle, WaveIntegrity™ is used by chip architects and designers to drive the chip design floorplanning and by package and PCB designers to integrate the noise-related design constraints in the final chip operational environment. \nFounded in 2003, CWS’ offices are located in Paris, Grenoble, France and San Jose, USA. \nMore information about the company, its products, and services is available at www.cwseda.com . \nCWS and the CWS logo are registered trademarks of CWS Design Systems, Inc. in the United States and other countries.
