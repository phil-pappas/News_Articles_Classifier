Dajani was recognized at the CGT Business & Technology Leadership Conference today in Orlando, Fla., where he was praised for his forward vision and ability to execute. Consumer Goods Technology recently profiled Dajani in its September 2015 cover story, \"Empowering Global Growth,\" which detailed Dajani's role in Mondelēz's Winning in Sales Execution (WiSE) initiative, a multi-year global project designed to transform the selling process of Mondelēz's more than 40,000 sales representatives. \nDajani, who was Mondelēz's first chief information officer, was also the subject of an Oct. 5 Forbes.com interview, part of the website's CIO-plus series. The article, written by contributor Peter High, noted Dajani's \"significant digital and innovation responsibilities,\" and his \"ability to simplify IT\" and make Mondelēz \"more truly customer-centric.\" \nThe CGT CIO of the Year award is presented annually to the Chief Information Officer who has made the largest demonstrable business impact within his or her consumer goods organization through the implementation and successful use of technology. Nominations are accepted from technology companies, consultants, consumer goods executives, retailers, analysts and partners. \n\"WiSE is among the biggest collaborative initiatives ever undertaken by Mondelēz's Sales and IS divisions and Mark was at the forefront of its development and implementation,\" said Thomas R. Buckley, CEO of StayinFront. \"Under Mark's leadership, Mondelēz is working to improve sales processes and execution by leveraging and simplifying technology. We have been privileged to work with Mark over the years -- as well as the great global team he has assembled and manages -- to support him in executing his vision. His recognition by CGT magazine is well deserved.\" \nMondelēz International, which until 2012 was known as Kraft Foods, is a $35 billion consumer goods company best known for brands such as Oreo, Cadbury and Nabisco.
