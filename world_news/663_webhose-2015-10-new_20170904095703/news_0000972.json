Easy: Just live in the parking lot of the tech company's Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. That's what Brandon S., 23, has been doing since he started working for Google this spring, the Washington Post reports. Brandon started out interning for Google in summer 2014 and paid about $100 a night for an apartment ... that he was almost never actually in. \"I wake up, catch the first GBus to Google, work out, eat breakfast, work, eat lunch, work, eat dinner, hang out at Google, and eventually take a bus home, pack my gym bag for the next day, and go to sleep,\" Brandon wrote on his blog . Inspired by another Google worker who lived out of a van in the parking lot for more than a year, Brandon decided to do the same. He bought a 16-foot box truck with 128 square feet of indoor space, spending about $10,000 for the truck plus repairs, and now his only monthly expense for the vehicle/dwelling is $121 for insurance. This week, thanks to saving about $2,000 a month in rent, he broke even on the cost of the truck. He's saving money on food, too: He doesn't want to keep any in the truck for fear of a rodent infestation, so he eats most meals—for free, a company perk—on the Google campus. He can also shower and work out there. When he's back \"home,\" he has installed all sorts of amenities, from a bed, dresser, and clothes rack to a bike rack , and he's even had friends over for a \"truckwarming party.\" As for Google, its security doesn't seem too concerned; three months after Brandon \"moved in,\" they contacted him ... just to cross-check the truck's registration file with the company database. But there are certainly some no-fun aspects of his living situation, like battling bugs . (Brandon isn't the only one creatively dodging high rents .)
