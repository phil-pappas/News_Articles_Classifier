(TSE: 8114), a leading global brand in the design and manufacture of POS solutions and peripherals, will exhibit its full POS portfolio at GITEX Technology Week 2015, the largest ICT event in the Middle East region. \nOccupying pride of place in Posiflex’s portfolio at GITEX will be the MT-4008A , the company’s newly unveiled cutting-edge Android mobile POS solution. The MT-4008A is designed to meet the needs of small and medium-sized retail and hospitality businesses that wish to offer their customers a more personalized, interactive experience with mobile POS functionalities. This new addition to the extensive Posiflex range is available from the third quarter of 2015. \nLike its award-winning Windows-based sister tablet (MT-4008W), the MT-4008A shares versatile functionality, a robust yet lightweight design for comfortable use, quick transformation into an all-in-one POS with the optional dock station, and extended operating time resulting from advanced power saving technology plus a removable battery within the pistol grip to sustain extra intensive usage. \nOwen Chen, President at Posiflex Technology, Inc. says, “The MT Series represents the pinnacle of all Posiflex’s experience and know-how in POS hardware for mobile retailing and hospitality.

The updates made to the fanless POS terminal XT Series and POS Box TX Series will provide various options from mid-range to high-end.
