OXIS' lead drug candidate, DT2219ARL is a novel bispecific scFv recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies and a modified form of diphtheria toxin as its cytotoxic drug payload. DT2219ARL simultaneously targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors. When DT2219ARL binds to cancer cells, the cancer cells internalize DT2219ARL and are killed due to the action of drug's cytotoxic payload. DT2219ARL has demonstrated success in early human clinical trials in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. OXS-4235 is a small molecule therapeutic candidate targeting the treatment of multiple myeloma and associated osteolytic lesions. In in vitro and in vivo models of multiple myeloma and osteoporosis, OXS-4235 demonstrated the ability to kill multiple myeloma cells, and decrease osteolytic lesions in bone.
