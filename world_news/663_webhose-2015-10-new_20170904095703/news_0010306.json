Two Facebook pages, run by anonymous persons in Jammu & Kashmir to lure youngsters into joining Jehad, have also been removed.\n\nA committee comprising senior officials of Intelligence Bureau, home and information technology ministries, CERT-In (cyber security prevention body) and other agencies met on Wednesday and discussed issues related to terror threats emanating from the internet. Its particular focus was on use of social networking sites by terror outfits.\n\nThe two websites, blocked on IB's request, had details on how to make bombs, carry out lone-wolf attacks and Jehadi training modules. The two Facebook pages, now blocked, were being run in the Kashmir for a few weeks, sources said.\n\nSources said nearly 55-60 websites and pages of social networking sites that contained terror-related activities had already been blocked by the government this year.\n\nSecurity and intelligence experts meet once a month to discuss threat from social media and CERT-in is given details of the websites to be blocked for carrying out Jehadi propaganda. Earlier this year, CERT-in had blocked 26 websites/URLs related to IS.\n\nThe move comes even as the government is planning a 24x7 body to track suspicious activities on the internet and talks are on with internet service providers.\n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:32:21.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
