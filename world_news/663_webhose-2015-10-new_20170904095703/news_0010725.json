The construction is now complete and the houses are ready for occupation, but I find the quality of the materials used to be very poor or sub-standard. What remedy do I have here? Can I go to the consumer court? What kind of evidence do I need to prove my case? First and foremost, I would suggest that you get together with other members (or all members) of the society who may have a similar grievance and file one common petition (class action) seeking compensation for all. That would work to your advantage. However, before filing, you will have to gather strong evidence to back your complaint. So first and foremost, you need to carefully examine the agreement between the society and the construction company, to check the specifications made by the society with regard to the quality of construction material, fittings, floorings, etc. If what has been used is not of the quality agreed upon or specified by the society, then you can straight away accuse the construction company of indulging in unfair trade practice, besides providing defective goods and deficient services. You must know that under the Consumer Protection Act, if the goods sold or used is not of the quality specified, then they come under the definition of ‘defective goods’ (even if they are not technically defective) and the consumer has the right to seek redress against such goods. Second, you should get a construction audit done by competent people – it requires examination of the quality of construction, testing of the material used in a laboratory, etc, but it will give you a strong evidential backing. Once you have these, you need to file the case against the construction company and if the society had engaged the services of experts to oversee the quality of construction, then they also ought to be proceeded against for failing in their work. You can seek compensation to cover the cost of repair or seek a direction to the builder to set right the defects. You can also ask for compensation for the harassment caused, besides the cost of litigation. Are there any precedents? Can you Quote: an example of one such case that came up before the consumer court? Well, in a number of cases, the consumer courts have directed builders to set right the defects in buildings and also awarded compensation to consumers However, I will Quote: here a case that emphasises the need for adequate and strong evidence to back such complaints. In this case, the cooperative group housing society had filed a case against the architectural firm engaged to oversee the work of the builder, alleging that poor quality of supervision had led to defects in the building. The National Commission, after a detailed perusal of the case, however, held that the society did not convincingly establish its allegation that the various defects mentioned in the complaint were all attributable to the architects who failed in discharging their duties and responsibilities under the agreement. So holding them liable only for certain deficiencies on their part, it asked them to pay Rs 61,000 to the consumers, after retaining half of the unpaid fees due to them, being Rs 39,000. (The Mayur Cooperative Group Housing Society vs. Osan and Associates, FA no 359 of 2003, decided in November 2008) In short, the case highlights the need for production of better evidence to win the case. As I said earlier, the society needs to prove violation of the agreements. It is also better to get the construction audit done by reputed companies. In fact in this case, the society had given, as part of the evidence, a certificate by a government-approved surveyor and loss assessor, on the defects and the cost of repairs. The architects or the respondents, however, raised questions over the competence of the surveyor. Also, for reasons best known to the complainants, the contractor was not named as the opposite party along with the architect, which I feel should have been done. So file the case by all means and get adequate compensation to cure the defects, but make sure that you have good evidence. Having said that, I must also point out that before engaging parties for the work of construction and supervision, one must always ensure that proper agreements detailing the work expected of them are drawn up. It is always better to consult a lawyer on this and ensure that adequate penalties for non-performance or poor performance or delays in execution of the work are clearly incorporated. So also clauses for curing any construction defects for about ten years following the construction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:57:08.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
