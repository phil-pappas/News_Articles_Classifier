ModernLend was founded in June 2014 by Kobina Ansah and Shuo Zhang , and is an online lender to international citizens in the U.S. that uses alternative data metrics to identify credit-worthy borrowers.\n\"LendingFront and ModernLend are deserving winners of this BBVA Open Talent final, and we're pleased to help them raise their profiles,\" said Gustavo Vinacua, director of Innovation Centers and Open Innovation at BBVA. \"We anticipate that each of them will realize their potential as industry disruptors, and we look forward to working with them and learning new ways of thinking — and banking — from them.\"\nLendingFront and ModernLend claim two of the six spots in the winners' circle for BBVA Open Talent 2015. Bitnexo and Destacame.cl were named the BBVA Open Talent 2015 winners from Latin America last week in regional finals in Mexico City . European winners will be named next week during that region's finals in Barcelona .

They will also have the opportunity to enjoy a day of innovation in the kitchen of Spain's El Celler de Can Roca, BBVA's culinary tour partner, which landed at No. 1 again this year on Restaurant magazine's influential World's 50 Best Restaurants list.\n\"Over the past two days, we've had firsthand access to the mentoring capabilities of BBVA senior leadership, and we're ready and excited to meet other team members and learn even more during the immersion program,\" said Ansah, of ModernLend.\nNow in its seventh year, BBVA Open Talent is an annual global competition and part of the BBVA Group's open innovation strategy, which encourages partnerships with entrepreneurs and developers that are disrupting the financial industry. In 2015, BBVA Open Talent focused on fintech in order to discover the startups that could have a direct impact on the financial services industry, or other relevant industries, like e-commerce, user experience or big data.\n\"Judging by the entries in this year's edition of BBVA Open Talent, there is much to look forward to in the financial industry,\" Vinacua said. \"BBVA intends to be a bank that thrives in the face of so much disruption, and we want to continue to find ways to partner and work with these innovative startups.\"\nA winner of last year's competition, Epiphyte , was on hand to demonstrate technology it's pioneering that uses the blockchain for peer-to-peer and remittance payments.\nFor more information on BBVA Open Talent 2015, please visit the BBVA Innovation Center .\nAbout BBVA Group\nBBVA Compass is a subsidiary of BBVA Compass Bancshares Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of BBVA (NYSE: BBVA) (MAD: BBVA).
