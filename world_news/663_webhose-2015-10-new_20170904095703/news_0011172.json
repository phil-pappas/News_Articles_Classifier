Sound waves are created by the vibration of an object, which causes the air molecules around it to vibrate. These vibrations cause our eardrums to vibrate, which the brain then interprets as sound. When the original vibration is very fast, so are the sound waves, and the pitch of the sound created is too high for the human ear to hear. \nIn the natural world, animals like dolphins and bats use these ultrasonic waves to communicate, but humans have discovered practical applications. The most commonly known is medical ultrasonography, although in the last 30 years some organizations have discovered highly effective, chemical-free cleaning applications and technology. Ultrasonic cleaners work in a very similar way to a loud speaker, except the ultrasonic waves travel at a much higher frequency and through water instead of air. A high-frequency electronic generator that creates ultrasonic waves is connected to a diaphragm, a flat or cone-shaped structure similar to the visible cone-shaped portion of a loudspeaker. The generator vibrates the diaphragm at a specific high frequency, usually between 25 and 170 kHz, inside a specially designed water tank. The ultrasonic waves created cause the water molecules to vibrate rapidly, creating alternating waves of compression and expansion within the water. During the expansion phase, or rarefaction cycle, the liquid is torn apart, creating cavitation bubbles . These bubbles are where ultrasonic cleaning technology is born. \nHow does ultrasonic technology clean? \nCavitation bubbles (Fig. 1) are vacuum cavities as tiny as red blood cells, or about 8 thousandths of a millimeter across. They are so small that it would take 1,250 of them lined up in a row to reach 1 cm long. \nUnder pressure of continuous vibration, these bubbles stretch and compress at a fast rate. Once they reach a certain size, as determined by the frequency and strength of the sound waves produced, the bubbles lose structural integrity and collapse violently. When these implosions happen near a surface, the bubbles emit high-powered streams of plasma that travel at more than 500 miles per hour and collide with, agitate and remove even very tiny particles and substances from that surface. \n(Fig 1) Illustration of an Ultrasonic Cavitation Bubble \nIn an ultrasonic cleaning machine, this happens millions of times per second, but because cavitation bubbles are so small the process is both highly effective and very gentle. Ultrasonic technology can be used to clean metals, plastics, glass, rubber and ceramics. It effectively removes a wide variety of contaminants, even if present only in trace amounts, including dust, dirt, rust, oil, grease, soot, mold, carbon deposits, polishing compounds, wax, pigments, lime scale, bacteria, algae, fungus, fingerprints and biological soil. \nThese contaminants typically are removed even if they are tightly adhered to or embedded onto solid surfaces, or if they are in remote cracks or tiny crevices of an object. For this reason, items usually do not need to be disassembled before being put safely in an ultrasonic cleaning unit. \nThe Power Behind Ultrasonic Cleaning \nSince all ultrasound waves are generated using the same basic technology, it follows that all ultrasonic cleaning systems include the same basic components. Energy is generated via a bank of ultrasonic transducers mounted to a radiating diaphragm (Fig. 2) . This transducer is then mounted to the unit’s cleaning tank where it is immersed in water or an aqueous solution. It’s essentially a stereo system under water. \n(Fig. 2) Two Ultrasonic Transducers: with the lid off (back), with the lid welded on (front) \nThere are two types of transducers used in ultrasonic cleaning—magnetostrictive and piezoelectric. They create the same result using very different technology, therefore each has different benefits and limitations. \nMagnetostrictive transducers work on the principle that iron-rich metals expand and contract when they are placed in a magnetic field. Thin plates of these metals are stacked up to make a core. Copper wire is then wrapped cylindrically around the core and the assembly is placed in a canister. When an electrical current is sent through the copper coil, a magnetic field is created and the core changes shape. When the electrical current is turned off, the coil returns to its original shape. This expansion and contraction causes the device’s canister to resonate and generate ultrasonic waves. \nMagnetostrictive transducers are remarkably durable, though its overall competitive advantages are quickly decreasing as the technology around piezoelectric transducers evolves and improves. The use of iron-based metals means there is no degradation over time; metals like nickel maintain their magnetostrictive properties on a constant level for the lifetime of the ultrasonic cleaning unit. The metal stack is welded directly to the unit’s diaphragm ensuring the bond will never loosen. Also, diaphragms used with this type of transducer are usually 5 mm thick or more, eliminating the risk of cavitation erosion wear-through. \nWhile magnetostrictive transducers have a higher mass and can drive more power into the tank, their use is limited. They can only generate a frequency between 22 and 30 kHz, so its use is restricted to cleaning applications where the parts are large, the contaminants are difficult to remove and complete removal of microscopic particles isn’t required. Their energy generation process has three steps in energy conversion—electric energy to magnetic energy to mechanical energy—making it less efficient overall. \n(Fig. 3) A Piezoelectric Transducer Unassembled \nIn piezoelectric transducers (Fig. 3) , crystals with special electrical properties called lead zirconate titanate are connected with electrical wires attached to opposite faces of the crystal. Both the crystal and wires are housed between two metal plates. These layers are then stacked together and fastened down. (Fig. 4) When electricity is passed through the crystal, it changes its shape. When the electricity is taken away, it returns to its original shape. This vibration causes the unit’s diaphragm to vibrate and create the ultrasonic wave necessary for the cleaning process. \nPiezoelectric transducers are less expensive to make and offer a wider variety of applications. These transducers can produce a wide variety of frequencies—between 25 and 170 kHz or more. They convert low-voltage electrical energy into mechanical energy in one step, making them cost-efficient to run frequently and for longer periods of time. \nIt used to be the case that the magnetostrictive transducers held a longevity advantage over its piezoelectric counterpart for two reasons: 1) When piezoelectric transducers were first developed, they used quartz crystals which lost significant power over time. Now, piezoelectric transducers use semiconductor ceramic materials that eliminate 99 percent of that strength degradation and lengthen their lifespan. 2) The adhesives available in the early days of piezoelectric transducers weren’t very strong and would degrade over time. However, adhesives developed over the years by the aircraft industry are much stronger, making the difference between welding and adhesion virtually negligible. \n(Fig. 4) Piezoelectric Transducer Parts Assembled \nPutting Transducers to Work \nWhen it comes to ultrasonic power generation, the frequency these transducers generate determines their effectiveness for any given application. \nWith lower frequencies, fewer cavitation bubbles are produced, but the bubbles are greater in both size and the energy released at implosion. This increases the likelihood of physical damage to items being cleaned. Softer metals like aluminum and brass may show what is called “cavitation burning.” Likewise, higher frequencies generate more bubbles that are smaller in size and offer a lower level of energy and gentler cleaning action. \nIt’s important to note that when generating an ultrasonic frequency of 25 kHz, ultrasonic units must contain a matching generator that can stand up to that mass requirement of the transducer. When frequencies between 40 and 170 kHz are required, many companies will use the same transducer along with a generator designed for the specific frequency output required for the application. \n25 kHz: The Heavy Weight Boxer \nA 25 kHz generator is used with larger mass items, such has a large cast iron block used for injection molding, a massive steel cutting tool or large stainless steel plates. It works best when the contaminant is on the surface of the item and requires a little more punch to remove it. This frequency also works well for removing baked on materials and is often found on plating lines for pre-treatment prior to the plating process. Larger tanks often are retrofitted with 25 kHz systems for these types of jobs. \n40 kHz: The Workhorse \nThe vast majority of ultrasonic cleaning applications require the mid-sized cavitation bubbles created by a 40 kHz generator. Approximately 90 percent of all ultrasonic cleaning applications can be addressed at this frequency. It has enough power to shake contaminants loose but is small enough to penetrate closer to the substrate. This frequency works best when items have many through-holes and/or complicated blind holes that are difficult to reach using the larger cavitation bubbles generated at lower frequencies. \nTypical applications of 40 kHz generators include carburetor cleaning, removing oils and metal chips from general machine shop applications, soot removal from items damaged in fires, cleaning of ceramics used in the high technology fields, removal of biological contaminants from surgical tools and many more. \n68/132/170 kHz: The Gentle Touch \nHigher frequency generators are more rare, only accounting for approximately 5 percent of the ultrasonic cleaning market. These generators offer ultra-fine gentle cleaning, including removal of micron and submicron particles, and cleaning applications that require cavitation bubbles to implode closer to the substrates being cleaned. Common applications are found in the medical and optical industries, but also in semiconductor wafer fabrication, production electronics, fine instrumentation and computer memory components. \n1,000 kHz (1 MHz): Megasonics \nWhen using frequencies of 1 MHz (1 million cycles per second) or higher, ultrasonic technology becomes megasonic technology. The energy is created using the same type of generator, just at a much higher frequency. The resulting cavitation is gentler and more controlled; only the side of the part facing the cleaning unit’s transducer is affected. This reduces or eliminates cavitation erosion and the risk of surface damage to the item being cleaned. Megasonic generators can be used when cleaning semiconductor wafers and industrial parts, but most frequently they are used when preparing silicon medical implants. \nAnalog vs. Digital Generators \nIt’s important to note that all ultrasonic generators (Fig. 5) are generally analog in design. In a typical unit, all or most of its components are analog, including resistors, capacitors, transformers and inductors. The nature of the technology allows a more simple mechanical design and the use of digital technology does not enhance the effectiveness of the ultrasonic cleaning process. \n(Fig.5) Side View on an Exposed Internal Ultrasonic Generator Unit \nDigital technology becomes useful to consider regarding circuitry and manufacturing—the machine’s controls and communications. While manual controls are still common and effective on ultrasonic units, microprocessing chips can be installed and programmed to control all or part of the machine’s adjustable levels, including frequency, frequency sweep modulation and waveform patterns. \nTypes of Ultrasonic Cleaners \nUltrasonic cleaning units come in a variety of sizes, based on the intended use of the machine. Their tanks are typically made of stainless steel and are rectangular in design. Transducers are mounted, placed or welded to the tank, most often to the bottom, but units can be customized with side-mounted, hanging or bulkhead-mounted transducers. \nTable Top Ultrasonic Cleaners \nThese units are small enough to sit on a table, shelf or workbench and be moved easily. They are simple in design, with single tanks ranging in size from half-gallon to 8 gallons and higher frequency levels (though 40 kHz is the most prevalent), making it safe for even very delicate items. They are intended primarily for lighter duty applications, including optical parts, small gears, machined parts, bearings, surgical instruments and carburetor components. \nBench Top Ultrasonic Cleaners \nThese units have the small size and mobility of tabletop machines, but provide larger capacity options and more cleaning power. The typical frequency used is 40 kHz, but this style of unit also can be custom built at lower and higher frequencies. Bench top units can have tanks as large as 20 gallons, which make them more suitable for high volume. They can be used even in extreme environments, such as out at the site of a natural disaster or wildfire. Bench top tanks are designed for tough or unusual cleaning jobs, and are often used in the machining, automotive, marine and 3D printing industries. \nLarge-capacity Industrial Ultrasonic Cleaners \nThe largest ultrasonic tanks can include tanks as big as 1,000 gallons or more. These units are meant for applications requiring lower frequencies (25-40 kHz), including larger or heavy duty equipment such as over-sized manufacturing parts, automotive and marine parts and large musical instruments. Units may have multiple built-in stages, including rinse and dry stations, and are sometimes automated. \nSolvent-Free Cleaning \nDuring the 1980s the level of understanding about ozone depletion and various chemicals and gases that contributed to it grew rapidly. In 1987, leaders from many countries signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer . It established legally binding controls on the national production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and, if it continues to be successful, will significantly phase out production and consumption of ODS before the middle of this century. \nWith the implementation of the Montreal Protocol over time, restrictions or bans on the chemicals often used for high-level cleaning, including solvents like 1,1,1-trichlorethane, carbon tetrachloride (tetrachloromethane) and Freon, are increasing. Organizations of all kinds need to find alternative cleaning methods that are effective without the use of harsh chemicals. Many are turning to ultrasonic technology. \nUltrasonic cleaning machines typically use water only, a water-based soap solution or a mild solvent. This largely depends on the material of the item to be cleaned or the contaminant being cleaned from it. \nCleaning Solutions \nAs ultrasonic cleaning technology was developed, it was discovered that if surface tension is reduced, cavitation levels increase. Cleaning solutions used with ultrasonic cleaning machines contain ingredients specially designed to increase the effectiveness of the process. These are called surfactants and they lower the surface tension of water. \nGeneral-use Soap Solutions \nThese solutions have a high alkaline content and are designed to remove a number of contaminants from metals, plastics and fabrics, depending on their formulation. Soap-based metal cleaners will remove oil, grease and carbon deposits. Those formulated for use with plastic and fabric items won’t clean oil-based deposits from these materials. \nDescalers \nDescaling detergents are formulated to clean metals laden with corrosion, rust, hard mineral deposits or heat scale. They are designed to help restore parts that have been in service in hard water or high-humidity environments. These solutions are acidic in nature. \nEnzyme Detergents \nEnzymes are used to degrease stainless steel, aluminum, brass and titanium parts, and can be more effective than general-use soaps when removing oil and grease. They are designed to clean heavily oiled surfaces when an oil-free environment is preferred or required. They also can be used effectively to remove biological contaminants from medical, surgical, dental and optical tools. Enzymes typically consume oil residue and digest it off as carbon dioxide. \n(Fig. 6) Our LpH ultrasonic cleaner solution \nLow pH Cleaners \nLow pH (Fig. 6) , or acidic, cleaners come in a number of formulations and can be helpful in several ultrasonic cleaning applications. Citrus-based cleaners clean and protect metals from the effects of chemicals. Some of the stronger low pH cleaners may damage certain materials, specifically aluminum, copper and brass. Citric acid solutions are used to passivate stainless steel and titanium by removing the free iron molecules from the surface of the metal to help prevent future corrosion such as rust. \nSpecialty Detergents \nSome solutions are formulated to clean specific contaminants like smoke, soot and certain odors. Although these specialty detergents will work very effectively when used in certain application, they can be harmful or ineffective when used outside of their intended use. \nThere are several additional considerations when determining if or how to use solutions with your ultrasonic cleaning application: \nLongevity \nSome solutions have a longer lifespan than others, which helps decrease long-term cost, but all solutions have their pros and cons. For example, when removing oil and coolants, users must choose between using an emulsifier solution or separating detergent. An emulsifier holds oil in suspension within the fluid so it does not float to the surface of the fluid in the tank. It is more effective at removing the oil, but it doesn’t last as long; once the solution is saturated with oil, it is no longer effective. A separator can remain effective for up to three months or longer. However, it cleans less effectively and, since oil rises to the surface of the tank, users risk recontamination during item removal unless filtration systems—overflow weirs or surface spargers—are added to the unit. \nDisposal \nMost ultrasonic cleaning baths are environmentally friendly and water-based, but, depending on the solution used and the contaminant removed, various methods of waste disposal may be required. Most ultrasonic cleaning baths are 92-95 percent water, and wastewater evaporators will reduce the amount of material requiring disposal by that amount. These solutions also often can be effectively neutralized or filtered until it can be released into the sewer system safely and legally. Some companies pay waste management firms that dispose of their materials in drums. \nHeat \nSolutions are often used in combination with heat, which effectively eliminates entrapped air in the water tank. For most applications, a temperature of 122-149 °F (50-65 °C) is effective. However, for some medical applications it is generally accepted that solutions should be used at temperatures below 100 °F (38 °C) to prevent protein coagulation. \nTypes of Metal & their Contaminants \nMetal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:10:53.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
