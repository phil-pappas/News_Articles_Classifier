Or, they are even going without food for days because of the erratic rainfall,\" Miriam Grove, IFRC operations manager in the Sahel region, said in the statement. \n\"These people need urgent assistance,\" she said, adding that \"if we can help them now, we can maintain their nutritional status and give them the tools and seeds necessary to survive worsening conditions next year.\" \nThe organisation warned that without more aid to the region, \"the prospect for many affected people is bleak.\" \nMichael Charles, IFRC acting regional representative in southern Africa, acknowledged that \"the regularity with which we see food insecurity in Africa has left many people apathetic.\" \n\"But the crisis currently facing millions of families is not inevitable and should not be acceptable,\" he said, insisting \"there are many things that we can do to stop this food crisis in its tracks and alleviate the impact on vulnerable people, but we need international support to make this happen.\" \nMalnutrition is already high in region, with the UN children's agency reporting that a full 37 percent of children there are stunted -- a clear indication of long-term nutritional problems. \n\"Further decreases in the availability of nutritious food may be life-threatening for children, people living with HIV, and other vulnerable groups,\" IFRC warned. \nThe organisation said it needed around eight million Swiss francs ($8.1 million, 7.25 million euros) to provide 205,000 of the most vulnerable people across six countries with urgently needed food aid and help equip their communities to withstand further climatic shocks. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:38:42.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
