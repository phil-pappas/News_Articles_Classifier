We’re doing well locally and with our niche targets nationally, but winning this competition will bring a certain amount of validation to everything we’ve done so far. Even if we don’t win, the publicity and exposure we’ll get from being involved in this event, in a town like New York City, could prove invaluable.\n“We’re also looking forward to the one-on-one time with so many investors. We want to make partnerships, we want to make those connections, and most importantly we want to grow.\n“There’s going to be thousands of New York businesses represented at the public expo and pitch sessions. It’ll be great to work with so many businesses we wouldn’t be able to reach by staying in Chatt, and we’re really excited to make a statement in this city!”\nJames Dawson and Text Request will be in New York City for Techweek between Wednesday, Oct. 14 and Saturday Oct. 17, competing with 49 other startups from across the nation for a chance to win $50,000.\nMore on Text Request:\nText Request is an intuitive cloud-based platform that lets consumers and businesses engage each other in real-time, two-way personal text conversations.
