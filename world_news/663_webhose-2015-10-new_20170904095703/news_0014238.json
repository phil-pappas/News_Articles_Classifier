Online or mobile video is the number one place for that,\" said Tian Hou, an analyst at TH Capital in New York. \nAbout 30 U.S.-listed Chinese companies have received offers to go private this year, according to Hong Kong research firm MCM Partners, many in the belief that higher valuations are available back home. \nIn the biggest proposed deal, a consortium offered to buy security software maker Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd for about $10 billion in June. \n\"Looking ahead, our opinion remains that with a relatively calm domestic market, the going private transaction looks increasingly attractive to founder/managers that have put forward bids,\" said Ryan Roberts, an analyst at MCM Partners said in a note on Friday. \nChinese stocks have been rising recently after falling sharply from June on worries the economy was cooling. \nAlibaba said its all-cash offer of $26.60 per American Depositary Share represented a premium of 30.2 percent to Youku Tudou's closing price on Thursday. \nYouku Tudou's New York-listed stock was up 24 percent at $25.26 in premarket trading on Friday. \nYouku Tudou's chairman and chief executive, Victor Koo, supports Alibaba's offer, Youku Tudou said. \nKoo, a Bain & Co alumnus who holds an MBA from Stanford University, owns about 18 percent of Youku Tudou, according to a securities filing. \nYouku Tudou has formed a special committee comprising two independent directors to consider the offer. \n\"Digital products, especially video, are just as important as physical goods in e-commerce,\" Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said in a statement. \n\"Youku's high-quality video content will be a core component of Alibaba's digital product offering in the future.\" \nThe $5.2 billion valuation is based on Yukou Tudou's 194.47 million shares outstanding as of June 30. \nTaking into account the cash on Youku Tudou's books, Alibaba will need to pay about $3.6 billion to acquire the rest of the company, according to a source familiar with the matter. \nAlibaba, whose shares were up about 0.3 percent at $71.99 premarket, said it would fund the offer with cash on hand.
