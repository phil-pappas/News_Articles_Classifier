Without reform, we’ll likely see a continued proliferation of costly and ineffective state-based chemical regulatory programs that confuse consumers and manufacturers alike. Congress must restore the public’s confidence in EPA’s chemical control laws, and one way of doing so is by passing S. 697. \n“The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21 st Century Act provides a bipartisan federal framework to ensure a healthier regulatory environment for manufacturers to compete and thrive, strengthen our economy and drive future job growth. With 60 bipartisan co-sponsors from 38 states, now is the time for the Senate to pass this much-needed, common sense reform legislation.” \nAbout CEA: \nThe Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is the technology trade association representing the $285 billion U.S. consumer electronics industry.
