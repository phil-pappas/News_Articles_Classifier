And no doubt, Accel Partners has provided highly informed and valuable advice to Atlassian on how to grow the business into global markets.\nThe US private equity firms focus primarily on revenue growth, with earnings secondary. This is the case with Xero – named after its earnings – and not its market capitalisation.\nLou Richard, from Newport Capital. Louie Douvis The TMT companies listed on the ASX are unlikely to achieve the scale and valuation of Atlassian. The middle-market ones struggle against global players, so seem unlikely to hit the high bar that Atlassian has.\nSo what's out there in the Australian TMT market with the potential to hit the high ceiling hit by Atlassian and Xero?\nThere are some companies with global market potential and many, if not all, struggle to raise funds to spur growth.\nFinding a niche Finding yet another opportunity to take market share from the Saturday Sydney Morning Herald classifieds by innovations online seems unlikely. Cars are done. So are dating, tradies' ads, restaurant takeaways and boats.\nBut speech biometrics is not fully done, and companies such as Auraya Systems stand a good chance. Internet gateway security is also not fully done – companies such as Firstwave Cloud Technology have upside.\nLooking deeply into hot sectors such as fintech can produce interesting opportunities, such as Canberra-based mHITS in the payments space.\nA lot has been made of the value of crowdfunding for start-ups, but it seems to be dying before its actual birth. Standing outside Wynyard station with a sandwich board extolling the virtues of a start-up and with a begging bowl in hand is unproductive.\nOther opportunities But what investors with vision can do, is look for what changes can be made to drive billions in revenue.\nPrivatising Australia Post and transforming the business to capture internet-of-things opportunities for huge and rapid growth could be interesting. But could it be a strain on the government and the board?\nHealth tech is hot – health informatics and e-health are still immature. Companies such as Best Practice Software – especially if merged with Medical Director, owned by Primary Health and now announced as a non-core asset – could take the global markets by storm.\nThe real challenge for entrepreneurs and investors alike, is to look into the future and establish real needs for innovative technologies – what may sell in today's market may be in the bin in the three years it takes to bring a new technology to market.\nReally effective crystal balls are rare.\nLack of local knowledge In the early-stage TMT sector, major challenges exist – to raise funds and grow in global markets. The fundamental issue – which we have encountered – is that despite being located in plush premises in high-rise buildings with fancy foyers – very few of the local PE's, VC's and high-net-worth families have any depth of understanding of emerging TMT markets and their technologies.\nIf you want to advise people on which car to buy, how to finance it, drive it and how best to have it serviced, this is facilitated by having driven a car. Not many of the high-rise clans have driven TMT companies.\nTo identify high potential, early stage TMT companies is difficult – even for a firm such as Newport Capital with 26 years in TMT M&A and advisory.\nWe tend to avoid early-stage TMT companies seeking to raise small amounts of capital. Basically because they can't afford to pay us fees for the blood, sweat and tears we invest in a capital raising.\nSome are prepared to offer some equity for our work, and if we see high potential, we pick up the shares and go for it.\nOverseas lessons and new ideas In Israel, powered by technologies often developed by their defence forces, TMT seems to work well – with James Packer and some wealthy Australian tech entrepreneurs now there with their cheque books.\nOur two key focus points in early-stage TMT companies are, first, the likely traction of the technology in global markets – over the horizon – using our crystal ball and, second, the team.\nThe team needs commitment, honesty and integrity, a well-informed vision, deep skills and a total determination to hit the high ceiling in global markets.\nEarly-stage TMT companies must have selling skills, too: to sell investors, sell their technologies and sell their teams to aspire to greatness.\nMany years ago, I visited a famous US VC based in a tall building on Sand Hill Road in the Valley. I asked him how he found his deals – which included Apple at an early stage.\nCan we do it? He said, \"Come over here. Look through the window down to the corner of Sand Hill Road. See those people – guys and girls – with sandwich boards extolling the virtues of their enterprises? That's where I find my deals.\"\nThere is no Sand Hill Road in Australia, and there are few VC's with deep knowledge focused on TMT. Yet there is a constant flood of early-stage TMT companies seeking capital.\nWill having a tech-savvy Prime Minister make the difference? Will our Minister for Innovation – Christopher Pyne – learn in weeks what can take others decades to get?\nWill the Tax Office allow immediate deductions of any amounts invested in TMT companies times 200 per cent? Will the Australian Technology Park open its doors to rent-free start-ups and provide mentoring by highly expert and experienced people?\nWill the Department of Social Services pay entrepreneurs market-rate salaries to get early-stage TMT companies buoyant? Will a tax-free zone be created on the central coast with infrastructure to house TMT start-ups?\nWe'll see.\nLou Richard is owner and managing director of Newport Capital Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:23:32.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
