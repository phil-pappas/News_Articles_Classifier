Good health. There are aspects of everyone’s lives which they are likely not to share with the world. Their reasons for keeping some knowledge from the world is driven by many things, but some are to the tune of not seeking sympathy, regret and them probably having the ability of making life hell for themselves or someone they care about should details become openly available.\nIt is so strange that there are so many of us on this planet yet when you get robbed you keep thinking “Why ME?!” when, quite frankly, you’re not all that special. I don’t mean this in a malicious way. Okay, maybe a little – haha! I too have been robbed, once upon a black moon, and all I kept feeling was anger. The sort of anger people feel when they discover that they or someone they know closely has been affected by something such as a chronic illness. In this class I can think of asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, various autoimmune diseases, and last, but certainly not least – cancer. Now, because these are so wide it is safe to assume that they affect pretty much everyone you know including yourself. The worst has however got to be when it’s a brother, sister, a parent or even yourself.\nIt is when you read and/or listen to someone affected by something like this directly that you realise just how deep the cut from long-term suffering really is. I am not a member of the medical fraternity so let me not bore you with the technicalities. What I feel is simple – appreciate everything you have. If you lost a right hand appreciate having the left. If you lost both then appreciate having someone to care for your needs. Life’s not easy, and we all have a painful story to tell.\nI am no different.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:10:14.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
