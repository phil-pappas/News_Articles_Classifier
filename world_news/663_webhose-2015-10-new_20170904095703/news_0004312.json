This highly actionable technology platform lets dealers immediately deploy their advertising budget more effectively by focusing their efforts on vehicles and zip codes that drive profitability, or have the most strategic importance to the dealership. ZipDriven was introduced to the public during the Digital Dealer Conference in Las Vegas on October 5, 2015. Showroom Logic will continue conducting live demos in their booth (#223) using dealers’ actual market share data.\n“Dealerships have access to several OEM and third-party data sources, but none of it is actionable,” said Neal Gann, CEO of Showroom Logic. “ZipDriven is truly a breakthrough because, within seconds, Dealer Principals, General Managers and Sales Managers know which vehicles to target - by zip code - and which competitors are standing in their way.”\nZipDriven was designed by Showroom Logic Founder and Chief Product Officer Patrick Bennett, whose AdLogic platform revolutionized automotive digital marketing when it was introduced in 2012. “Traditionally, there has been a pretty wide gap between this kind of data and a dealer’s marketing strategy”, said Bennett. “This gives them the ability to see where they are losing vehicle sales to competitors, and direct their digital marketing budget toward what they really want, which is to take market share.”\nZipDriven will initially be available with new car sales data, and will quickly be expanded to include lease and used car sales. It will be scaled to include additional data platforms to give dealers even more insight into market share and digital marketing opportunities. Finally, it will include market share opportunity data to help dealers in states where vehicle sales data is not available for legal reasons.\nDealers not attending Digital Dealer 19 can try ZipDriven by running a free report for one of their models at http://www.ZipDriven.com . It can be purchased for $199 per month, with the price increasing to $499 per month on February 1, 2016.\nAbout Showroom Logic\nShowroom Logic is an innovative digital marketing technology company driven by its proprietary AdLogic and ZipDriven platforms.
