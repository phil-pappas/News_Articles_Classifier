The service connects them with marketing professionals willing to promote the product in exchange for company equity or a percentage of gross product sales for a fixed period of time.\nThe service is free for both software developers and marketers. After contact is made and the parties agree to terms for working together, Promote Builders recommends they formalize the relationship with a written contract. Examples are provided on the website.\nPromote Builders accepts professional programmers and hobbyists. Many programmers work on pet projects in their spare time. Often, these software products sit on the shelf because the developer doesn’t want to or doesn’t know how to market the software. Promote Builders was designed to eliminate this obstacle.\n“Prime Time is my educational math game,” said game designer Ben Shirley. “It helps kids in the 3rd through 9th grade have fun as they learn math. Teachers and parents approve of the game. Students would even come to class early to play. Unfortunately, sales failed to materialize. Although I programmed since age 8, marketing was still a black box. The frustration of watching a good product die on the vine was the spark needed to create Promote Builders.”\nSoftware Developers register for the site in the Builder role, which allows them to post their product in the Active Products list. Marketers register in the Promoter role and after reviewing Active Products, contact the Builder of the product they wish to market. Future enhancements to the site include automating contract creation, providing project management services, and granting access to a Kickstarter-like funding app designed for software product campaigns.\nFor more information about Promote Builders or to sign up as a developer or marketer, visit http://promote.builders.\nPromote Builders is owned and operated by TC Software LLC of Chicago, IL.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:55:37.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
