This universal application is an extension of the current NC4 Street Smart operating platform now accessible from mobile devices, laptops and tablets as well as large-scale displays including Microsoft's new Surface Hub. \nThe application enables officers to go from an 84 inch Microsoft Surface Hub in the roll call room to the desktop and to mobile data terminals (MDTs) in their police cruisers. In addition, the application now allows for an \"out of the car\" user experience further utilizing Microsoft's Surface and Windows Phone devices. The crime fighter is now able to utilize native Windows functionality including GPS location services and onboard cameras on mobile and tablet devices for picture, video capture and upload capabilities, giving officer's easy-to-use, mission critical tools for fighting crime. \n\"Built with help from more than 4 million people around the world, Windows 10 marks the start of a new era of personal technology, designed to empower people to do great things,\" said Rick Zak, director of Microsoft's Justice & Public Safety Solutions. \"NC4's new app flexes the power of Microsoft's latest technologies to help law enforcement better fight crime and protect citizens.\" \nNC4 Street Smart is a state-of-the-art tool that provides real-time data to keep officers informed and protected as they patrol our communities. It creates an environment to quickly share crime-related information enabling officers to stop crime faster by visualizing data points on maps and aggregating and sharing relevant information through situation-based bulletins and secure blogs. This allows the law enforcement officer to achieve constant situational awareness and maximizes the absorption and dissemination of tactical intelligence to and from the organization. \n\"In this day and age, officers need all the information their organization has available in order to keep them safe. The new NC4 Street Smart Windows 10 Universal Application allows officers to stop fighting crime via email and instead puts mission critical data directly in their hands in an easy-to-use application,\" said Robert Wolf, Vice President of Public Safety for NC4. \nNew Castle County Police Department in Delaware is the launch agency for the initiative. New Castle County PD has been instrumental in helping NC4 in the early design stage and in providing hands-on input. \nNew Castle County Chief of Police Colonel E.M. Setting states, \"NC4 Street Smart is a valuable technology that allows our officers to obtain and view detailed data quickly, efficiently and securely. With the fast pace of each investigation, having the ability to share and review data on various platforms in the field is more important than ever. We are excited and honored to be part of this new initiative with NC4 and Microsoft. The New Castle County Police look forward to utilizing this new application to not only prevent crime, but to also solve cases and rapidly make arrests to prevent more citizens from being victimized.\" \nStop by Booth #5214 at the IACP Conference to see the Microsoft Windows 10 Universal Application for NC4 Street Smart in action. \nAbout NC4 NC4 delivers safety and security solutions for both business and government organizations.
