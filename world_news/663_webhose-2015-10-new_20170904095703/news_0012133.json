Samsung Electronics and other cash-rich companies were considering share buybacks as a primary option, it said without elaborating.\nSamsung Electronics' share price is down 3.6 percent so far this year, as the world's top smartphone maker struggles to reverse sliding market share and margins in its handset business due to competition from cut-price Chinese manufacturers and Apple Inc's latest iPhones at the upper-end.\nThe firm in January said it bought back 2.45 trillion won ($2.15 billion) in shares as part of a plan announced in late November 2014.\nSouth Korea's stock exchange has asked Samsung Electronics to comment on the report by 0900 GMT. The firm had no immediate comment.
