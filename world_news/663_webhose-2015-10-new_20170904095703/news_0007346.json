Karhoo’s chief competitor will be Uber, the world’s best funded private technology company, which has raised $10bn and is valued at $50bn . \nDaniel Ishag, 41, chief executive and founder, seems undeterred — albeit conscious that “timing is key”. He notes that Karhoo is making its move after others have spent money proving a taxi app market exists — and is catching the taxi industry’s incumbents at a vulnerable moment. \nFearful of the disruptive impact Uber is having on their businesses, groups such as New York private hire operators Carmel and Dial 7, and the UK’s largest minicab company Addison Lee, have signed up to make their cars available through Karhoo. \n“Generally speaking, a monopolistic environment where you’ve got one really big, dominant player doesn’t always do the best for service,” said Mr Ishag. “We’re in a position where we’re able to create a vendor-neutral platform for both the locals and the larger players to compete.” \nAnd the established players think it stands a chance. “We’re confident with the amount of investment they are making,” said Catherine Faiers, chief operating officer at Addison Lee. “They will bring something new to us in the form of incremental bookings.” \nUber’s model has been to create its own fleet, with drivers downloading its technology to be connected to customers. Karhoo has chosen a different path, offering rides solely from established companies — allowing consumers to choose between different providers and differing fares. Taxi companies will dictate prices, with Karhoo taking a 10 per cent cut from each journey. \nThis is not a new idea. Many early taxi app groups, including Gett, Hailo and Kabbee all operate by providing access to established taxi fleets and licensed drivers. But Karhoo is better funded, having raised $250m, and set out plans to raise another $1bn next year, according to people familiar with the matter. \nIt has done this by securing money from wealthy individuals and people associated with private equity groups — the types of investor traditionally overlooked in big tech fundraising rounds. \n“We have very much of a private equity background and a private equity mentality,” said Mr Ishag. “We have strong backers who encouraged us to batten down the hatches, just focus on execution and motor forwards.” \nNick Gatfield, former chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment, who has personally invested in Karhoo, said: “There’s room for several players in a market this vast. It’s not necessarily first mover advantage either. It’s for people who can look at the mistakes and successes of other businesses and build on that.” “I do get blown away by the amount invested in these [taxi app] companies and their valuations. It’s crazy. A lot of people, particularly those who invest in the later fundraising rounds, will lose money.” \n- Richard Holway, chairman of TechMarketView \nNevertheless, analysts point out that Karhoo stands at a financial disadvantage to the global leaders, each of which have raised more than $1bn: Uber and Lyft in the US, Didi Kuaidi in China and Ola in India. \n“Working with groups like Addison Lee gives them credibility,” said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at CCS Insight. “I wouldn’t rule them out on day one, but they’re going to have to throw a lot of money into marketing.” \nRival taxi app groups have also used their financial strength to engage in heavy price cuts, to win customers from each other. But Mr Ishag claims that even this may be to Karhoo’s benefit. “Uber did very well in over-subsiding the market to squeeze out a lot of other players.” he suggested. \nHowever, others continue to question the funds being invested in start-up apps. Richard Holway, chairman of TechMarketView, the industry analysts, said: “I do get blown away by the amount invested in these [taxi app] companies and their valuations. It’s crazy. A lot of people, particularly those who invest in the later fundraising rounds, will lose money.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:49:44.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
