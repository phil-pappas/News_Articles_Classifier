SVP of e-Learning Ginger Bell to see the new Morf Media Inc. social training platform for mortgage industry professionals. Building upon its success with the Morf Learning TRID training course, Bell showed the company’s next new offering for new hire training and mentoring courseware on a smartphone. \nIndividualized, Smart, Social, Fast & Fun: The Secret Sauce to Gen Y Engagement \nMorf Media Inc. is building a digital training platform with courses developed by industry experts in the mortgage industry. For the first time, mortgage lenders can deliver one-to-one training to their staff and new hires on a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop. Now, mortgage loan officers can get the training they need anytime, anywhere, in a way that is individualized, intelligent, social, fast and fun. The platform offers three-minute mini training sessions with feedback, and game-like capabilities for an individual to compete with other team members and earn rewards as progress is made. The solution offers managers a quick and easy way to get reporting on an individual’s progress and compare with other staff performance. \nBell commented on why “easy, fast and fun” matters in the world of training today. “The trainings you received in the 20th century, and that you are likely delivering to your employees today, don’t cut it with Millennials. They are a different breed of learners, and if the training culture of your company isn’t up to snuff by their standards, you will likely watch these young geniuses come and go, taking with them valuable human resource opportunities and wasting your time, money, and effort.” http://bit.ly/1hfaZSB \nAccording to Bell, a veteran training expert, Millennials want engagement. They want mobility and they want social feedback online. They want participation and connectivity, and they definitely expect technology. Bell stated, “Imagine a training where, instead of human widgets all sitting obediently in their rows, trying to consume particle-board-dry information, there is dynamism. Imagine the energy in your company when new hires feel empowered to contribute to a training, are given a chance to express some ownership, and thus find a deeper meaning for themselves than just the acquisition of facts. Imagine that these trainings take place in a fraction of the time of the old-school model. They are attended on mobile devices, giving employees the creativity and flexibility that has been a hallmark of the millennial generation from the beginning ( http://huff.to/1wRdH1Z ). That is the secret sauce to attracting and training Millennials and that’s what we are building into the Morf Media platform right from the start.” \nTo learn more, please visit www.morfmedia.com . \nAbout Morf Media, Inc. \nMorf Media, Inc. is the developer of Morf Learning™ and soon-to-be-released Morf Playbook™, the game-changing training delivery platform, made easy, fast and fun.
