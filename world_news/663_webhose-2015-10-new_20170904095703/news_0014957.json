(NYSE:VZ) stated that it will begin providing roaming wireless service in Cuba from next week. As a outcome, it will develop into the initial American telecom firm to start the service. The announcement comes on the heels of the diplomatic relations restoration between the Americas and Cuba in July. Both the countries’ relationships have been strained for additional than 5 decades.\nIf Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) could launch the service, it was for the reason that the United States has accorded priority to the connectivity in its fresh relationship with Cuba’s communist. Incidentally, Cuba also named its very first Ambassador to the Americas on the exact same day. Following 1961, the nation is naming its Ambassador for the initial time. The United States removed the embargo on telecommunications technologies, as properly as, services and equipment as a fall out of both the nations move to restore diplomatic relations.\nThe American telecom firm is organizing to charge voice calls at $two.99 a minute and $two.05 per MB of information. That will make the choice a little bit highly-priced. The Americans, who are going to, need to invest in spend-as-you-go mobile phone to enjoy cellular service in Cuba from the State firm. Alternatively, they can have an account in a third country. The state telecom firm has not been offering information service.\nAt present, only two million people in Cuba are obtaining cell phone. The country has a population of eleven million. The regional authorities cited the embargo of the United States for the weak deployment of cell telephone connections. The nation is now hoping to reach 60% mobile phone connectivity before the year 2020 ends.\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)’s move will enable the Americans visiting Cuba. In April, Sprint Corp (NYSE:S)’s Enhance Mobile unveiled a prepaid strategy for the buyers in the United States calling, as properly as, texting Cuba. Telecommunication services involving the two countries have been passing through the third countries earlier.\nOur editors found this article on this site using Google and regenerated it for our readers.", "external_links": ["http://www.wallstreetscope.com/verizon-communications-inc-nysevz-to-launch-roaming-service-in-cuba/25431074/"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:00:49.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
