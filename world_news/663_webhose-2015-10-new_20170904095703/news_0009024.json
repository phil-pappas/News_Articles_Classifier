Today’s announcement has positioned SherWeb as a market leader in North America for Office 365 under Microsoft’s Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program.\nSherWeb started distributing Office 365 to its partners under the CSP program in Canada last year. It currently sells thousands of subscriptions every month through its channel partners. Jason Brown, Director of Product Management for SherWeb, said part of the company’s success with Office 365 can be attributed to its all-inclusive technical support and migration services.\n\"SherWeb is a new kind of distributor in the cloud services market,\" said Brown. \"What differentiates us from the others is our free 24/7 support and migration. The fact that we can offer multiple cloud services to clients in a single move is key to a partner’s success in the cloud.\"\nResellers get to market in 10 minutes\nOffice 365 is one of the fastest growing products in the IT sector. SherWeb’s all-inclusive migration and support services will now enable US partners to resell Office 365 on their own terms within minutes. This means very little upfront investment.\nSherWeb has become a major player in reselling cloud services to partners in the US, mainly through its Hosted Exchange and Infrastructure-as-a-Service solutions. Becoming a distributor in the US will allow SherWeb’s 4,000 partners to take advantage of the company’s expertise and one-stop shop experience.\nMicrosoft’s CSP program allows partners to sell Microsoft cloud solutions with their own offerings and services. Partners own the complete customer lifecycle through direct billing, provisioning, management and support.\nAbout SherWeb Inc. – Since 1998, SherWeb has been helping businesses increase agility and trim IT overhead with our best-in-class cloud services.
