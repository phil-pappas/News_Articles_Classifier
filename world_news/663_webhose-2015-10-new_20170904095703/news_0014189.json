Nicolas Walker by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald It's never much fun being in hospital as a patient - and not just because no-one likes being sick. Hospital food is terrible, those gowns never do up and lying in bed is just so boring.\nBut one float hopeful wants to change all that.\nOneview Healthcare provides software solutions that integrate the hospital's IT systems onto one technology platform.\nIt means staff, clinicians and patients are able to use the bedside terminal for a range of different purposes, be it as a computer, a TV, a tablet or a smart phone.\nFor example, with Oneview Healthcare you could Skype your kids, log on to Facebook, and the terminal automatically pauses whatever is on TV once your doctor walks into the room.\nOneview Healthcare, which hung up its shingle seven years ago, is headquartered in Dublin, the location for R&D and software development.\nThe company recently raised €10 million from existing investors and its technology is present in healthcare facilities in the US, Australia and the Middle East.\nFund manager sources told Street Talk on Monday night that broker Moelis & Co has taken Oneview Healthcare on a non-deal roadshow in Australia in recent weeks and the reception has led all involved to think there would be demand for an initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange.\n Moelis is understood to be handling the float, with a deal tipped to take place in the first quarter of 2016.\nmore to come", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:21:56.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
