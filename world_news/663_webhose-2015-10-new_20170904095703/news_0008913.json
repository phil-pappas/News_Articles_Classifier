a responsibility fund firms could struggle to discharge if their products are bought and sold through an app.\n\"Our rules and guidance are what we call media-neutral, which means that irrespective of the way a service is delivered, consumers receive the same level of protection,\" an FCA spokesman said. \"As a result, if a fintech firm is offering a regulated service, they need to abide by the same rules.\"\nDILEMMA\nBritain is an established hub for fund management, and embracing technology is viewed as critical to helping fund managers connect with a younger generation of savers known as millennials, many of whom have fallen into an 'advice gap' after a shake-up in how financial advisers are paid.\nUK-based investors must pay upfront fees for advice and fund firms are no longer allowed to pay commission to the advisers who recommend and sell their funds.\nBut earlier this month, just two years after the reforms were introduced, Britain's finance ministry opened consultation on consumer access to financial advice due to fears the perceived expense of using advisers had deterred prudent retirement planning.\nSome fund firms are already responding to the demand for investment without recourse to an adviser.\nOnline investment 'supermarket' Hargreaves Lansdown has attracted a loyal following of savers who want to invest with little or no interaction with advisers - but only if they are willing to make independent investment decisions.\nIf clients opt to use this kind of 'execution-only service', which is far less lucrative for wealth managers, the firms who offer it cannot be held accountable for bad investment calls.\nBut the promise of faster, cheaper distribution and bigger market share via the web and smartphones has been overshadowed across the industry by worries that certain clients could buy unsuitable products and lose more money than they can afford.\n\"If a client which shouldn't be in a position to invest in a particular product, but is able to because of a new technology and loses money, then the system has failed structurally,\" said David Norton, head of investments at wealth advisor AES International.\n\"In that sense, it could enable the next mis-selling scandal easily,\" he added.\nROBOTS\nThe world's largest fund firm BlackRock is advancing further still, pumping millions of dollars into another fintech innovation known as 'robo-advice' - a concept designed to provide automated, algorithm-based wealth management guidance that could be easily delivered by phone or online.\nWhile the possible benefits are well trailed, few expect robots to replace human advisers any time soon. \"In the medium term, you're going to have to support it with a person,\" said Richard Keers, chief financial officer at Schroders. \"That person might be in front of you, might be on the telephone, might be on a Skype link.\"\nSome managers argue that many of those clamouring to use online, mobile or 'robo-advice' to bypass direct contact with a financial adviser are ironically the investors who most need face-to-face, bespoke guidance.\n\"I can't see how it can be quite as holistic and look at everyone's circumstances, in their entirety,\" Richard Marwood, senior investment manager at AXA Investment Managers.\n\"I just don't see how you're going to be able to do that on some kind of flow chart.\"\n(Editing by Pravin Char)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:44:09.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
