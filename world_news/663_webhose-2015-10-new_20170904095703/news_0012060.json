There are a number of frequency bands that are used by all of the manufacturers,” explained Taylor.\n“We transmit into those frequencies in the direction of the UAV using a directional antenna,” he told the BBC.\n“There’s quite a lot of radio power on to the UAV – so much so that it can only hear our Auds signal,” he said.\n 11, 2015 7:14 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:10:41.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
