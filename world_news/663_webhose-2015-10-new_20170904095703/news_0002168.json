The watch will be available from other retailers next month.\nThere are two options for the Gear S2. The standard watch (at $499) has a sporty look and users Samsung’s proprietary silicon watchbands. The Gear S2 Classic ($599) has a black finish, has a different bezel, a more traditional look, and comes with a leather watchband. This can be swapped with standard watchbands, which range from $59 to $89.\nBoth watches are classified IP68, meaning you can immerse them in water that’s no more than 1.5 metres deep. This makes the Gear S2 one of the few smartwatches that claims to be water resistant.\nAlthough it looks like a typical circular Android smart watch, The Gear S2 operates very differently. That’s because Samsung has ditched Google’s Android Wear operating system in favour of homegrown Tizen, which offers a different user experience.\nThe pièce de résistance with the Gear S2 is the rotating bezel, which makes it easy to flick through menu items and make selections on the go. It is not available as an Android Wear feature.\nA second strength is customisation. You can configure menus of four items with any apps of your choosing in any order you want, so if you particularly like fitness apps, you can make them available a click away from the watch face.\nAnd from my initial hands-on with the device, software screens have been designed to be easily read. There is also a selection of watch faces.\nThe Gear S2, like most smartwatches, shows SMS and email notifications, has voice recognition through Samsung S Voice, and you can initiate calls from the watch. However you conduct the calls from your smart phone.\nThe Gear S2 is 11.4mm thick, has a 1.2-inch circular screen with 360x360 pixel resolution, or 302 pixels per inch. Text is crisp and sharp. It has a 1.0GHz dual core processor.\nThe one question hanging over Gear S2 is apps. Tizen isn’t Google Android, so the device cannot run standard Google Play Store apps. However Samsung says it is working with local developers on converting their apps into Tizen, which it says is not difficult.\nIn any case, It is punting on users being enticed by its own software offering ahead of needing a plethora of third party apps on their wrists.\nThe Gear S2 can pair with any Android smartphone using Android KitKat 4.5 or newer Android versions, and with at least a 1.5 Gigahertz processor.\nWhether Australians will embrace smartwatches is yet to be seen, however research by Frost and Sullivan Quote: d by Samsung predicts that the Australian wearables market will grow by 78 per cent by 2018.\nThis article was first published in The Australian.\ngear s2.jpg", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:11:00.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
