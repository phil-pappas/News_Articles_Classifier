This also signals that more shoppers are starting on their holiday lists earlier this year. \n“With gas prices and unemployment down, and housing prices up, holiday shoppers are heading into the season with increased confidence in their spending power,” ICSC Spokesman Jesse Tron said in a statement. “While certain headwinds exist, such as uncertainty in global financial markets and minimal wage growth in the U.S., the positive macroeconomic trends are likely to win out and propel retail sales throughout the holiday season. As a result, it appears to be shaping up as a solid season for retailers, and if ICSC’s forecast holds, one that would better the average of the previous ten seasons by 1.5 percentage points.” \nThe study also found that 80 percent plan to spend the same or more this year, and predicts that shoppers will spend an average of $702 this season, up from $677 in 2014. Shoppers will split their holiday spend with $575 on holiday gifts and $127 on decorations, greeting cards, clothing, and other holiday-related items. And in a significant blow to online retailers, 95 percent of Americans plan to do their holiday shopping at brick-and-mortar stores. \nShoppers indicated their preference for brick-and-mortar because: They like to be able to see or try on the actual merchandise (46 percent); They don’t want to pay for shipping (36 percent); Sales are only offered in-store (30 percent); Returns or exchanges are easier in-store (28 percent); They enjoy the convenience of one-stop shopping (27 percent). \nThe top five categories for U.S. shoppers this holiday season are traditional gift cards (54 percent), electronics/devices (51 percent), apparel and footwear (49 percent), toys and games, not including apps or video games (42 percent), food like chocolates, popcorn and food baskets, and beverages/alcohol (34 percent). \nThe 2015 ICSC Holiday Shopping Survey was conducted Opinion Research Corporation from September 29 to October 1. The online survey included a nationwide demographically representative sample of 2,001 adults 18 years of age and older. Like what you are reading?
