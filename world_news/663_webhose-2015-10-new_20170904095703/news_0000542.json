(its closest rival, the iPhone 6s Plus, has a screen size of 5.5-inches)\nThe halo surrounding the Nexus P6.

I'm yet to make up my mind.\nNexus 6P and 5X. Photo: Ben Grubb\nThe Nexus 6P, which will start at $US499 when it goes on sale later this year, was one of two new Nexus smartphones unveiled at a Google event in San Francisco on Tuesday (early Wednesday morning in Australia). The other was LG's Nexus 5X, which will start at $US379. Australian pricing and availability is yet to be announced, but it's likely the phones will come to Australia soon, albeit at a higher price, which leaked pricing suggests will be around the $659 mark for the base Nexus 5X model and $899 for the base Nexus 6P model.\nPutting aside availability, both phones feature great cameras (front and back facing) for their price and are incredibly speedy. The speediness may partly be due to the fact Google says the new phones will have less \"bloatware\" installed than in the past — that annoying pre-installed software that no one uses that can clog up space.\nAnd despite the larger 6P looking ginormous, it's comfortable to hold. Both phones are also incredibly lightweight: The Nexus 5X weighs 136 grams while the 6P is 178 grams. (The iPhone 6s is 143 grams and the iPhone 6s Plus 192 grams.)\nIn the flesh: The Nexus 6P and 5X.

(The battery capacity of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s is 2750 mAh and 1715 mAh, so both Nexus devices beat them hands down.)\nAnd I also love how the fingerprint scanner, which allows you to unlock the phone with your fingerprint, sits on the back of the device. It's where all fingerprint readers should probably be on smartphones, as that's naturally where your index finger rests.\nBut the main feature I think most will find useful in the new Nexus phones is Google Now on Tap, a software feature in Google's latest Android mobile operating system, Marshmallow, which enables users to press the home button while within any app and have Google find relevant information about what it sees that they can then act upon if they choose to do so.\nGoogle Now on Tap could, for instance, recommend the phone number of a restaurant your friend has just mentioned in a text, or recommend that you put a calendar appointment in your phone based on what your friend said about meeting up with them at a particular time. Visiting a certain web page containing flight information? It could trigger certain recommendations or actions to take.\nAlternatively, if you're talking about a particular movie with a friend, it might offer up booking times for you to buy tickets. Now on Tap is basically an extension of Google Now, the tech giant's personal assistant and Siri rival, but made more accessible.\nApp permissions (like access to your photos and microphone) in Marshmallow have also been simplified and will not longer bug you until they're actually needed — something that will please many Android users who are used to pretty much signing their entire life away every time they install an app when it asks for permission for almost every part of their phone's operating system.\nThe writer travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Huawei\n​Follow Digital Life on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/digitallife_au", "https://ausdroid.net/2015/09/30/nexus-6p-and-nexus-5x-show-up-on-google-store-in-australia-with-pricing-and-a-bunch-of-accessories-coming-soon/"], "published": "2015-09-30T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:43:01.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
