Penny Pritzker , the American secretary of commerce, also said she was willing to negotiate a new deal with European officials, in part to reduce uncertainty for companies like Google and Amazon. And negotiators have been in daily contact over the last month as both sides geared up for the European court’s decision, according to several people with direct knowledge of the discussions. The European justice commissioner is expected to continue negotiations with her American counterparts when she visits Washington in late November. Several senior American officials, including Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, have visited Europe in recent months to jump-start the stalled talks. American officials say they have fined companies a combined tens of millions of dollars in recent years for failing to protect people’s online information. Those figures are significantly higher than in Europe, where financial penalties are often capped. Several agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, also say Europe has failed to consider improvements to American privacy safeguards over the last two years that restrict what information is accessible to the country’s intelligence agencies. Yet for many European lawmakers, their citizens’ privacy — which is enshrined as a fundamental right on par with the freedom of expression — cannot be guaranteed until Europeans can bring legal cases in the United States when their data is misused. Any new safe harbor agreement is expected to give Europeans that right. Officials also want to limit the ability of American intelligence agencies to access European citizens’ data when it is transferred outside the European Union. “Everyone keeps saying they’re close to a deal,” said Emery Simon, counselor to the Software Alliance, a trade body in Washington. “But what we want to hear is that an agreement has been done.” A version of this article appears in print on October 8, 2015, on page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: In Europe-U.S. Privacy Clash, a Longstanding Schism.
