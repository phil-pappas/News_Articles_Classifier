Universal Pictures\nLONDON--Defending the accuracy of the new movie \" Steve Jobs \", writer Aaron Sorkin said Sunday that his \"conscience is clear.\" The film's star, Michael Fassbender, and director Danny Boyle also described what they saw as the truth contained in the film, with Fassbender hailing Sorkin's screenplay as the best he'd ever read.\nSorkin, Fassbender and Boyle joined co-star Kate Winslet and other cast members in discussing the film at a press conference here at the London Film Festival 2015.\n\"It's a one-off that you get scripts like this,\" said Fassbender. \"I thought to myself, 'this is extraordinary writing.' It's the best script that I've read.\"\n\"Steve Jobs\" explores the life and personality of the late Apple co-founder in three acts, focusing on the backstage preparations for three key product launches and featuring some of the major figures in Jobs' life, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and the daughter Jobs long denied. While these people are real and the events really happened, most of the conversations in the film are imagined.\nThe filmmakers have previously addressed questions of accuracy by describing their portrait of Jobs as \" a painting, not a photograph .\" Sorkin on Sunday emphasised that the film is not \"a dramatic re-creation of [Jobs'] Wikipedia page\", while supporting actor Michael Stuhlbarg, who appears as Apple engineer Andy Hertzfeld, described how the film takes Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs as a starting-off point. Stuhlbarg explained that the film \"brings [the book] to life in a different way, giving a suggestion or a sense of the inspiration of what [Jobs'] inner life was like.\"\nInside 'Steve Jobs,' the movie (pictures)", "external_links": ["http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/09/4f86f6ec-aa40-4d66-b082-1069f427ef6a/resize/270xauto/a61bdda1e6ff30ac59294ae1faac5e37/2462d03300138rv2crop.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:51:48.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
