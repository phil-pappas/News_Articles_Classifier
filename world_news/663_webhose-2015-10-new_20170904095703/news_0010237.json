They are not planning a wider release just yet, as the device is essentially a proof of concept.\n\"We've all heard of wearables. Now it's time to start thinking about moveables,\" she argues.\nEven Bob Gale, the screenwriter and producer who created the original hoverboard concept for the Back to the Future film, is a fan of the design: \"It was a total high riding the Hendo because it embodied what we were trying to create in 1989. The Hendersons' movie-inspired technology has led to not only a functional hoverboard, but also other fascinating hover applications.\"\nA video posted by Tony Hawk (@tonyhawk) on Aug 22, 2015 at 11:03am PDT\nFor the Hendersons this type of technology has the potential to make a real difference across a whole range of industries, including transportation, structural isolation, industrial automation and even space exploration.\n\"If you don't have to touch the ground, what more does that enable?\" asks Greg. Arx Pax say the potential could mean being able to isolate structures from unwanted movements, which could have huge applications for buildings in Earthquake zones. It would also lead to changes in car assembly, allowing it to no longer be linear and in space to use magnetic tethering devises to grab satellites magnetically.\nFuture applications\nArx Pax's Magnetic Field Architecture is also being made available to teams competing in SpaceX's Hyperloop pod competition. It's designed to help accelerate the development of the Hyperloop , the proposed vacuum tube transportation system that would take passengers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in a mere 20 minutes, at 760 miles per hour.\n\"Our attitude is, may the best technology win.\"\nLonger term the significance of the technology goes way beyond what we can imagine. \"All we talk about is hovering, but the technology goes way beyond that\" explains Greg. \"This leads to a more efficient transmission of electromagnetic energy.\" The possibilities are huge.\nBut for many the big question is still, when will we get personal hoverboards? The answer according to Jill is no longer a matter of if, but when.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151021193651-2-0-4-engine-10-2015-exlarge-169.jpeg", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/142464853/hendo-hoverboards-worlds-first-real-hoverboard", "http://hendohover.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151021193651-2-0-4-engine-10-2015-medium-plus-169.jpeg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151021193651-2-0-4-engine-10-2015-small-11.jpeg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151021193651-2-0-4-engine-10-2015-large-169.jpeg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151021193651-2-0-4-engine-10-2015-small-169.jpeg", "https://instagram.com/p/6se0CqrHlZ/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151021193651-2-0-4-engine-10-2015-super-169.jpeg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151021193651-2-0-4-engine-10-2015-full-169.jpeg", "https://instagram.com/p/9H3CKwM0pa/"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:57:14.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
