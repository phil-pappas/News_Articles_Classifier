After George Lucas took the helm for episodes I to III (and the original IV), JJ Abrams brings his directorial clout to the seventh instalment in the Star Wars franchise, for what is one of the most hotly anticipated movies in history. \nThe new trailer doesn't provide many details in terms of plot lines, but shows new characters in action, along with appearances from old favorites including Chewbacca, R2-D2, and a more mature Princess Leia and Han Solo. \nThe trailer follows the release of the official poster, which follows the same style of posters from earlier Star Wars films, and signals the opening of advance bookings – although many outlets jumped the gun and began taking bookings early. \nYou can check out the new trailer below, along with the preceding teasers (or trailers, or teaser trailers...). \nStar Wars: The Force Awakens arrives in theaters worldwide on December 18.

Somewhere between enduring a winter in the Canadian Rockies and trekking through Chilean Patagonia, he graduated from university and pursued a career in journalism. Having worked for publications such as The Santiago Times and The Conversation , he now writes for Gizmag from Melbourne, excited by tech and all forms of innovation, the city's bizarre weather and curried egg sandwiches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:36:40.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
