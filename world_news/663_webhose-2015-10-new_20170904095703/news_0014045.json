It had to close down five of its ten units after it was forced to reduce power consumption by half. \nThe Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) reduced its supply to Sable, which ultimately forced the company to shut down its operations. \"Feasibility studies have been done to evaluate the commercial viability of using coal bed methane (CBM). The results of these studies are positive.\" \nSable's decision to shut the plant came after management held a meeting with the government and the power utility. \nSable Chemicals company secretary Victor Makoni said: \"Sable has an installed capacity to produce 240,000t of AN per annum. \n\"This volume is produced using 115,000t of ammonia, of which 72,000t is produced at the factory in Kwekwe, and the balance of 43,000t is imported from South Africa. \n\"To this end, feasibility studies have been done to evaluate the commercial viability of using coal bed methane (CBM). The results of these studies are positive. Migration to new technology will take some time,\" \nMakoni also stated that the company was considering taking both short and long-term measures to come out of the crisis. \nThe short-term measure includes immediately adopting a business model of manufacturing AN using imported ammonia, to ensure Zimbabwe ha adequate supplies. \nInstead of using the power intensive electrolysis technology, the company will migrate to a technology that manufactures AN using less power. \nThe electrolysis technology alone consumed 90% of the electricity supplied to Sable. The company was using the 'preferential tariff' to buy power from ZESA at five cents per kilowatt hour, when the industrial rate is 11 cents per kilowatt hour. \nSable owes over $200m to the government, because of which it cannot start importing ammonia immediately. \nSable Chemicals director Jack Murehwa said the company would retire the electrolysis plant and turn to CBM to produce ammonium from Lupane gas in three years.
