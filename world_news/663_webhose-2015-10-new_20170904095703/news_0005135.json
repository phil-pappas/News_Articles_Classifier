A video posted by @daisyridley on Oct 19, 2015 at 8:06pm PDT \nAlongside the video, posted on Instagram, the 23-year-old actress said: “Staying in a little b'n'b with my friend... Set an alarm to watch the trailer... My friend filmed my reaction. Totally emotional seeing it for the first time and so so so incredibly awed to be part of this incredible legacy #starwars #theforceawakens (sic)” \n\nHowever, her on-screen co-star John Boyega said he didn't film his own reaction to the trailer because he was stuck in traffic after attending a basketball game. \nHe wrote on Twitter: “Have I seen the trailer ? No! En route home from lakers game. It deserves a BIG screen. Have I seen the trailer ? No! En route home from lakers game.
