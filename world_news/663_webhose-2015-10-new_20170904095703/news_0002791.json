Further financial terms weren't disclosed.\nIn March, the companies formed their partnership, creating one of the broadest collaborations ever forged between a large Western drug maker and a Chinese biotechnology company.\nIndianapolis-based Lilly at the time said it would pay $56 million upfront to Innovent, a four-year-old startup near Shanghai, to co-develop at least three cancer drugs--including one from Lilly's research labs and two from Innovent. Also at the time, Lilly said it could pay more than $400 million to Innovent if one of the Innovent drugs hit certain development and commercial goals.\nThe deal gave Lilly a local partner to help speed up its introduction of new biotechnology-style drugs in the fast-growing Chinese market. It also expanded Lilly's efforts in two hot areas of drug development: drugs that unleash the body's immune system to fight cancer, and so-called \"biosimilar\" drugs, or knockoffs of brand-name biotech drugs.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n 12, 2015 07:07 ET (11:07 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:52:56.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
