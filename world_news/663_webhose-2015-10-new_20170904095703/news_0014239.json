Located on a quiet street at the Jinqiao business park in Pudong, the building is an architectural treat: clean lines, natural light, long corridors and expensive wood and glass. \nIt was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the same firm behind Dubai’s Burj Khalifa and New York City’s Time Warner Center. The 277,000 sq m site even has a lake, ‘eco-swamp’ and small coniferous forest — not to mention a meditation garden for employees to collect their thoughts. \nAll is calm inside the building, but this is surely deceptive. For Huawei has joined a fiercely competitive global race to become the first company to offer fifth-generation wireless networks, otherwise known as 5G, to customers, and it is determined to win. \nAt the Jinqiao centre, almost 10,000 researchers are working to crack what could be technology’s most lucrative code — the achievement of record breaking mobile internet speeds at a time when 4G provision is still patchy or non-existent in many parts of the world. \nHuawei has hundreds of other employees across the globe dedicated to 5G research. In July, it signed up to contribute to five major research projects led by the pan-European 5G Public Private Partnership (5G-PPP), which comprises telecoms giants such as Ericsson, Nokia, Orange Labs and Telefónica I+D. \nHuawei is a member of the Chinese government-led IMT-2020 (5G) Promotion Group, a network of Chinese research institutes and telecoms providers established in 2013 to facilitate international discussion on 5G. \nThe company also has a $7.6m investment in the University of Surrey’s 5G innovation centre (5GIC), which in February was reported to have achieved speeds of one terabit per second (Tbps) — thousands of times faster than current data connections. \nThe consortium claimed that at 1Tbps, a file 100 times the size of a feature film could be downloaded in about three seconds. This is an incredible feat, particularly when you consider that a previous record at the time — Samsung’s 7.5 gigabits per second (Gbps) — is less than 1 percent of it. \nHowever, telecoms firms have yet to find out whether it would be possible to replicate the speeds under commercial conditions. For that reason, Huawei invests heavily in research. It is a private company and guarded about sharing financial information, but a spokesperson tells Arabian Business the company aims to invest at least 10 percent of its total sales revenue on R&D every year. \nTo give an indication of how much money this represents, the spokesperson refers to Huawei’s carrier, enterprise, and consumer business division, which is responsible for the development of smartphones, mobile broadband devices, home internet and cloud services, as well as watches and other wearables. This division contributed to 66 percent of the group’s overall revenue in 2014 and invested $1.2bn on R&D in 2014. Of the division’s 15,000 staff, 70 percent work in R&D. \nThe Financial Times reported this year that Huawei’s spending on research had increased ten-fold between 2004 and 2014, from $600m a year to $6.5bn a year. The investment helped propel the company’s revenues from $4bn in 2004 to $46bn in 2014, although Huawei will not confirm the accuracy of these statistics. The company spokesperson says only that the group’s cumulative input on R&D has exceeded $30.7bn and that by 2018, Huawei will have invested $600m specifically in 5G research. \nThe industry has broadly accepted the definition of 5G as mobile connection speeds of up to 10Gbps for more than 100 billion devices at a time — although the University of Surrey’s research has created faster speeds than that — and this is what Huawei and many of its rivals are working towards. \nAt the Shanghai R&D centre, president of Huawei’s wireless marketing operation Qiu Heng shows journalists a futuristic display outlining the group’s plans for 5G and beyond. With 10Gbps network speeds, “anything is possible”, he states. \nThe industry is excited about 5G because the technological and commercial implications are huge. Faster download speeds would enable wireless networks to support hundreds more connections than is currently possible, so seemingly distant goals such as driverless cars that rely on a constant and reliable stream of real-time data to function safely and effectively would be theoretically possible. \nSo, too, would the creation of ‘smart cities’ wired up to a central information portal that could use real-time data to monitor events and facilitate more efficient public services. For example, if there was a fire in one part of a city, technology could be used to control traffic lights and divert traffic flows to ease congestion and allow firefighters to reach the emergency more quickly. \nUltimately, 5G would be the necessary next step towards developing the ‘Internet of Things’, the concept of a network of physical objects — drones, cars and buildings, for example — embedded with software, sensors and connectivity to collect and exchange data. Industry experts claim the commercial benefits of this are huge, as governments, companies and the public could use advanced technology to increase efficiencies and drive down costs. \nOn a basic level — and this has already been trialled by many ICT firms, including Huawei through its ‘smart home’ pilot — houses could be fitted with sensors to monitor energy consumption and help residents make informed decisions to reduce their bills. \nAccording to a report by Business Insider in April, the Internet of Things will add $1.7 trillion to the global economy in 2019, as a result of hardware, software, installation costs, consultancy services and increased efficiencies. \nHeng says Huawei has begun designing options for indoor and outdoor wireless base stations that could be installed in buildings and scattered across cities to improve wireless coverage. \nThe company unveiled a new ‘air interface’ technology at the Mobile World Congress trade show in March that it claims would facilitate the deployment of high bandwidth applications such as virtual reality. In tests, the new interface increased the number of wireless connections by 300 percent, says Huawei. \n5G could also be the bedrock of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) capable of communicating with humans in real time. “Speed is critical,” says Heng. \nHuawei Middle East vice-president Pan En says in an emailed statement to Arabian Business: “We believe 5G wireless networks will be capable of providing zero-distance connectivity between people and things, things and people. \n“It is a platform for disruptive new applications, new business models, and new industries. When we talk about 5G, we’re referencing networks that support 1,000-fold capacity gains, connections for 1 million devices per square kilometre and individual response time powered by 10 Gbps connection speeds per user. \n“Huawei started 5G research in 2009. We are continuing to spend considerable funds on 5G advances, particularly in technical areas like air interface and test bed developments. \n“The fact remains that 5G won’t come overnight, which is why Huawei is also working with operators to trial and implement 4.5G technology — an important bridge between today’s 4G networks and the 5G era.” \nAll of the above may sound like a brave new digital world decades away, but experts claim the interconnected 5G-enabled reality is closer than many would imagine. \nJoern Kellerman, senior vice-president of T-Systems, a division of Deutsche Telekom, told the Huawei Cloud Congress in Shanghai last month: “Digitalisation will transform all industries and its growth is very aggressive. Players will disappear if they do not manage their digital transformation properly”. \nDeutsche Telekom this year signed up Huawei as its public cloud computing partner in Europe. Kellerman said: “China wants to create the digital Silk Road to Europe, and enable the transfer of digital services from the Far East to Europe.” \nJoy Huang, Huawei’s vice-president of product management and marketing, told the congress that digital technology is evolving so rapidly that the so-called Moore’s Law – a long-held rule of computing that states that data chip capacity doubles every two years — “could cease to be true”. \nTelecoms firms in particular are racing to develop 5G to build up new revenue streams and fend off the threat posed by over-the-top (OTT) internet providers and voice over internet protocol (VOIP) players such as WhatsApp, Skype and Viber. At present, these operators are using established data networks to provide their services for free. \nUlf Ewaldsson, chief technology officer at Ericsson, told the Wall Street Journal at the Mobile World Congress in March: “There is an urgent need [for the industry] to cooperate more than in the past. The threats come from others who want to eat the cake of the operators.” \nAt the Huawei Cloud Congress, Khalid Alamansouri, chief information officer at Etisalat’s Egypt business MISR Egypt, agreed: “Revenue is being leaked to the OTTs; telecoms firms need to come up with better systems for monetising data.” He predicted that 212 billion sensors would capture and exchange the flow of data across the world by 2020. \nEtisalat has a partnership with Huawei to collaborate on research to expand networks and improve user experience. Two days after the congress, during a visit to Huawei’s global headquarters in the southern city of Shenzhen, an Etisalat spokesperson tells journalists the development and future roll-out of 5G in the Middle East and North Africa is a key objective for the UAE telecoms giant, despite not yet completely implementing 4G. \nThe spokesperson points to Dubai Ruler HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s ‘smart government’ initiative to enable citizens to process all government transactions in one place, remotely, on one mobile device — and that faster data speeds “are only the beginning” of what could be achieved in future. \nBack in Shanghai, the sun sets on another busy day for the Huawei laboratory. But across the world, thousands of researchers will pick up where their colleagues left off, racing to crack that elusive 5G formula before someone else gets there first. \nConnecting the Gulf \nHuawei’s plans for the Middle East mobile market \nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) is a key growth market for Huawei and the group aims to strengthen its brand and tap into high mobile penetration rates across the region, company spokesperson Jerry Huang told Arabian Business. \n“The Middle East is a very important region for us. Mobile penetration rates are high and if we continue to build our brand there we are hopeful it can be a testbed for other regions.” \nIn July, Huawei’s Consumer Business Division, which is responsible for the development of smartphones, internet services and wearables, announced year-on-year revenue growth of 69 percent to reach $9.09bn for the first six months of the year. It said Huawei Middle East contributed significantly to this, achieving 48 percent year-on-year growth. Its total income represented 32 percent of the parent group’s income — an increase of 24 percent on last year. \nSmartphone sales accounted for a substantial portion of the growth. Globally, revenue from Huawei’s smartphone business reached $7.23bn in the first half of 2015 — an increase of 87 percent from the same period last year. Huawei declined to reveal the value of total handset sales for MENA, but said North Africa and the Middle East taken as separate regions recorded year-on-year growth of 164 percent and 48 percent, respectively, in the first half of 2015. \nThe spokesperson declined to reveal Huawei’s MENA market share (it held an 8.2 percent share of the global market in the second quarter of this year) but said substantial H1 growth is attributed to its strategy since 2011 to focus on premium mid-to-high-end products and grow regional awareness of the Huawei brand. \n“The Middle East continues to be a high-growth market for Huawei consumer devices with the company investing in numerous flagship product launches in 2015 such as that of its P8 and P8max smartphone,” the spokesperson said. \nHuawei also ran its ‘Be The Star’ competition in May, encouraging would-be singers to submit online videos showcasing their talent for the chance to meet Arab singer Nancy Ajram, Huawei’s MENA brand ambassador. \n“We hadn’t done much brand publicity, so few knew about our brand even though we had sold millions of products over the years,” Huang said. \nHe added that increasing brand loyalty is one of Huawei’s main business targets for the next two-three years. “We want to become one of the top three global brands in the smartphone arena by 2020.” \nBeyond the smartphone business, the group has ambitions to trial ‘smart home’ and ‘smart city’ initiatives in MENA. There are substantial opportunities to create power-saving solutions to address high energy consumption and car usage in the Middle East, the spokesperson said. \nHuawei Middle East is headquartered in Bahrain and has offices across ten countries with a total of around 5,000 employees. \nPan En, vice-president of Huawei Middle East, said in a statement to Arabian Business: “In terms of consumer electronics, we might have thought of Europe, the US, Japan and South Korea in the past. But China is fast becoming a new fashion guide where there are not only world factories but also new industry innovators, of which Huawei is one. \n“Our goal and dream is to become the best-loved consumer electronics brand for world’s consumers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:29:36.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
