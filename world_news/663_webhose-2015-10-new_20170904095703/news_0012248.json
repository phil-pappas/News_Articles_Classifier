This new product thoroughly secures internet access. RelaxBox is a simple solution to the many dangers online, such as surveillance, malware, copyright trolls, and regionally locked content. Almost every device today is online like notebooks, tablets, smartphones, smart watches, and game consoles, the list never ends. All of these devices are potential targets for malware but having a security system in place for each and every one of them individually is simply not feasible. Users should be able to have a device and not worry about the maintenance—that is RelaxBox.\nHow does it all work? Anonymity and encryption are ensured by the VPN and anti-fingerprinting technologies used. Data security is provided by the integrated firewall, DNS filter, anti-virus software and intrusion-detection. The RelaxBox will offer subscription rates. There will be a Free, Basic, and Premium, each selection varies in bandwidth, and a very other differences. However, before this product can secure everyone’s internet access, RelaxBox needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise €10,000 by October 27, 2015. The funds raised will go towards launching production and manufacturing.\nTo help bring this innovative protection to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign by clicking here or click here for the English version. Perks will be delivered by November 2015.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help RelaxBox reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nCampaign: www.relaxbox.de (English version available)\nImages: www.relaxbox.de/digi\nContact: Maximilian Pohl\nTitle: CCO\nPhone: 0049-30-692052800\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
