If that is still a little too dear for you then it's worth checking out the Apple Sport Watch which starts at R5,899. \nBut, if money is no object then you'll want to take a look at the Gold edition which starts at R159,999 at Digicape. If you really want the high end watch then be prepared to fork out R269,999 for an 18-karat gold edition. \nCraig Parker, marketing manager at Digicape, said: \"We are thrilled to be selling Apple Watch at Digicapeâ€™s Cape Town and online stores soon. We believe Apple Watch will be one of the hottest gifts for the holiday shopping season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:24:54.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
