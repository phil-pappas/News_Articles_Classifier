Or is there something else going on?\" Kalanick asked at a Wall Street Journal tech conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. on Tuesday. \nKalanick said Uber is currently in its \"junior high\" stage of development, and that talk of going public now is like \"telling us to go to the prom.\" \n\"It's just a little early,\" he said. \"Give us some time ... something like that could happen but we're just not there yet.\" \nKalanick also said that Uber -- which is valued at more than $50 billion -- is still the underdog in some markets. \nThat includes China , which now makes up more than 30% of Uber's business. \n\"[China accounts for] almost as many [trips] as we're doing in the U.S., and we've been there a far shorter time,\" he said. \nKalanick said that Uber committed $1 billion this year to expansion efforts in China. Still, the company has a long way to go: \"The economics aren't quite as good when you're the number two ... like we are in China,\" he said. \nIn China, a company called Didi Kuaidi -- which recently formed a strategic partnership with Uber's U.S.-based rival, Lyft -- is the industry leader. \nBut overall, Kalanick said he's happy with the China market: \"We have not seen a single instance where we have been treated different than our competitor. That's all we ask for: Give us a fair shot.\" \nUber has a fraught relationship with many city governments, but Kalanick said that he sees his company fightingforcities, not with them: \"When you succeed, there are going to be incumbents who fight progress from happening,\" he said. \nKalanick said that as Uber gets bigger, he's had to learn to finesse his approach. \n\"If you're starting to be perceived as the number one, but you're still acting as the scrappy underdog, there's a cognitive dissonance with that,\" he said. \"There's a responsibly with success, and you have to be cognizant of that.\" \nMore from WSJD:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:02:48.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
