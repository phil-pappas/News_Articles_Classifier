In return we will have to pay higher taxes including your parents. Excluded will be those who already get 100% subsidies. We will therefor subsidise a lot of students who can actually afford their own tuition but would rather spend their money on booze and parties but they will still get free education.\nDo you for one minute think that the so-called students will study and pass subjects if everything is handed to them on a platter including Daddy's pocket money.\nWe subsidise the BEE companies who sell coal to ESKOM at 3 to 4 times the price more than corporate who actually keep the coal mining industry alive is able to. A scenario which can easily be compared to our rocket scientist under performing students.\nWhy do you think this is happening now.\nBoys and girls you/we need to grow up and get rid of the rotten apples among us. Zuma, un-disciplined soldiers, and violent and vandalizing students comes to mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:30:00.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
