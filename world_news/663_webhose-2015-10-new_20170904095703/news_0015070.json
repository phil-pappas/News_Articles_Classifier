Twitter received a complaint from sports video editing firm XOS Digital that @SBNationGIF had fired off tweets containing college football game content protected by copyright. \nAn @Deadspin account was taken offline by Twitter for slightly more than two hours late Monday, reportedly due to copyright complaints centered on video of US National Football League play. \nThe Deadspin account belongs to Gawker Media, an executive from which sent a tweet saying it appear the copyright complaint came from the NFL. \nTwitter declined to comment on specific account suspensions, in accordance with its policy. \nCopies of take-down requests showed that NFL showed that the NFL complained that Twitter's website was \"infringing copyrighted materials owned and/or controlled by the National Football League.\" \nA spokeswoman for the NFL told AFP that the organization sent Twitter routine copyright notices requesting that more than a dozen links to pirated game footage or highlights be disabled but it did not ask for the suspension of any accounts. \nA copyright complaint aimed at @Deadspin also came from the Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed martial arts promotion company, according to Twitter. \nThe ease with which video of key game moments can be captured and shared, sometimes in seconds-long snippets known as GIFs, has set the stage for fans to enjoy matches without leagues or teams benefitting from advertising or subscription revenue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:10:14.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
