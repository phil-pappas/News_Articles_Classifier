The mmWave frequency bands have the potential to support cellular data connections at speeds exceeding 10 gigabits per second (Gbps), a thousand times faster than current 4G data rates. \nThis grant will fund research to address economic and business-related questions, such as how should the mmWave spectrum be valued and auctioned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and how should businesses coordinate business infrastructure and spectrum resources, as well as continued research into the development of new mmWave technologies. \nResearchers involved in the project include experts in cellular and wireless communication technology, specifically mmWave technology, from NYU Wireless and the NYU Tandon School of Engineering , as well as experts in Internet and spectrum policy from the NYU Stern School of Business. \n\"Given the size and importance of the global cellular industry, estimated at more than $1 trillion, the research that will be conducted in this project has the potential to shape the evolution of spectrum policy,\" stated a news release from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. \"It is highly likely that mmWave bands will play a prominent role in the next generation of standards, given the severe shortage in conventional cellular bandwidth.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:01:30.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
