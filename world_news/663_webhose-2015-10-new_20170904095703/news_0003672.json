(Photo: Electronic Arts)\n15 CONNECT 22 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Video game players finally get their first crack at one of the holiday's potential blockbusters.\nPublisher Electronic Arts launched Thursday a beta for Star Wars: Battlefront , the upcoming action game for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One available November 17.\nThe beta is available through October 12, and features three game modes: Walker Assault on the ice planet Hoth, Drop Zone on Sullust, and a Survival Mode on Tatooine.\nWe got early entry into the Battlefront beta ahead of Thursday's launch. Here are five things we learned:\n1. There are definite Battlefield similarities. This isn't surprising when you consider the studio behind Battlefront -- DICE -- also designed the military-style shooter. But it clearly feels like Star Wars . Blasters don't need ammo, but players can't hold down shoot because their weapon overheats. Other items such as thermal detonators (grenades) feature cooldown periods, so players must wait several seconds before using them again. Both multiplayer modes are team-based, so you're working together to capture pods in Drop Zone or protect relays in Walker Assault.\n2. These levels go up to 5. The beta is capped at Level 5, but you get a taste of some of the gear players will be able to enjoy in the full game. There's a personal shield that will protect players for several seconds and Ion grenades that short shields or droids for short periods (it's kind of a variation on an EMP grenade). Cards representing extra items are earned through currency gained by playing. Players outfit up to two cards, one for each hand. For example, they can equip a thermal detonator and a Cycler Rifle, which works similar to a sniper rifle.\n3. The jump packs are great. This is the reason you want to get to Level 5 as quick as possible. Because you're a normal soldier on the battlefield, getting around requires a lot of running. The jump pack helps players move a lot faster. While tempting to have two weapons and grenade in your arsenal, the jump pack is by far the most useful item in the beta. Get it quickly.\n4. Walker Assault is fantastic . Drop Zone is the appetizer. Walker Assault is the scrumptious main course. Players enjoy 20-on-20 battles either protecting or taking out AT-AT Walkers on Hoth. This is also where you not only fly signature vehicles like Y-wings, but you can play as either Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. Icons pop up on the map granting either special abilities (Orbital Strike, Blaster Cannon), or access to vehicles and the most powerful Jedis on the planet. Once you secure the icon, you have about 10 seconds to tap the front bumper buttons (L1 and R1 on a PS4, for example) to use them. Then you're either in the cockpit of a vehicle or roaming Hoth as Luke or Vader. I only got to play as Vader, who can attack with a lightsaber or force choke soldiers. It's incredible. Even when you're not playing as Jedi, the sight of Darth Vader or Luke helping you as enemy soldiers descend is an awesome feeling.\n5. Survival Mode is solid, but too early to tell. For those who prefer cooperative play, there's the Survival Mode. Players must plow through six waves of Imperial forces before a drop ship requested by Admiral Ackbar arrives to pick you up. Pods drop periodically offering more gear to help fend off enemies. It's fun but definitely feels like a small slice of the experience. With a beta, that's to be expected, but it's tough to figure out whether this will be another strong mode, especially important since Battlefront will not include a traditional single-player experience .\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n15 CONNECT 22 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1LjXrRO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "http://usat.ly/1LjXrRO", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8427a10e623cf7e8a5ed8ce8c1ae56d7a58a6de5/c=0-0-716-538&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798986968736910-star-wars-battlefront-beta.jpg", "http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/17/star-wars-celebration-battlefront-does-not-have-a-campaign", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33d97f8a03d5ea06baca0f7a30eca34c8bd87643/r=500x281/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798986968736910-star-wars-battlefront-beta.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LjXrRO&text=5%20things%20we%20learned%20from%20the%20%27Star%20Wars%3A%20Battlefront%27%20beta&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798986968736910-star-wars-battlefront-beta.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LjXrRO&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:06:48.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
