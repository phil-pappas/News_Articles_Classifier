Instagram was full of travel photos from a range of destinations promoting tourism around the world. Australian travel brand 'hello world' were behind the 'Insta-relay' which included participants from over 75 destinations. The #HelloWorldRelay hash tag trended on Twitter and saw a host of engagement, with tourist boards getting involved with the action. Hello World created an interactive map highlighting where people had uploaded content.

A new glass-bottomed suspension bridge has been hung 180 meters above a valley in the Shiniuzhai National Geological Park in China. Nicknamed 'Haohan Qiao', meaning the 'brave men's bridge', it is the second glass-bottom feature in China. Earlier this year a horseshoe-shaped walkway was opened to the public in the South West of China. Twitter users from around the world commented on the new bridge, most calling it 'terrifying'. The bridge was originally made of wood however, even with its new glass structure a construction worker told China News Service that 'the bridge will stand firm even if tourists are jumping on it'. Wonder why someone's tweet is a little more negative or egotistical, it could be because they are tweeting from their phone rather than sat behind a computer screen.
