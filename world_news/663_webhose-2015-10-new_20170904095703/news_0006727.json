Highlights of the upgrade include an updated user experience, eventing and workflow capabilities, and flexible cloud options. \nIn addition, the company worked with the U.S. Department of Education to improve the way CampusNexus controls financial aid disbursements to students enrolled in online programs. The tool \"helps institutions reduce the risk of students taking on too much debt, while it also helps ensure compliance with disbursement rules state by state as online programs attract students throughout the country,\" according to a press release. \"Online programs and other nontraditional academic delivery still present challenges in terms of scheduling Title IV disbursements,\" explained Raymond Blackwood, vice president of product management at Campus Management, in a statement. \"While institutions want to offer students greater flexibility, there is still the need to better align disbursements with their academic progress and timelines. With the latest release of CampusNexus Student, institutions can now govern disbursements across a wide range of traditional and nontraditional academic models, from classroom to online, semesters to flexible terms, and even clock hour and competency-based programs.\" \nOther enhancements include: An expanded workflow designer, to optimize configuration and execution of business processes. Institutions are now be able to automate course registrations, customize wait listing rules, manage populations through student groups, and automate student notifications for changes in courses, enrollments and billing. A mobile portal that simplifies access to online services such as admissions, academics, financial aid and housing. Enhanced CRM tools that can be accessed directly through a Web client using any Internet connection. Support for real-time analysis of data, including data views and reports that allow users to launch workspaces configured to their responsibilities, priorities and preferences. \nFor more information, visit the Campus Management site .
