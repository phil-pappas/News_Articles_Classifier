Tuesday’s ruling overturns the commissioner’s initial refusal to investigate on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction over Safe Harbour.\nThe data commissioner’s office said in a statement it would now “proceed to investigate the substance of the complaint with all due diligence.”\nFacebook said in a statement it had never been part of a programme to give the U.S. government direct access to its servers and said it would respond to enquiries by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.\nThe ECJ ruling has thousands of U.S. and European companies mired in legal uncertainty over the transfer of personal data from Europe to the United States. That includes payroll and human resources information as well as data used for online advertising, which is of particular importance to tech firms.\nUnder EU data protection law, companies cannot transfer EU citizens’ personal data to countries outside the bloc deemed to have insufficient privacy safeguards.\nA lawyer for Facebook had asked to voice the company’s opinion in the Irish case, but withdrew that request when the judge said any ruling would not go into detail as to how the regulator should conduct its investigation.\nSchrems, who live-tweeted the ruling from the Irish court room, told journalists he expected the EU would have difficulty reaching consensus on a new framework due to disagreements between countries who want different levels of safeguards.\n“In the end you will have to have a solution because it’s not possible that within a European market you have different approaches,” he said.\n 21, 2015 8:43 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:50:29.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
