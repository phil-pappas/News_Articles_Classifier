Version 19 runs circles around Premiere Elements for about the same price. The version I reviewed, Pinnacle Studio Ultimate, for $129, is simply the best, easiest, most powerful midrange movie editing program I’ve used.\nThe ability to take footage from up to six cameras is a blast. You’ve almost certainly seen professional movies where the camera seems to be everywhere, shooting at all angles. Pinnacle Studio Ultimate lets you do that — easily.\nPinnacle makes lesser, cheaper versions of its movie editing software, but I recommend the Ultimate version. It has live screen video capture and can capture footage from VCRs and analog camcorders. It has excellent audio editing programs that get rid of background noise and other annoyances. It has thousands of themes, effects and background files. It will make your aged aunt look young again, as wrinkles disappear, thanks to included software called NewBlue Video Essentials 4. This feature allows you to turn day into night, transform your footage as if a fish-eye lens were used, add reflections, make a slide show, and more.\nMovie editing can be as simple as dragging and dropping scenes into a story board or, for more serious filmmakers, scenes can be dragged onto a timeline, where they can be edited. Adding special effects and titles is a drag-and-drop affair, and you can add layers of soundtracks.\nMovies can be transferred to iPads, Apple TVs and the Microsoft Xbox, and they can be uploaded and shared on social media sites. You can make elaborate DVDs of your movies, complete with soundtracks and special effects. Thirty days of free training films come with the software.\nOther Studio versions start at $59, but have far fewer features.
