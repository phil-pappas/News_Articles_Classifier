Toyota is developing a technology to combine images taken by cameras of many vehicles and automatically create a map. [Click to enlarge image] \nToyota Motor Corp announced that it is developing a technology to automatically create high-accuracy map data with automotive cameras. \nThe new technology may help automatically update map data required for autonomous driving and drastically reduce workload required for developing map data. \nIn autonomous vehicles, high-accuracy map data is used for estimating the location of the vehicle and using data on traffic rules. However, map data frequently changes as if it is living. If the updating process can be automated by using cameras of vehicles sold to general consumers, it becomes possible to increase the update frequency and drastically improve its \"freshness.\" \nToyota Central R&D Labs Inc has been engaged in the development of the technology since about 2007. An image of a road, etc is taken with an automotive camera when the vehicle is running. Then, errors in location data are corrected for each image, and an image is synthesized by using an in-vehicle computer. \nThe synthesized image is transmitted to a server, and data on the running path and traffic rules are added to it. Finally, data collected by many vehicles are combined to make map data covering a wide area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:54:10.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
