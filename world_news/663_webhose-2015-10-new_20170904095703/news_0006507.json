Pauline Cafferkey is in London Royal Free Hospital 's isolation ward after becoming ill in Scotland. She was thought to have beaten the disease and was discharged from an earlier hospitalization in January. Her family told the Sunday Mail newspaper she went to a Glasgow hospital Monday night but was sent home even though the doctor assessing her knew of her earlier Ebola treatment. Four days later she was flown by military plane into London for treatment in the isolation ward. Her family said doctors had missed a big opportunity to treat her earlier. Cafferkey was diagnosed with Ebola after returning from Sierra Leone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:51:14.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
