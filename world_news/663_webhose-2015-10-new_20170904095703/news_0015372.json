The Department of Labor said installers were not paid for every hour they worked, were not paid overtime and did not get paid for travel time. \nThe DOL took the issue to court in 2012, suing DirecTV and subcontractor Advanced Information Systems of Kent. The parties reached an agreement this month that requires DirecTV to comply with the fair labor act and to review agreements with its contractors across the country. \nDirecTV first stated it did not employ the installers, but rather the subcontractor did. The court found that DirecTV was a joint employer of the workers. \n  “This ruling represents major victory for workers’ rights in a landmark case against unacceptable fissuring practices used to avoid liability and responsibility in the workplace,” said Janet Herold, the DOL’s regional solicitor.\nDirecTV said it does not believe it violated the fair labor act.\n“While we believe we, and our current third-party contractors, have fully complied with the wage and hour laws in our DirecTV operations in Washington, we are pleased to put this dispute behind us,” a DirecTV representative said in a statement. \nRachel Lerman: rlerman@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter @rachelerman .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:26:07.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
