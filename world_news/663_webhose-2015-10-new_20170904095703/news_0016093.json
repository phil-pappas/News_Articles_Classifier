More than 30 top brands partnered with Yahoo to kick off this new era of sports programming, making this a sold out event. \n“It’s been a great opportunity to partner with the NFL and deliver a truly exceptional global live streaming experience for our users,” said Adam Cahan, Yahoo’s SVP of Product and Engineering. “We’re seeing a dramatic shift in the industry as audiences’ primary video watching moves away from TV. We were thrilled to join the NFL in setting a new standard for sports programming for our users and advertisers.” \n“We’re thrilled with the results of our initial step distributing an NFL game to a worldwide audience and with the work of our partner, Yahoo,” said Hans Schroeder, Senior Vice President, Media Strategy, Business Development & Sales for the NFL. “We are incredibly excited by the fact that we took a game that would have been viewed by a relatively limited television audience in the United States and by distributing it digitally were able to attract a global audience of over 15 million viewers.” \nAcross the 33.6 million streams and 15.2 million unique viewers, Yahoo brought fans a leading technical experience, performing with an average rebuffering ratio of nearly 1%, while delivering over 8.5 petabytes to end users. The stream reached HD levels, with max bitrates over 6.74 Megabits (Mbps) per second and 60 frames per second (fps). \nThe Bills/Jaguars game lasted three hours and 15 minutes, kicking off at 1:35 GMT and ending at 4:50 GMT. Jacksonville defeated Buffalo 34-31. \nABOUT YAHOO \nYahoo is a guide focused on informing, connecting, and entertaining our users.
