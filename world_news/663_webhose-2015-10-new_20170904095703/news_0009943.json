The easy to use, graphical tool helps ensure consistency of messaging across the entire contact center regardless of the situation, customer, or initiative. The scripting tool is robust and flexible as it guides agents to provide consistent, high-quality service during every customer interaction and ensures policies are followed correctly and accurately the first time and every time. The tool is extremely user-friendly to both managers and contact center agents and does not require any knowledge of either programming or scripting languages.\nThe web-based program empowers managers and supervisors to easily design scripts and support branch logic flows for the creation of interactions. A draft mode is provided for testing and review before a script is published and put into production in the contact center. Additionally, the program supports paused or interrupted calls and enables the interaction to resume at the point where it was stopped, thus avoiding the need to ask the customer to repeat their information.\nThe dynamic aspect of this scripting tool improves interactions and has a direct impact on customer satisfaction by enabling them to be more responsive to customers’ needs. Furthermore, the tool increases agent productivity while still keeping staff in line with company processes, goals and directives. In addition to helping guide agents step-by-step to ensure every customer interaction is consistent and goes as well as possible, supervisors can easily create, modify, and update scripts as the situation demands. The graphical nature of the tool means supervisors can easily edit scripts in real time, allowing them to quickly update their agents with changes to company policy, industry regulations, or new initiatives without negatively impacting the work flow within their contact centers.\n“Largely due to the cloud, we are now seeing increased accessibility and simplification of technology in the contact center space where advanced features, such as dynamic scripting, Omni channel support, advanced IVR, wall boards, reporting and analysis no longer require significant reliance on the IT department and an investment in complicated software or expensive technology,” stated Daniel Lonstein, Chief Operating Officer of AireSpring. “Our ongoing mission is to provide the most advanced features and functionality in an easy to use cloud application and allow contact center executives to focus on what matters most – customer satisfaction” added Lonstein.\nKey Features and Benefits of AireContact Dynamic Scripting Tool\n Deploys Instantly: No programming knowledge is required and scripts are built with an easy-to-use web-based, graphical user interface, enabling scripts to be created and deployed immediately.
