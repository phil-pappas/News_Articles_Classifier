That change became official at the end of the day Friday, though it won’t mean much to the 3.5 billion people who run Google searches each day. Nor will it change much at the other Alphabet companies, including Android, YouTube, Maps and Google Apps.\nD’oh \nWalmart laid off 450 workers at its headquarters Friday as the world’s largest retailer attempts to compete with the likes of Amazon.com. There are still more than 18,000 people who work at the main office in Bentonville, Ark. The job cuts were across all areas, from finance to global e-commerce. \nHot now \nShoppers may soon be able to sip a cinnamon latte while they cruise the aisles at Kohl’s. The company said Friday it is testing small cafes in two of its department stores in Wisconsin, a move to attract customers and boost sales. The retailer, based in suburban Milwaukee, will serve Caribou Coffee, caramel macchiatos, smoothies, and other packaged snacks in the cafes. “You want the customer to dwell more,” said Jon Grosso, executive vice president and director of stores told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. “You want them to spend time in the building.”\nThe Daily Briefing is compiled from San Francisco Chronicle staff and news services.
