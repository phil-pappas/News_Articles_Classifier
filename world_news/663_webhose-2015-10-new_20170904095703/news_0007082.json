The event will be launched on 5 Nov 2015 by His Excellency, Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, President of the Republic of Singapore. Singapore's Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Mr Ong Ye Kung will also attend the opening and take part in the Executive Roundtable discussion. \nThe Future of Learning \nThe Nobel Prize Series Singapore 2015 will feature a main conference and an executive roundtable about \"The Future of Learning\", four public lectures incorporating dialogues with students, as well as a special exhibition. \nThe travelling exhibition The Nobel Prize - Ideas Changing the World will be displayed at the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands, from 7 Nov 2015 to 24 Jan 2016. The exhibition tells the story of Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prize, Nobel Laureates and how Nobel Prize-awarded work has shaped and continues to change our world. For the first time, exhibition visitors will be able to explore the life of Alfred Nobel and the history of the Nobel Prize through a digital experience based on his will, which left much of his wealth to the establishment of the Nobel Prize. \n\"We are delighted to present the Nobel Prize Series in Singapore as a part of our global outreach with the ambition of raising engagement in science, literature and peace in line with Alfred Nobel's vision,\" said Dr Lars Heikensten, Executive Director of the Nobel Foundation. \n\"We believe in lifelong learning and the power of ideas. By stimulating dialogue between great minds from both science and society, we wish to inspire all participants, bring important issues into the public debate and make a difference with science as a starting point.\" \nProfessor Bertil Andersson, President of NTU Singapore and former Chairman of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry selection committee, said that NTU's partnership with Nobel Media and the Nobel Museum to present the first Nobel Prize Series provides a rare opportunity for some of the world's brightest minds to deliberate on a subject of enormous importance to NTU and Singapore. \n\"The future of learning is especially relevant to NTU and we have begun innovating the way students learn in a big way. Key initiatives include the introduction of the flipped classroom pedagogy, building more high-tech smart classrooms, launching massive open online courses (MOOCs) and setting up the Centre for Research and Development in Learning (CRADLE@NTU) to advance innovative approaches in tertiary learning,\" said Professor Andersson. \n\"It is apt and timely that Singapore is chosen as the venue, because this country is well-known globally for education excellence. Research and education are the twin pillars of any world-class university and NTU is no exception. This high-profile event where Nobel Laureates like Sir Harold Kroto who all share a common passion in learning is also a fitting tribute to Singapore on its 50th birthday this year.\" \nBusy schedule at Nobel Prize Series Singapore 2015 \nExecutive Roundtable Four Public Lectures by Nobel Laureates Public Exhibition entitled \"The Nobel Prize - Ideas Changing the World\" \nThe two-day programme will kick off with the Executive Roundtable on the morning of 5 November at NTU's latest architectural icon, The Hive.
