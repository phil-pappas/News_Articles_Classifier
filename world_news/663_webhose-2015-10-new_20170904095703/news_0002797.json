The money will inject capital into AngelList \"syndicates.\" A \"syndicate\" is a group of investors: with one who serves as the lead on a deal and others who contribute as backers. There are currently 165 of these syndicates -- led by investors like Tim Ferriss and Jason Calacanis -- that include a combined 4,400 investors. \nAccording to Ravikant, AngelList will provides data and insights to help CSC make investment decisions. AngelList has used a similar model with a $25 million fund from Maiden Lane. \nHeadquartered in the U.S., Upshot's fund follows the trend of Chinese investors getting into U.S. companies earlier and earlier. \nChina has been a big investor in startups in recent years: Companies like Uber , Snapchat and Airbnb have all raised recent rounds of funding from Chinese investors. \nRichard Chen, a partner at Beijing-based VC firm CeYuan, predicted this summer that more money will shift to younger companies. That can happen as a result of increased market volatility in both China and the U.S. \nRavikant said if all goes well, there's more money where the $400 million came from: \"It's pretty clear more capital is around.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:21:44.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
