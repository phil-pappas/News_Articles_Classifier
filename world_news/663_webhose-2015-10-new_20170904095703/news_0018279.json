Google will probably choose to leave the site as an inactive placeholder, rather than populate it with any new Alphabet content, and it's unknown how much they paid to gain control of the name. Interactive: Google Alphabet \nFormer Google employee Sanmay Ved claimed to have paid $12 to buy Google.com last month, before the company swiftly revoked his access around one minute later. \n\"I clicked the add to cart icon beside the domain (which should not appear if the domain is not available for sale),\" he said. \"The domain actually got added to my cart as seen by the green check-box, and the domain appeared in my cart.\" \nDuring the sixty seconds or so, Ved said he received emails from Google webmaster tools and notifications relating to other sites owned by the company. \nSelling on domain names can mean big business for those savvy enough to register names in time, or fortunate enough to have owned them for some time. Prior to the launch of Apple's iPad in 2010, enterpreneurial web users registered sites such as ipaddownload.com , ipaddownloads.com and ipaddownloads.net in their droves in the hope of reselling them for millions of dollars.
