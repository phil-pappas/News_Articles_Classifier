The solution will replace a legacy system, with modules catering for the core business functions of finance, sales, purchasing, expenses, internal project management and R&D cost management. Taking a staged approach, Columbus will implement Dynamics AX in the UK, before rolling out the solution worldwide. \nMartin Burden, Retail Practice Sales Director at Columbus, explained that the investment is set to drive even greater benefits to JUST EAT and its customers as AX becomes a critical business application that reduces costs for JUST EAT and helps boost the customer experience. \n\"By using AX and RapidValue to standardise processes within JUST EAT, and centralise core operations across the business, the company will significantly improve operating processes. Furthermore, the ability to track information more effectively, better manage purchasing requests, and more effectively manage expenses, will all result in long term financial gains for JUST EAT, and this will subsequently help to improve its customer service levels.\" \nIt was Columbus' experience as a consultancy with industry knowledge, which proved a key driver in JUST EAT's decision to invest in Microsoft Dynamics AX over alternative options. As part of the agreement, Columbus will utilise its unique RapidValue application and methodology to help JUST EAT review its business processes and requirements in order to adopt a solution as close to standard as possible. This business process led approach to ERP, together with the functionality of the AX product and Microsoft's cloud first approach, appealed greatly to Marcus Jennings, Group Financial Director at JUST EAT. \nMarcus Jennings commented: \"We are really excited to be working together with Columbus and Microsoft to implement Dynamics AX across the business and start to utilise a solution that will enable us to grow and provide an even better customer experience. We know that we have a solution from Microsoft that is stable and is constantly being invested in and delivered, and a partner in Columbus with great experience in the retail environment, and decades of knowledge of ERP. Between us, we are confident that the project will be a huge success.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:05:24.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
