Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian \nThe Moto X Style looks like any other Motorola phone released in the last two years. The all-glass front has front-facing speakers which operate in stereo, some presence sensors for gestures and now a front-facing LED flash to go with the selfie camera.\nThe back is curved, covered in your choice of plastic, wood or leather, and the sides are aluminium. There’s a metal accent bar connecting the camera to Motorola’s characteristic dimple. The build is solid, although the unit I have has a tiny gap between the glass screen and the metal band at the top.\nAt 11.1mm thick and weighing 179g, the Moto X Style is considerably chunkier and heavier than, for example, the 6.9mm thick, 153g Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ .\nBut it feels solid, comfortable and ergonomic in the hand. The curved back also makes it one of the easiest phablets to hold, but while one-handed use is possible at a stretch, the top of the phone is out of reach.\nThe 5.7in 2K AMOLED screen is excellent and Motorola’s best yet. It is on a par with likes of the LG G4 and Samsung’s latest phablets. It appears pin-sharp with a pixel density of 520 pixels per inch, is bright and easily readable in direct sunlight and has great viewing angles. It’s not quite as vibrant as some other AMOLED screens such as that on the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ , but could be considered to be more realistic for viewing photos and video.\nSpecifications Screen: 5.7in 2K AMOLED (520ppi)\nProcessor: six-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808\nRAM: 3GB\nStorage: 32GB/64GB + microSD card slot\nOperating system: Android 5.1.1 Lollipop\nCamera: 21MP rear camera (f/2.0), 5MP front-facing camera with flash\nConnectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS\nDimensions: 153.9 x 76.2 x 11.1 mm\nWeight: 179g\nCool running but only for a day Facebook Twitter Pinterest The curved back makes the Moto X Style one of the easier phablets to keep hold of. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian \nThe Moto X Style uses Qualcomm’s six-core Snapdragon 808 processor, which is not the latest or the most powerful available, but also does not suffer from overheating issues. It’s the same one used to great effect in the LG G4 and performs equally well in this device.\nThe phone is one of the snappiest you can find on the market today, on par with any of the top Android smartphones at the moment performing similarly to the Galaxy S6.\nThe processor handled everything I threw at it without issue, including games. It didn’t get particularly warm even under heavy use. The 808 might be less powerful for some tasks, but most people won’t notice or even care. Call quality was excellent and hands-free calling particularly loud.\nThe Moto X Style lasted an average of 26 hours during my testing, which was enough to see me safely through a day and a night out, but it had to be charged every night. That was with 3 hours of browsing and listening to music via Bluetooth headphones, hundreds of push notifications and emails, 20 minutes of gaming and a couple of photos a day.\nThis is pretty average when smartphones from Sony and others can last two days or more with similar specifications, but the Moto X Style charges quickly reaching 55% in 50 minutes.\nSnappy stock Android Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Moto X Style runs Android (almost) straight from Google. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian \nMotorola ships its Android smartphones without software customisations. They are as close to Google’s Nexus devices in those terms as you can get. Motorola instead spends its time optimising the software, which is one reason why it is quite so snappy.\nThe standard Android Lollipop experience is very good and those bits that Motorola adds are actually useful, apart from the camera app (more on that below).\nMotorola’s Moto app adds a couple of features to Android. Gesture support is excellent allowing users to karate chop to light the flash as a torch or twist your wrist with the device in hand to fire up the camera app. The phone can also turn on or off Wi-Fi or other settings based on location and time of day.\nMotorola’s active display detects when the phone is approached with a hand with its presence sensors and lights the display with notification icons and the time.\nHolding a finger on the icon previews a small snippet of the message or notification. Users can then dismiss or unlock the phone to see the rest of the message. It’s a better user experience and consumes less battery than Android’s stock “ambient” display.\nMoto Voice adds to Google Now with more voice control options including a custom hotword that the user can change to fire up the voice command system without having to touch the phone. It works well in the home or office, but struggled outdoors on a busy street. I’m not sure why you’d want to use it on the street – it feels awkward talking to a smartphone when no one can see you, let alone in public.\nCamera Facebook Twitter Pinterest The camera’s great, the app not so much. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian \nThe camera is the first one fitted to a Motorola smartphone that I’ve thought was actually good. The 21-megapixel camera was excellent in good lighting, producing photos with good colour balance and detail – better than the Moto X Play .\nIt struggled in low-light conditions more than some rivals, producing some muddy photos when I expected it to be fine.\nVideo capture is also strong, with 1080p at 60 frames per second and 4K if only at 30fps.\nThe 5-megapixel selfie camera is very good, producing bright and detailed shots making it one of the best. The flash on the front will make some selfies better, but its throw was short making it a bit anaemic more than an arm’s length away.\nAs good as the camera is, the camera app is poor. Motorola’s made it tap to capture rather than tap to focus. I found it routinely failed to focus correctly, producing images that were not as sharp as I would have liked. It worked fine for selfies, but not for rear-camera shots of anything with detail in the foreground.\nA drag to focus mode is available, but I found it clumsy to use and in the end switched to the equally simple to use but much better Google Camera app.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The front-facing flash will help illuminate your mug in a pinch. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Price \nThe Motorola Moto X Style costs £360 for 32GB of storage without customisation. It is also available from Motorola’s Maker site, where accents, backs and storage can be changed starting at £400 for 32GB and £434 for 64GB.\nFor comparison the LG G4 is currently available from £320 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ currently costs £580. The 5.5in Motorola Moto X Play costs £250.\nVerdict With the Moto X Style, Motorola is trying to replicate a winning formula: offer a great smartphone experience for less than the competition.\nCosting £360 it is around £220 cheaper than its rival Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ and offers a similar experience. The only things notably lacking from the Moto X Style are a fingerprint sensor and wireless charging, which hurt its future proofing. Its battery life of just over one day could also be better.\nThe Moto X Style has an excellent screen, feels good in the hand, has a good camera, very snappy performance and runs stock Android without any bloat. In fact, the Moto X Style is essentially a Google Nexus smartphone but with a microSD card slot for adding extra storage.\nPros: great screen, good rear camera, excellent selfie camera, microSD card slot, cheaper than rivals, stereo front-facing speakers\nCons: battery could be better and is not removable, no wireless charging or fingerprint scanner\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The metal bar in the back has Motorola’s dimple logo, but it is more for aesthetics than a useful place to rest your finger.
