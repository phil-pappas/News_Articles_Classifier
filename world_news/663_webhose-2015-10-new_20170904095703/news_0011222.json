On Wednesday, a potential rival for the nomination, Vice President Joe Biden, announced he would not join the race. Clinton also is riding the momentum of a solid debate performance last week.\nContentious moments during the hearing included questions and accusations about the Obama administration's shifting early public account of the September 11 2012 attacks, which killed four Americans, including the first ambassador in more than three decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:50:27.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
