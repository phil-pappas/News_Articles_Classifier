Sensis, which works frequently with small businesses, trawled through transaction data to discover that men are much more likely to shop online than women. “I was surprised. I had to double-check the data,” John Allan, chief executive of Sensis, told The Australian’s Digital Marketing Forum. “Men are spending two and a half times that of women buying products online.”\n“The other interesting stat I think that is important when you think about digital: two-thirds of businesses are saying when they’re selling online, that those purchasers are coming from their local area, only a third are coming from interstate or overseas. So it’s not just about exploring new markets -- it’s about how to connect with new customers in your local region predominantly.”\nJohn Allan(L), CEO of Sensis with cafe owner Marcel Ruggieri. Allan says men are outpacing women in terms of online purchasing.

According to Maile Carnegie, chief executive of Google Australia, one study about a family’s trip to Disneyland revealed that there were 150 micro interactions in terms of search history, web browsing and other research that went into the purchase.\n“What all of us are doing is breaking down, whether they’re easy or very complex tasks, into a myriad of little steps that we execute in micro moments. Purchase journeys have just gotten so fractured and so fragmented. And so I think the role of a marketer these days is, really, how do you win in this new landscape and this new battleground of micro-moments?”\nGoogle Australia CEO Maile Carnegie says there up to 150 ‘micro-moments’ that lead to an online purchase.

Volume is the amount to be collected, variety refers to the different types of data and velocity is the speed of data processing.\nThere are many tools to handle and manage big data, starting with basic and free services like Google Insights and Google Analytics that help companies identify what people are looking for and how they interact with your online content. Facebook Insights gives very accurate measures of who is engaging with your Facebook page and who could become a customer advocate.\nWhen it comes to processing big volumes of internally generated data, the most frequently used tool for big data analytics is Hadoop. Hadoop can store files that are bigger than what can be stored on one particular node or server, which allows you to store as many files as you want. It is also known for its efficiency in processing data.\nVarious vendors including AltiSpace, Rackspace, Amazon, Savvis, and Xplenty offer Hadoop as a service. Other vendors, such as IBM and Terradata, offer their own distributions, while Actian, Oracle and Microsoft partner with pure-play vendors.\nOne of the key issues around Hadoop and big data tools, according to Gartner, is that many businesses don’t have the skills to manage it.\nSo how should it be handled?\nGartner analysts Nick Heudecker and Merv Adrian recommend starting small.\n“Start with small projects backed by a business stakeholder if Hadoop is necessary to address your business problems,’’ they write in a recent report. “This allows you to develop skills and establish a record of success before tackling larger projects.”\nGartner consultant Frank Buytendijk says companies have to bring in experts to handle data.\n“The assumption that your current analytic and information management staff can learn big data skills themselves may be a bit too optimistic.” Buytendijk says.\n“Big data requires a different analytical skill set in which a combination of different approaches is often applied. Build your own knowledge by working with external consultants. In the meantime, strive to hire experienced people and work with universities on fringe projects.”", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/13/1227567/268535-90d0157c-70b0-11e5-8cb9-949f91ef4ac5.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/13/1227567/268562-3d3b1fd8-70b0-11e5-8cb9-949f91ef4ac5.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:20:12.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
