Firms ranging from startups to established players were keen to showcase how their particular technology can be implemented to streamline current workflows. \nSYS , a platinum Stratasys partner, in particular demonstrated how its engineers have become adept in leveraging particular materials towards particular applications like injection moulding and sheet metal forming. \n3D printers on display at the SYS booth included the high-performance Fortus 450, the strength of which lies in reliability, speed and precision. The Fortus 450 is able to produce jigs, fixtures, factory tooling and end-use parts, as well as functional prototypes. With four layer thicknesses to choose from, users can strike the right balance between strength, detail and rapid build time. \n3D Printing With ULTEM 1010 \nAvailable on the Fortus 3D Production Systems, ULTEM 1010 resin offers the highest heat resistance, chemical resistance and tensile strength of any FDM thermoplastic. It is the only FDM material with an NSF 51 food-contact certification, and itâ€™s biocompatible with an ISO 10993/USP Class VI certification \nThe material allows you to produce large custom tools for metal, plastic or composite parts fabrication; 3D print medical tools like surgical guides that can withstand steam autoclaving; build temperature-resistant dies, patterns and fixtures for food production; even manufacture out-of-cabin aerospace components and under-the-hood automotive components including housings, ducts and semi-structural components.
