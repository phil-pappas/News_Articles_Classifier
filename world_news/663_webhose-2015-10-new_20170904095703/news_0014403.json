(2330.TW) said Thursday its third-quarter net profit fell 1.3% from a year earlier, as smartphone makers stocked fewer chips in response to falling demand for such devices from China.\nThe world's largest contract chip maker said its net profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to 75.33 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$2.33 billion) from NT$ 76.33 billion a year earlier.\nRevenue rose 1.7% to NT$212.50 billion from NT$209.05 billion. The slowing earnings growth was a contrast to its record high earnings last year when TSMC, as the company is widely known, began shipping the computing brains used in Apple Inc.'s smartphones and tablets.\nWrite to Lorraine Luk at lorraine.luk@wsj.com\n 15, 2015 02:17 ET (06:17 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:49:17.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
