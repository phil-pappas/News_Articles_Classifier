On this week's #talkingtechLIVE podcast, we thought it would be fun to dream about how we’ll be living with tech three decades from now.\nOur guests:\n--Greg Cohn is co-founder of Burner , the app that looks to bring 7-digit phone numbers into the next century--and 30 years into the future!\n--Josh Viner is a co-founder of Wag! , an L.A. based dog walking app.\n--Allison Mac is an analyst with the Gas Buddy app. On the show, she offers her predictions for the price of gas in 2045.\n--Jarek Khan is an actor, musician and personal trainer with a big interest in tech.\n--Offer Yehudai is co-founder of mobile ad exchange Inner-active .\n--Austin Furey is the host of the Flitetest podcast for drone enthusiasts.\nHere’s some of our 2045 conclusions.\n-- Cars: We probably won’t be owning vehicles--instead rides will be on-demand, electric and driverless. It will take us longer to get where we want--since computerized cars will stop at all signs, won’t speed and obey all laws. And we’ll be working even harder--during our commute as well.\n-- Life expectancy --Viner predicted a medical breakthrough that will take us from a current 82 years to 130. Which of course might lead to even more overcrowded cities and all sorts of issues we’ve never had to tackle.\nJarek Khan, a Los Angeles actor, musician and fitness pro, on the #talkingtechLIVE show. (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n-- Waiting for packages to arrive will be history . Everything will be instant--either arriving via quick drones or hyperloop technology.\n-- Will the smartphone continue to exist? The panel was mixed on that--they’ll probably exist in some form, for the screen, but not as we know it now.\n--My favorite prediction comes from Mac. \"Men will wear purses,\" she said, adding that they'll need them for all the gadgetry they'll be carrying around.\nSo guys--let's get busy and go shopping!\nBurner co-founder Greg Cohn (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\nReaders--what’s your take on tech in 2045? Let’s chat about it on Twitter, where I’m @jeffersongraham.\n8 CONNECT 35 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1S1r77r TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S1r77r&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812211371595528-tune-in-sandy2-40.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812211371595528-tune-in-sandy2-40.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4575695104001_video-still-for-video-4575614261001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4575695104001_video-still-for-video-4575614261001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/81034ded919571c569b0c0551c674f54b4ddfc01/c=218-0-3623-2560&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812211371595528-tune-in-sandy2-40.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2cb1e0371287ef3cbc6d864f31761367951a0d9/c=218-0-3623-2560&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812215721527412-tune-in-jarek-12.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2cb1e0371287ef3cbc6d864f31761367951a0d9/c=218-0-3623-2560&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812211883590810-tune-in-sandy2-49-Edit.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4575695104001_video-still-for-video-4575614261001.jpg", "http://twitter.com/jeffersongraham", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S1r77r&text=Podcast%20-%20predictions%20for%20Back%20to%20Future%202045&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4575695103001_thumbnail-for-video-4575614261001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1S1m4UM", "http://usat.ly/1S1r77r"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:50:05.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
