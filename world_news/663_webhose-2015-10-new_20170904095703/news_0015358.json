Fans will have to go to ESPN's own websites for its videos. The $10-per-month Red service combines ad-free viewing with unlimited on-demand music. YouTube, which is owned by Google, says that creators have to participate in Red to have their videos show on YouTube in the U.S. Spokeswomen for both ESPN, which is owned by Disney, and YouTube declined to say what legal issues might impede its participation. Media analyst Laura Martin of Needham & Co. says it is likely that ESPN's pre-existing contracts with cable and satellite companies like Comcast prevent it from participating in YouTube's subscription plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:22:41.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
