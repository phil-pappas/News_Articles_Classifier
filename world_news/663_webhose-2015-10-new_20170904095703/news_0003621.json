This is family housing for Google,\" Lewiston said.\nFor all the development both current and planned in the Boulder Junction area, Lewiston told the Planning Board, there are much more \"hallway building\" residential options than there is the kind of spacious luxury he envisions in his 2,700-square-foot, fenced-in-backyard units.\n\"There' s nothing like this being built. We think there's a niche in Boulder Junction,\" he said. \"There are going to be plenty of (Google) executives. We think this will be a nice option.\"\nSome Planning Board members were sold on the need for the the kind of housing Lewiston pitched, but the real sticking point Thursday night was whether the proposal is consistent with Boulder's Transit Village Area Plan.\nAdvertisement That plan was devised to control the immediate future of the 160-acre plot in the city's geographical heart, formerly known as Transit Village, and now called Boulder Junction.\n'Looking for a business main street here'\nCity planners envision Boulder Junction as a \"redevelopment area that is being transformed into a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood with regional transit connections and public spaces that will benefit the entire community.\"\nThe plan for Boulder Junction has always been to provide pedestrian interest with active, ground-floor commercial uses. Lewiston's proposal is 100 percent residential, though, which prompted some disagreement among the Planning Board.\n\"That guideline is in (the area plan) for a reason,\" board member John Gerstle said. \"This is supposed to be as interesting a place to walk along as possible. I think that this project would be enhanced by having that mixed-use function.\"\n\"We're looking for a business main street here,\" board chairman and current City Council candidate Aaron Brockett said. \"I think it needs to comply with the eventual vision for the corridor, and that's for 30th street to become a walkable, main-street neighborhood.\"\nLewiston's greatest supporter on the board was Liz Payton, who felt the proposal is consistent with the area plan.\n\"It isn't a mixed-use project,\" Payton said, \"but I think that the arguments that the applicant is making about there already being so much commercial development ... those are pretty compelling.\"\nSuch a mixed review didn't sit well with Lewiston, who said he and his partners \"put what remaining money we had in this project.\"\n\"We need to get it started,\" he said. \"I can't afford to hold on for two years.\"\nProject facing 'difficult' next step\nThe lack of clear direction from the Planning Board left him unsure of whether attempt to get his project rezoned and then consider commercial uses, or stick with the plan and hope that the more positive bits of feedback on Thursday ultimately win out.\nBrockett acknowledged that the board may not have given Lewiston something concrete enough to actually be helpful.\n\"I realize this is a difficult next step, but you've got to navigate the waters and figure out which direction you want to go in,\" Brockett said.\nLewiston responded from his chair, not the podium that applicants traditionally speak from.\n\"I wish I knew what to say. I really don't,\" he said. \"I'm trying to do the best I can. I don't want to fight.\n\"You're sending me home with — \"\nThe visibly exasperated Lewiston declined to finish that sentence.\nPrior to the meeting, he expressed general annoyance with attitudes he perceives from both Boulder residents and officials alike, particularly around the ongoing debate about growth and development, and what they portend for the future of the city's identity.\nHe'd do away with the city's 55-foot building height limit, for example.\n\"I would have 100 feet. We should start to have density where density is appropriate,\" he said.\n\"You can't be afraid. It's amazing. These people weren't afraid of integration, and they weren't afraid of gay marriage. I don't know why they're afraid of changing zoning. It's really a reactionary policy, and it's the wrong one.\"\nAlex Burness: 303-473-1389, burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/alex_burness"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:10:55.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
