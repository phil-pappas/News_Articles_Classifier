Credit: Ulf Sirborn. \nResearchers at Karolinska Institutet and universities in Hong Kong have found a new molecular mechanism for DNA repair involving an unexpected interaction between the PARP-1 protein and sleep proteins in humans. Their discovery is presented in the scientific journal Molecular Cell . \nWhile it is a well-known fact that sleep is important to the body's recovery and healing, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that make this possible is incomplete. In the present study, the researchers show that a protein known as PARP-1 bonds and interacts in humans with another protein called Timeless and that together they control the repair of DNA in the cell nucleus. \n\"Timeless is involved in the regulation of the body's circadian rhythm,\" says principal investigator Thomas Helleday, PhD, Professor of chemical biology at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, and also affiliated to the SciLifeLab facility in Stockholm. \"We already knew that PARP-1 and Timeless each plays its own part in cell survival, but not that they interact in this interesting manner.\" \nProfessor Helleday and his team have long specialised in PARP proteins and their role in DNA repair, knowledge that is important to cancer prevention. Their work with PARP inhibitors has produced a new therapeutic principle for breast and ovarian cancer . \nWithout damaging normal cells \n\"This therapeutic principle has now been approved as a drug in the USA and Europe for advanced ovarian cancer, which is wonderful,\" continues Professor Helleday, who is also affiliated with Stockholm's SciLifeLab. \"The new treatment kills only the mutated cells without damaging normal cells .\" \nHowever, it is not yet clear just what contribution this newly discovered link between PARP and the circadian rhythm can make to cancer treatment. \n\"Maybe our results can help to explain the side-effects that some patients can show,\" he says. \"However, we keep a very open mind in our lab and I'm constantly surprised by all the functions and roles that PARP proteins have in the cell.\" Breakthrough could make 'smart drugs' effective for many cancer patients June 27, 2011 \n(Medical Xpress) -- Newcastle and Harvard University reseachers have found that blocking a key component of the DNA repair process could extend the use of a new range of 'smart' cancer drugs called PARP inhibitors. New mechanism of action for PARP inhibitors discovered November 9, 2012 \nNew understanding of how drugs called PARP inhibitors, which have already shown promise for the treatment of women with familial breast and ovarian cancers linked to BRCA mutations, exert their anticancer effects has led ... Renewed hope in a once-abandoned cancer drug class June 19, 2013 \nCould drugs that block the body's system for repairing damage to the genetic material DNA become a boon to health? As unlikely as it may seem, those compounds are sparking optimism as potential treatments for ovarian and ... New protein knowledge offers hope for better cancer treatment September 19, 2013 \nWhen the pharmaceutical industry develops new medicines – for example for cancer treatment – it is important to have detailed knowledge of the body's molecular response to the medicine. World-first cancer drugs could work in larger group of patients March 19, 2015 \nA pioneering class of drugs that target cancers with mutations in the BRCA breast cancer genes could also work against tumours with another type of genetic fault, a new study suggests. Study finds gene mutations sensitize tumors to specific cancer drugs June 11, 2015 \nMutations in ARID1a, which are common in many cancer types, disrupt DNA damage repair in cancer cells, allowing the cancer to progress. This gene may also be an Achilles' heel when treating certain tumors, according to a ...
