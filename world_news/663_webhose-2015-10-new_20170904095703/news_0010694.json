We have our own leadership team and office,\" the statement said. \nAccording to co-founder Andrew Morse, Great Big Story is looking to break new ground. \n\"It's not a website. And it's not an app, video series or cable channel,\" Morse said in a note. \n\"Great Big Story is something else: an independent network, custom-built for the mobile and social platforms that are changing the way we watch video.
