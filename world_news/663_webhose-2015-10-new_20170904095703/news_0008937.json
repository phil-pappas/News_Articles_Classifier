If a product from a third-party merchant has a five-star review, a consumer can feel comfortable that said product will arrive as expected.\nThe flipside of the equation, though, is that a false review can easily skew a consumer's perspective. And this risk is something that Amazon ( AMZN - Get Report ) is fighting heavily against in a new lawsuit against 1,114 people Amazon claims has been posting false reviews on its site.\nAmazon Review Complaint\nMust Read: Who 'Wore' It Better -- Etsy or Amazon Handmade?\n Amazon filed the lawsuit on Friday, claiming those individuals have been selling their fake review service on Fiverr , a platform that lets consumers order small services and tasks for $5. For a small fee, anyone could hire the reviewers to post a five-star rating and prewritten review, such as \"This has lit up my life\" on a USB cable.\n\"The vast majority of reviews on Amazon are authentic, helping millions of customers make informed buying decisions,\" an Amazon spokesperson said via email. \"And our goal is to make reviews as useful as possible for customers.\"\nThe suit follows a similar one Amazon filed in April against websites that sold fake reviews. On top of legal action, Amazon is also trying to improve its algorithms to surface more accurate reviews for consumers.\n\"Given Amazon's market share, it is likely the biggest target for this kind of scam,\" ITG analyst Steven Weinstein said \"However, I think they do a lot to protect the integrity of the review and I believe customers who are aware of the issue will be encouraged by the company's aggressive response.\"\nWeinstein isn't worried about the scam having a material impact on Amazon's overall business.\nIf anything, the lawsuits show how seriously Amazon takes its reviews and should be encouraging for its shoppers.\nAmazon certainly isn't the only e-commerce company dealing with these sorts of problems. Alibaba ( BABA - Get Report ) has long battled a practice called \"brushing\" where sellers boost their reviews. And all online marketplaces suffer from counterfeit activity to varying degrees. The important thing is that the companies prove to consumers that they are able to keep these illegal practices to a minimum and that consumers can trust that they will not be disappointed when they make a purchase.", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13328972/1/amazon-gets-serious-about-its-reviews-with-a-new-lawsuit.html", "http://www.scribd.com/doc/285431272", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13328972/1/amazon-gets-serious-about-its-reviews-with-a-new-lawsuit.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13328972/1/amazon-gets-serious-about-its-reviews-with-a-new-lawsuit.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13328972/1/amazon-gets-serious-about-its-reviews-with-a-new-lawsuit.html&text=.@Amazon", "http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/22/amazon-ai-fake-reviews-star-ratings-astroturfing", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/285431272/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13328972/1/amazon-gets-serious-about-its-reviews-with-a-new-lawsuit.html&title=Amazon", "http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/18/amazon-sues-1000-fake-reviewers", "http://media.publishersmarketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Amazonfakereviewscomplaint.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:54:56.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
