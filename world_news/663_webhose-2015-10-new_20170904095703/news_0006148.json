A few are choosing to bypass paying for a cable subscription entirely, opting instead for a growing number of choices of online TV alternatives.\nThe job cuts are a \"necessary part of our continued strategic evolution to ensure ESPN remains the leader in sports as well as the premier sports destination on any platform,\" said ESPN CEO John Skipper in a memo to employees that was posted online.\nDisney in August trimmed its TV profit outlook because of a loss of ESPN subscribers. ESPN gets money from cable and satellite companies that carry its channels, and it's the most expensive of the basic pay TV channels. Data provider SNL Kagan has estimated that ESPN costs cable and satellite TV companies $6.61 per monthly subscriber.\nSo ESPN comes under pressure as people skip the cable bundle or choose cheaper TV packages with fewer channels.\nThe company has said that it doesn't expect big declines in traditional TV subscribers over the next few years. But CEO Bob Iger said in August that if the business declines, Disney would consider selling ESPN straight to viewers.\nThere are already big media brands doing that, like HBO, CBS and Showtime.\nFor affected ESPN employees: Skipper said they would get a minimum of 60 days' notice, severance packages and job search assistance.\nShares of Burbank, California-based The Walt Disney Co. rose $1.69 to $111.53 in midday trading Wednesday.\n___\nOnline:\nESPN's memo: http://espnmediazone.com/us/174517-2/\n___\nFollow Tali Arbel at https://twitter.com/tarbel\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
