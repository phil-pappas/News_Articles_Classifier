In doing so, it eliminates the need to locate the remote control. As a result, it saves time and it offers added convenience. The invention features an accessible design that is easy to use so it is ideal for households and businesses. Additionally, the HANDS FREE TV is producible in design variations.\nThe inventor described the invention design. “My design provides a faster and easier way to watch television.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
