The commission is expected to announce its decision on Oct. 21 following a meeting of the EU's top officials, the people said.\nThe commission declined to comment.\nMargrethe Vestager, the EU's antitrust chief, has postponed a trip to China this week to deal with \"important matters requiring her presence and full attention in Brussels,\" the commission said in an emailed statement on Thursday.\nIt isn't yet clear whether Fiat and Starbucks will be asked to pay back taxes that the EU deems they should have paid in the past. If so, the demands could be substantial, EU officials have said.\nNor is it clear when the EU will conclude two other investigations involving Apple Inc.'s tax affairs in Ireland and Amazon.com Inc.'s in Luxembourg.\nAll of the companies have denied receiving special treatment, and the governments have denied giving it.\nThe four probes were announced last year amid a push by European governments to bolster national coffers that have been hit hard by the region's financial crisis, and to assure citizens that the biggest corporations are paying their fair share of tax.\nThe EU has made a priority of the probes, and Ms Vestager had pledged to reach a decision on all four by June. That deadline was missed, however, and Ms. Vestager hasn't given a new deadline.\nThe tax investigations are politically sensitive in Brussels because European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was Luxembourg's prime minister when the tax deals were in force.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:51:19.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
