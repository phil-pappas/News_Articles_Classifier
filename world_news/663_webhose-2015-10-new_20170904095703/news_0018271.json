The American chemical company denied her allegation, saying that exposure to the chemical was not sufficient to cause health issues, and some other factors are responsible for Bartlett's cancer. \nApart from Ms Bartlett, around 3,500 people filed lawsuits against DuPont for dumping C8 into the Ohio River, who reported to have suffered diseases related to the chemical. \"She understands that she did good for the communities all up and down the Ohio River.\" \nThe jury found no malice on the part of DuPont, which saved the company from paying a much larger amount as punitive damages to Bartlett. \nThe company use C8 to make Teflon at the company's plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia. \nBartlett's attorney Michael Papantonio as quoted by Associated Press saying: \"She (Bartlett) understands that she did good for the communities all up and down the Ohio River.\" \nBartlett stated that DuPont was aware that C8 was toxic, and has known since 1961. \nHigh levels of the chemical were found in the water the company discharged into the river from its Washington works plant in 1984. \nIn 2005, DuPont paid $16.5m settlement to settle a federal complaint which alledged that it had hidden health information about C8. \nWhen Bartlett was diagnosed with cancer, she was living in Coolville in southeastern Athens County, around 10 miles downriver from the plant.
