Faris is an associate professor of sociology at the University of California at Davis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs. (CNN) Most adolescents with access to smart phones are living their social lives online as much as they do face-to-face. Adults worry that teens are hooked on social media, but most have no idea what teens are actually doing online. Marion K. Underwood Robert W. Faris Over the past year, we collaborated with \"Anderson Cooper 360\" on an exploration of the hidden digital world of adolescents. We invited over 200 13-year olds from schools around the country to participate in a research project to discover what 13-year-olds are actually posting online. Adolescents and their parents completed surveys about the child's involvement with social media and psychological adjustment. Most importantly, teens agreed to download an app to their social media accounts that archived the content of everything they posted on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook from September, 2014, to April, 2015 (all posts and pictures, but not direct messaging). In this study, we examined the content of what teens actually say and do on social media, not simply what they say they do — and what it means to them. Not only are 13-year-olds using social media to post, tweet, share, friend, block, and unfriend, adolescents are spending vast amounts of time just \"lurking,\" reading the never-ending stream of their peers' activities without posting anything themselves. More than one third of them said they check social media without posting 25 times or more per day on weekends, and our heaviest users said they use social media over 100 times daily, including during classes at school. What do lurkers see? When adolescents lurk online, what do they see? If they are scrolling through Instagram, they likely see highly groomed, curated, filtered pictures strategically posted at a time of day when peers will be online so as to attract the maximum number of likes and comments. One student in our study told us she takes over 100 selfies (pictures of herself) to get one she likes well enough to post. On all social media feeds, young people are highly likely to see pictures of friends gathering without them, or larger groups having a wonderful time at parties to which they were not invited. Social media thus opens a window onto the (seemingly) more glamorous social lives of schoolmates, leaving many feeling less attractive and left out. As they access social media throughout the day, teens will see how many peers liked, commented, favorited and retweeted their posts, and will take careful note of how they compare to the likes and favorites their peers receive. When they lurk online, teens are studying where they stand in the social network, who is in and who is out, and the numbers that serve as a barometer for social status.
