These non-natives support more generalized and redundant herbivore communities than the native plants that they're potentially replacing on landscapes,\" said Burghardt, who added that this is especially true for young herbivores that use the plants for food. \nTallamy said that finding young herbivores on a plant is a good indication of how that plant is supporting the local ecosystem, as opposed to finding adults, which could be on a plant for a number of reasons, such as resting or looking for a mate. \n\"The relationship between the adult and food is far weaker than the relationship between immatures and food, so when you find adults on the non-natives, it doesn't mean that much. When you find immatures, that's what you should be measuring,\" Tallamy said. \"Those are the plants that are creating those immatures and so we do get significant differences between the immatures that are using native plants versus the immatures using non-natives.\" \nWhen it comes to non-native plants that are congeners - non-native plants with a close native relative, such as Norway maple and red maple - the researchers found that those seem to support herbivore populations across sites more similar to those on natives than the non-native plants that have no native relatives at all. \nTallamy said that few unique species were found on these non-native congeners, as most species found were also living on their native relative. \nHe also stressed that that native plants always do the best job per tree of supporting herbivore communities when compared to their non-native counterparts. This study expands the understanding of that fact by looking at whether that lower per tree diversity is magnified further by non-natives hosting more similar communities across trees species and locations. \nBurghardt said the goal of the research was to understand how the composition of the plants that homeowners plant in their yards affects herbivore communities. \n\"If you think about it, you're driving around the suburban environment, and every time a new development goes in, you have a lot of decision making happening as to what plant species are going to be planted around those properties,\" Burghardt said. \n\"If we do all that landscaping with non-native plants, are we limiting the wildlife and conservation support system that could be available within that given plot of land? What the gardens we constructed for the study are trying to replicate are landscaping decisions that people might make if they wanted to support native insect communities that in turn support much of the diversity around us.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:22:54.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
