Others, like coders and other power users, need their keyboards to be as powerful and functional as possible â€” and the \"Ultimate Hacking Keyboard\" hopes to meet that need. If it meets its crowdfunding target, that is.\nRelated: Microsoft's New Keyboard Works on Any Device, Anywhere\nIt might not look like much on the outside, but there's a lot under the hood. Mechanical key switches give a tactile feel to presses. It's \"tenkeyless\" and \"fkeyless,\" meaning it doesn't have the number pad or F-keys, making it more compact. It has a special custom layout that lets you control your media and your mouse without leaving the home row. Gamers and coders can set up macros and application-specific key mappings. And, of course, the whole thing splits in half for better ergonomics.\nadvertisement You can pre-order a \"UHK,\" as its creators call it, for $200 if you order now, but like all crowdfunding projects you'll be taking a bit of a risk in buying into something that hasn't been publicly reviewed. The product is slated to ship next summer.", "external_links": ["http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_42/1263891/imgl8954-1080p-png-project-body_jpg_project-body_ffab27a23d3bc2b77237ef56d400f0f3.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/142388086?color=ffffff&portrait=0", "https://www.crowdsupply.com/ugl/ultimate-hacking-keyboard", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_42/1263891/imgl8954-1080p-png-project-body_jpg_project-body_ffab27a23d3bc2b77237ef56d400f0f3.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_42/1263891/imgl8954-1080p-png-project-body_jpg_project-body_ffab27a23d3bc2b77237ef56d400f0f3.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:14:15.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
