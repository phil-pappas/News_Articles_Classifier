So finding that they have mass helps in that regard.\nAsked what other questions about neutrinos remain to be answered, McDonald said that scientists would like to know what the actual mass of the neutrino is. And experiments are looking at whether there are other types of neutrinos beyond the three clearly observed.\n11:55 a.m.\nTakaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald have won the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics.\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited the researchers \"for the discovery of neutrino oscillations, which shows that neutrinos have mass.\"\nNeutrinos are particles that whizz through the universe at nearly the speed of light.\n___\n9:55 a.m.\nThe winner or winners of this year's Nobel Prize in physics are set to be announced at 0945 GMT by a committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nSince the Nobel Prizes were first handed out in 1901, 198 laureates have received the physics award. Only two were women.\nAmerican scientist John Bardeen is the only person to have won the physics award twice, in 1956 and 1972.\nOn Monday the 2015 Nobel Prize in medicine went to scientists from Japan, the U.S. and China who discovered drugs that are now used to fight malaria and other tropical diseases.\nThe prize announcements continue with chemistry on Wednesday, literature on Thursday, the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday and the economics award next Monday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:53:34.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
