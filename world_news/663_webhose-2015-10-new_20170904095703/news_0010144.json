A stereoscopic view of Pluto \nBecause we can’t get enough of Pluto, NASA has now released photos of the dwarf planet in stereo 3D! So strap on your red and blue glasses and get ready to view the dwarf planet like never before. While it may seem like a fun gimmick to look at the non-planet, the purpose of these photos will be to better decode Pluto’s geological past. Eventually most of Pluto’s hemisphere will be laid out like this, in order to get a detailed look at the topography of the heavenly body’s surface. This particular image shows a region 180 miles across , dotted with low hills and enveloped with deep craters cut into the crust. Hacker tape \nDuct tape gets all the glory for having bright colors and fancy graphics like mac and cheese and the British flag, but what about the rest of the single sided adhesive world? Well, masking tape no longer has to sit in the corner with its boring beige complexion, mocked by even the clear wonders of Scotch and packing tape. Japanese graphic designer Aya Kodama at Cosmotech came up with this Hackers-chic circuit board print that make you the coolest tech head in the office next time you have to seal a label shut. But really, it’s a rad design and hopefully one that will make its way State side sometime soon. Watch a black hole shred a star \nIt doesn’t get much more metal than NASA. An artist with the space agency made this animation that shows what it looks like when a supermassive black hole tears into a nearby star. The rendering is based on a recent discovery which they a called tidal disruption, this particular one they named ASASSN-14li. It’s “when stellar debris is flung outward at high speed while the rest falls toward the black hole.” In November 2014, NASA detected this odd occurrence some 290 million light-years away around a giant black hole. The phenomenon was observed between several different missions with the help of the Swift Gamma-ray Burst Explorer, NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA/NASA’s XMM-Newton. \nOnce the star’s bits start to fall back in toward the black hole, the gasses begin to merge together in a hot, smooth disk. That disk shines bright with X-Rays, which not only heats up the area around it, but can put out flares for several years. NASA hopes to find more events like the ASASSN-14li to further see how black holes affect the areas around them. Infectious bacteria art \nScientists are creative people. Seriously. One of my best friends is an immuno-biologist, and one of the most talented artists I know. Still, I’ve never seen her recreate Van Gogh’s out of bacteria. Melanie Sullivan, the artist and microbiologist behind this piece of infectious art, was part of the first ever Agar Art contest at the American Society of Microbiology. Other contestants entered art of flowers, decahedron dice, even a mnion. Sadly, Melanie’s recreation of Starry Night lost out to a yellow and orange “painting” or a nerve cell. \nAnd here I just make costumes in my spare time. What’s the weirdest thing you’ve made out into art? On second thought, maybe we don’t want to know. Anyways, that’s it for this week’s Bits You Missed. We’ll see you on the flip side.
