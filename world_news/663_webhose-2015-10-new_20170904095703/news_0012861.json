The PAINWeek conference took place on September 8 - 12, 2015 at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas. In addition to the presentation of two genetic and drug response studies 1) Genetics and Drug Response: Study on the Influence of Genetics in Individual Variations in Response to Hydrocodone and 2) Genetics and Drug Response: Study on the Influence of Genetics in Individual Variations in Response to Oxycodone, Proove Biosciences exhibited their product and services at the four day event. The PAINWeek event is considered one of the nation’s leading pain management conferences, with over 2100 physicians and medical professionals attending the event. The conference serves as a forum for groundbreaking and state of the art research and data in the Pain Management and Personalized Medicine Industry. Over the past decade, prescriptions for opioid medications to manage chronic non-cancer pain have increased significantly. During that time, opioid abuse and prescription opioid overdose deaths have simultaneously increased. While opioids remain an effective tools for managing pain and effective pain relief, physicians cannot predict how a patient will respond to medications such as Oxycodone and Hydrocodone. By analyzing the genetic information of 600+ people from across the nation, Proove Biosciences’ researchers were able to determine which genes are responsible for making an individual a poor responder versus a good responder to prescription opioid medications. “Due to the huge number physicians who choose not to treat chronic pain I think this conference is an exceptional platform for post training education on the possible management techniques and resources available to physicians,” said Dr. May Hafez , Clinical Science Liaison at Proove Biosciences. “It’s no surprise that Proove Biosciences participates in the conference yearly. Proove Biosciences is ahead and leading in personalizing pain management, which makes discussing test value to prescribing physicians gratifying and simple. PAINWeek has the perfect audience for all cutting edge pain management tools that Proove testing provides.” About Proove Biosciences Our Mission is to Change the Future of Medicine. Proove is the proof to improve healthcare decisions. We seek to realize a future when clinicians look back and wonder how they could’ve ever prescribed medications without knowing how a patient would respond. With offices in Southern California and the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area, the Company is the research leader investigating and publishing data on the genetics of personalized pain medicine with clinical research sites across the United States. Physicians use Proove Biosciences testing to improve outcomes – both safety and efficacy of medical treatment. From a simple cheek swab collected in the office, Proove performs proprietary genetic tests in its CLIA-certified laboratory to identify patients at risk for misuse of prescription pain medications and evaluate their metabolism of medications.
