Undeniably, the biggest challenge the ANC is currently facing is the corruption cancer that is ravaging the very same ideals and principles in which it was founded upon to liberate, develop and alleviate poverty in South Africa.\nIt is therefore, the betrayal of the greatest and honourable cause to see the primary suspects that are destroying this once glorified movement are from within the ANC. Some ordinary members and leaders of the ANC are guilty of this demise. Whether this is a perception or reality the voters will test this theory and decide for themselves next year at the polls for municipal elections.\nHowever, in order to deal with this scourge the ANC should not only apply punitive and corrective measures as suggested by the law against the perpetrators, but also it needs to model a basic but modern culture that gives re - birth to the essence of African value system that prioritizes the wellbeing of the other more than your very own. That is a core of humanity that transcends humility with an emphasis on a caring, selfless, ethical and responsible behaviour at all times by those that serve the public.\nWhile ambition and accumulation of wealth is not necessarily a bad thing for people representing the electorate in other societies, the blurred lines on how wealth is accumulated in South Africa should be eliminated, somehow. If an ANC elected representative have stolen from the state coffers they must pay the heavy price and face the vicious arm of the law. It should no longer be only rhetoric on television and to get media attention to convince the public the state is dealing with corruption.\nWithin the context of South Africa, ill-gotten ways of accumulation of wealth by public representatives using state resources should not even become a thought or option because that almost amounts to the betrayal of our hard earned democracy. The stakes are very high to even conceive such a thought while millions of South African people are lingering in squalor and poverty.\nHowever, to turn the tides, the ANC must do a reflection of the soul, and be willing to put itself in a vulnerable position, naked to public scrutiny and discard all defensive mechanisms from branch level to Luthuli House. It should scratch deeper than the surface, and be mindful to reinvent itself as a credible modern party it takes more than the passionate voices of committed 4000 ANC members that gathered for a few days at an NGC.\nIn fact, the whole nation should be given a platform a draw and claim a new identity that will take South Africa to greater heights that is morally indispensable and ethically sound. To make effective change within, the ANC should stop having double standards by protecting some of its leaders who are susceptible to corrupt tendencies and who are morally bankrupt and whose integrity is compromised. It should not matter what position an ANC leader holds, if there's evidence of putting the party into disrepute, action must be taken immediately without fear or favour.\nThrough such remedial actions, hopefully, the public will slowly regain its faith and build this once dignified and respected movement.\nUnlike other parties, the ANC was founded on the principles that sought to fight for justice for the marginalized and oppressed masses of the land and through rank and file it has been led by leaders who put their lives on the frontline. Those brave men and women who led the ANC were remarkable and exemplary in every aspect. To them it was never about the accumulation of wealth using unconventional methods, but it was about to serve the nation expecting nothing in return.\nNot once did they ever deviate from the beliefs and value system that brought us to this far to this very long road to economic freedom.\nArnold Mdepa\nÂ· Arnold Mdepa is a staff member at the University of the Western Cape.
