According to CB Insights, there are 104 unicorns worldwide with a combined valuation of $503 billion. \nCB Insight and KPMG noted in the third quarter of this year investment money was being channeled into more mature companies and there have been fewer IPOs to recoup capital than in the past. \nWall Street debuts of private firms from all sectors stalled in recent months but the slow down was particularly noticeable when it came to technology startups which had been a cornerstone of the market for IPOs. \nThere was only one tech company IPO in the third quarter, which was the lowest number in more than six years, Renaissance Capital said in a recent report. \nThe absence of tech company market debuts came \"in the face of mediocre tech IPO performance and ample private funding capacity at generous valuations,\" according to Renaissance. \nFirst Data payment processing technologies firm on Thursday ended its first trading day below its IPO price. \nPure Storage hit Wall Street recently only to see its shares stumble. The flash storage specialty firm rebounded since closing its opening session last week below the $3 billion valuation it got from private investors. \nGoDaddy and Fitbit are worth more than when they made their stock market debuts earlier this year, but Box and Etsy have lost 10 percent and 30 percent respectively. \n\"The problem with the IPOs that have happened with technology in the last two or three years is that the public market acted as a way to bail out private investors,\" said analyst Chowdhry. \nPeople trusted their valuations, only to realize that \"they had lost money on Zynga, Groupon, Twitter, Box,\" he continued. \n\"People were foolish before. People are getting a little bit sensible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:37:57.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
