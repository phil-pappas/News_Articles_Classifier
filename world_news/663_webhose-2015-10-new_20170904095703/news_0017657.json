The result? More accurate emergency alerts. \nAnd it all relies on you, the public. If you tweet \"earthquake\" -- even if it's in seven other languages -- you're helping American scientists get better at tracking these destructive phenomena. Quick Clicks Microsoft unveils its first ever laptop \nIt's called Tweet Emergency Dispatch. Twitter described the program in a blog post on Wednesday, and U.S. government scientists confirmed it to CNNMoney. \nHere's how it works. USGS pays Twitter to tap into its data. A program automatically sorts through the tweets coming from Twitter's 316 million active users. When, all of a sudden, lots of people in a specific area start sending out messages about earthquakes, government researchers get an alert. \n\"It's not a revolutionary change in what we do, but it just gives us that extra minute to start on our response,\" said Paul Earle, a seismologist at the federal agency. \nThat extra bit of Twitter data does a few different things. Sometimes, it alerts scientists to an earthquake that faulty sensors didn't pick up. Other times, it catches earthquakes in places where there weren't any sensors at all. \nAfter all, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado has 2,000 devices listening to tiny movements in the Earth's crust, but only about half of those are outside the United States. \nFor example, last year, seismic sensors in California picked up a magnitude 5 earthquake -- a slight rumble. USGS automatically placed the alert on its website. But when Earle looked through his Twitter alert system and didn't see any unusual chatter, he realized something was wrong. It turns out that earthquake never really happened. \n\"That's the key,\" Earle said. \"The data stream from Twitter is totally independent. It's a secondary check.\" \nDozens of earthquakes in the last few years have helped scientists fine-tune the system. They've gotten better at ignoring irrelevant tweets -- like news stories and everyday conversations about earthquakes. As can be expected, the most relevant tweets are curt and to-the-point. \nDuring violent shaking, people don't have time to write long tweets. \nUSGS has also learned to look for certain words. Spanish speakers use the word \"terremoto\" for major quakes but \"temblor\" for smaller ones. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
