The combination also enables Western Digital to vertically integrate into NAND, securing long-term access to solid state technology at lower cost. \nWestern Digital has had a successful track record of acquisitions over the last several years helping to fuel innovation, create value and strongly position the company to capture higher-growth opportunities. \nIn addition, Western Digital's operational excellence, coupled with the recently announced decision by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) allowing Western Digital to integrate substantial portions of its WD and HGST businesses, is expected to generate additional cost synergies. \n\"This transformational acquisition aligns with our long-term strategy to be an innovative leader in the storage industry by providing compelling, high-quality products with leading technology,\" said Steve Milligan, chief executive officer, Western Digital. \n\"The combined company will be ideally positioned to capture the growth opportunities created by the rapidly evolving storage industry.\" \nThe transaction, expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2016, will be financed by a mix of cash, new debt financing and Western Digital stock. In this connection, Western Digital expects to enter into new debt facilities totaling $18.4 billion, including a $1 billion revolving credit facility. \n\"Western Digital is globally recognized as a leading provider of storage solutions and has a 45-year legacy of developing and manufacturing cutting-edge solutions, making the company the ideal strategic partner for SanDisk,\" said Sanjay Mehrotra, president and chief executive officer, SanDisk. \nBoth companies have strong research and development, and engineering capabilities and a rich base of fundamental technologies with over 15,000 combined patents issued or pending worldwide. They also have complementary product lines, including hard disk drives, solid-state drives, cloud datacenter storage solutions and flash storage solutions. \nToshiba has been a long-term strategic partner to SanDisk for 15 years. The joint venture with Toshiba will be ongoing, enabling vertical integration through a technology partnership driven by deep collaboration across design and process capabilities. \nSteve Milligan will continue to serve as chief executive officer of the combined company, and the company will remain headquartered in Irvine, California. Upon closing, Sanjay Mehrotra is expected to join the Western Digital Board of Directors. \nWestern Digital has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions to create value. The company expects to achieve full annual run-rate synergies of $500 million within 18 months post-closing. \nThe transaction is expected to be EPS accretive on a non-GAAP basis within 12 months of the transaction close. Pending the closing of the transaction, Western Digital expects to continue paying its quarterly dividend and plans to suspend its share buyback program. \nSanDisk's shares rose to $78.76 in premarket trading, but were well below the cash-and-stock offer of $86.50 per share. \nThe transaction mirrors similar deals in the semiconductor industry as demand for cheaper chips and products to power Internet-connected gadgets push technology companies to consolidate suppliers.
