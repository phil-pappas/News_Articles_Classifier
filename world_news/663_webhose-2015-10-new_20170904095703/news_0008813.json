In the clip, we see a young couple eagerly oversharing articles, butting into other people's private conversations and having loud conversations with each other that everyone in the office can hear.\nYou know, things nobody but them cares about, but everyone sees on their news feed because the couple felt the need to share it with the rest of the world for some reason -- right down to the bitter breakup and beyond.\nYou can watch the clip above; maybe it'll inspire us all to think twice before sharing every little thought that pops into our heads on social media.", "external_links": ["http://www.collegehumor.com/post/7034006/if-couples-acted-like-they-do-on-facebook?ref=homepage", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/06AAe0MfEd8"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:37:12.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
