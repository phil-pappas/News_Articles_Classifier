Previously, this had only been achieved using ruthenium dyes which are expensive and toxic. \nAlthough solar energy is a sustainable resource, it is still infrequently used. To try and alleviaite this problem researchers worldwide are on a quest to find innovative and efficient methods of harnessing solar energy in an environmentally friendly way. \nThe novel method developed by team at Lund University involves the use of solar cells which consist of a dye that captures the solar energy and a thin film of nano-structured titanium dioxide. The dyes currently used in high-quality solar cells contain ruthenium, a rare and expensive element. \nMany researchers have tried to replace ruthenium with iron, but without success. All previous attempts have resulted in molecules that convert light energy into heat instead of electrons, which is required for solar cells to generate electricity. \nProf. Villy Sundström - Lund University \nResearchers at the Chemistry Department in Lund partnered with Uppsala University to successfully create an iron-based dye capable of transforming light into electrons at almost 100% efficiency. \nThe advantage of using iron is that it is a common element in nature. It can provide inexpensive and environmentally friendly applications of solar energy in the future. \nProf. Kenneth Wärnmark - Lund University \nThe team integrated the experiments with advanced computer simulations to better understand what design concepts will make the iron molecules work best. With the data obtained from the simulations, iron-based dyes are being developed further. Although these dyes require more research before they can be used practically, the theory holds promise. \nThe results of the study suggest that solar cells based on these materials can be at least as effective as those of today that are based on ruthenium or other rare metals. \nProf. Villy Sundström - Lund University \nIt is likely that this research will help in the progress of research on solar fuels. Similar to photosynthesis in plants, sunlight can be used to transform water and carbon dioxide into energy-rich molecules, i.e solar fuels. \nWe envision that the new iron-based molecules could also drive the chemical reactions that create solar fuel \nProf. Kenneth Wärnmark - Lund University \nFor three years, the team has been working on creating iron-based solar cell dyes. They're extremely pleased at their speedy discovery of a dye that is capable of capturing sunlight in with such a high efficiency. \nAchieving success in research usually takes longer than what we hope for and believe... For once, it was the opposite! \nProf. Villy Sundström - Lund University \nThe research findings have been published in the Nature Chemistry journal. The research is a collaborative effort of researchers from several departments within Lund University and researchers from Uppsala University.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:52:18.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
