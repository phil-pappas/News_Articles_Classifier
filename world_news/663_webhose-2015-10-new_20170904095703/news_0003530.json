Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Melbourne-based tech hardware start-up Strone is raising between $3 million and $5 million after its device, which lets overseas travellers stay connected to their own phone number without the bill shock, proved a hit at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this year.\nThe company is raising funds to kick-start a marketing push and enable it to hire more staff.\nStrone's first product, Roam, is a cylindrical device which allows users to leave their usual SIM card at home connected to Wi-Fi and receive calls and texts while travelling to their own number using the Strone app. The one condition is that users need to have access to data while travelling.\nTo tackle this, Strone has signed a deal with mobile data business GigSky, which sells data-only SIM cards for travellers. The partnership means Strone Roam owners are given a free GigSky data SIM to use when travelling (although they'll have to buy their own plans).\nThe Roam product which aims to save money for travellers has a sleek black design. \"We had about 25 different SIM card providers wanting to partner with us, but GigSky was a very clear choice because of its strategic alliance with Apple. GigSky comes preloaded onto iPads, but their product is also easy to use and seamless,\" Strone chief executive Tas Tudor said.\nThe business is selling the first 250 of its devices through crowdfunding platform Indiegogo. But Mr Tudor said this was more about generating interest rather than funds to create the product, which is in beta testing.\n\"It wasn't all about getting orders and sales, but it was designed to generate interest and it's definitely done that. We have had an order for 10 Roams from Saudi Arabia,\" he said.\n\"We will continue discussions with distributors and hopefully also get some big corporates supporting us by buying our product.\"\n Early backing Through Indiegogo, there have been 73 orders for one or more Roams, but offline orders have tripled that.\nThe venture is already backed by OzForex chief executive Richard Kimber (also the company chairman) and a private Malaysian investor who put in $1.6 million.\n\"As someone who has spent many years travelling for work and on holidays, I have never been able to reconcile the fees charged for roaming,\" Mr Kimber said.\n\"I want to support innovation directly and I am prepared to put my own capital into the ventures.\"\nThe company believes it could save consumers up to 50 per cent on their global roaming charges, depending on their carrier.\n\"We've had some figures through from a top 100 ASX company and they had a $2 million roaming bill and we cut it down to $1 million,\" Mr Tudor said.\nFormerly an accountant, Mr Tudor decided to create the device when he was travelling in Sri Lanka in January 2014.\nAt the time he was working on a separate tech venture, but he realised that global roaming charges was a bigger problem to tackle.\n\"It was costing me a fortune to stay connected to my own phone number,\" he said.\n\"I was looking for something to put my SIM into to stream my phone calls, but I couldn't find it because it didn't exist.\"\nThis led to the creation of Strone Technology, which Mr Tudor formed with some friends and his brother. They outsourced most software and hardware development to local Australians, which gave them access to skills and resources they couldn't afford within the business.\nIf the the Roam product is successful, Mr Tudor hopes to expand the capabilities of the device and have a consumer and enterprise division of the company.\n\"We want to put a 4G modem in it which can become a personal Wi-Fi hot spot. Through simple software upgrades, we can turn it into an internet of things device.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:19:59.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
