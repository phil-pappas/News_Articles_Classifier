One short video clip appears to show, from behind, a man having sex with a hugely obese woman while the music from \"Mission Impossible\" plays. \nMuch of the content appeared to be intended as humor. \nA series of fake \"motivational posters\" included one that says \"you failed the gay test\" if you noticed a sponsor's logo in the background behind four scantily clad women on a beach volleyball court. \nAn email captioned \"morning funnies\" showed children, some still infants, seeming to ogle women's bodies, posing with empty beer bottles or making obscene gestures. There were also clips that included a family dinner interrupted when the apparent daughter rips open her shirt, telling her parents: \"I got these pierced because I hate you.\" \nOne email included a photo with a joke about what happens when you use corn on the cob as a sex toy. \nThe only email sent by Eakin showed an elementary schoolteacher in the classroom asking her students for two examples of an abstract noun, something they can think of but not touch. The answer, from a boy student? Her breasts. \nEakin also is part of an email conversation that apparently involved a golf outing, beer and \"hot chicks.\" Under the pseudonym John Smith, he chimed in with: \"Where's your spirit of closure — Stoney left the poor girl hanging.\" \nEakin did not respond to a message seeking comment Thursday. He previously apologized for what he called \"insensitive\" content in his private email account, and said it was out of character for him. \nKane has argued the emails could violate court rules that require judges to act in a way that promotes public confidence in the judiciary and that prohibit them from acting in ways that would appear to undermine their independence, integrity and impartiality. \nThe attorney general is herself awaiting trial on charges she leaked secret grand jury material to the Daily News and lied about it, allegations she has repeatedly denied. A suspension of her law license took effect Thursday, although she remains in office and has said she will continue to perform most of her official duties. \nThe attorney general's office recovered hundreds of sexually explicit, crude and sometimes pornographic images in emails exchanged among state prosecutors, judges and others while investigating the agency's handling of the Jerry Sandusky sexual molestation case last year. \nThe scandal resulted in dozens of people being fired, disciplined or forced to resign, and also caused the abrupt retirement of another Supreme Court justice, Seamus McCaffery. \nEakin's role in the email circle was investigated a year ago, and he was cleared. \nBut Kane has raised fresh questions about whether the investigation was conducted properly. The Judicial Conduct Board and a lawyer hired by the Supreme Court are currently taking another look. \nKane said Wednesday that the material in Eakin's email account was offensive to all Pennsylvanians and worse than described by the Judicial Conduct Board in a letter last year telling Eakin the complaints against him had been dismissed. \n\"This set of emails is, however, only a subset of the pornographic, misogynistic and racist emails received and sent by Justice Eakin,\" she said in a note provided to reporters with the emails on Thursday. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:37:16.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
