It is the first phone in the price range to have a 13MP rear camera with laser auto-focus and dual-LED real tone flash. The camera uses Toshiba’s f/2.0-aperture lens to deliver excellent details, saturation and contrast levels with every shots taken in daylight conditions. \n\nThe laser auto focus technology measures distances at lightning speed, producing near-instant focus as fast as only 0.2 seconds.That is two times faster than traditional focus, which need to detect the sharpness of the photo frame by frame and thus requires longer and unnecessary travel that slows down the focusing time. \nASUS also equips the phone with PixelMaster’s Low Light Mode, which combined with the laser auto focus system, produces the best pictures in low light environments. It also intelligently adjusts noise-level, colour and contrast. \nPriced at RM799, the ZenFone 2 Laser is probably the best smartphone manufactured for the mid-to-low range market because ASUS also doles out legions of other great features on the phone like a key on the back of the phone, which you can control with your index finger naturally to adjust volumes and take a selfie, among other things. \nThe smartphone also has a beautiful yet tough 5.5″ HD IPS display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, which offers wide viewing angles up to 178 degrees. Fit with a 20nm anti-fingerprints layer on the cover glass, you can enjoy sliding and swiping the screen without leaving any fingerprints. \nASUS top this off with outstanding performance on the phone. The ZenFone 2 Laser comes with the 64 bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 Cortex A53 MSM8916 Quad Core processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB internal storage and can support up to 128GB of MicroSD card. \nOverall, ASUS has given us a cheaper alternative for high-end smartphones that can excite mobile users.
