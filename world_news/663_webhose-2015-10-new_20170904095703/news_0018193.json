SkySiren then provides a proven safety back-up.\" \nThe PCS system has eight ultrasonic sensors installed behind and in front of the operator on the boom platform, which generate high-frequency sound waves around the MEWP operator. \nWhen the platform moves to within a defined distance of an object, the sensors detect the sound waves that are reflected back from it, and trigger a signal to stop the MEWP. \nWhile moving within the 'sensing zone' around the object, the operator is continuously alerted by a flashing red light and a personal alarm, and will have to simply reset the safety foot pedal in a bid to start the machine again, and move towards the working position. \nIf the user operates the platform in a way that risks entrapment, the SkySiren pressure sensor bar located across the control panel ensures his safety by stopping the MEWP and subsequently raising the alarm with a strobe light and a klaxon. \nThe system also warns operators about potential hazards so as to help them remain more alert in high-risk areas. Trapping and crushing incidents are claimed to be one of the major causes of serious injuries and fatalities involving MEWPs.
