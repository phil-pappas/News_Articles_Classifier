The new Backup-as-a-Service offering is dynamic and reliable, delivering significant cost savings to MCS customers by only requiring that they purchase the system level protection they need, rather than the entire underlying Commvault platform. As one of Commvault's premier Cloud Solution partners, UbiStor will help MCS leverage its storage platform for customers around the U.S., increasing the sales reach of MCS for storage as well as for the MCS platform itself. \nAs businesses look to leverage the latest in cloud technologies, environments are becoming increasingly complex. This is generating the need for expanded storage, improved performance and a proven data protection solution. Currently, organizations are forced to purchase expensive data management platforms and storage to protect their business critical data. Commvault software is built to cost-effectively protect, manage and access data in a simple, flexible and modular way. With this partnership, MCS is providing backup agents at the server level, storage targets for these systems and a fully integrated managed service. This greatly reduces the costs to the customer, while increasing their support levels with dedicated support and system management functions from the UbiStor team. \n\"The data demands of our clients grow daily, and the collaboration between Markley Cloud Services, Commvault, and UbiStor keeps us true to our promise that customers will always have access to top of the line solutions that fit their business needs,\" said Patrick Gilmore, chief technology officer for Markley Cloud Services. \"It was important to the Markley team that our Backup-as-a-Service offering not only present a cost-effect and simplified way for our clients to ensure their data is protected, but also offer holistic managed services so they can focus on more critical and expanding IT goals.\" \nMCS delives the ideal enterprise-class Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions for organizations working to maximize IT performance, reduce upfront capital expenses, and increase speed to market, taking full responsibility for all physical hardware supporting IaaS solutions, including enterprise-class servers, storage, switching and cabling fabric, and more. MCS clients realize cost-effective security, performance and reliability. \nMCS is currently operating in three U.S. locations - Boston, Los Angeles and Dallas - with additional builds on-going in Sterling, Va. and Cincinnati. Users have multiple points of entry across the country to provide local and regional storage target points to lessen latency and increase overall throughput. \n\"By offering multiple locations for customers to send and receive protected data, we are enabling users to have much more control over their data protection schemes,\" said Paul Diamond, solutions architect at Markley Cloud Services. \"Customers place importance on the ability to have control over where their data is located and replicated, and our partnership with UbiStor and Commvault supports the self-service administrative capabilities required to do so.\" \nMarkley Cloud Services' product suite also includes DR-as-a-Service and Storage-as-a-Service with multiple tiers of storage for varying use cases.
