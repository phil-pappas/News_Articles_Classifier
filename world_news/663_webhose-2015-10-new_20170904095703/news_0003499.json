Of the just over 1,900 contacts in my primary address book, 399 are women. Last year, people I followed on Twitter were 79.7% men; today my address book is 79.9% men.\nIf the majority of leaders at most companies are men and if the majority of their networks are men (as mine are), then this is a self-perpetuating problem.\nThis is hardly a new notion: a 23-year-old study concluded that \"network mechanisms operate to create and reinforce gender inequalities in the workplace.\"\nThat study's author, Herminia Ibarra , more recently referenced Malcolm Gladwell’s work on the subject of gender diversity:\n\"[N]etworks run on 'connectors,' people who are linked to almost everyone else in a few steps and who connect the rest of us to the world. … [Y]ou can reach connectors through someone you already know or through someone who knows someone whom you already know. (emphasis mine)\nIt really is who you know. And who I know is 80% men. The 80/20 split is everywhere for me. People who follow me on Twitter? 81/19:\nRick Klau's gender split of Twitter followers (Photo: Rick Klau)\nMaybe LinkedIn is different? Spoiler alert: LinkedIn is not different. Interestingly, LinkedIn itself doesn’t know this: it doesn’t ask your gender when you sign up. I used genderize.io to programmatically estimate the gender of my LinkedIn network. Of my 2,300 plus contacts in my LinkedIn network, 23% are women. At least I’m consistent.\nWhat now?\nA few years ago, my favorite contemporary science fiction author John Scalzi wrote a brilliant post attempting to explain white male privilege. He came up with a rather lovely metaphor:\nIn the role playing game known as The Real World, “Straight White Male” is the lowest difficulty setting there is.\nWhat I like about John’s metaphor is not that it says you’ll win the game just because you’re a straight white guy, but that the game of life is inherently more difficult if you’re something other than a straight white guy. Once you become more aware of the obstacles placed in front of the non-straight white males, it's harder to deny the fundamental truth of John’s post.\nI’m a father of three, my youngest is my daughter. Once I'd taken Google's Unconscious Bias training , it was hard not to notice all the subtle cues we're surrounded by that reinforce the idea that it's a man’s world:\nHighlight tonight: reading \"Oh, the Places You'll Go\" to my daughter. Mildly annoyed at having to sub \"girl\" for \"guy\" a few times though.\n— Rick Klau (@rklau) March 5, 2014 In the professional context, address books like mine are just one obstacle among many that women face — and it's hardly their biggest obstacle. But it's a real obstacle nonetheless, and importantly it's one I can directly work on improving .\nMuch like the Unconscious Bias training helped me see things I wasn't previously aware of and changed how I interacted with my colleagues, this network awareness led me to be more conscious of how I engage with women at work and online.\nNext Steps\nI suspect that many people will be similarly surprised at what the data says about their networks. Once you know your own ratio, I think you'll be motivated as I was to make it better. That was the first step for me: awareness and commitment to improve. I reached out to several colleagues, men and women, to ask how they address this for themselves.\nHere are a few suggestions:\nUnderstand Unconscious Bias. Once \"bias\" is a fact rather than a stigma, you can get to work on compensating for it. The Implicit Association test was useful data that helped me accept that even though I'm married to a strong woman, am father of a strong girl, have spent years talking a good game when it came to championing women in the workplace, yes, I do in fact over-index \"work\" with \"male\" and \"home\" with \"female.\" (Whether you know it or not, odds are, so do you. Take the test.)\nKnow your own ratio . Look at Twitter’s analytics and give Followerwonk a try. For that LinkedIn data I generated, here's a blog post on how you can do what I did. From the time I started this essay to today, every single metric I measured has improved . Knowing your own ratio will lead you to want to improve it.\nPush for gender diversity and insist on a code of conduct at events. One event I attend each year, ORDcamp, addressed this by asking for attendee nominations of people who \"don't look like you.\" Zack and Fitz (ORDcamp’s organizers) progressed from <10% to 33% women in just a few years. (To their credit, they're still not happy with a 2:1 ratio, and continue to work on improving the ratio.)\nAvoid all male panels and all-male speaker line-ups. Going forward, I simply won't participate in a panel discussion that's all guys. (Also? Panels are often terrible.)\nFollow more women on Twitter. No, I'm not giving you a list. Who's interesting to me isn't necessarily going to be interesting to you — and whether I listed 50 or 500 I’d be leaving out countless worthwhile voices. Seek them out. Use the ORDcamp mantra I cited earlier as your guide: Follow people who don’t look like you.\nListen. A funny thing happens when you engage with more women (I know, I know — this is hardly rocket science): you become more aware of their experiences, more conscious of their challenges. Read one headline about harassment online and you might think it's an isolated case; follow hundreds of women, you'll learn just how common it is . And you might just be motivated to help make things better, in whatever small way you can.\nRick Klau is a partner at Google Ventures, Google's venture capital arm.
