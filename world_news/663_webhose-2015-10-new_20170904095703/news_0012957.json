Minotaur was one of the early stage monitoring products for Microsoft BizTalk Server. (Minotaur was originally owned and maintained by Raging Bull Tech, and was later taken over by Synegrate).\nSynegrate is focused on providing a superior customer experience in their consulting and service offerings when it comes to complex integration projects. While the Minotaur monitoring product filled a customer requirement a few years ago, it has since been superseded by superior niche focused products like BizTalk360.\nSays Riaan Gouws (CTO, partner): “This partnership allows us to focus 100% on our services around on-premise BizTalk and Azure Service bus enterprise integration projects while still providing our customers with a best of breed monitoring product. We chose BizTalk360 as the preferred monitoring product for our customer base based on product maturity and value proposition.”\n“When Johan and Riaan (founder of Minotaur) approached us and explained about their intention to transition Minotaur customers to BizTalk360, we were super excited. I feel they made the right decision by putting their customer’s interest first and keep their focus on their core strengths by serving their customers better by providing system integration solutions” said Saravana Kumar, Founder/CTO of Kovai Limited.\nBoth Kovai Limited and Synegrate will work closely together in making sure the transition is seamless for their existing Minotaur customers. The companies also signed mutual partner agreement to help each other in future business opportunities.\nAbout Kovai Limited\nKovai Limited is a software development (ISV) company based in London.
