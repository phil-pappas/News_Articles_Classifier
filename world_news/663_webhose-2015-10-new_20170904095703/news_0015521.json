No, seriously. Sure, I came back from Germany with like $80 worth of little figures . Sure, I got the 30th anniversary 8-bit Mario. Sure, I got the retro three-pack. Sure, I got a display for them. But I’m done. Really. \nWatch this video to see just how done I am with them. \nLet’s be fair, Nintendo might be getting less stupid with Amiibo distribution. I found the 30th anniversary 8-bit Mario Amiibo and the retro three-pack at GameStop, for retail price, without a preorder. And I’ve seen Olimar, Dr. Mario, and Ganondorf there, too! It’s like you can actually buy the new Amiibos instead of pine for them until the ones no one wants (I’m sorry, Toad and Luigi, but you know the deal) warm pegs for months. \nIncidentally, Ganondorf looks great (though I haven’t bought him yet. I mean, I won’t buy him! I’m done with Amiibos). He’s as detailed as Marth and Pit, with the added bonus of the actual chance of getting him in this country. \nThat’s a point that remains frustrating, especially after going to Berlin and seeing how many Amiibos that are impossible to find here are in every electronics store there. Some rare Amiibos have been spotted at the Nintendo World Store at Rockefeller Center, but besides there you’ll have a hard time finding any rare Amiibo from the first few Super Smash Bros. waves. \nIf you want to show off your Amiibos, this $30 Super Mario Bros. display is deceptively excellent. The box says it can hold up to six Amiibos, but that’s a lie. Each block (with the exception of the two-block flag holder) can hold one Amiibo and be rearranged however you want. The base can hold eight Amiibos, or eight columns of blocks with Amiibos on top. And, well, it’s inexpensive enough that you can glue the blocks together with impunity to make a big Amiibo shelf. \nNow, no more Amiibos. I’m not getting any more. Nope. None. \nUnless they make Protoman, or Mega Man X, or Wind Waker Ganondorf, or Solid Snake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:23:46.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
