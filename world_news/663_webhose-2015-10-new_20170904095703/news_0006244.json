The solution includes KVH’s global TracPhone ® V11-IP satellite communications system, mini-VSAT Broadband sm connectivity, IP-MobileCast TM content delivery service, and CommBox TM network management tools. More Seaspan vessels are expected to receive the mini-VSAT Broadband 2.0 solution in 2016. In addition, other vessels in Seaspan’s fleet already utilize such KVH services as Videotel TM maritime training and KVH Media Group news and movie services. \n“We chose KVH for our newest vessels because of their dynamic and flexible one-stop communications and media solutions, and because they can provide us with a level of quality that addresses all of the factors that are so critical to ship owning and ship management today,” says David Kramer, Director, Fleet Management, for Seaspan, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. “At Seaspan, we require high-quality, continuous global connectivity for optimizing operations, and cost-efficient content delivery services for attracting and maintaining the best crews possible.” \nKVH’s TracPhone V11-IP is a powerful yet compact 1.1 meter antenna that seamlessly accesses both the C- and Ku-band satellites of KVH’s mini-VSAT Broadband network, providing global coverage, with download speeds up to 4 Mbps. Fast, reliable connectivity is important for the Seaspan containerships, which incorporate technological and environmental advancements for fuel efficiency and travel the world’s shipping routes on long-term charters. In addition, the Seaspan vessels are utilizing the network management capabilities built into the TracPhone V11-IP’s Integrated CommBox Modem (ICM), for onboard IT functions to optimize and manage web and email traffic. \nBy choosing KVH’s IP-MobileCast content delivery service, Seaspan has made it possible for crew members onboard the subscribing vessels to enjoy national and international newspaper editions updated several times daily; and new-release movies and popular TV shows from a variety of countries – with new selections added regularly, even while the vessel is at sea. The content is commercially licensed as required by copyright law, and helps ship operators meet maritime guidelines for crew welfare. \n“Seaspan is known throughout the world as a leader in ship management, with a reputation for best-in-class operations, technologically advanced vessels, and experienced crew,” says Brent Bruun, executive vice president of mobile broadband for KVH. “We are thrilled that they have chosen KVH’s mini-VSAT Broadband 2.0 complete maritime communications solution to help them meet the demands of modern shipping.” \nNote to Editors: For more information about mini-VSAT Broadband 2.0, KVH’s complete maritime communications solution, please visit the mini-VSAT Broadband 2.0 website , www.minivsat.com/one.
