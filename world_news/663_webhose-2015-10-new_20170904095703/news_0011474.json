PROSPECT, Ill., Oct. 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cutting fiber cement material can be tough on both the user and their saw. That's why SKILSAW(Â®), a leader in wood cutting saws for more than 90 years, took on the task to create a jobsite cutting solution to help pros power through this demanding job. The SKILSAW 7-1/4 in. SIDEWINDER(TM) Circular Saw for Fiber Cement relies on the brand's long-standing expertise to create a saw that is not only engineered with optimal power for greater efficiency on the jobsite, but also funnels harmful silica dust away from the tool motor for a longer life and a cleaner work space. What's more, the saw is designed with the same high standards of every SKILSAW to ensure maximum performance and durability for pros. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151021/279156 \nThe SKILSAW 7-1/4 in. SIDEWINDER for Fiber Cement is available with a Diablo fiber cement blade (SPT67FMD-22) or a SKILSAW blade (SPT67FMD-01) and features a unique dust collection system. The tool includes a blade guard extension and dust channel that funnels dust into the included vacuum hose, where it's then collected in a jobsite vac. The saw's no-mar cord and hose sleeve keeps these items protected from the cutting surface and makes handling the tool more convenient so users can focus on the job at hand. Pros will also benefit from the SKILSAW Dual-Field(TM) motor which ensures best-in-class performance and durability. The lightweight yet rugged magnesium components make the new SIDEWINDER for Fiber Cement the perfect tool for remodeling and new construction projects as it handles cut after cut all day long. \n\"SKILSAW looks for ways to increase jobsite productivity, and tackling fiber cement cutting is a natural next step as the demand for the material, such as fiber cement board on jobsites continues to grow at a rapid pace,\" said Miki Vuckovic, SKILSAW Product Manager. \"The new SIDEWINDER for Fiber Cement offers tried and true SKILSAW cutting technology, a comprehensive dust management system and best-in-class ergonomics\". \nAvailable in April 2016, the new SIDEWINDER for Fiber Cement saws can be found at industrial distributors nationwide with a suggested retail price of $199 (USD). The new SIDEWINDER for Fiber Cement also has the Stay True Gaurantee (TM) that all of the saws carry because every SKILSAW should be as hardworking and reliable as its user. After 180 days, if the user is unsatisfied, the company will honor its word and refund the cost of the saw. More information will be available on www.skilsaw.com in the near future. \nAbout SKILSAW Power ToolsSKILSAW Power Tools, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Robert Bosch Tool Corporation in Mount Prospect, Ill., is a leader in cutting technology serving the professional construction market under the SKILSAW brand and consumer do-it-yourself market under the SKIL brand.
