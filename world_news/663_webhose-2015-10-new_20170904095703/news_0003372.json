Technology is all about the fresh and fast. Mobile centric apps that instantly gratify your tastes for visual stimulation are all the buzz in 2015. Brands and companies are finding new and exciting ways to engage their consumers with attention grabbing photos and videos. They are now discovering that leveraging influential social-media users’ followings is an excellent avenue for engaging a massive client base of very active users within their markets, that they otherwise wouldn’t reach.\nOriginally founded in the Summer of 2013, IG Shoutout Network LLC is the first company of its kind. Their network is designed to help brands more efficiently collaborate and build relationships with influencers to launch social media campaigns and measure their effectiveness, allowing digital marketers to better engage potential consumers and ultimately drive greater business results. Essentially, the app is a brand to influencer transaction and correspondence facilitator management platform. What this means in laymen’s terms is that you can pay varying amounts of money to get posted on Instagram pages of varying sizes - All for varying durations. Seem complicated? It’s really simple once you wrap your head around it. Many companies of all shapes and sizes are catching on to this marketing trend. The site features a whole bevy of different Instagram users and accounts whose followings include hoards of mobile consumers across a broad range of interests.\nSimon said, “More and more companies these days are allocating increasing amounts of their advertising budget towards influencer marketing rather than traditional advertising methods like TV, radio, print ads, and even Google or Facebook ads. Our company is the first to bridge the gap between influential Instagram users and brands of all different shapes and sizes. It doesn’t even matter if you are a brand or company, even if you are an average Joe who has 20 bucks and wants some instagram followers within your interest. Let’s say Joe is a car guy. For that $20 his car can be posted to a auto enthusiast page with 100,000 followers. That post on the big page which tags @JoeTheCarGuy in the caption will likely deliver dozens of followers , comments, and likes to Joe’s future posts. Now isn’t that sort of the point when showing off your car? The same principal can apply to Plain Jane and her flat faced cat. Fancy that.”\nHow it works:\nIG Shoutout caters to two influencer types from any interest : from animals, fitness, travel, photography, and Women’s fashion, to fishing enthusiasts, college football fans, and basically anything you can imagine that people are interested in. The two types of influential Instagram users are niche pages and influencers. IG Shoutout has heavier emphasis on niche pages. On the IG Shoutout Network, most of the Instagram accounts that sell promotions are general niche pages, and do not represent actual people. For example ‘InstagramBodyBuilding’ is an account related to fitness and bodybuilding. On the other hand, Gerardo Gabriel is a fitness influencer with a name and the likeliness behind his personal “brand”. This person’s endorsement is worth more to brands, therefore their endorsement generally costs more.\nFollowers of both pages are much more likely to engage if an actual person telling them to go out and buy a product when they endorse it, as opposed to a niche page about fitness. A diverse combination of endorsements from niche pages as well as actual people is a healthy influencer marketing strategy for social media.\n“I got a shoutout on the page WomensApparel for my fitness clothing line and I was VERY pleased. I added over 400 followers in 6 hours and gained instant sales for my business. I highly recommend this site if you are looking to get noticed,” said Jesse Mirabal, Owner of fitness-epidemic.com\nIGSnet makes it possible to buy and sell Instagram shoutouts from a mobile app. The IGS Customer app facilitates the brand and influencer correspondence while they partner their likeliness for strategic social campaigns. The IGS Vendor app allows shoutout sellers to tap into the vast network of potential buyers from many different niches. Approved vendors of IG Shoutout gain access to a sales portal where they can approve or deny a shoutout request, and manage multiple instagram accounts. Now that’s nifty.\nMedia Contact\nIG ShoutOut Network LLC\nSimon Heit\nCEO and Founder\nLos Angeles, CA\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
