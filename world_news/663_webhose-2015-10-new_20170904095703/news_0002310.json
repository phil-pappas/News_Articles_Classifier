In March, the FDA extended the use to treat advanced lung cancer.\nUnder the deal, Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay Five Prime $350 million. In addition to the upfront sum, Five Prime will be eligible to receive more than $1.3 billion in development and regulatory milestone payments as well as royalties.\nFPA008 is a drug from the hot field of immuno-oncology, which looks for ways to use the immune system to battle cancer.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n 15, 2015 07:24 ET (11:24 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:49:56.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
