For these consumers, features that can enable them to monitor/view suspicious behavior, send notifications in 'unusual' circumstances, provide a wider angle of surveillance, and capture evidence when needed, are key capabilities. For consumers wanting to use smart security devices to monitor their children's activities, the ability to recognize kids at home, automatically follow their motion, and identify potential dangers, are particularly attractive features for parents. \nClick here for the report: http://bit.ly/1LsSPcD \nAlvin Wu, report author and Senior Analyst commented, \"Consumers also expect comprehensive security features that enable strict access to the camera to prevent unauthorized users. Furthermore, easy installation and set-up is essential. Though several participants in this study were technology enthusiasts, many complained about the complexity of setting their devices up.\" \nDiane O'Neill, Director, UXIP, added \"Overall, smart home products need to be intelligent and importantly, able to actively learn and adapt to users' habits and preferences to bring convenience and safety. As an increasing number of home appliances and devices are becoming 'smart', an elderly-friendly user interface will be essential. Hence, a control hub that can understand natural voice commands is the future interface that will provide the most usable and useful smart home experience.\" \nAbout Strategy Analytics Strategy Analytics, Inc. provides the competitive edge with advisory services, consulting and actionable market intelligence for emerging technology, mobile and wireless, digital consumer and automotive electronics companies.
