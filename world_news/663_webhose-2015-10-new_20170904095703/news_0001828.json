The project is aiming to break the land speed record for two wheeled vehicles in the driven wheel category, i.e. not powered by exhaust gases from a jet engine or a rocket. \nThe current record stands at 376mph and the aim is to exceed 400mph. The team is headed up by Alex Maxfadzean who is an ex-GP sidecar racer and will be ridden by James Toseland who is an ex-world superbike champion. \nThe bike will be powered by an RR Gem gas turbine engine taken from a Linx helicopter and TCL will be providing engineering and consultancy services for the fuel control to the engine. \nThe engine is currently undergoing tests to establish the torque curves and it is expected that the bike will be tested at Bruntingthorpe aerodrome later in the year.
