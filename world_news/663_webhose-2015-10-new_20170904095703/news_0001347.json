It had to not just lure the customer the right way with discounts and more, it also had to prepare the ground and strategy to deliver those very goods to eager customers the very next day to make sure there were no disappointments or bad experiences during the entire process. Here we explain how Amazon.in did it:\n1. Amazon India tripled its warehousing capacity to five million cubic feet since last Diwali.\n2. Amazon has lined up one million products for next day delivery as the country’s two largest online retail rivals (Both Amazon and rival Flipkart will have their high voltage festive sales from October 13 to 17) launch simultaneous five day sales on Tuesday – Snapdeal had its 1-day affair called ‘Electronics Monday Sale’ a day earlier.\n3. Amazon has been preparing for the mega sale for months by enrolling a host of vendors and product selections. More than 25,000 sellers queued up in the last two months to participate in the mega event.\n4. As part of its seller development programme, Amazon operated Chai Carts painted with the company’s logo that are taken around in various cities, with officials offering free tea and coffee to business owners while introducing them to the possibilities and rudiments of selling online. So far, about two dozen such Chai Carts have toured 31,000 kilometres in 21 cities.\n5. Amazon is operating 21 warehouses in 10 Indian states covering two million square feet with storage capacity of five million cubic feet – rival Flipkart has 17 warehouses covering 1.5 million square feet of storage capacity.\n“It would be great deal for customers, ensuring that sellers have a blockbuster time, ensuring that we provide a great experience. We believe that this will be the greatest sale India has ever seen,” said Amit Agarwal, head of Amazon in India.\n 14, 2015 9:58 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:24:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
