Please explain how each affects the retailer’s “big picture,” (i.e. potentially moving the sales needle and improving the customer experience). \nOn the surface, automated scheduling through a workforce management (WFM) system sounds like the clear winner at retail. You make a few simple clicks, and based on the employee data you have inputted the algorithm decides, which people should work in what department, and at what time, so you have optimal coverage throughout the store. That option doesn’t always make sense for every workforce, however, and it’s usually a matter of size. \nRetail locations that employ a large number of staff across multiple departments greatly benefit from the ease that an auto-scheduler brings. For these bigger companies, the hours reclaimed by not having to weigh the availability and attributes of 30 to 100 associates to fill each day of the week results in increased time for managers to help support the customer experience, and an optimized schedule that delivers actual dollars saved on labor expenses. \nPlease log in or register below to read the full article.
