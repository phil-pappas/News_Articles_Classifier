RMM takes over the management and monitoring of servers and endpoints up to the operating system (OS) level and can prevent many infrastructure failures from happening. By combining real-time monitoring of critical servers and endpoints with patch management and optimal managed anti-virus and remediation, RMM ensures the reliability and stability of the customer’s IT assets. “We have seen more and more companies that don’t have the time to focus on these services in-house,” said Derrin Rummelt, Product Development Manager at US Signal. “Many companies risk compliance issues if their servers and security endpoints are not consistently updated, supported or maintained according to the requirements set in place. Without managed services, organizations run the risk of increased security vulnerability, downtime by not keeping up on patching, and other critical situations.”\nA regularly maintained infrastructure exposes the customer to fewer failures, yielding higher productivity and savings on support costs. Exposure to security risk is dramatically lessened and allows the customer to focus on core business functions.\nWith eight physical data centers and over 14,000-miles of fiber, US Signal’s fully deployed network is guaranteed to deliver resiliency, flexibility and scalability. US Signal is the most robust cloud provider in the Midwest and includes both HIPAA and PCI Compliant Cloud and Network-based solutions.
