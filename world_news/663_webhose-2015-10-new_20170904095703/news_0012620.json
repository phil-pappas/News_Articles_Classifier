(PRWEB) October 22, 2015\nAccording to EnterWorks , a market leader in master data solutions for transforming product information into persuasive and personalized content, retailers will be competing on content to earn a spot in consumers’ shopping carts this holiday season. As consumers are expected to spend more than $960 billion this year, EnterWorks shares tips for retailers to attract and convert online shoppers.\nToday, consumers read less text but consume more content through images and video. Even customers who prefer to shop in-store rely on digital content to research products before purchasing, using detailed item descriptions and peer reviews to make informed buying decisions. A PwC study found that more than 80 percent of consumers said online channels, including search engines, brand websites and social media, were their first resource when conducting product research.\n“The more that customers rely on digital content for information and insights about purchases, the greater the burden on the retailer to ensure they are providing the right content,” said Rick Chavie, CEO of EnterWorks. “Enabling consumers to access accurate, relevant information will curb dissatisfaction and reduce post-holiday returns related to misleading product content.”\nAccurate product content can reduce the number of returns after the holidays, a time that retailers are inundated with returns and exchanges. A survey conducted by Retale reveals 21 percent of consumers planned on returning a gift they received during the 2014 holiday season. To make sure their product content is ready for an influx of online shoppers retailers should ensure they have the descriptive assets – the right tags, facets and visual content - that accurately reflect product assortment and current market trends.\n“We work with companies in a variety of sectors, from fashion and beauty to electronics, so we see the challenges that brands face in getting their most current content distributed across channels,” continued Chavie. “Most retailers lack a single view of content, which makes it incredibly difficult to ensure that product content is accurate and up-to-date in all touchpoints.”\nDespite the prevalence of online shopping, most retailers still don’t have enough timely, visual content on their sites. For retailers that need a product content overhaul before the holiday shopping season, as part of its Product Information Management system, EnterWorks can develop and implement data models and content in as little as 30 days.\nTo learn more about EnterWorks and how it can help retailers improve their product content strategy, visit http://www.enterworks.com/ .\nAbout EnterWorks\nEnterWorks Enable® software acquires, manages and transforms a company’s product information into persuasive and personalized content that enables differentiation, higher sales and new competitive strengths.
