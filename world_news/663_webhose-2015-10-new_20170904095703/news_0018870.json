The visit left a lasting impression and Mr. Lawrie began a life-long fascination with sculptures.\n“It somehow resonated with me,” said Mr. Lawrie, who runs an insurance business in Burlington, Ont. “I somehow fell in love with sculptures.”\nHis passion has sent Mr. Lawrie around the world, visiting museums and meeting sculptors to learn more about their craft. He has also become a major donor, contributing $1-million to the Royal Botanical Gardens in Burlington for the creation of an international sculpture garden and $100,000 to the Art Gallery of Burlington, along with a sculpture for the gallery’s main courtyard.\n“I just have a soft spot for the gallery,” Mr. Lawrie said about his recent gifts. “I want it to grow and be an intricate part of the community.”\nMr. Lawrie said he is still intrigued by sculptures and the artists who create them. “There’s always a story behind a sculpture,” he said.\npwaldie@globeandmail.com\n More Related to this Story giving back Helping Princess Margaret hospital fight cancer one slapshot at a time\nGIVING BACK Investment conference funds SickKids research\nGIVING BACK Pedaling for Parkinson’s – and for family\nGIVING BACK Helping students with autism take Giant Steps forward\nGiving back Golfer David Hearn hits a hole-in-one for Alzheimer Society of Canada\nTopics: Giving Back Burlington, Ontario Comments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:53:09.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
