Latest Rumors Tweet \nYesterday William and Kate marked World Mental Health Day by visiting Harrow College in order to meet young people who talked about their mental health issues. \nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, both 33, encountered charity volunteers at an event hosted by mental health charity Mind, where the royals and the youngsters discussed about how they manage to cope with their problems. \nKensington Palace shared, on October 10, photos of the royal couple during the event as they were talking with Mind charity volunteers and their families. The Palace also tweeted a photo of the Duke and Duchess participating in a Mindkit workshop.

But they really put everyone at ease. They genuinely wanted to hear about our personal experiences.” \n“Will said, ‘Actually you guys are the real heroes and it’s you that we want to hear from, it’s not about us,’” the volunteer added. \nThis isn’t the first time the Duchess of Cambridge, née Kate Middleton, is described as being down-to-earth. Back in June, the royal mother-of-two stopped at an organic shop, located close to their country house, Anmer Hall, where she bought a desert for their son George – a meringue, and a staffer praised the royal for her unpretentious attitude. \n“If you didn’t know who she was, you would never know,” the staffer told People magazine. “She’s incredibly down-to-earth, very gracious and extremely polite.” \nKate Middleton, Prince William and Prince Harry are “interested” in “ mental well-being ,” a royal source told People in August. \nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is also a patron of children’s mental health charity Place2Be, which offers counseling to children in schools.
