This solution utilizes client-side encryption with which no one except the users themselves can see their data, file names and contents. Accessing the encrypted files in the apps has been simplified to only typing a personal passcode, called \"Crypto pass\".\n\"Our pCloud Crypto desktop and mobile applications take the advantage of client-side encryption and we are very happy that now we can offer it in the Web browser too\" said pCloud's CEO Tunio Zafer. “pCloud Crypto for web is ensuring that pCloud users can access their encrypted data on all platforms and devices “.\npCloud Crypto acts as a zero-knowledge privacy folder where users can store as many sensitive files as needed. Because only the users know their Crypto pass, not even the service provider has access to what’s inside.\n pCloud Crypto visit https://www.pcloud.com/encrypt-your-sensitive-files-in-the-cloud.html\nTogether with the announcement of the Crypto service for Web, Tunio Zafer announced a 90 days hacking challenge. pCloud offered to pay $20,000 to the hacker that can break into its pCloud Crypto service in the next three months.\n“We are so confident of the security of our client-side encryption service that we offer $20,000 to the hacker that can prove us wrong” said Tunio Zafer.\n pCloud hacking challenge visit https://www.pcloud.com/challenge/ .\nAbout pCloud\npCloud is one of the most innovative cloud storage services on the market.
