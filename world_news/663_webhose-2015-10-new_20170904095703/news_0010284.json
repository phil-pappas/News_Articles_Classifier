Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said the country could be in for major “adjustments” on climate change policy by 2017, ahead of a major UN convention in Paris on the issue. \nIt comes as French Ambassador Christophe Lecourtier said the “planets are becoming more aligned” ahead of the Paris summit where 200 nations will meet to set a new version of the Kyoto Protocol that could have a huge impact on every area of Australian life. \nSo far, 146 countries representing 87 per cent of global emissions have submitted a plan for the event, which is expected to deliver an agreement on how to create a “low emission, climate resilient and sustainable future” that will prevent global temperatures rising more than two degrees — the line in the sand against the worst impacts of climate change. \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change executive secretary Christiana Figueres said the number of commitments made by individual nations has “grown from a steady stream into a sweeping flood” which create an “unparalleled opportunity” to create a new future. \nBut with Australia holding the ignominious position of producing the “ highest emissions levels per capita among all major countries ,” what does that mean for our carbon-loving lifestyle? \nHere’s everything you need to know about the confusing science of climate change. The Adani mine in Queensland could provide the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions a year as Norway and Sweden combined.

We’re the highest emitter of greenhouse gases per capita of the world’s large countries and 14th highest emitter overall , according to the World Resources Institute . \nAustralian National University’s director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy, Frank Jotzo said the combination of a coal-powered energy system, low energy efficiency in general and reliance on primary industries combine to make Australia one of the world’s worst polluters per person. \n“Whether it’s cars and truck or buildings, industrial plants, power stations, on average just about all of these things are much less energy efficient than they are in the countries that have the leading edge in terms of energy efficiency,” he said. \nThe combination of mining, coal, steel mills and agriculture add up to create a “very emissions intensive economy” which is even worse when you consider that the products we export also have emissions trapped within them just waiting to be let out. \n“If you count that as well, then Australia’s national emissions would more than double. In fact they would almost triple,” he said. \nCarbon Pulse estimates the recently approved Adani mine in Queensland could produce around 128 million tonnes a year of carbon emissions, similar to the output of Norway and Sweden combined. However this will count towards total emissions in India where the coal is exported to rather than under Australia’s tally. \nAustralia has agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 ahead of the Paris meeting. It’s a target the government claims is “serious and ambitious” and will impact every aspect of the economy, through greater use of renewable energy and a new national energy plan. \nThis week Environment Department secretary Gordon de Brouwer told a Senate Estimates hearing the target will require “significant economic adjustment” but admitted that even with the reduction, it would still leave Australia “one of the highest — per capita countries with emissions,” in the world. PM Malcolm Turnbull has signalled Australia could be due for a change in policy after 2017 but has not said whether he will attend the Paris negotiations.

But given that Prime Minister’s Abbott’s stance was that “coal is good for humanity”, he said we’re lucky to be in the game at all. \nThomson Reuters head of carbon analysis Stig Schjølset said part of the confusion around targets comes from the fact that each country sets their own non-binding plans making comparison almost impossible. \n“Countries don’t even criticise each other anymore,” he said, making it virtually impossible to make meaningful comparisons. For instance, China says it will achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions at 2030 and work to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 per cent from 2005 levels. Russia said it will limit greenhouse gas emissions to 70-75 per cent of 1990 levels by 2030. The US will reduce their emissions by 26-28 per cent of 2005 figures by 2025 and Europe will work to reduce its emissions to 40 per cent of 1990 levels by 2030. \nMr Jotzo said different ways of expressing targets is part-marketing and part common sense. Countries often choose a base-year in which emissions were high in order to make their reductions seem significant, however the fact that 2005 is used by the US, China and other major nations means it has become a “quasi-standard”. \n“So it might be convenient for marketing purposes but it’s also a fact that the two largest emitters in the world have chosen this base year and so really at the end of the day you cannot fault a county for choosing the base year,” he said.

Picture Dean Martin Source: News Corp Australia \nWHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME? \nIt might seem like high-level talks about meaningless figures, but the reality is the stakes for ordinary people in Australia are high. \nHoward Bamsey and Kath Rowley said in a Lowy Institute report earlier this year that failing to play a meaningful part would “seriously endanger the national interest” and leave the country economically isolated. \n“Avoiding the task at hand is rather like a smoker ignoring health warnings. The problem will not go away — it will only get worse. And over time, failure to convincingly explain its domestic policy choices would leave Australia’s interests exposed, both within and beyond the climate negotiations,” they wrote. \nThe conundrum is this: With a resource-driven economy, it’s going to be hard for Australia to cut emissions in order to reach the target and may require some wholesale economic disruption. But without action, Australia faces being left as a major fossil-fuel producer in a world where appetite for these products is waning. Add in the fact that climate change makes things like droughts, bushfires, floods and storms — which affect the country’s agricultural livelihood — more common and you have a very complex problem indeed. \nAs Bamsey and Rowley put it: “Few if any other international negotiations invoke such consequences. In no other multilateral process are Australia’s interests so distinctive.” \nMr Jotzo agrees meeting Australia’s targets would require a major overhaul of industries and energy systems, but said the good news is that Australia has plenty of room for improvement and remarkable scope to produce renewable energy due to huge amounts of space, sunlight hours and a sound engineering base. \n“There’s always this fear of change but Australia actually has a very successful history of managing change,” he said. \n”At the end of the day this is simply something we need to face and we need to face proactively. Instead of trying to cling on to an industry that is essentially an industry of the last century, we need to look for industries of the next century.” \nDo you think Australia is doing enough to fight climate change?
