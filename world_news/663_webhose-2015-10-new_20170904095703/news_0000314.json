HRL's breakthrough development of ultralight microlattice materials recognized October 5, 2012 \nResearchers from HRL Laboratories are among the honorees of Popular Mechanics' 2012 Breakthrough Awards for their development of ultralight microlattice materials. Lightweight membrane can significantly reduce in-flight aircraft noise April 27, 2015 \nRiding in a helicopter or airplane can be a noisy experience for passengers. But researchers from North Carolina State University and MIT have developed a membrane that can be incorporated into aircraft to drastically reduce ... Scientists making progress on self-repairing aircraft parts June 24, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers working at Bristol University in England recently briefed the press on progress they have made on creating self-healing carbon fiber reinforced composite materials—they reported that they ... Deformation of 3-D hierarchical nanolattices September 2, 2015 \nIn a new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), researchers in the laboratory of Julia R. Greer, professor of Materials Science, Mechanical Engineering and Medical Engineering, have ... Surfing over simulated ripples in graphene September 18, 2015 \nThe single-carbon-atom-thick material, graphene, featuring ripples is not easy to understand. Instead of creating such ripples physically, physicists investigating this kind of unusually shaped material rely on a quantum ... Recommended for you Boeing demonstrates lightest metal ever October 15, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—Airplane maker Boeing has unveiled what it calls the \"The Lightest Metal Ever\"—called microlattice, the material is a construct that is 99.99 per cent air. It has been developed by Boeing's HRL Laboratories ... Biochemists uncover structure of cellular memory mechanism October 14, 2015 \nCalcium is a crucial element in the body that controls thought, movement and other bodily functions. These events are directed by specialized proteins called ion channels that allow the flow of calcium ions in and out of ... Supercoiled DNA is far more dynamic than the 'Watson-Crick' double helix October 12, 2015 \nResearchers have imaged in unprecedented detail the three-dimensional structure of supercoiled DNA, revealing that its shape is much more dynamic than the well-known double helix. Meteorite impact turns silica into stishovite in a billionth of a second October 13, 2015 \nThe Barringer meteor crater is an iconic Arizona landmark, more than 1km wide and 170 metres deep, left behind by a massive 300,000 tonne meteorite that hit Earth 50,000 years ago with a force equivalent to a ten megaton ... Water-soluble non-peptide foldamers with tunable higher-order conformations October 9, 2015 \n\"Foldamers\" are a class of synthetic structures modeled after proteins, but are designed to form unique, non-natural tertiary and quaternary structures. Like proteins, they are comprised of hydrophobic and hydrophilic subunits, ... Electrochemical process changes magnetism in ferromagnets reversibly October 13, 2015 \nMagnets are well-known from the physics lessons at school, but they are hardly covered in chemistry lectures; and it is still a chemical process by means of which researchers at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:29:39.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
