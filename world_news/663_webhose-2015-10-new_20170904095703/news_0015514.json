We started to detach it after heating it in the oven to examine how the touch panel function was realized. \nHowever, the glass plate on the back side was broken when part of it was being detached. The thickness of the glass was 0.2mm. So, it was naturally fragile. The liquid crystal layer of the display was detached. [Click to enlarge image] \nIn the glass pieces, we found polarizing plates (films) and TFTs on the glass substrate. Judging from the circuits, the capacitive touch sensor seemed to be an in-cell type formed on the liquid crystal layer. The iPhone 6s seemingly detects normal touch operations with the touch sensor formed on the liquid crystal layer and pressures applied for the 3D Touch with the pressure sensor located behind the backlight unit. The TFT circuit was checked with a microscope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:33:08.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
