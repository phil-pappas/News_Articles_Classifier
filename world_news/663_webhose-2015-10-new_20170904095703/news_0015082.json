Ten healthy adults and 10 with MetS ingested encapsulated hexadeuterium-labeled (d 6 )-RRR-α-tocopherol with 240 mL nonfat (0.2 g fat), reduced-fat (4.8 g fat), or whole (7.9 g fat) milk. Blood was drawn at regular intervals during 72 hours. \nThe researchers found that participants with MetS had lower baseline plasma α-tocopherol and greater oxidized low-density lipoprotein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and C-reactive protein (P < 0.05) compared with healthy participants. Increasing amounts of dairy fat provided by milk beverages had no impact on d 6 -α-tocopherol bioavailability, regardless of health status. Compared with healthy participants, MetS participants had lower estimated d 6 -α-tocopherol absorption. In addition, they had lower plasma d 6 -α-tocopherol area under the curve from zero to 72 hours, lower maximal concentrations, and slower rates of plasma disappearance. \n\"These findings support higher dietary α-tocopherol requirements for MetS adults,\" the authors write. Fatty liver may directly mediate CAD in metabolic syndrome January 23, 2013 \n(HealthDay)—Men and women with fatty liver are more likely to have metabolic syndrome (MetS) with type 2 diabetes, and women with fatty liver are more likely to have MetS with subclinical atherosclerosis, according to research ...
