Botti, Executive Vice President, Lifeboat Distribution. “Our backup customers have been asking for an easy-to-sell, integrated solution, and our backup and disaster recovery customers have also requested delivery of our vendor partner products on an appliance-like platform. CBUS is a plug and play solution that efficiently satisfies these strong demands in the market. Initially available for Veeam Software and shown at the VeeamON conference this week in Las Vegas, the appliance will support configurations for Unitrends and StorageCraft and we will be adding those vendors shortly.”\nCBUS is available in 5 standard configurations from XS, S, M, L, XL — addressing storage needs from 2TB-24TB. It includes all licensing for VMware and Microsoft, and remote professional installation services from Lifeboat to ensure maximum performance and faster time to ROI. Purchase of the backup vendor license is required with CBUS, but is sold independently. Customizable units are available upon request.\nResellers and managed service providers interested in offering the CBUS solution should contact Lifeboat by phone at +1.800.847.7078 (US), or +1.888.523.7777 (Canada), or by email at sales(at)lifeboatdistribution(dot)com.\nAbout Lifeboat Distribution\nLifeboat Distribution, a subsidiary of Wayside Technology Group, Inc.
