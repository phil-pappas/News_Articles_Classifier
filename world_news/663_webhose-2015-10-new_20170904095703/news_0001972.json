The vessel sailed with a high utilisation to its next destination, Tangiers, Morocco on September 30, 2015.” \nThe APMT Maasvlakte II Rotterdam facility launched the world’s first container terminal to utilise remotely-controlled STS gantry cranes. \nThe cranes move containers between vessels and the landside fleet of 62 battery-powered lift-automated guided vehicles (Lift-AGVs), which transport containers between the quay and the container yard, including barge and on-dock rail facilities. \nA fleet of 54 automated rail-mounted gantry cranes then position containers in the yard in a high-density stacking system. \nThe facility, constructed on land entirely reclaimed from the North Sea, has been designed as a multi-modal hub to reduce truck-traffic in favour of barge and rail connections to inland locations. \nThe 86 ha deep-water terminal features 1,000 meters of quay, on-dock rail, and eight fully-automated electrically-powered ship-to-shore (STS) cranes, with an annual throughput capacity of 2.7 million TEU. \nAt planned full build-out, the terminal will cover 180 ha and offer 2,800 metres of deep-sea quay (19.65 metres depth), with an annual throughput capacity of 6 million TEU. \n(Source: Maersk Line / YouTube)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:50:36.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
