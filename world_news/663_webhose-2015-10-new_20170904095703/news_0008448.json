However, CLW on Thursday alleged that most of these failings remained unresolved at a Pegatron factory in Shanghai, where one of its investigators spent several weeks working over the past two months. More Western Digital to buy SanDisk for $19bn \nIt alleged that workers received only six hours of safety training instead of the 24 hours required by Chinese law, and claimed that managers at Pegatron had sought to deceive Apple by instructing workers to cheat on tests to assess their understanding of the training. \nOther alleged breaches included a lack of emergency exits and overtime that was compulsory — a practice Apple has vowed to prevent at its suppliers — and, in most cases, well in excess of the Chinese legal limit of 36 hours a month. \nPegatron — which assembles about a quarter of iPhones, according to Nomura — and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nApple’s outsourcing of manufacturing processes to Chinese factories has boosted its margins but left it unable to ensure legal compliance across its supply chain. Since 2007 it has published an annual audit of its suppliers, which has shown varying degrees of progress in key areas. \nIn last year’s audit of 633 factories, Apple found that 92 per cent of employees’ work weeks were no higher than its stipulated maximum of 60 hours — up from 62 per cent in 2007. \nBut 58 per cent of audited factories failed to comply with health and safety communication standards, Apple said. It also uncovered 16 cases of underage workers, and said it had instructed their employers to pay for their education and provide financial compensation. \nIn 2012 Apple signed up to the Fair Labor Association, a non-profit network that has since produced reports on supplier factories including, in June, on a Pegatron factory in Shanghai. It reported breaches in some of the same areas as the CLW report, stating that most workers did more than the legally allowed amount of overtime, and that safety training was inadequate. \nCLW’s report took aim at Apple’s broader policies, saying that its targeted 60-hour work week tended to result in overtime well beyond the Chinese legal limit, while noting that workers at the Pegatron factory would in any case generally have to work long hours because their minimum wage income of $1.85 per hour fell short of a living wage. \n“A portion of Apple’s historical profits is squeezed out of the low pay and illegally poor working conditions of more than a million Chinese workers,” it said.
