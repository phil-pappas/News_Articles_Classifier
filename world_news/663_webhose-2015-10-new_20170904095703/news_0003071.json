Picture: International Animal Rescue \nHOW could anyone do this? \nThese heartbreaking photos show a baby orang-utan who was left in a “filthy cardboard box and left out in the sun to die”. \nNow being nursed back to health, the orang-utan now named Gito, was discovered by the International Animal Rescue in Borneo, it said “it was one of the worst cases of neglect they had ever seen”. \n“Our team in Borneo are currently providing 24-hour intensive care to a baby orang-utan that had been dumped in a filthy cardboard box and left out in the sun to die. He is critically ill, suffering from a highly contagious parasitic skin infection.” \nThe rescue centre believe the baby orang-utan was taken from its mother to be kept in captivity. \n“Gito’s arms were folded corpse-like across his tiny body and he looked almost mummified in his cardboard coffin. Gito had barely any hair on his body and his skin was grey and flaking from sarcoptic mange. The constant itching and pain must have been excruciating.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:28:40.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
