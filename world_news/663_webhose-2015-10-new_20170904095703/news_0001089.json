While there is much to celebrate there is still much more work to be done. A study recently conducted by the RoundTable highlighted many of the challenges that our rural communities and residents face. Rural New Englanders statistically have less access to health insurance and primary care providers. They are far more likely to have gone without a checkup or routine preventive tests within the past 5 years. Higher chronic disease rates and poor dental outcomes are common in our rural communities. Rural residents experience a severe lack of mental and behavioral health resources in comparison with their urban counterparts.”\nDr. Kassler offers more than 25 years of experience in health policy and currently focuses on initiatives to improve health care quality in his role with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will also be joined by other federal officials as part of a Federal Program and Policies Panel.
