The Chinese marketplace had more than 22 million monthly users in Russia, according to researcher TNS.\nAliExpress leads the cross-border e-commerce market in Russia, which was worth 65 billion rubles ($1 billion) in the first half, according researcher Data Insight. The domestic market, where Alibaba hasn’t yet been present, was worth more than four times that at 305 billion rubles, the researcher said.\n“In choosing partners, we focused on categories of goods that are in demand in Russia, and we highlighted Russian brands and companies that manufacture products in Russia,” Mark Zavadskiy, business development director at AliExpress, said in the statement.\nRussians are increasingly turning to Internet shopping to seek best bargains as a recession and weakening ruble have eroded incomes. Chinese sites including AliExpress, JD.com Inc. and others are particularly popular. The volume of e-commerce parcels from China rose 50 percent in the first half, according to the Russian Post.", "external_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/ngg93fn\\", "http://incity.ru/\\"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:32:07.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
