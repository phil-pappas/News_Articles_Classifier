The man's identity hasn't been released, but Petty Officer Lauren Steenson in Kodiak said the sailboat was named La Chimere.\nThe man activated a location beacon on Tuesday about 643km south of Cold Bay, Alaska. The C-130 was dispatched to assess the situation.\nThe airplane crew made radio contact with the mariner, who reported his 9m sailboat lost its rudder and rigging in heavy seas and 46km/h winds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:31:35.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
