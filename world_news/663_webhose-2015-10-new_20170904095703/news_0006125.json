With Vodafones M2M communications at its core, the Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionising the way we communicate, creating new services and innovative products. Studies show that by the year 2020, over 50 billion things will be communicating with one another*, acquiring information that will benefit our everyday lives, help us save on power and ultimately cut costs. Today, Vodafones Global M2M SIM enables content to be updated and managed in real-time anywhere in the world. It is opening up new ways of doing things that we have always taken for granted, and is enabling things we never before thought possible. Partnering with some of the worlds most innovative companies, the breakthrough technology has so far helped create tracking capabilities for elderly patients with dementia and children out to explore the world, solutions for crowded parking problems and overflowing public waste bins, and increased the efficiency of everything from cattle feeders to air travel. As one of the worlds leaders in M2M communications, Vodafone has been developing innovative M2M technology for over 20 years in order to provide business transformation and efficiencies. This is only the beginning.
