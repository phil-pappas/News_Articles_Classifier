The program offers two packages, based on the company’s award-winning platform, Care Navigator™. Care Navigator: Engage and Care Navigator: Activate each offer specific features – like secure texting, video conferencing, photo sharing, knowledge assessments and multimedia education – in a 90- or 180-day program. “Pediatric hospitals serve a special mission to provide highly personalized care to each of their children and families.
