SAN JOSE, Calif., and SINGAPORE, Oct. 22, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avago Technologies (NASDAQ: AVGO ) today announced an industry-first demonstration of a multi-reader HDD read channel in silicon. The multi-reader HDD read channel supports the product development of next-generation HDD controllers with high-performance data rates up to 4.0GHz and enables Array Reader Magnetic Recording (ARMR) targeted at providing areal densities greater than 1.3Tb/in 2 . \nThe Avago multi-reader HDD read channel creates the next inflection point in areal density capability. Capacity gains enabled by multi-reader channels are 10 times greater than prior generation channel technologies. The Avago multi-reader technology is cost-effective, enabling SOC implementation in less silicon area than previous single-reader HDD SOCs. Further, multi-reader technology has no performance limitation, so it can be deployed in all HDD markets, from enterprise to consumer. \n“The Avago multi-reader HDD read channel is a significant engineering accomplishment that will provide HDD makers with the ability to deliver the increasing storage capacities needed to satisfy all storage markets,” said Dan Fisher, vice president of marketing, Data Controller Division at Avago. “We are excited to provide a technology that will enable a single 2U server to increase system capacity by an additional 16Tb. This added capacity can provide storage for an additional 3 million photos or 30,000 user email accounts, all without increasing the power or physical footprint of prior generation platforms.” \nAvago multi-reader channel products are now shipping to customers. \nAbout Avago Technologies \nAvago Technologies is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog, digital, mixed signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems with a focus in III-V compound and CMOS based semiconductor design and processing.
