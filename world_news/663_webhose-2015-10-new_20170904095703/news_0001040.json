The auction began Tuesday with a starting bid of $3 million. \nEugene Area Chamber of Commerce President Dave Hauser, who monitored the auction online, called the $20 million sale price significant, but added he didn't know the identity of the buyer or how the buyer might use the property. \n\"It's a strong enough price that somebody has an idea for (the building's) use,\" Hauser said, adding that a lower price may have meant the buyer considered it a speculative purchase. \nEugene real estate broker John Brown said re-use of the plant \"will be very good for the local economy.\" \n\"Any improvement will only be positive for our local taxing districts. Anyone who pays that much for a facility I'm assuming will retool it and hire locally, so another great thing for the local economy.\" \nDetails of the sale will be available once escrow has closed, according to auction.com. \nIt's not clear when that will happen. \nChicago commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle placed a for-sale flier on the website in early September, calling the Hynix plant \"the largest advanced manufacturing availability in the West.\" \nHynix was one of Lane County's largest private employers from late 1998 until 2008, manufacturing computer memory chips. \nBased in South Korea, Hynix spent about $250 million to buy the west Eugene land and build the factory shell in 1995. \nA glutted chip market and a slowing world economy spelled the plant's doom. \nThe plant's closure, amid the economic crash of 2008, devastated the local economy, putting 1,100 direct employees out of work, along with many contractors and others dependent on the factory. Hynix has continued to own the building. \nSeveral potential buyers have showed interest in the property since the closure, but none has pulled the trigger on a deal until now. \nSouth Korean firm Uni-Chem announced tentative plans in 2009 to convert the Hynix plant into a solar cell manufacturing factory that would employ 1,000 people. But the company never followed through. \nIn 2012, Seattle-based Real Property Investors LLC signed a tentative deal to buy the plant and spend $100 million converting it into a data center and hub for tech businesses. The company said it envisioned 600 workers there, but backed out of the deal three months later. \nThe Hynix property sits in the West Eugene Enterprise zone, which could make the buyer eligible for large property tax breaks on upgrades it made to the site. \nInformation from: The Register-Guard, http://www.registerguard.com \nThink your friends should see this?
