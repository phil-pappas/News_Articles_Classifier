Kongsberg Maritime simulators are built on 40 years of simulation experience. This ensures that its portfolio provides the industry with the most realistic and pedagogically sound simulators, which are also ideal for research and development in addition to pre-mission planning.\nAlgoryx Simulation develops real time physics simulation technologies for integration into maritime simulators, resulting in realistic motion dynamics. Algoryx' physics simulation kernel, AgX Dynamics, can solve millions of physics equation in real time, enabling integrated simulation of the many interacting mechanical components of maritime systems, such as wires, chains, winches, anchors, cranes, engines, drums and more. These simulations are also fully integrated with wind and water dynamics as well as ship hydrodynamics.\nKongsberg Maritime and Algoryx Simulation have already collaborated for eight years. During this time Kongsberg Maritime has delivered the world's most advanced simulator and simulation technologies to training institutes and ship owners worldwide. This collaboration has now been secured in a premium partnership for another five plus five year period of research and development.\n\"From Algoryx' simulation engine, we get unprecedented simulation performance, which contributes to quality and stability in our marine training simulators,\" says Erik Hovland, General Manager Simulation, Kongsberg Maritime. \"The agreement ensures that we can fine-tune our simulator precision and performance whilst adapting to future advanced training requests.\"\n\"We have had a fantastic collaboration with Kongsberg Maritime for the past eight years and we are truly happy to continue this work,\" says Kenneth Bodin, CEO of Algoryx. \"Kongsberg Maritime's experience in maritime simulation combined with our competence in physics simulations have contributed tremendous value to the development of AgX Dynamics. At the same time, I am convinced that our technologies, when used in operator training simulators, have contributed to offshore safety and reduced the number of accidents as well as made many operations more effective and economic.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:04:51.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
