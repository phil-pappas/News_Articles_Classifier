Then we have Motorola Moto X Style which seems to be going the vanilla Android path and will be among the first manufacturer to release their own version of Marshmallow OS. - Advertisement - \nThe Nexus 5X is considered to be the little (and cheaper) brother of Huawei Nexus 6P that we reviewed earlier. We even did a cover on Nexus 6P against Nexus 5X, but for now; let’s turn our attention to the Moto X Style instead. With the same exact price, would the former champion stand its ground – or will it be sucker punched by its much bigger rival. \nThe Nexus 5X, which is expected to be released in the middle of October 2015. It will have a body measurement of 147 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm (5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 in) and weighs just 136 g (4.80 oz). This means that it is indeed slim and light. In terms of protection, there is Gorilla Glass 3 and oleophobic coating to protect it from harm. The fingerprint scanner is placed on the back of your device to complement the way you naturally hold it. Nexus Imprint will turn on your screen with one touch, unlock your apps quickly and easily, and let you breeze through checkout lines. And, by incorporating measurements each time you use it, Nexus Imprint gets smarter with every touch. Sporting a 5.2-inch Full HD screen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density, it will indeed make viewing a pleasure. \nThe Moto X Style is also known as Moto X Pure Edition in the United States. Expected to be released as early as this month and will now be in its 3 rd generation, it has been a huge learning curve and growth for the Moto X. This device will come with a body of 153.9 x 76.2 x 11.1 mm (6.06 x 3.00 x 0.44 in) and weighing in at 179 g (6.31 oz), it certainly isn’t thin though. But with a sleek metal frame and curved back, it feels as amazing as it looks. You can customize it even further with Moto Maker. Pick a soft-grip back and metal accents in your favorite colors or dress it up even more with a premium leather or real wood back. Or personalize it even further by engraving your name on the device. Talking about personalization, this is as close as you can get to having it according to your taste. It will be sporting a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~520 ppi pixel density which really makes for only the most amazing stuff being displayed on the screen. In terms of protection, there’s the Gorilla Glass 3 available. Need more? Now here’s something new the device has a water repellent nano-coating or IP52 certified. Spills, splashes or rain, will no longer ruin your day. \nLarger screen, more resolution, metal frame and the fact that it has a water repellant nano-coating, gives the Moto X Style an edge over the Nexus 5X. Plus, you can even customize it to your heart’s content which is another positive factor. \nLet’s now move on to the performance side of things. Under the hood of the Nexus 5X will be the Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset, a Hexa-core processor Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 & Dual-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 418 graphics, and 2GB RAM. It would have been so much better if it were to have 3GB RAM instead. \nElsewhere on the Moto X Style, it will be equipped with the same Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset. Paired with the same Hexa-core processor comprising a Dual-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A57 & Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53, same Adreno 418 graphics, and 3GB RAM. \nEven though technically everything is the same on both devices except that the Moto X Style has an additional 1GB RAM, they should both perform quite similar to each other. Only on intensive apps and power-hungry games would you see the real benefit of the additional 1GB RAM. But when you have a lean software such as the Marshmallow 6.0, that additional 1GB RAM wouldn’t make much difference by then right? - Advertisement - \nAs always with other Google phones, the emphasis is not that great on the camera side of things. On the Nexus 5X, it comes equipped with a 12.3 Megapixel primary camera and a 5 Megapixel secondary camera. It does, however, shines especially in low-light conditions. Its larger 1.55μm pixels capture more light even in the dimmest of conditions; that can produce stunning details and sharp images. With a faster Google Camera app, you will never miss a moment. It also comes with an app called Google Photos - a new way to store, search, and share all of your photos and videos. Store an unlimited amount of photos and videos at high quality for free, and access them anywhere. Automatically organized and searchable by the people, places, and things in them, your memories are always easy to find and share. \nMeanwhile for the Moto X Style, it will be sporting an amazing 21MP-5MP setup. Capture the moment like never before with the top-rated 21 Megapixel camera. It allows you to capture clear, color-balanced photos quicker than ever. Equipped with the industry-leading 21 MP Sony IMX230 image sensor—the latest and best complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor for mobile phones. Its single-shot Auto High Dynamic Range (HDR) feature overcomes high-contrast environments to create the best photo possible. And with an ƒ/2.0 aperture, the camera gets more light for improved low-light performance. Phase Detection AutoFocus utilizes hundreds of thousands of pixels to ensure incredibly quick focus. And zero shutter lag means there’s no delay between when you touch the screen and the time that the photo is taken. The feature called Best Shot will capture multiple images before and after you touch the screen. Then it recommends the best version, helping avoid blurs, blinks, and other photo fails. And it works for selfies, too. Talking about selfies, with the front camera’s wide-angle range, you will never leave a friend cropped out of a selfie. And a front LED flash will make you look great even in low light. Finally, an absorptive blue glass infrared filter eliminates flare in challenging lighting scenes like campfires and candles. \nThat’s a long list of features that you can find on the Moto X Style, and it completely washes away the Nexus 5X. As we said earlier, Google has never been putting much emphasis to get their camera to be the best, so you should take note of this fact. \nAlso another feature of Google devices (or disadvantage to some) are the unavailability of expansion slots. This is where on the Nexus 5X, you get to choose to go with either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage only. \nOver here on the Moto X Style, you can go for either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB. Since the price difference isn’t that huge between each of them, it makes more sense to get the highest 64GB version, rather than to get yourself a microSD card. Talking about that extra space, just pop in a microSD card and it supports up to a maximum of 128GB. \n16GB is not enough these days, and 32GB is the most comfortable number. By having an expansion slot, the Moto X Style surely has a significant advantage over here. \nBattery-wise, on the Nexus 5 there is a non-removable Li-Po 2700 mAh battery that should help in powering up the device for at least a day in between charging. \nMeanwhile for the Moto X Style, its juice will be supplied by a non-removable 3000 mAh battery. There’s also the innovative TurboPower™ Charging, which gives you up to 10 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes. \nAgain the Moto X Style shines over here by virtue of 10% more higher-rated battery and the fast charging feature that is very useful indeed. \nBut the best thing about getting your hands on the Nexus 5X is definitely on the software. Built to get the best out of the world's most popular OS, Nexus is the ultimate Android experience. You're always among the first to receive software and security updates. And you'll have the freshest, fastest version — Android 6.0 Marshmallow — working for you right out of the box. It also comes with the best Google apps pre-installed, so it's ready to use right out of the box. Search, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Gmail, Drive, and so much more ready for you to enjoy on your phone. No bloatware and no unnecessary apps or games that will hamper this device and slows it down. You get to choose what you want out of it. \nThat is the advantage that the Nexus 5X has over the Moto X Style for the time being. We say for the time being is because it currently is running on Android Lollipop 5.1.1, but it doesn’t just stop there. This device will surely be among the earliest that will get its Marshmallow version of the OS. But for the next few months, the Nexus 5X has that bragging rights, though. - Advertisement - \nThe LG Nexus 5X has its pros and cons and is not for camera purists. Then you have also to make do with its rather limited storage with no expansion slot. But if you can live with these few constraints, then it makes for a great pure vanilla experience, exactly how Google wants it to be. No bloatware, no unnecessary apps installed – the fastest device yet without the need for extremely high specs. \nThe benefit of a metal body, additional 1GB RAM, better camera, an expansion slot, bigger battery and a promise of getting the latest Marshmallow OS; makes for everything that you can wish for from the Motorola Moto X Style. With the price being similar, you should be getting this instead. \nLG Nexus 5X is expected to be on sale in the middle of this month, and the 16GB version is expected to be available for $399 USD. It will be available in Carbon, Quartz and Ice colors. \nThe Motorola Moto X Style is expected to be released as early as this month for a price of $399.99 for the 16GB model, $449.99 for the 32GB model and $499.99 for the 64GB model.
