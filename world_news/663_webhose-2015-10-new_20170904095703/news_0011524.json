He added that the fund initially had $1 million to play with.\nJoining Brad Shofer as founding investors are Gary Burg, resident director and co-founder at Global Capital Holdings, as well as capital markets expert Neil Hessen, angel investor Michael Kadoury and former Investec chief executive Sam Leon.\nThe first company to receive seed investment from Rimon is Premonition — a software company aiming to disrupt the logistics industry with a technology platform called Foodbank Local.\nCo-founder Brad Lorge said Foodbank Local used artificial intelligence and real-time data to connect donors and charities and improve logistics in the foodbanking sector. An app allows donors to snap and share a photo of their food, and charities can then browse what’s available and choose what they need, with the platform handling allocation, scheduling and routing behind the scenes. It has partnered with several major supermarket and charity groups.\n“We realised we needed a long-term, sustainable approach to building this technology,” he said.\n“We needed the capital to invest in a longer-term vision, something that would have a longer impact and we needed a group of partners to join us on that quite ambitious journey.\n“Brad (Shofer) has read the winds better than almost everyone in Australia, having founded MYOB and then becoming an early investor in Xero, he’s been incredible for our business.”\nAccording to Mr Stein, Rimon Investments has four start-ups in its pipeline but is looking to meet entrepreneurs to invest in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:43:06.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
