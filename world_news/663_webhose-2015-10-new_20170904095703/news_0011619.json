CIBC hopes to improve its agility by allowing select employees to work outside of the constraints of the traditional banking environment, says David Williamson, the head of CIBC's retail and business banking division. \nAt CIBC's Mars lab, co-op students and other staff undertake sprints — \"fuelled by pizza and Xbox\" — that produce completed concepts in just a few weeks, Williamson said. For example, the concept for CIBC's Apple Watch app was developed in around six weeks, Williamson said. \nThe bank has been using the space to experiment with a variety of new technologies, including voice authentication similar to Apple's Siri, that would allow customers to use their voices not only to access their accounts but also to perform a variety of tasks such as pay bills, transfer money and even seek advice about budgeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:22:35.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
