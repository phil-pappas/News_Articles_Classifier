ST. LOUIS, MO October 10,   ArchitectNow, a software development firm, is pleased to announce that Microsoft has recently honored President Kevin Grossnicklaus with Microsoft's Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award for the seventh year in a row. Each year, Microsoft selects between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals around the world to receive this prestigious award. An invitation-only award, the MVP Award is given in recognition of community leaders and thought leaders with a focus on their specific products. Recipients are recognized for the contributions to the communities surrounding several consumer and developer focused Microsoft product areas including Microsoft Office, Microsoft Azure, Windows 10, Xbox, Visual Studio and Developer tools, and more. While there is no benchmark in selecting MVP Award recipients, Microsoft hand selects community leaders who have demonstrated an exemplary commitment to helping others get the most out of their experience with Microsoft's many technologies. These select few share their passion, real-world knowledge, and technical expertise with the community and also with Microsoft itself. Microsoft has been honoring exemplary talent with these awards for more than two decades as a way to thank independent community leaders for all that they do in assisting others. Recipients obtain access to behind-the scenes support, exclusive information, and an invitation to attend the yearly MVP Global Summit in Redmond, Wash., where they collaborate closely with Microsoft resources and other MVPs related to their areas of expertise. About Microsoft's MVP Global Summit The summit is a multi-day event that is hosted in Bellevue and also at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. With a large catalog of technical sessions and a wide variety of networking opportunities, the event enables MVPs to connect with other MVPs, foster relationships with Microsoft product managers, and provide feedback on current and future Microsoft products and technologies. This event is exclusive to MVPs awarded during a specific year, and much of the content presented is under a strict NDA with Microsoft.&#8232; About ArchitectNow ArchitectNow is a software development firm based in St. Louis.
