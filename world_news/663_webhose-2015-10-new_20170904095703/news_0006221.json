The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 1.46 points to 2,014.89 and the Nasdaq composite rose 19.68 points to 4,830.47.\nThe S&P 500 ended the week up 3.3 percent, its best week since mid-December. Global markets also had a strong week, with markets in Germany and France rising more than 5 percent. In Asia, markets in Japan, China and Hong Kong are up roughly 4 percent each.\nMost of the gains this week came immediately following the release of last week’s disappointing jobs report, which sent a signal to investors that the Federal Reserve would hold off on raising interest rates at least for several more months. That signal was reinforced Thursday, when the minutes from the September Fed meeting showed policymakers are too concerned about low inflation and the slowdown in China to raise interest rates.\n“In short, we found little to change our view that the first Fed hike will not occur in 2015 (and the) market has reached the same conclusion,” wrote Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of fixed-income at Barclays, in a report.\nOne sector that did push higher was airlines. The companies said they flew nearly full flights last month, an important profit driver for the industry. United Continental flew flights on average 82.9 percent full; while American Airlines reported its flights were 82.7 percent full.\nUnited Continental rose 6.6 percent, American rose 6.7 percent, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines added 3 percent each.\nOne industrial company that did not do well was Alcoa, the aluminum company, which fell 75 cents, or 7 percent, to $10.26. The company reported a steep drop in profits for its third quarter, citing lower aluminum prices and a strong U.S. dollar.\nInvestors are now positioning themselves for corporate earnings, which pick up steam next week with most of the nation’s largest banks report their results, as well as Intel, Netflix, UnitedHealth and General Electric. \nStocks rally \n\nOn Friday: \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.74 points to close at 17,084.49.\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 index added 1.46 points to 2,014.89.\nThe Nasdaq composite rose 19.68 points to 4,830.47.\nFor the week: \nThe Dow is up 3.7 percent.\nThe S&P 500 index is up 3.3 percent.\nThe Nasdaq is up 2.6 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:28:54.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
