Though similar to R-134a, R-40 reacts with aluminium to form trimethylaluminum, a highly volatile substance that, when exposed to air, can explode. \nAccording to international insurer TT Club, R-40 contamination accounts for 0.2% of the world’s reefer container fleet, affecting around 2,500 reefers. \nSome operators may be unaware of the potential risks of using counterfeit refrigerants, while others may be seeking to cut costs. However, the main reason these refrigerants continue to circulate is because of the continued existence of disposable cylinders. \nSvenn Jacobsen, Technical Product Manager of Refrigeration at Wilhelmsen Ships Services, said: “These cylinders are the container of choice for the counterfeiter. Cheap and untraceable, no counterfeiter is ever going to get any complaints from their customers using this type of packaging.” \nJacobsen explains that counterfeiters offer what appear to be authentic, trademarked refrigerants. Despite the efforts of leading manufacturers such as Honeywell, Linde and Dupont, which have taken legal action to crack down on counterfeiters and changed packaging to discourage fakes, counterfeit refrigerants remain an industry menace. \nJacobsen continues: “If the legitimate refrigerant suppliers no longer provided refrigerants in disposable cylinders, the counterfeiters would be out of business. We don’t support their use and we believe a worldwide ban is far overdue.” \nWhether or not a global ban on disposable cylinders will come into force anytime soon is unclear. In 2007, the European Union (EU) banned disposable refrigerant cylinders in the EU and on EU flagged vessels. However, disposable refrigerant cylinders are still in use elsewhere in the world. \nWhile Jacobsen applauds the EU’s move to reduce the environmental impact of R-134a refrigerants, he cautions that these regulations may inadvertently create a strong market for suppliers of counterfeit refrigerants. \nHe said: “It is likely that the reduction in the supply of EU HFCs [hydrofluorocarbon] will lead to shortages and a sharp spike in costs, meaning some operators will be tempted to purchase lower-price refrigerants. This regulatory change will create an ideal market for counterfeiters. \nJacobsen concluded: “Despite numerous warnings, accidents and fatalities, many operators will be more willing to take a chance on gases packaged in disposable cylinders by unregistered suppliers. We anticipate that the counterfeiters of R-134a are going to be very busy in the years ahead.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:50:34.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
