Gurgaon is perhaps the only complying district in the country, says Deputy Commissioner TL Satya Prakash. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (SHW) Law requires updating the authorities about such cases in addition to steps taken to comply with the law. The companies who sent in their reports include IT major Accenture, Hotel Hilton, Pepper Fry and Minda Group of Management Services. The Deputy Commissioner said all companies were asked to file their reports by August 2015 and these reports were analysed by the Society for Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Child Abuse. \"Awareness about implementation of this law is quite low,\" said Society president Dr Surabhi Dhingra. The preliminary analysis found that nearly 63% companies claimed they had been time and again trained about the issue, though a majority failed to practise what was taught. Nearly 93% companies also claimed that they had received no such complaint in 2014 and 2015. The rest who received complaints claimed that most of these were disposed of within stipulated 90 days. \"The aim of this initiative is to demystify the law. Compliance will also help male employees who at times are harassed with fake complaints,\" said Satya Prakash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:04:56.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
