Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (Caanz) chief executive Lee White said this week that roughly 46 per cent of jobs in New Zealand were at risk from automation in the next 20 years and Kiwis were underestimating the impact that would have. READ MORE:* Eight jobs that no longer exist thanks to technology \nThe New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER), which helped Caanz with this research, predicted in its analysis that rural workers and men were most likely to be displaced by technology. \nService sector roles had a greater presence in big cities and were less susceptible to automation, while men were over-represented in at-risk occupations like transport, construction and manufacturing. SUPPLIED \nPWC partner Scott McLiver says technology has allowed him to give better advice to clients and thinks it is only going to get better. \nThe most at-risk were therefore labourers, with almost 143,000 possible jobs at risk, followed by machinery operators and drivers, with 68,000 jobs at risk. \nSome short term economic disruption could be expected from these job losses, the impact of technology in the long run would greatly benefit the economy, NZIER principal economist Aaron Drew said. \n\"Technological progress does lift living standards, improves the range of goods and services people can buy, health outcomes,\" he said. Is your job on the way out? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nA case study in the report looked at driverless cars, which were expected to minimise human error and therefore reduce car accidents. \nThey would also decrease congestion and improve efficiency in road networks, meaning less money spent on roading. \nDrew said there were two types of skills sets that were less at risk of automation: ones which rely heavily on having good social skills, so teaching and social work for example, and ones that blend good technical skills with good social skills. \nHe said New Zealand was well-placed to handle any of the predicted changes. \n\"We've got a pretty resilient economy, a flexible labour and product market and we're on a technological frontier,\" he said \n\"We can be confident in the medium to long runs that those technological changes will be beneficial.\" \nCHANGE, NOT LOSS \nCareers NZ principal careers adviser Pat Cody said reports about jobs coming, going and changing have gone around the world many times over - it was just now, this was happening at a faster and more unpredictable rate. \nHe also believed jobs were not necessarily disappearing but rather, morphing. \n\"Globalisation and technology create jobs. Five years ago, did we have a social media intern, UX designer, data scientist, digital marketer? No, but we probably had similar equivalents,\" he said. \nCody said good numeracy, literacy, computer skills, interpersonal skills, ability to collaborate and being able to solve problems formed an essential foundation to build transferable skills. \nHaving the ability to adapt to change, learn and personal resilience to ride out the fluidity of the employment market were also important, he said. \nPROBLEM AND SOLUTION \nDiscussions about technology generating unemployment have been around since the beginning of the 70s, according to Auckland University of Technology professor of work and employment Erling Rasmussen. \nWhile the rate at which jobs were disappearing or changing seemed to be increasing, Rasmussen said it was important to put that into context. \n\"The reality is that the paid workforce has actually grown in nearly all OECD countries. While some jobs aren't featuring so much anymore it doesn't mean people aren't working,\" he said. \n\"You can't have people who are experts in the cloud if you don't have the cloud, so there's a whole lot of new jobs coming out.\" \nRasmussen said education was both a key and problem to navigating the murky waters. \n\"If you don't know what jobs are going to be in 20 years, how can we educate people?\" he said. \nOne way was to constantly keep an eye on the market and try and pick up on all the changing demands for certain skills and education and for employers to be willing to invest in the continuous retraining of staff. \nBut Rasmussen's greatest concern was a disconnect between education providers and employers, particularly in the lack of education and employment of young people. \n\"If there's a dislocation [between education providers and employers] then we will have to go through periods of higher than necessary unemployment and we will have longer periods in terms of retraining people,\" he said. \n\"To limit that impact we would have to continuously retrain, re-educate and readjust people's expectations.\" \nEMBRACING TECHNOLOGY \nThe Caanz report showed automation threatened the jobs of about 16,500 accountants but for PWC partner Scott McLiver, technology was by far an enabler and provider of opportunities. \nMcLiver started his career as an accountant and said while much of the traditional accounting work - like bank reconciliations - was no longer done by people, technology has allowed him to provide better services and advice to clients. \nClients themselves were now able to produce their own quality financial information that advisers could then provide insight and tax advice around. \n\"Current tasks that accountants do for clients, they will be made obsolete over time but I don't think it means there's not going to be a need for business advisers assisting clients to have more successful businesses,\" McLiver said. \n\"We're really excited about the technology because it enables us to do what we enjoy and what our clients value, which is value-added, strategic insights - the insights around growing the business and managing risk and being more successful.\" \nHe said there was still so much to be discovered in terms of analysing and using data, particularly big data - and he reckoned it would be a \"game changer\". \n\"We're only at the tip of the iceberg,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:50:18.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
