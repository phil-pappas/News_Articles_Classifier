The services will be delivered via a combined on-site, onshore and offshore model using the Fujitsu Global Delivery Centre as well as local resources.\nLink Group also aims to optimise IT spend across all entities to minimise risk and obtain cost efficiencies.\nLink Group managing director John McMurtie said the decision to continue a proven relationship with Fujitsu would deliver the best value for IT spend over the next five years.\n“In addition, we will continue to work with Fujitsu to ensure the highest standards relative to the security of data,’’ he said. “With the assurance of predictable IT costs delivered by this new services agreement, Link Group can better plan over the medium term.’’\nFujitsu Australia and New Zealand chief executive officer Mike Foster said the two companies had already shared a 10-year history.\n“We are committed to our expanded role and to creating value for Link through innovation, reduction of risk and continuous improvement aligned with the Fujitsu Technology and Service Vision,’’ he said.\nLink Group, whose customers include some of Australia’s largest superannuation funds and the world’s biggest corporations, expects to realise significant annual savings in IT spending across the business under the deal with Fujitsu.\nThe Group has acquired more than 35 local and international companies since 2004 and the recent acquisition of Superpartners almost doubled the size of the business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:43:33.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
