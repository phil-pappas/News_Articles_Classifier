Contractors that already have a PPC program should consider this, too. It will supplement the sales leads you already generate. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277510 \nFlat Rate Pricing Per Phone Lead \nContractors will benefit from having a known cost to make the phone ring with sales leads . In Phoenix, there will be two price tiers. The Gold Program starts at $50 per call and the Silver Program at $35 per call. Call MicroManaged Media for details. Contractors may participate in both programs. \nWhy We Made an Alternative to Adwords Self-Management \nBut, how can you make the phone ring at a cost you can afford? Word-of-mouth advertising doesn't cut it. The yellow pages in the phone book is a complete waste of money and presents a long term commitment. Any program that requires a long term commitment could bring a small contractor down. It's a risk they can't afford. \nPay-Per-Click advertising has become the go to tool for contractors. Most small HVAC and plum bing contractors have tried it, but failed for many reasons. \nThe Problem With Pay-Per-Click Advertising: It's Expensive and Time Consuming! \nPay per click advertising has gotten very complicated and expensive. Many small contractors attempt to do Pay Per Click advertising only to fail miserably. Google / Bing / Yahoo have made Pay-Per-Click advertising so complicated that it requires your full attention and a great deal of experience. \nPay-Per-Click ads require constant maintenance. \"Set it and forget it\" is not going to work. Pay-Per-Click a battle every day and the battle lines change constantly. You need a team effort. \nHibu, Reachlocal, etc. will set up a pay per click program for you, but the results usually don't measure up. Their model is not transparent. The contractor never knows what was actually spent on the PPC (Pay-Per-Click) campaign. \nLarge electrical, HVAC, and plumbing contractors excel at Pay Per Click because they can afford to hire the experienced, full time specialists to manage their campaign. They can afford a call center. Now small contractors can, too! \nOur Team Approach \nThe small contractors at an incredible disadvantage. Small contractors cannot spend that much time and effort on a Pay Per Click campaign. After all, they have a business to run. Pay Per Call is the solution. \nWhat is Pay-Per-Call Advertising? \nWhen it comes to pay per call advertising, you don't pay for the clicks. You only pay for valid calls. All calls are tracked and recorded. They ring directly through to your office and are answered by your staff. \nIf you don't have a staff to answer calls and book appointments, our Team concept will help you there, too. Call for details and prices. \nThere are very few companies out there that have a service like this because it is so difficult to do. That is why Micromanage Media is pleased to announce they are launching a Pay-Per-Call program for the plumbers and air conditioning repair contractors in the Phoenix Arizona area, including Tempe, Mesa, Gilbert, Chandler, Glendale, Sun City, Surprise, Peoria, Sun Lakes and more. \nGet the Phone Ringing for a Fixed Price \nFlat rate pricing for leads are the answer for contractors of all sizes: \nLarger Contractors - Your company may have its own Pay-Per-Click program. This is a supplement to your marketing efforts. \nSmall Contractors - Pay-Per-Call advertising places a cap on the spend per lead that you will find affordable, returning an acceptable ROI. In some cases, this is the only advertising campaign of any type you'll ever need. \nAvailability in Phoenix is Limited, Get On Waiting List \nMicroManaged Media, Inc., a plumbing and heating and air conditioning contractor marketing agency, has just launched a Pay-Per-Call program for the Phoenix, AZ area.
