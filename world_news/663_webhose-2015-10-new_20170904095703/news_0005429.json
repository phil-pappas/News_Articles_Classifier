The aim is for every citizen to have broadband connection. Telkom sees Openserve paving the way for the democratisation of broadband.\n\"I personally envisage a South Africa where, like water and electricity, broadband should be within everyone’s reach. It should be open to access,\" said Mr Maseko.\nBMI-TechKnowledge MD Denis Smit said this was long overdue, but that the devil was in the detail as to what extent Openserve would be able to make independent and transparent decisions on strategy and pricing. This could, however, open up a broader consolidation, possibly in the fixed-line wholesale industry and movement towards some form of national broadband network, he said.\nBut this would take some time to evolve.\nThe decision to spin off the wholesale business into a stand-alone unit comes three years after the group agreed with the Competition Commission — which found it guilty of anticompetitive behaviour — to implement a functional separation of the wholesale and retail businesses. Such a decision was meant to enable management to be transparent about its pricing to its clients, especially internet service providers.\nBut Telkom says that unlike its international counterparts, the spinoff was not forced by the regulators. UK’s BT created a separate wholesale business called Openreach about 10 years ago, to house the infrastructure division of BT Group. This came after an agreement between BT and UK regulator Ofcom to ensure rivals got equal access to the operator’s network.", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=TKG"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:21:37.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
