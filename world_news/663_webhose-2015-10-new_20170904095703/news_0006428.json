Photo: Christopher Pearce\nMore public service news The new federal agency tasked with shaking up the way the public service deals with 24 million Australians has announced an ambitious work schedule that will start in the nation's capital.\nThe Digital Transformation Office will begin by trying to lessen overcrowding and cut waiting times for public patients needing non-urgent medical treatment in the ACT, as well as at a national level attempting to reduce confusion for businesses, particularly importers.\nDTO chief executive Paul Shetlerâ€‹ said his agency would work with the ACT government to improve the appointment booking system for the territory's seven community health centres used by 660,000 patients a year.\nAdvertisement \"When we say citizens shouldn't need to understand the structures of government, we also mean they shouldn't need to know the tiers of government responsibility as well,\" Mr Shetler said.\n\"We are working with states and territories, starting with the ACT government, to transform services across all levels of government.\"\nThe DTO will work with three of the federal bureaucracy's biggest departments, Immigration and Border Protection, Human Services and the Australian Taxation Office, in its first phase of projects.\nThe DTO wants to make it easier for businesses dealing with the Immigration Department to complete import declarations.\nImmigration processes more than 3.5 million import declarations annually and this number is expected to increase.\n\"We'll work together with our industry partners to improve the current arrangements for the management of the importation of goods across the border,\" Mr Shetler said.\nHis organisation would help change the way 600,000 people a year registered for Medicare and was working with the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, in collaboration with the ATO, to simplify business registrations.\n\"There are over 2 million businesses actively trading in Australia today and that number is growing steadily,\" Mr Shetler said.\n\"Currently, there are around 700,000 new businesses registered each year.\n\"Getting a new business off the ground can be tough at the best of times, and it's not something you do every day.\n\"To ensure we don't make it any more complicated than it needs to be, we're working to streamline business registrations: improving compliance, minimising errors and reducing frustration.\nHe said more than half of the 2.5 million Australians who looked up government information and services online each month would experience a problem.\n\"Chances are, it's happened to you,\" Mr Shetler said.\n\"Many departments are improving their services individually, but we can still improve our approach to design and delivery overall so that the public isn't forced to wade through several different websites just to do what they need to do.\n\"Our vision is that everyone who needs to use government services should be able to find what they need quickly and easily.\"\nA recent DTO survey found the public service was not as good at dealing with the public as the private sector, a point that did not surprise Mr Shetler, who, on taking up the job, said the government was \"failing\" its customers .\nAbout three-quarters of people and businesses agreed they could do basic transactions with the federal government via digital options.\nHowever, only 60 per cent of people and 67 per cent of businesses agreed they could successfully do all their interactions on digital devices.\nThe DTO survey found there was \"still a long way to go\" with only 7 per cent describing digital services as a superior way to deal with the government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:19:56.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
