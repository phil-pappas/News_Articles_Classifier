(Photo: USA TODAY)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE After five years of patent disputes, Google and Microsoft have cast their lawsuits aside, instead focusing on patent reform and video technologies. Newslook\nSAN FRANCISCO — Technology investors brave enough to still be looking for fourth-quarter investment ideas may want to look to the leaders left standing among the third-quarter rout in tech shares.\nAmong the 20 most-valuable U.S. public tech stocks, two companies stood out for their outsized returns during three months when most tech stocks suffered double-digit losses and the Nasdaq fell more than 7%.\nGoogle shares surged 19% during the third quarter, as a new CFO signaled tighter spending discipline, while Amazon leaped 18% after it entered a slew of new markets.\nGoogle’s valuation gain of $65 billion the day after its second-quarter earnings report was among the 20 largest one-day surges in the history of U.S. markets, according to Ned Davis Research.\nOne other notable gainer in the quarter has also been a tech-stock leader all year. Netflix shares rose 10%, putting it among the Top 25 most valuable tech firms for the first time, at a valuation of $44 billion.\nAmazon is now among the five-most valuable U.S. tech firms for the first time.\nAmazon and Google have been market leaders for six months among big-cap tech shares, as we’ve tracked here for this quarterly column.\nSo has Facebook, whose shares rose 5% during an otherwise very bad quarter for tech investors.\nThe biggest loser among the big-caps in both share price and total valuation was Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.\nThe one-year anniversary of its record-breaking IPO in mid-September was not a bullish party, as the stock sank 28% in three months.\nIt shed a massive $41 billion in market value, costing dearly the portfolios of those who overpaid for an otherwise fast-growing and profitable company.\nBut Alibaba was not alone in suffering from worldwide jitters over China’s economic growth and the plunging price of oil, usually a leading indicator of world economic growth.\nApple, Oracle, Samsung, IBM, Qualcomm and Vodafone all saw their respective shares drop by double- digit percentages.\nStocks don’t go down for no reason, even though they often seem to, as the late, great Yogi Berra might have said if he was foolish enough to cover Wall Street, instead of home plate. (RIP Yogi.)\nThe third quarter was a comeuppance for global GDP bulls, as the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for worldwide growth to 3.3%, from 3.5%.\nIf the forecast is accurate, the global economy will grow less than the 3.4% it grew in 2014.\nThis week, Goldman Sachs cuts its estimate for S&P 500 earnings and trimmed its year-end target for the index by 4.3% to 2,000, from 2,100 previously.\nSome-sized economic deceleration is coming, stocks are telling us, so I'd be playing defense if I had an actively-managed portfolio. (I don't, since I'm an index-only investor.)\nBut for those who can't resist buying stocks even while stocks are falling, Google, Amazon and Facebook, based on their status as market leaders for at least several quarters, are likely to hurt your portfolio the least.\n.\nA more prudent strategy would be to wait until the overall direction of the market improves before wading back in as a buyer.\nTop-five valuable tech companies, Q3 stock returns:\nApple, $629 billion, -12%\nGoogle, $491 billion, +19%\nMicrosoft, $346 billion, flat\nFacebook, $259 billion, +5%\nAmazon, $244 billion, +18%\nFollow USA TODAY columnist John Shinal on Twitter: @johnshinal.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1KPFut0 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4522496075001_thumb-Mobilenewslook891290.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4522496075001_thumb-Mobilenewslook891290.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1KPFut0", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KPFut0&text=Tech%20investors%20look%20to%20market%20leaders%20amid%20the%20storm&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1edfe4864adabdff309592f03431843d249fc2ab/r=257x400/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/23/1377285262000-XXX-IMG-IWK23TWEETIMG-1-1-984TMTOK.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0537e999e18d2f131ffb200fe8938f7251daf00a/c=0-0-1000-1323&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/23/1377285262000-XXX-IMG-IWK23TWEETIMG-1-1-984TMTOK.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/09/29906170001_4522496075001_thumb-Mobilenewslook891290.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1FHFSuQ", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KPFut0&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/08/23/1377285262000-XXX-IMG-IWK23TWEETIMG-1-1-984TMTOK.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-01T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:59:08.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
