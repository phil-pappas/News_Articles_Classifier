Scott Barbour by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald With James Packer's Crown Resorts receiving planning approvals from Nevada authorities for its $4 billion Las Vegas casino, attention has turned to how it will finance its share of the resort, dubbed Alon.\nCrown took an initial 73 per cent stake in the Alon Leisure Management entity. But given its bulging pipeline of projects scattered throughout Australia and Asia, it's now moving to sell down that stake to raise equity for its ambitious Vegas plans.\nSources said Crown advisers Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse approached institutional investors in Asia last week, testing appetite for an 11.5 per cent stake for about $350 million.\nIt should be noted the equity raising is at the project [and not the headstock] level. A similar-sized equity chunk could be offloaded early next year depending on demand from institutional or strategic investors for the first tranche, sources said.\nBoth Packer and Crown's newly installed chairman, former Deutsche banker Rob Rankin, are treading carefully when it comes to Vegas. Packer lost $US2 billion ($2.76 billion) during the 2008 credit crisis from poorly timed North American investments while Deutsche took over the Cosmopolitan casino in Vegas the same year before selling it for a loss in 2014 to Blackstone.\nBond investors are understood to be comfortable with Crown's debt position despite it jumping 47 per cent to $2.5 billion during the 2015 financial year. The company's credit rating is solid - Standard & Poors has it at BBB while Moody's is Baa2; outlook stable.\nDeutsche and Credit Suisse have also started testing US debt markets to fund Alon. While initial feedback had been muted, it's expected that the credentials of Packer and his partners on Alon - former Wynn boss Andrew Pascal along with Oaktree Capital - will get a deal over the line.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:33:14.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
