As government agencies prepare to resettle these refugees in communities nationwide, Stratus Video Interpreting —a leading provider of on-demand interpretation services—urges healthcare administrators to be ready to meet the rising need for medical interpreters among refugee patients with limited English proficiency (LEP).\nWhile current U.S. policies cap the total number of refugees from all nations at 70,000 per year, human rights activists and some members of Congress are calling for the administration to substantially raise that limit (1). A group of senators urged the president to heed Refugee Council USA’s recommendation to resettle at least 65,000 Syrian refugees next year (2), and government officials have discussed raising the refugee cap to 100,000 per year (1).\nWhether the final number of Syrian refugees accepted remains at current levels or increases, hospitals and healthcare providers nationwide will likely begin seeing more Arabic-speaking LEP patients. Of the 18,000 cases the United Nations has already referred for U.S. resettlement, many are torture survivors and individuals with special medical needs, and more than half are children (1).\n“Government regulations require healthcare facilities to provide equal language access for LEP patients, so most already offer interpretation services. However, they may not have in-house resources to meet the predicted surge in demand for Arabic-speaking medical interpreters,” explained David Fetterolf, President of Stratus Video Interpreting.\nFetterolf proposes on-demand healthcare interpretation services as a convenient and affordable solution for healthcare providers that do not have certified Arabic-speaking healthcare interpreters on staff and for those requiring supplemental interpretation support. He emphasizes that video remote interpreting (VRI) combines the benefits of onsite interpreters—including access to visual cues and the ability to follow patients throughout a facility via mobile technology—with the immediacy and affordability of over-the-phone interpretation (OPI), offering interpreter access in less than 30 seconds and a low cost-per-minute.\n“Many refugees have endured unspeakable horrors of war, so compassion and comfort become an essential part of delivering quality care to those patients,” explained Fetterolf. “At Stratus, we aim to give a voice to voiceless by providing information, comfort, advocacy and support, and enabling people from different cultures to connect in a simple, immediate and meaningful way. We are committed to helping improve the physical and emotional health of LEP patients and helping refugees overcome past traumas as they forge a new life here.”\nStratus provides certified healthcare interpreter services in nearly 200 languages, including Syria’s official language of Arabic and the Kurdish language spoken by Syrian Kurds. The company also features video remote interpreting for more than a dozen commonly spoken languages, and offers Arabic VRI with extended hours.\nFor more information on Stratus and its video remote interpreting services for limited English proficient patients, visit http://www.stratusvideo.com .\nAbout Stratus Video Interpreting:\nStratus Video Interpreting provides on-demand interpreter services by using technology to connect clients with interpreters in over 175 spoken and signed languages in less than 30 seconds.
