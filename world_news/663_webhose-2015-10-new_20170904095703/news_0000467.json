The study approached several hundred CIOs working across a range of industry sectors in Australia.\nThe data found the ranking of priorities for the year ahead was: cyber security, followed by digital, big data/information, mobility and cloud services.\nMichael Page NSW technology director Niall O’Rourke said digital transformation needed to be the main business improvement project for 2015.\n“If you are not under way with digitalisation then you are going to fall behind. That is just the nature of the beast,’’ he said. “Every organisation, no matter what industry sector you are in, needs to go down that digital route.’’\nThe survey found that, compared with the previous year, budgets have increased for 43 per cent of CIOs, while 37 per cent of respondents said it remained the same, and 22 per cent saw a ­decrease. The top challenges or concerns for CIOs were: budget/costs, security, talent manage-ment/staffing and aligning with business strategy.\nMore than 70 per cent of CIOs believed that in terms of the scope of their role, they were making decisions that affected the overall company strategy. Another 67 per cent said this had increased in the past five years.\n“I think nowadays the role of a CIO is not just to improve technology, it’s more about how can they increase revenue or how can they increase the overall operational performance of the business,’’ Mr O’Rourke said.\nSome 47 per cent of CIOs expect the number of technology staff in their organisation to increase over the next 12 months, while 41 per cent believe the headcount would remain the same and 12 per cent said it would decrease. “It (hiring) would be around purely project-related areas so transformation, cloud services and digitalisation,’’ Mr O’Rourke said. He said there was now a split of about 60-40 between day rate contracting and fixed-term contracting depending on the industry sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:23:01.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
