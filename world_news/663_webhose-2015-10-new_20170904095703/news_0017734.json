As with Semarchy’s popular Master Data Management (MDM) solution, customers can gain value from this RDM solution in days using a unique agile approach to Reference Data Management. RDM is available for cloud based deployments on AWS where it is the most popular RDM and MDM solution offered. Convergence 3.2 delivers on the company’s promise to provide fast return on investment (ROI) and reduce project costs and risks, while providing an outstanding user experience. \nThere is an increasing need for accurate and predictable reference data. Data such as country codes, currencies, organization (NAICS) and product (UNSPSC) classification standards is critical to provide meaning to all other data. Without consistent and trusted reference data, business teams cannot rely on their decision-making analysis. With well-managed reference and master data, operational business teams can simplify project management, collaborate with partners, avoid duplicated manual effort, create audit trails, and more importantly, comply with regulations. \n“ Reference data is a critical component in any company’s master data initiative, ” says Malcolm Chisholm, ‎Senior Partner with First San Francisco Partners. “ Without a good reference data strategy and implementation, companies are not maximizing their information assets. There has been a surge in the popularity of managing reference data as companies see the value of well managed information. Good reference data needs to be the foundation for all enterprises; without it they are leaving money on the table. ” \nSemarchy’s RDM solution is immediately available and can be deployed in the cloud and on premises. The solution inherits the same agile approach that Semarchy created for its highly successful Convergence product suite. “ The value associated with agile development has been well documented, but RDM and MDM implementation processes have been slow to adopt agile techniques, until now. Recently multiple agile MDM/RDM methodologies have surfaced, ” said Aaron Zornes, Chief Research Officer of the MDM Institute. “ A model-based, agile approach such as Semarchy’s enables companies to deliver value quickly and continue to provide timely value as businesses evolves. ” \nTo support Semarchy’s vision of driving value quickly and empowering the business, Semarchy Convergence 3.2 provides a more powerful and sophisticated matching engine to support the most complex use cases. It also adds capabilities for self-service data stewardship which increase business user productivity. \n“ Our company continues to expand its worldwide footprint, and the last three months are indicative of the market’s acceptance of our unique agile approach to MDM and now RDM. We are the number one rated solution on AWS Marketplace, ” said Salah Kamel, President and CEO of Semarchy. “ We are also proud to have been chosen to participate in Amazon’s initial roll-out of the AWS BI and Big Data Digital Library initiative. With the introduction of our RDM solution, we are expanding our enterprise class solution portfolio and building on 100% growth year over year we have experienced the past three years. \" Semarchy is sponsoring the RDM track at this week’s MDM and Data Governance Summit in New York City sponsored by Source Media. At this 10th annual summit, Semarchy will be demonstrating its RDM solution at this conference held at the New York Hilton Midtown. \nAbout Semarchy Semarchy provides master data value in weeks not months, using an agile, value-driven approach to design and manage master and reference data.
