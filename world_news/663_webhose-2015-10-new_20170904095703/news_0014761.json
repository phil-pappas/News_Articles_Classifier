This has been a huge trend for a while, and it just seems to be growing and growing. You can’t go onto any social media website without seeing a load of selfies from your friends and family members. Unfortunately, not all selfies are good. Here are the tricks you need to use to make sure that you take the best selfies. High-Quality Smartphone Camera \nOne of the most important things to think about when it comes to getting great selfies is the quality of the camera you are using. No one wants to see crappy photos that are grainy and are low in photo quality. Even your grandmother will get fed up with looking at those bad photos after a while, no matter how much she pretends to like them. \nThe best option is to be able to get the latest smartphones, such as the iPhone 6, which has a super-high quality, 8-megapixel camera built in. This phone also uses iSight and True Tone flash technology, so you get the best selfies even if you aren’t in the best lighting situation. It also uses algorithms to determine how much light should be used to make sure that you get the perfect exposure every time. The newer the technology you are using, the better your selfies are ultimately going to be. Selfie Sticks \nOne of the latest trends for taking mobile phone photos is to use selfie sticks. This allows you to take photos from a variety of angles, so you can get more people into the shot, utilize broader backgrounds, and get some really cool angles for your shots. Some sticks can be a pain, because you still have to use the phone to snap photos, which means reaching and stretching, and probably not really getting the shot you want.

A Selfie Stick allows you to take photos from a distance, and set up various angles and positions.” There are also loads of accessories available that you can use to make your photos even better, including a wide angle lens, a selfie flashlight, and a portable power bank. This selfie stick extends up to 40 inches, and is collapsible so you can even put it in your pocket when you are not using it. Selfie Toaster \nHow would you like to see your digital photos come to life on toasted bread? You can, if you have a selfie toaster. This is such a cool gadget, and you can have loads of fun with it. This product from the Vermont Novelty Toaster Corporation can transfer any image from your phone camera onto your breakfast toast. Just imagine the look on your friends’ faces when you serve them breakfast and their own faces are on their toast. \nThe toaster is inexpensive at $25, and there is an extra charge of $45 for the company to create custom plates that will turn your selfies into images on your toast. This is a great idea if you own a business, because you can use the toaster to create toast that has your company name and logo, which is perfect if you are hosting an event where food is being served. \nSelfies don’t have to be horrible photos of your friends with their “duck-face” poses. You can do some pretty amazing photography when you are using the right tools, and you can have all kinds of fun with the final product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:37:51.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
