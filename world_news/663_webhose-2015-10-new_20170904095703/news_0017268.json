With support from luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, they’re touring from London to San Francisco to woo candidates, saying there’s no reason why the next Uber Technologies Inc. can’t come from France. Their group called “ReviensLeon,” or “Come back Leon,” wants to counter the perception that France is good for study but bad for business.\n“We’re learning to market and sell ourselves,” said Frederic Mazzella, founder of Paris-based Blablacar, which was valued at $1.6 billion last month after raising money from investors including Insight Venture Partners and Lead Edge Capital. “When you’re good, you’ve got to say it.”\nMore than 276,000 science, math and computing students graduate each year from French universities that are among the world’s best-ranked , such as Polytechnique and Ecole Normale Superieure. Google Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are at the top of the pile of global technology companies they want to work for, according to researcher Trendence.\n‘Food Chain’ “We want to put to bed the idea that if you’re not American you won’t make to the top of the global tech food chain,” said Ludovic Le Moan, CEO of Sigfox, a low-cost communications network builder. “ReviensLeon isn’t necessarily about working in France, it’s about helping to grow French companies.”\nAfter raising $115 million in February from investors including Japan’s NTT Docomo Inc., Sigfox is seeking software developers and sales executives; Blablacar posted ads on the ReviensLeon portal for web designers, data analysts and a variety of engineers; and LVMH is targeting e-commerce experts and online community managers, the luxury company’s digital director told a French magazine last month.\nFor these companies, getting their message across got a bit more difficult after recent developments in France dented the country’s efforts to portray a business-friendly image. Air France workers this month ripped the shirts off some of the company’s executives during protests over job cuts. Meanwhile, economy Minister Emmanuel Macron’s battle to reform labor law drew criticism from within the governing Socialist party’s ranks.\n“France’s problem is the lack of flexibility, which is worse for tech companies,” said Didier Lamouche, CEO of security-software provider Oberthur Technologies, which predicts its IPO will be this year’s biggest in European technology. “The country is great at innovation, but we need to get rid of the obstacles that stop economic rebound.”\nSome French people have fled the country’s shores rather than wait for these changes. According to the national statistics office Insee, the number French nationals leaving the country has risen, doubling to 120,000 in 2013 from 60,000 in 2006. It’s not clear, however, how many of these people are driving new technologies.\nRenewed Optimism Still, there are some reasons for optimism.\nFrench startups got about 1 billion euros in venture capital money in the third quarter, President Francois Hollande said earlier this month as he hosted some 20 technology-focused venture capitalists , including California’s Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners. That’s 100 million euros more than the the U.K. raised in all of last year, according to data by EVCA, Europe’s venture-capital association.\n“Paris is becoming more and more of an attractive place to do business,” said Thierry Petit, co-CEO of online retailer Showroomprive , which is due to list in the French capital before the end of the year. “It’s the obvious place to IPO our company as we look to grow into new markets.”", "external_links": ["http://www.shanghairanking.com/SubjectMathematics2015.html#\\"], "published": "2015-10-26T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:41:50.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
