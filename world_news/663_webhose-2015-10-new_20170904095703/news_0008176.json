Under the terms of the deal, IoT will see Shu Ueyama, a former Sony and Virgin executive, become the sales and distribution agent for IoT Group in Japan.\nIan Duffell, executive director business strategy at IoT said that Mr Ueyama will be an important asset for the Australian business as it spreads its wings.\n“Shu Ueyama is a valuable asset to our business in Japan having a wealth of experience and respect with many large Japanese Corporations,” Mr Duffell said.\nMr Duffell, a former Virgin Entertainment Group CEO and Sony marketing executive, has a long standing professional relationship with Mr Ueyama, with both executives part of the original launch team for the Sony Walkman.\nAccording to Mr Duffell, Mr Ueyama is particularly impressed by IoT’s drone offering.\n“Shu had seen our products, and he contacted me to say ‘I hear you’re involved, and I have some contacts that would be very interested in looking at what you’re doing,” he said.\n“The high-profile product is the selfie drone. Companies have seen the specifications and images of the drone and see it as being a major disruptor in the Japanese market - not only because it’s a lot less expensive than other drones on the market, but also because it has a lot more features.\n“Drones are usually tethered to a phone or other controller, but ours is different in that it has its own SIM card so it can work from Sat Nav on its own and be guided by object recognition,” Mr Duffell added.\nSydney-based IoT is seeking to make its debut on the share market in mid-December through a reverse takeover of Ardent Resources. Ardent Resources will acquire IoT in exchange for about 696 million shares in Ardent.\nArdent shareholders will be asked to endorse a change in the nature and scale of Ardent's activities, and the company will also issue a prospectus to raise $5 million.\nIoT has already launched a $99 smartwatch called the Viper Phone Watch which is available in some supermarkets. According to IoT, sales of the unit have already exceeded the original forecast of 2,500 units by December 31. As of October 13 the company has sold 4,820 units.\nIt’s also developing a GPS safety smartwatch for children, a rugged smartwatch designed for tradies, and smart clothing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:15:26.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
