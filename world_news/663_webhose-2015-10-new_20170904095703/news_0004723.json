The awards are given annually to companies that promote the value of workplace wellness and demonstrate innovation and leadership in their wellness programs. Sunstone again placed in the top ten for the “medium sized employers” category – those with 100-499 employees. \nThe Portland Business Journal linked up with Indianapolis-based Healthiest Employers LLC to produce the Healthiest Employers of Oregon awards, a program designed to reward companies for innovative wellness programs and to give other businesses ideas for implementing their own worksite wellness initiatives. This year, The Business Journal honored 63 companies for their efforts to improve employee health. The Healthiest Employers/HR Summit took place on October 21st, 2015, at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Portland. \n“It is so exciting to again be recognized as one of the Healthiest Employers of Oregon,” said Human Resources Manager Sheri Kuretich. “The wellness of our employees continues to be a top priority for all of us at Sunstone Circuits. The wellness initiatives that we’ve launched over the last four years have been very successful for our employees who have worked hard, with many seeing great results from their efforts. Health and well-being are important in every facet of life – including the workplace – and at Sunstone, we continue to focus on creating a wellness program that inspires employees to take charge of their health, and that has the ability to facilitate success in a fun, safe and sustainable way.” \nSunstone Circuits earned this award for the third year in a row by maintaining a formal wellness program to encourage healthy life styles. By implementing a health incentive, employees who obtain biometric readings, undergo a health risk assessment and participate in the “Wellness BINGO” challenge have the ability to receive a reduction in their health insurance premiums each month. The judges also acknowledged Sunstone’s on-site walking trail, fitness room, employee health initiatives, and company-organized participation in local running and walking events. Sunstone has had several employees who were, through the assessment and coaching process, educated on pre-stage medical conditions and have since made lifestyle changes to improve those conditions. \nAbout Sunstone Circuits® \nSunstone Circuits® is the established leader in providing innovative and reliable printed circuit board (PCB) solutions for the electronic design industry.
