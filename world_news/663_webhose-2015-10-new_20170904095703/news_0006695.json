Chawanakee, located in the Sierra Foothills of Madera County near Fresno, California, will utilize PowerSchool within its district of five schools and 1,100 students.\nAccording to Chawanakee, its previous SIS was difficult to navigate, access and input data, featured a cumbersome process for log entry, was difficult to customize, and did not integrate with other systems. The Chawanakee selection committee, comprised of school staff who will be the primary end users, chose PowerSchool because it:\nIs easy to navigate and enter data Features clean, easy-to-read student information screens Provides a hosted option so there is no need for the district to buy equipment Features the ability to customize the system with regard to data and reporting Includes an API (Application Program Interface) infrastructure that allows PowerSchool to talk to other educational systems such as phone systems, LMS systems, SPED systems, and enrollment systems\nChawankee stakeholders chose PowerSchool to provide important functions such as a single point of login for grades and student information, and faster and more robust student reporting of incidents and other student information.\n“PowerSchool’s clean and easy-to-understand screens are a hit with parents and students. We’ve seen a 20 percent increase in parent logins in just the short time we’ve been using it. The ability to move data in and out of the system, and the speed in which end users can navigate important screens is a big reason why we moved to PowerSchool,” said Patrick Wilson, Director of Charter, Minarets High School & Charter, Chawanakee Unified School District.\nFor almost two decades, PowerSchool Group LLC has consistently and reliably supported K12 SIS customers through core features and robust APIs that allow educators, administrators, parents and students to effectively manage school processes and student data and connect the diverse education technologies being utilized in classrooms, schools and districts.\n“PowerSchool is the best comprehensive K12 solution available, and we are proud to partner with districts like Chawanakee to meet its specific needs. We have confidence that our SIS can provide the best features, API system, data and reporting features, all in an easy-to-use, powerful system that allows administrators, teachers, parents, and students to effectively manage school processes and student data,” said Oliver Wreford, PowerSchool Group LLC Vice President of Product and Marketing.\nFor more information about the Chawanakee Unified School District, visit http://www.chawanakee.k12.ca.us/ .\nFor more information about PowerSchool, visit http://www.powerschool.com/ .\nAbout PowerSchool Group LLC\nPowerSchool is the most widely-used SIS, serving more than 13 million students in the US, Canada and in more than 70 countries.
