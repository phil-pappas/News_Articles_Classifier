John Townsend the band''s lead singer had a Top 10 hit on Warner Brothers Records with the Sanford-Townsend Band in the late 1970''s. Ed Zinner the band leader is the lead guitarist whose style transcends rock and jazz playing. The horn section is led by Paul Lieberman who is the music director of Jai Johanny Johanson''s - (who was a founding member of The Allman Brothers Band) Jaimoe''s Jasssz Band and has played with the top jazz artists in Brazil. TGZ''s other band members include: John Toomey Avon Lucas John McKnight Taylor Caldwell Jimmy Dormire and Stan Lassiter.Several of the songs on \"Time To Begin\" include some of the last recordings of the co-founder of the TGZ Band \"Dangerous\" Dan Toler who lost his battle with ALS disease in 2013. Before forming the TGZ Band Dan was a member of The Allman Brothers Band and Dickey Betts & Great Southern.\"The music on our \"Time To Begin\" project cultivated from hundreds of hours in the studio to capture the unique sounds of the world-class musicians that are - the TGZ Band\" states Ed Zinner who also produces the new album. \"In today''s marketplace the sound is fresh and of a quality comparable to Steely Dan''s \"Aja\" release\" he added.Ray White managing director of Classic Artists Today a nationally syndicated radio show has been following the production of the new album closely. \"Their obsession with the sonic details and textured sounds on this project is unlike the overwhelming number of new releases coming out today\" said White. \"TGZ''s songs on the new CD need to be listened to closely by PD''s of radio stations of various music genres\" White stated. He continued by saying \" The crossover sound of this band is the strength that makes this project standout.\"The first single off this 12-song album is titled \"Victimless Crime\" and was released to radio on October 5th. The band will follow up the release of the new album with a national tour in late 2015 and 2016 starting in Virginia Beach Virginia on October 16th with Ambrosia. The bands first album \"Living Dangerously\" was released in 2006.For information on the band visit http://www.tgzband.com and to hear song samples visit http://www.reverbnation.com/tgzband ContactRay White - TGZ Band***classicartiststoday.com--- End --- \n\nAbout PRLog", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:08:56.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
