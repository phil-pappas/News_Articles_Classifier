A 25-member body tasked with overseeing conservation of the Antarctic Ocean will revisit plans to protect critical areas around the frozen continent \nMark Epstein, executive director of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, added that \"CCAMLR promised that this protection would come by 2012, yet the process has been stalled for the last four meetings\". \n\"Global leaders—many of whom are CCAMLR members—have a responsibility to take action now, ensuring these marine protected areas come into force at this meeting,\" he said. \nAustralia, France and the European Union first put forward a bid for a 1.9 million square kilometre (760,000 square mile) Marine Protected Area encompassing seven stretches of the pristine continent in 2011. \nBut it was again knocked back last year with Russia and China citing geo-political issues and concerns about its size. \nCompromises have been made with the current proposal for a 1.0 million square kilometre zone over four areas with some fishing and research allowed as long as conservation values are met. \nSet aside differences Campaigners say two vast marine sanctuaries proposed for Antarctica are imperative to protect one of the world's last untouched wildernesses \nThe Ross Sea plan has also been scaled down, to 1.25 million square kilometres, with 1.14 million square kilometres proposed as a \"no take\" zone in an area often referred to as the \"Last Ocean\" due to its pristine condition. \nBoth of them must win the support of all 25 members of CCAMLR to succeed. \nAustralian Antarctic Division director Nick Gales, who is leading Australia's delegation, said ensuring the impacts of climate change were factored in to CCAMLR management decisions would also be a priority issue. Graphic on proposed Antarctic marine sanctuaries \n\"Australia will be joined by Norway in proposing the establishment of a climate change focused group to provide information, advice and recommendations on how best to integrate climate change considerations into the work of the commission,\" he said. \nAnother key area of discussion includes the effective and sustainable management of fishing krill, a cornerstone of the Antarctic eco-system and the staple diet of many animals, including seals, whales, fish, squid, penguins and other seabirds. \n\"While current harvests are well below the total allowable catch set by CCAMLR, demands on the fishery are expanding as krill is increasingly recognised as a valuable resource in medical products and supplements, and as fish meal,\" said Gales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:30:07.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
