The site even has pages for Julia Cordray and Nicole McCullough, founders of Peeple, a soon-to-launch app following MyLife's platform for leaving personal, professional, and even romantic reviews for other people. \n\"Peeple is being trashed as the 'Yelp for people' for reducing personal opinions to a simple reviews app. MyLife has been offering not only a personal reviews platform, but features that allow individuals to cultivate a more accurate and positive online reputation,\" said Jeff Tinsley, founder of MyLife.com, a website with 6 million unique monthly visitors. \"In its launch six months ago, MyLife pioneered the concept of categorized reviews for people. However, that was only one feature in a series of many designed to help members protect, shape, and monitor their online reputations.\" \nIn addition to providing millions of Americans with personal, professional, and intimate feedback via its categorized review platform, MyLife.com is also providing individuals the ability to: \n- View, monitor, and control all personal information being exposed around the web \n- Read/post personal, professional, and romantic reviews \n- Remove private information from other sites \n- Discover who is accessing their information and/or searching their name \n- Claim and manage their personal MyLife webpage \n\"Whereas Peeple seems to position its subjects as powerless victims of their reviews, MyLife.com is focused on empowering its members,\" says Tinsley. \"The entire purpose of MyLife.com is to give individuals a voice and help them take control of their online reputations, not succumb to them.\" \nIn just three months, MyLife.com has seen its numbers grow from 4.7 million unique visitors to nearly 6 million in September. \nFor more information on MyLife.com, please visit https://www.mylife.com . ### \nAbout MyLife.com, Inc.
