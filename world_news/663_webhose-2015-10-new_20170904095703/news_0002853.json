David Ige in May outlined a plan for improved stewardship of Mauna Kea, which many Native Hawaiians consider sacred.\nIge said 25 percent of the 13 telescopes already on the mountain need to come down before the Thirty Meter Telescope is ready for operation.\nThe university on Wednesday said the third one marked for decommissioning will be the UKIRT Observatory, formerly known as the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. The decommissioning process is underway for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and the Hoku Kea telescope.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
