Wayside Schools is a tuition-free, college preparatory, public charter school district serving four campuses in South/ Southeast Austin, Texas. \nAccording to Chad Riley, Director of Growth & Strategy for Wayside Schools, their decision to go with Prologic was based largely on the software's intuitive design and the Company's continued commitment to the ED-Fi Data Standard for enabling interoperability among education data systems. \"About a year ago we started working with a third-party consultant to see what was available. We wanted a technology partner that was committed to ED-Fi Data Standards. Prologic's willingness to commit the resources necessary to achieve the recently released Ed-Fi Data version 2.0 standards by our go-live date in nine months, made the difference in our decision,\" stated Riley. \n\"Prologic was one of the first four Student Information System (SIS) vendors to license the ED-Fi solution, ensuring our technology was fully compliant with Texas Data Systems. It's was an important commitment we made back in 2011 and continues to be an essential piece of our technology roadmap going forward,\" noted Jeff Pepper, President of Prologic Technology Systems. \nRiley also noted that the TEAMS easy-to-use interface with prepopulated fields made Prologic a clear front runner in their decision. \"Prologic put together a system that is better from the user perspective ...a more logical experience. It's something that you would think would be standard in all systems, but it's not. If I had a new employee sit down with our current system and pull a P&L, they wouldn't be able to figure it out on their own. With TEAMS, they can easily pull a P&L on their own. It's just more intuitive...which is important to a growing organization,\" added Riley. Wayside Schools' goal is to have TEAMS ERP up and running for their 2016-2017 school year. \nCore to TEAMS ERP is its single database methodology, offering districts real-time financial and student information, enhanced data integrity, shared data across departments, improved workflows, customizable report creation tools and teacher/principal mobility. TEAMS is available in both on-site and cloud solutions. \nAbout Prologic Technology Systems, Inc. \nPrologic is the first advanced technology solution for K-12 school district administration and student management.
