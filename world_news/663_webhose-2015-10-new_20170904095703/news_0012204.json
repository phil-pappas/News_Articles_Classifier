As a result, they are only legal to use on land which is private property, and only with the landowner’s permission, the CPS says.\nThe guidance, which was initially released for Segway scooters, points out that, since self-balancing scooters are powered vehicles, they are illegal to ride on the pavement under under section 72 of the Highway Act 1835. In Scotland, where that act does not apply, they are also illegal to ride on the pavement under the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984.\n— MPS Specials (@MPSSpecials) October 11, 2015 Own one of these or thinking about getting one? They're illegal to ride in public!

The devices have already been singled out as popular among footballers and rap stars , and in September a video of a man performing the tawaf on a hoverboard while on pilgrimage to Mecca went viral, splitting opinion in the Islamic world.\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Man circles the Kaaba in Mecca on a hoverboard\nDespite the popular nickname, self-balancing scooters do not actually hover. But real hoverboards are about to hit the market, with Arx Pax, an American start-up, offering the devices for $10,000 a piece . The magnetic technology they use requires an all-metal surface to hover over, meaning that currently they are unlikely to be useable anywhere other than specially prepared private land, but if they ever do hit public streets, a new legal question will be raised: it may be illegal to use a hoverboard on the pavement, but what about a few inches above it?", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c4vk%2Fsfb&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c4vk&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Faudio%2Fvideo%2F2015%2F9%2F3%2F1441271282227%2FKP_446166_crop_640x360.jpg", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/09/03/150903hoverboard.m3u8", "https://twitter.com/MPSSpecials/status/653250273440346112", "https://twitter.com/MPSSpecials/statuses/653250273440346112", "http://t.co/vMm0hxNAjs", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/09/03/150903hoverboard_desk.mp4", "http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/9/3/1441271282227/KP_446166_crop_640x360.jpg", "http://t.co/We85yLAzsU", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/09/03/150903hoverboard_large.3gp", "http://gu.com/p/4c4vk", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/flash/components/mediaelement/f70092081235f698081e268fecea95e4/flashmediaelement.swf", "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CRDPqW3WwAEypH1.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/9/3/1441271282227/KP_446166_crop_640x360.jpg?w=640&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=09c6761a70dab55c516d8fa066abc21c", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/09/03/150903hoverboard_synd_768k_vp8.webm", "http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/09/03/150903hoverboard_small.3gp", "http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/road_traffic_offences/#dot", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Man+circles+the+Kaaba+in+Mecca+on+a+%27hoverboard%27+%E2%80%93+video&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2Fvideo%2F2015%2Fsep%2F03%2Fkaaba-mecca-hoverboard-saudi-arabia-video&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Faudio%2Fvideo%2F2015%2F9%2F3%2F1441271282227%2FKP_446166_crop_640x360.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Man%20circles%20the%20Kaaba%20in%20Mecca%20on%20a%20"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:44:52.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
