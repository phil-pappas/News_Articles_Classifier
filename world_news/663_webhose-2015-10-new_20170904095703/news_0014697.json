John Mica (R-Fla.), who also criticized a GPO-printed ID for lacking certain components and looking \"like it came out of a Cracker Jack box.\" \nVance-Cooks said GPO takes advantage of \"the best of the best innovation\" but admitted to employing fewer than five people for research and development into secure credentials. \nCommittee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) praised the private sector's ability to innovate on the basis of competition, though by the end of the hearing, he also praised Vance-Cooks for restoring his confidence in GPO with her testimony. \nGPO IG Michael Raponi noted that audits had turned up a few compliance issues, but most of those issues were being rapidly addressed. \nChaffetz said he might be interested in amending Title 44 to clarify that agencies are not obligated to use GPO for secure credentials but can and perhaps should look to the private sector for solutions.
