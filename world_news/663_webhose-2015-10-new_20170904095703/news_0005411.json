By Matt Pillar , senior executive editor, Innovative Retail Technologies \nNovember 2015 Innovative Retail Technologies \nAs the groundwork for enterprisewide data visibility falls into place, a game of connect-the-data dots is playing out in stores. \nEvery third quarter since 2005, we’ve launched a survey asking our subscribers for insight into their tech spending plans for the following year. The survey results always tell us a story, and this year’s story is about omni-channel innovation. More specifically, it’s about omni-channel innovation in the store. \nWith few exceptions, we’ve historically told the story of our survey in rote fashion, with a report that follows the mechanics of the survey itself. That effort typically resulted in an account that outlined retailers’ spending priorities across the five distinct categories we asked them about: in-store hardware, in-store software, marketing and operations solutions, supply chain systems and hardware, and loss prevention/asset protection solutions.
