The bundle offers mobile device management, classroom management and web filtering to simplify the day-to-day management of devices with a single, complete solution. With mobile devices coming into schools in increasing numbers, administrators need smart solutions to simplify management. The requirements of schools differ from those of enterprises and, like all Lightspeed Systems solutions, the Management Bundle was designed specifically to meet those unique needs. The bundle provides powerful controls to set device features, view student screens, set secure testing policies, and more — all from an easy-to-use central interface that gives administrators centralized control while providing easy and secure options for delegation of key classroom functions.\n“Windows devices offer great quality and affordability with a familiar interface and powerful productivity tools, which is why so many schools have chosen them for their mobile learning programs,” says Lightspeed Systems President Brian Thomas. “Our bundle offers everything IT departments and teachers need to make Windows devices easily-managed learning tools.”\nLightspeed Systems has worked closely with Microsoft to ensure powerful integration and seamless inter-operation with Windows, Office 365, and other Microsoft education solutions. Today, the solution is available through resellers including CDWG, coupled with professional services.\n“Whether teachers and students are purchasing new devices or upgrading existing devices to Windows 10, the package of Lightspeed device management and professional services is a cost-effective way to simplify device management and classroom management, enabling them to achieve more,” said Tony Prophet, Corporate Vice President, Education Marketing, Microsoft.\nEarly reaction to the bundle from school technology directors is reflective of the need this new solution fills for administrators seeking solutions to help them more easily manage devices across their districts, schools, and classrooms:\n“A one-stop shop for Windows control.”\n“A wonderful tool to help administrators and teachers effectively manage mobile devices and users.”\n“A dynamic system for today's learning environment.”\n“A complete management solution.”\n“Just what schools need.”\nTo learn more about the Lightspeed Systems Management Bundle for Windows, visit lightspeedsystems.com/mb.\nAbout Lightspeed Systems\nLightspeed Systems partners with schools to make learning safe, mobile and easily managed.
