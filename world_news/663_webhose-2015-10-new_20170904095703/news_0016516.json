His enzymes were positive and the patient was taken directly to the cardiac CATH lab. The study revealed a proximal left anterior descending (LAD) high-grade stenosis with angiographic thrombus. The thrombus was removed with the Aspire RX-LP6 Mechanical Aspiration System and the LAD was stented achieving an excellent clinical and angiographic result.\n\"The amount of thrombus was extensive, unprecedented and reflected the fact the patient's symptoms were so unstable for days,\" said Dr. Joel Schneider. \"Removing the thrombus was critical before attempting coronary stenting. The Aspire System allows physicians to remove this thrombus with power, control and speed.\"\nThe ASPIRE Systems allow clinicians to instantly start, stop, increase, decrease, pulse, or maintain thrombectomy force during the procedure. ASPIRE Mechanical Aspirators also aspirate up to 280ml, almost 10 times more than basic syringe systems, without multiple messy and time-consuming catheter connections, disconnections, and re-connections.\n\"Thrombus aspiration in patients presenting with AMI's can be a benefit to the patient and the physician,\" said Chris Livingstone, VP of sales and marketing with Control Medical Technology. \"The Aspire Mechanical Aspiration System gives the physician improved speed, force, volume and control compared to manual aspiration devices.\"\nThe patented ASPIRE RX-LP6 Mechanical Thrombectomy System includes an ASPIRE Mechanical Aspirator (drive unit/pump) and a low-profile rapid-exchange (RX) thrombectomy catheter. ASPIRE Mechanical Aspirators are also available alone and may be connected to any thrombectomy catheter the clinician chooses to use. Control Medical also manufactures ASPIRE MAX Mechanical Thrombectomy Systems with larger over-the-wire (OTW) thrombectomy catheters for use in the peripheral vasculature.\nControl Medical Technology designs, develops, and markets innovative thrombus management, biopsy, and aspiration devices, including the patented ASPIRE Mechanical Aspirator, ASPIRE RX-LP6 Mechanical Thrombectomy System, and ASPIRE MAX Thrombectomy System.
