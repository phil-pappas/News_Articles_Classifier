(NASDAQ: QRVO ), a leading provider of core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defense applications, today introduced four multiplexer solutions designed to simplify and accelerate the adoption of carrier aggregation (CA) in 4G LTE-Advanced devices. Qorvo's first multiplexer solutions leverage the Company's proprietary LowDrift™ BAW filter technology, which features an intrinsic performance advantage over other acoustic filter technologies and enables dramatically improved mobile data services for users of next-generation smartphones. \nEric Creviston, president of Qorvo's Mobile Products group, said, \"Qorvo's first multiplexers were developed in collaboration with leading chipset suppliers and are qualified on major reference designs. Qorvo is expanding our family of multiplexers to accommodate carrier aggregation deployments worldwide, and we are integrating multiplexers into RF Fusion™ solutions for a single scalable source of best-in-class filtering, switching and amplification.\" \nQorvo's multiplexers deliver best-in-class insertion loss and high cross-isolation of receive and transmit paths to optimize receive sensitivity and extend smartphone battery life. The Company's first multiplexer solutions are optimized for Europe and the Asia Pacific region and integrate multiple BAW filters to cover the primary band combinations used in CA deployments: bands 1+3 and bands 39+41. The highly compact multiplexer solutions deliver 60% space savings over discrete components. \nQorvo's high-performance filters meet or exceed the increasingly stringent requirements related to narrow spacing on receive and transmit bands while delivering consistent performance over temperature, thus enabling better performance in the RF front end. \nAbout Qorvo's Multiplexer Solutions \nQM25005 : Qorvo's QM25005 multiplexer features LowDrift™ transmit and receive filters for FDD-LTE bands 1 and 3 in a highly compact 3.0 x 2.0 mm form factor. Enabling downlink CA, the QM25005 is qualified with leading LTE chipsets and performance-optimized to deliver best-in-class insertion loss and high isolation, resulting in improved receive sensitivity and coverage. \nQM25001, QM25011, and QM25012 : Qorvo is introducing three multiplexers featuring LowDrift™ BAW filter technology for TDD-LTE Bands 39 and 41, each developed in partnership with leading chipset suppliers. With a compact 2.5 x 2.0 mm footprint, the QM25001 is designed for global smartphones supporting the full band 41 spectrum for worldwide use. The QM25011 and QM25012 are designed for China domestic smartphones and optimized for China's Band 41 narrowband allocation. The QM25011 includes primary transmit and receive filters in a 1.7 x 1.3 mm package, while the complementary QM25012 provides diversity receive filters in an even smaller 1.5 x 1.1 mm footprint. Both products provide at least a 60% space savings over discrete components. \nInclusion in RF Fusion™ Roadmap \nQorvo plans to progressively incorporate its multiplexer technology into its RF Fusion™ line of high performance front-end solutions, which combine best-in-class power amplifier efficiency, filtering and switching to provide a single scalable source for the entire cellular front end. \nQorvo's high performance RF solutions simplify design, reduce product footprint, conserve power and improve overall system performance in smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. Qorvo offers customers a unique combination of broad manufacturing scale, deep systems-level expertise and the industry's most comprehensive product and technology portfolio, helping mobile device manufacturers accelerate delivery of next-generation products. \nTo learn more about Qorvo's multiplexers and other core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defense applications, please visit www.qorvo.com . \nAbout Qorvo \nQorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO ) is a leading provider of core technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defense applications.
