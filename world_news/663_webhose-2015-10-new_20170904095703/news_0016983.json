Besides 4K, the new model will help people find a lost remote under the couch by signaling the remote to make a sound.\nRoku will continue to sell older models at prices that start at $50.\nAll Roku devices are also getting new software offering more ways to get alerts when movies and shows become available for streaming or have price reductions. A new feature promises to make it easier to connect in hotels, dorms and other public settings with complicated sign-in procedures for Wi-Fi.\nRoku offers access to more than a thousand apps, a broader selection than what rivals such as Fire TV, Apple TV and Google's Chromecast and Android TV devices offer.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments New Roku Streaming TV Device Has 4K Resolution   \nLong Island Doctor Found Dead After Night Out \" \nAmazing   \nSeattle   \nGun Store Opens Near School, Prompting Protests in Community \" \nWhere Democratic Candidates Agree and Disagree on Gun Control \" \nUS 'Mistakenly Struck' Kunduz Hospital, Gen.
