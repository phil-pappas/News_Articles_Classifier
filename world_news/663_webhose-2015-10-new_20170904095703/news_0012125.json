And I hope you will from this too. I was part of the protest at UWC today, which was PEACEFUL in so many respects. There was NO violence whatsoever - except a group of individuals who decided they'd vandalise the campus property, which was sad, and allegedly not even students from our institution.\nThe protest went on peacefully, with songs being sung in order to create awareness in respect of #FeesMustFall. No classes were disrupted, no people were harmed and there was solidarity with the rest of the country. This, however, was sadly overshadowed at as some students, towards to end of the afternoon, decided to barricade and block the entrances and exits.\nThis is not okay. Now it's important to note that the media along with everyone just sees the negatives and nothing gets said about the peacefulness, and it's made out to be that all was chaos which it was not the case. Why should students, staff and various other people be denied the right to exit the campus - and more so, who gives those students the right to act in this manner? Sadly - all in the name of the protest? This is NOT the way we should go and want to achieve this. It is far from condonable, and it's that kind of mentality that has spoilt the image of the protests.\nMany are mistaken about the protest and I don't blame them. I find myself confused at times too, because there are demands for many different things. But today, I found common ground and I hope this helps you, who also is somewhat confused, about everything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:11:29.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
