The company prides itself on shrinking such circuitry quickly to boost the capability of its products. Intel has also kept close control over its production technology to prevent rivals from copying it.\nThe factory at Dalian, opened in 2010, is unusual because Intel said it would be kept at least two generations behind production processes at its other factories. As part of the move disclosed Tuesday, however, Intel said the factory would become a \"leading-edge\" maker of so-called nonvolatile memory chips, a term that refers to chips that retain data after power is turned off.\nNonvolatile memory includes the flash memory chips widely used in devices such as smartphones and new data storage hardware being deployed in data centers.\nIntel's move represents a shift not only toward memory but also toward greater independence in its memory business. The company up to now has relied on a joint venture with Micron Technology Inc. to manufacture flash memory chips, which Intel sells in solid-state drives and other storage devices.\nThe two companies recently joined rivals in offering a new version of that technology called 3D NAND, which replaces a single layer of cells for storing data with multiple layers to boost storage capacity. The Dalian plant is expected to begin producing such chips in the second half of 2016, Intel said.\nBesides standard versions of flash memory, the two companies recently announced a new jointly developed memory technology called 3D XPoint that they said is much faster than conventional flash memory.\nRob Crooke, senior vice president in charge of nonvolatile memory at Intel, said in a blog post that the company's relationship with Micron remains strong. But Intel wanted to have an additional source of supply of flash memory, he said.\n\"The expansion is part of our global multisource supply strategy and will allow us to best serve our customers,\" Mr. Crooke said.\nThe Chinese government has been trying to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers of technology. The country has a number of chip makers, but no major locally based makers of memory chips.\nTsinghua Unigroup Ltd., a Chinese state-owned company, sought to buy Micron for $23 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. People familiar with the discussions said talks fell through partly because of the dim prospect of gaining U.S. regulatory approval.\nWrite to Don Clark at don.clark@wsj.com\n 20, 2015 15:30 ET (19:30 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:26:27.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
