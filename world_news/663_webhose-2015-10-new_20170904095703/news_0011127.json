Now, the possible discovery of liquid water on the red planet has reenergized his affection for it. He is now clarifying his idea for heating up the planet with nuclear bombs. Musk's goal isn't to blow up Mars in the hopes of heating it up enough for livability. No, he wants to launch fusion bombs into the sky over Mars' two poles to create tiny pulse suns. These suns would be similar to our own sun, but would only last for a short while. Musk says they will warm the planet and create a greenhouse effect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:00:59.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
