Its second menu for the curved display adds some useful shortcuts.\nThe bad: The usefulness doesn’t live up to its sky-high price. Fans of removable batteries and microSD card slots will be disappointed that this has neither.\nThe cost: $450 (with two-year contract) to $900\nThe bottom line: Buy the Edge+ if you love the idea of a wraparound screen; otherwise, you’ll find less expensive phones that do nearly as much.\nSamsung Continuum \nCnet rating: 3.5 stars out of 5 (Very good)\nThe good: It features two displays; the smaller ticker window is a great tool for quickly accessing information and multitasking. The smartphone also has a 1GHz processor and a 5-megapixel camera with HD video capture. It offers full wireless options and can be used as a mobile hot spot.\nThe bad: The smaller screen makes for more cramped typing. Ticker display isn’t available for third-party apps. Runs Android 2.1, and Bing is the default search engine. You can’t uninstall preloaded apps and services.\nThe cost: $25 to $100\nThe bottom line: More than just a gimmick, the Continuum’s secondary display is a useful management and multitasking tool, but its constant flow of information might not appeal to everybody.\nKyocera Echo \nCnet rating: 3.5 stars out of 5 (Very good) \nThe good: Its one-of-kind design offers two screens and the ability to use two applications at once. Call quality is acceptable, and the phone is quick and responsive.\nThe bad: The design entails some usability quirks, and we’re concerned about long-term durability. The feature set is pretty average, it lacks 4G, and you’ll have to wait for an upgrade beyond Froyo.\nThe cost: $128\nThe bottom line: The design offers some unique advantages, but its appeal is hampered by usability quirks and lackluster features.\nLG Doubleplay \nCnet rating: 3.5 stars out of 5 (Very good)\nThe good: It has a vibrant and sharp display, a 1GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor, Android 2.3 Gingerbread, DLNA support, Wi-Fi calling, mobile hotspot support, full Webkit browser with Adobe Flash, support for T-Mobile ’s 4G/HSPA+ network, a 5-megapixel camera with 720p HD video capture, and great call quality.\nThe bad: The quirky dual screen and split keyboard design is a little too strange for us. It’s a hefty and bulky handset, and has poor battery life.\nThe cost: $200\nThe bottom line: It has excellent features for a midrange Android smartphone, but its bizarre design is not for everyone.\nCnet staff contributing to this story are Bonnie Cha, Jessica Dolcourt, Kent German, Nicole Lee and Laura K.
