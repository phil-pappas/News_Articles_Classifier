For example, by allowing retailers to invest in RFID at a later point via an RFID upgrade kit, the E10 2.0 enables them to use their existingelectronic article surveillance (EAS) RF solutions today and then use RFID when the time is right for their businesses. In dual-mode, only one tag is required for both inventory management and loss prevention. \nAccording to Uwe Sydon, Senior Vice President of Innovation, Checkpoint Systems, “The E10 2.0 represents a new generation of antenna where style meets substance. Whether retailers want to adapt to existing store layouts, boost their brand messages or create a visual deterrent to theft, the E10 2.0 is ready to meet their needs. In addition, powerful data analytics enhance loss prevention and merchandising capabilities.” \nFlexible Design Accommodating flexible store designs is one of the drivers of RFID adoption at apparel retailers. Checkpoint has taken the E10 2.0 to a new level of design flexibility. The antenna can be used as a sleek see-through acrylic design, or can be changed instantly to become an advertisement panel for a store’s products, simply by inserting graphic panels that are held in place by the elegant standard display. Advertising panels serve as a low-cost means to promote in-store campaigns or the brand itself. \nThe new antenna also is EMOPrint ready, which means retailers can obtain from Checkpoint full color textile panels that are easy to modify on the E10 2.0. EMOPrint improves the appearance of the antenna, making the store entrance much more appealing, an important factor for apparel retailers. \nLastly, retailers can further customize the antenna by ordering from Checkpoint full color graphic prints that are applied to the antenna base plates and RFID elements, to create a unique branded antenna solution. Some antenna areas are also available in color options to meet a store’s overall design scheme. In addition, the side of the antenna can be fully illuminated to create a high impact visual effect. \nPowerful Data Analytics Checkpoint’s data analytics for the E10 2.0 help merchandising and operations staff better understand store traffic, and ensure that store associates leverage RF/RFID investments appropriately, comply with store shoplifting policies and have systems always turned on and operating properly. \nIntegrated Vistor Counting is embedded in the new system, offering highly sophisticated functionality, analytics and reporting to improve profitability. It enables retailers to maximize the potential of their sales floor space, calculate shopper conversion rates and improve staffing allocations. \nIn addition, when used in RF or RF/RFID mode, E10 2.0 can be fully integrated with Checkpoint’s recently announced EVOLVE-Store, a real-time app for smartphones and tablets that supports real-time EAS and organized retail crime (ORC) event management, creating a powerful data-centric solution. \nFinally, the improved RFID functionality of E10 2.0 will help loss prevention managers better understand what is potentially stolen, and store associates improve stock management by having the right product at the right time. \nEVOLVE E10 2.0 is available immediately. \nAbout Checkpoint Systems, Inc.
