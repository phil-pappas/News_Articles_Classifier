The Pentagon initially said the attack was to protect US troops engaged in a firefight and has since said it was a mistake.\nThe special operations analysts had assembled a dossier that included maps with the hospital circled, along with indications that intelligence agencies were tracking the location of the Pakistani operative and activity reports based on overhead surveillance, according to a former intelligence official familiar with the material. The intelligence suggested the hospital was being used as a Taliban command and control centre and may have housed heavy weapons.\nAfter the attack - which came amidst a battle to retake the northern Afghan city of Kunduz from the Taliban - some US analysts assessed that the strike had been justified, the former officer says. They concluded that the Pakistani, believed to have been working for his country's Inter-Service Intelligence directorate, had been killed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:26:05.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
