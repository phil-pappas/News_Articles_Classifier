His hair might no longer be crafted into a bleached blond quiff, his punk rocker wardrobe has been replaced with something more sophisticated and he has graduated from the rowdy, if entertaining, Really Wild Show that launched his career to co-presenting the decidedly more grown-up Springwatch . But there’s still an air of the enfant terrible about him.\nIndeed for a man who confesses to disliking conflict, Packham is no stranger to a fight. Last year he joined in the charge against the Maltese government, campaigning furiously against its annual spring shoot of migratory birds , while his continuing battle to save the hen harrier has seen him square up against a powerful collective of grouse-hunters across the UK. And he’s adamant that charities should shout louder about conservation issues:he has urged both the RSPB and RSPCA to speak out about the havoc wreaked by cats on garden birds.\nIf I were a ‘bunny-hugger’ then that would compromise the integrity of the BBC\n“I have nothing against cats; it is the cat-owners,” he fumes. Inevitably, backlashes abound – last month backers of blood sports accused him of jeopardising the impartiality of the BBC with his call for charities to turn up the volume against fox hunting and other activities. But Packham is not rising to the bait.\n“If I were a ‘bunny-hugger’ then that would compromise the integrity of the BBC but I base my arguments on good, sound fact,” he says. The frequency of his furores is not the only paradox in Packham’s life. A lover of method and order, the untamable dynamism of the great outdoors has brought its own challenge.\n“When I look out into the natural world I don’t see chaos , I see, something I have managed to grapple with enough to be not only comfortable but excited,” he says. And while he is phlegmatic about a sparrowhawk dismembering a sparrow, he is clearly besotted with his two poodles whose virtues, from intelligence to companionship, he readily waxes lyrical about. “They are also anarchists,” he adds with a hint of pride.\nPackham has a voguish edge, too. Tucked away down a rugged lane, his home in the New Forest is such a vision of bucolic bliss I half expect a Pop Larkin-type character to saunter across the yard. But inside, a kitsch, gnome-based table gazes benevolently across the living room while the chic collection of retro furniture looks so sleek I daren’t sit down in case the chairs turn out to be some sort of installation.\nI am not really interested in fun\nPackham is even setting up his own line of ethical outdoor clothing: “I want it to be slightly more fashionable, slightly less green and straight-sided, maybe a little bit fitted,” he says. Clearly his sister, fashion designer Jenny Packham, isn’t the only one keen on the catwalk.\nPerhaps the most striking thing under the gentle autumnal sun is Packham’s restless desire to get things done.\n“I am not really interested in fun or free time or holidays; we don’t do that. I don’t do that,” he admits as we talk in his garden. And perhaps, in the end, that’s why Packham is so at home with wildlife. Nature doesn’t stop for a break. And neither does its biggest fan.\nYou wanted to be an astronaut as a kid. Wouldn’t you have been a bit bored “out there” with no wildlife?\nI grew up throughout the 1960s and the Apollo programme was on. It was extraordinarily exciting and particularly for young people. I had posters on my wall of the astronauts and the Saturn V rockets. Astronauts were very much the heroes of the age. And they were glamorous, there was no doubt about that. When I first saw that photograph Earthrise taken on the Apollo 8 mission in 1968, of the Earth looking back, that little jewel floating in space, I just wanted to be there. Obviously it was never going to happen.\nRelated: Chris Packham slams 'shameful' silence of Britain's conservation charities\nWould you want to go up on a Virgin Galactic flight?\nI’d love to but I’m never going to have the money. I’m very envious, but only in a nice way, of people like Sarah Brightman who are able to go the space station. And I wouldn’t want to go up [to the International Space Station] and be kicking my heels while everyone else was busy working, I’d want to be part of the scientific programme. They’d have to train me to do something or I could be a guinea pig for them. I’d hate the idea of just being a tourist.\nYou’ve been vocal in the fight to save the hen harrier. Do you think naming them, as one young conservationist suggested, would help raise their profile?\nI am not against any form of anthropomorphism. I used to be terribly snobbish about it but now I am mercenary - to be honest with you I will happily embrace any technique to achieve my aims. We use quite a lot of anthropomorphism [on Springwatch ] - the audience give [the animals] names and we embrace that. What I am keen to say through that is all of these animals, whether they have a name or not, are individuals. And I think that people when they realise [that the animals] haven’t all come out of a mould and are acting like automatons, and they have their own struggles and successes and failures, I think they develop a greater affinity for them - and that’s my mission. Whether we give [hen harriers] names, it would be good to satellite-track the young and to have that information on a publicly accessible website.\nYou’ve said that campaigning isn’t popular any more. Do you think we should embrace 1970s-style activism and protest more loudly?\nI think so, but let me be really clear- I am not into violence of any kind. I just don’t like it and it is counter-productive. I think that it is really important that we campaign for democratic change and we do that using our voices. And what we should use as our greatest weapon is good, sound, scientific fact. But yes, I would like to see more people shouting those facts more loudly. What I detect in the public is a change and a hankering for people to be more determined and to present their case in a more forthright fashion because I think the rules have changed. And they have changed because we have social media. So this means we can be far more effective. In the case of hen harriers, in the past if people had been caught killing raptors illegally it would finally get to court and six months later it would be a little column in an RSPB magazine. Now it is all over the media so we know straight away.\nYou campaigned for the end of spring shooting in Malta, making a series of YouTube videos. It looked as if you came up against some pretty aggressive heavies in the process. Do you ever feel afraid when taking a stand for the environment?\nNo, I used to get punched in the mouth quite a lot when I was a punk rocker so I remember it hurt. But no, not at all. I am not intimidated physically by those sorts of things. And again, I am not a violent person. There is no way I am going to ever lose my temper and hit anyone. My job is to try and convert them to the way I think. I would rather do that through dialogue and creativity. Conflict slows the whole process of change.\nRelated: Craig Packer: ‘Cecil the lion’s killer was unlucky and not altogether to blame’\nMalta held a referendum in April, but the hunters won by a hair’s breadth. That must have been a blow …\nIt was disappointing. I think that you could argue that it was a fair election in that the votes were counted correctly. But I think the way that the election was handled wasn’t entirely democratic. And I think the Maltese people unfortunately missed a trick because we knew that the majority were opposed to spring hunting but it wasn’t a big enough issue to get them off of their sofas and this is a real shame.\nAs a child you took a kestrel chick from the wild and raised it yourself. Would you be outraged if a child did the same now?\nWhen I did that, kestrels were the commonest raptor in the UK. I can’t condone the fact that what I did was illegal. I did everything I could to make it legal. I applied for the necessary licence, but people like me didn’t get licences. It wasn’t fair. So I took the bird out of the nest. In my defence I can say that the keeping of that bird and the time that I spent with it had the singularly most profound effect on my life. What would I do now if I found a child that had taken a bird out of the wild? Well, you are talking about a child – and I was a child of 14. My reaction to an adult doing it would be very, very different. I wouldn’t chastise that child, I would ask them to think about what they had done, but I would do that after I had engaged with them. I certainly wouldn’t take [the bird] away from [them]. My bird was taken away - it died - and it had an enormously negative effect on my life. So no, I’d be thinking, right, let’s utilise this determination, let’s utilise this rebellious streak and turn it into something productive.\nI’ve heard you visited its grave for many years. Isn’t that romanticising the circle of life?\nI am one of those people that has probably closer relationships with animals than people and I am not ashamed of that at all. Outside of that, yes, you’re right, I am ruthlessly dispassionate to the point where I can see a genuine beauty in things dying and being killed and eaten. But when it happens to you, of course it is different. One of my dogs is buried in a grave and I go there occasionally when I want to think about him. I suppose that’s why we have graves because they are a controlled environment whereby you only think about it when you want to. And that is useful, otherwise it is there haunting you all the time.\nI used to get punched in the mouth quite a lot when I was a punk rocker\nHas working for the BBC clipped your wings as far as activism goes?\nNo. There are certain protocols which are agreed with the BBC so that I don’t compromise its impartiality and I don’t transgress those and there are two reasons for that. One, you won’t find a greater supporter of the BBC than me – I think its impartiality is intrinsically important and invaluable. As a public service broadcaster it has no global equal. So I am keen to protect the reputation and the health of the BBC. The second thing is, it doesn’t clip my wings. I don’t work for the BBC all of the time. I am employed on the basis of my – and I use the term modestly – expertise and also because of my passion for the subject. The BBC has a long tradition of employing experts in their field, whether it is historians, physicists, cooks, gardeners, bakers - or natural history presenters – and I think the audience has an expectation that those people they are listening to are speaking with authority. Equally, I base all of my campaigning on sound scientific foundations. So if I am campaigning against something it will be from that standpoint and again I don’t think that compromises my integrity at the BBC.\nYou’ve been touted as the next David Attenborough. Do you feel comfortable with that?\nObviously not. There’s only one David Attenborough. He’s a remarkable broadcaster and he has been broadcasting through a period of relatively stable television, but now we are in a period of great flux, both in terms of what we are able to do as a public service broadcaster and also how we are going to use that technology in the future. I think that there won’t be any successor to David because those sorts of programmes are going to be increasingly difficult to make. It’s very flattering but Dave is still going; long may he continue. And we come from a different age and we face different problems in terms of what we are trying to do and how we are going to do it.\nYou are involved with Population Matters, which raises concerns about overpopulation. Has that influenced your decision about having children?\nThere’s both personal and wider reasons why I didn’t want to have children. But the reason I am involved with Population Matters is that it is a discussion I think we should be having. It is a critical issue for our health and the health of our planet. In my lifetime the human population has doubled but the size of the planet and its resources haven’t doubled and already we’re living beyond our means in terms of exploiting those resources. The Ladybird book of ecology says that that’s a stupid thing [to do], so why aren’t we discussing that?\nAre you optimistic about next month’s international climate change meeting?\nNo. I am rarely pessimistic about anything actually, I always try to find some positive - I need that as fuel. But I am afraid that we have gone through all of these and the key players are refusing to play and we are not playing either. It is really disappointing when we have the knowledge, when we have the expertise, when we have the data to show that we need to act more promptly and more decisively, that they are fudging it and fluffing it on all sorts of spurious grounds.\nYou’re a fan of rewilding. How about de-extinction, bringing back the mammoth?\nWell, I am interested. I like blue-skies science, I love the idea that we find out things just because we want to know. That’s again part of the human spirit so I will champion that. You could easily argue that we don’t need Cern, ring up Brian Cox and say: “Brian, give us a break mate, we honestly don’t need that,” but I think we do. I do want to know about those particles. He wants to know more than I, but for me it is important that we try to understand everything maximally.\nI don’t lose control of anything, I regulate everything in my life.\nWhat do you do in your free time? Do you even have free time?\nI have got a limited amount of time to get things done. I have got to get as much done as possible so if we do take a break invariably I’ll take a break to work on something different, normally taking photographs or something. I enjoy reading books off topic - that’s naughty, that’s sort of gratuitous enjoyment - I read a lot of history.\nDo you listen to The Archers ?\nNo. As soon as I hear the theme tune it’s off. Same as Coronation Street . It is one of those instinctive reactions. I have never listened to The Archers. I have no idea how good it is or how bad it is, it is just I don’t want to allow myself the time for that distraction in life.\nIs it a fear of losing control of your time?\nYes, I don’t lose control of anything, I regulate everything in my life. I won’t be eating these flapjacks, ever [waves box of flapjacks around].\nWhat’s in the menagerie nowadays?\nIt’s the two poodles really. Charlotte [my partner] bought me a ball python a few years ago. But the dogs are terribly jealous and every time I got it out they tried to kill it. So the snake now lives at the zoo where it meets lots of kids and gets handled. It was called Biter because young snakes are very inquisitive and they tend to bite things to see if they can eat them, so when I had it and it was very young it would bite me repeatedly. Maybe they’ve changed the name at the zoo …\nAutumnWatch airs on BBC 2 from Monday 2 November-Thursday 5 November\nBORN TO BE WILD: PACKHAM’S LIFE AND TIMES\nMay 1961\nBorn, Southampton.\n1979\nEnrols in a BSc in zoology at the University of Southampton.\n1984\nStarts training as a wildlife cameraman.\n1986\nBegins co-presenting the Really Wild Show.\n1998\nPresents The X-creatures on BBC1 looking at cryptozoological animals.\n1999\nSets up production company Head over Heels, making natural history programmes.\n2005\nBegins presenting BBC2’s long-running Hands on Nature.\n2009\nBecomes a host of Springwatch on BBC2.\n2010\nAwarded the British Trust for Ornithology’s Dilys Breese medal.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Early days: Chris Packham with a barn owl called Spook, pictured in 1989.
