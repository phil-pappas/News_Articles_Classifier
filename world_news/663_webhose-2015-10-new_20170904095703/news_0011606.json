She lived in Colorado, which is over 1,600 kilometres away from his home in Arkansas. \nTEN SECRETS TO A LASTING, LOVING RELATIONSHIP Schuler Benson accidentally logged into a stranger's Facebook account and sparked a love affair that has turned into marriage. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook \nSchuler was stuck in Celeste’s account for a week and the pair began to communicate as ‘This is Celeste’ and ‘This is NOT Celeste’. Celeste sent Schuler a friend request to see if it would fix the glitch and it worked. \nSchuler was able to log out of Celeste’s accout and get back into his own account. \nCeleste, a student, told heavy.com that she had intended to add Schuler as a friend gor a couple weeks in order to make sure the glitch was fixed and then delete him. Her plans though changed as she got to know him. \n“I never did (delete him) because I enjoyed his status updates,” she said. “He would post such funny stuff that I liked having him in my feed. We commented here and there on each other’s statuses and that is how we got to know one another.” \nThe friendship slowly grew into a romance. Despite not knowing each other and living 1600 kilometres apart, Schuler Benson and Celeste Zendler gradually fell in love.

The following year she began dating Schuler and moved to Arkansas to be near him. \nThe romance developed and on June 11 last year, Schuler logged into Celeste’s Facebook account for the second time — but this time on purpose. Schuler logs into Celeste's account for a second time and proposes to her. Picture: Facebook Source: Facebook \nSince they met on Facebook, he could not propose to her where they first met. Hacking into her account, took them back to their first meeting and Schuler posted a wedding proposal. \n“He was waiting for me to check my Facebook and had the ring in hand,” she said. \nCeleste said yes and the pair married in South Carolina, where they now live, on June 21 this year. Married six years after meeting through a technical glitch on an account on Facebook.

Rounding down, the odds of us connecting were less than 1 in 175,000,000. Statistically speaking, you’re about 300 times more likely to be struck by lightning. You’re more likely to be bitten by a shark … on land. And you’re about as likely to win the Powerball Jackpot … with the exact same numbers as someone else.” \nDespite the odds being slim, Schuler said the pair found they had a lot in common. \n“I found my partner, my best friend and my great love due to a simple glitch on social media.” The odds of Schuler and Celeste meeting, let alone falling in love, were less than 1 in 175 million.
