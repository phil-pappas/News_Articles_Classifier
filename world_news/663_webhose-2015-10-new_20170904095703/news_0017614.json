The plan, to be presented to heads of state for approval next month at a Group of 20 summit in Turkey, seeks to address concerns about whether large companies such as Apple and Google are paying their fair amount of taxes.\nThe 15-point action plan was drafted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in consultation with more than 100 countries. It seeks to eliminate so-called “tax shopping” for most-favorable rates, profit shifting and a host of other strategies estimated to cost between 4 and 10 percent of global corporate income tax annually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:28:57.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
