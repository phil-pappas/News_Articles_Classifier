Chief Executive Satya Nadella's total compensation in 2015 fell to $18.3 million, a 78% drop largely tied to stock awards.\nMr. Nadella's compensation last year was boosted by a $59.2 million restricted stock grant when he was promoted to CEO--which raised the value of his total compensation to $84.3 million, making the 48-year-old one of the highest paid tech executives--at least on paper.\nCompanies are required to disclose the fair value of a stock award at the time it is granted, even though the executive may not collect the money for years.\nThe $59.2 million figure assumes Microsoft's stock-price gains and dividend payouts top those of 60% of the companies in the S&P 500 in each of three overlapping five-year stretches ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021, making Mr. Nadella eligible for the award starting in 2019.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Nadella's base salary for the year ended June 30 jumped 31% to $1.2 million and his cash bonus rose 20% to $4.3 million, according to a securities filing.\nChief Financial Officer Amy E. Hood's total compensation, meanwhile, fell 16% to $8.8 million and Chief Operating Officer B. Kevin Turner's dropped 46% to $12.2 million. The lower compensation, like Mr. Nadella's, was largely because of lower stock awards.\nMargaret L. Johnson, who joined the company in September 2014 as executive vice president for business development, was paid $14.5 million, including a one-time hiring cash bonus of $2.5 million.\nSeparately, Microsoft said it would nominate Johnson & Johnson executive Sandra Peterson and Padmasree Warrior, Cisco's former chief technology and strategy officer, to its board at its Dec. 2 annual meeting.\nIf elected, the company's 10-member board would expand to 11. Maria Klawe, Harvey Mudd College's president who joined the company's board in 2009, won't be seeking re-election.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\n 19, 2015 21:15 ET (01:15 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:23:19.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
