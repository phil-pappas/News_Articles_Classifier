It comes back to our people – managers lead by example and share their knowledge, and employees who have been here longer mentor their newer colleagues. This recognition from Washingtonian is a testament to the success of our next-generation security software and the dedication of everyone who helps build it and helps provide it to our customers.”\nNow in its ninth year, Washingtonian’s biennial award honors the 50 top workplaces based on the following criteria: generous pay and benefits, challenging and interesting work, great work/life balance, growth and learning opportunities, charity and community involvement, and the recognition and respect given to employees. Winning workplaces vary in size and industry and were selected based on close to 10,000 employee surveys from nearly 200 D.C.-area companies.\nOver the last year, Tenable also earned “best place to work” recognition from The Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Magazine, and was named one of the fastest growing technology companies for the sixth consecutive year by the Deloitte Fast 500 program. The company was also named one of the 100 most promising tech companies in North America in 2014 by Red Herring. Tenable also earned the GSN 2014 Homeland Security Award for the company’s work on the U.S. Department of Defense Assured Compliance Assessment Solution (ACAS).\nTo learn about opportunities at Tenable, visit the company’s career site at http://www.tenable.com/careers , and follow our career updates on LinkedIn , Twitter and Facebook .\nAbout Tenable Network Security\nTenable Network Security provides continuous network monitoring to identify vulnerabilities, reduce risk, ensure compliance and respond to threats.
