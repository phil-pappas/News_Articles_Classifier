At the completion of Accenture’s strategy efforts, technological solutions will be selected to begin the work to implement clinical data integration. \n“We are delighted Accenture has been selected to help break new ground in integrated care delivery excellence,” said Andrew Truscott, managing director of clinical services, Accenture Health. “We look forward to working with Anthem and the seven hospital systems to build a foundation for improving care coordination, patient engagement and outcomes.” \nThe work is expected to be completed by late Fall 2015. \nSince its launch in late 2014, Vivity, which is available to large employers, has already gained 13,000 members, nearly reaching its goal of 15,000 members by the end of 2015. CalPERS, the country’s second largest purchaser of health benefits, was a Vivity customer at launch, with a variety of employers signing up since, including a restaurant group, school system and small businesses. \nAbout Anthem Blue Cross: \nAnthem Blue Cross is the trade name of Blue Cross of California.
