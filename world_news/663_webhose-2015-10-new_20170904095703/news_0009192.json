Scientists have created crystals that capture carbon dioxide much more efficiently than previously known materials, even in the presence of water. The research was recently published in a report in the scientific journal Science ( \"CO 2 capture from humid flue gases and humid atmosphere using a microporous coppersilicate \" ). Osamu Terasaki and Peter Oleynikov with a model of the new crystal. One way to mitigate climate change could be to capture carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the air. So far this has been difficult, since the presence of water prevents the adsorption of CO 2 . Complete dehydration is a costly process. Scientists have now created a stable and recyclable material, where the micropores within the crystal have different adsorption sites for carbon dioxide and water. As far as I know this is the first material that captures CO 2 in an efficient way in the presence of humidity. In other cases there is competition between water and carbon dioxide and water usually wins. This material adsorbs both, but the CO 2 uptake is enormous says Osamu Terasaki, Professor at the Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry at Stockholm University. The new material is called SGU-29, named after Sogang University in Korea, and is the result of international cooperation. It is a copper silicate crystal. The material could be used for capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and especially to clean emissions. CO 2 is always produced with moisture, and now we can capture CO 2 from humid gases. Combined with other systems that are being developed, the waste carbon can be used for new valuable compounds. People are working very hard and I think we will be able to do this within five years. The most difficult part is to capture carbon dioxide, and we have a solution for that now says Osamu Terasaki.
