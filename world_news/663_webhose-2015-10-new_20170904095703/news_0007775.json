And material here is in the literal sense of the word. Right from Iron Age or Bronze Age to the recent silicon age (the computer age), these materials have shaped nations, technologies, infrastructures and future of the generations. Now a new material has gained entry into this list to affect our future. This material is called ‘Graphene’. It has been dubbed as a supermaterial and the researchers world over, are trying to find out all possible ways to make hundred percent use of it. Understanding Graphene and its history Graphene is a single thin layer of graphite. Graphite is an allotrope of the element carbon that is it has the same number of atoms as carbon but its atoms are arranged in a different way so that this arrangement brings about a difference in the properties of the two. Graphene’s atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, so when graphene is isolated from graphite, it takes on some amazing properties. It is a mere one atom thick, the first two-dimensional material ever discovered. Despite this, graphene is also one of the strongest materials with a tensile strength of 130 GPa (gigapascals), which makes it more than 100 times stronger than steel. In addition to these qualities, it is also flexible, transparent, highly conductive, and seemingly impermeable to most gases and liquids. The first isolated sample of graphene was discovered in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester using just a roll of scotch tape. They were actually using tape to polish a large block of graphite; when they noticed exceptionally thin flakes on the tape. They continued peeling layer and layer from the flakes of graphite and eventually produced a sample as thin as possible. They had found graphene. The discovery was so bizarre, the scientific world was skeptical at first. The popular journal Nature even rejected their paper on the experiment twice. Eventually, their research was published, and in 2010 Geim and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. Where can it make itself useful? Considering the many qualities that graphene possesses, it can be put to use in varied things and applications and scientists are working continuously to identify these potential applications. Some of them can be: Water filtration : The world’s ever growing population is putting a lot of pressure on our water resources so making clean drinkable water to such a huge population is a herculean task. Graphene can come to the rescue in this field as Graphene’s tight atomic bonds make it impermeable for nearly all gasses and liquids. Curiously, water molecules are an exception. Because water can evaporate through graphene while most other gasses and liquids cannot, graphene could be an exceptional tool for filtration. Graphene could also be immensely helpful in purifying water of toxins. In a study published by The Royal Society of Chemistry, researchers showed that oxidized graphene could even pull in radioactive materials such as uranium and plutonium present in water, leaving the liquid free of contaminants. The implications of this study are massive. Some of the biggest environmental hazards in history, including nuclear waste and chemical runoff, could be cleansed from water sources thanks to graphene. Graphene filters have immense potential to improve water purification, increasing the amount of fresh water available. In fact, Lockheed Martin recently developed a graphene filter called “Perforene,” which the company claims will revolutionize the desalination process.Current desalination plants use a method called reverse osmosis to filter salt out of seawater. Reverse osmosis uses pressure to move water through a membrane. In order to produce large amounts of drinkable water, the pressure involved requires enormous amounts of energy. A Lockheed Martin engineer claims their Perforene filters could reduce the energy requirements by a massive hundred times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:06:13.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
