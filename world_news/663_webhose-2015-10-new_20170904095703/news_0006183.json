The feature is available on all versions of Windows since Windows XP.\nMany Windows users that work with large amount of files and documents would like to have the Recycle Bin always at hand, and the system taskbar appears to be the best place for this. This is proved by more than 16,000 votes for such ability on the Windows Uservoice website. Until now, neither standard system tools nor third-party software products allowed users to get the Recycle Bin on the taskbar in a quick and easy way.\nActual Tools offers the solution in the new 8.6 version of its Actual Multiple Monitors product. Now any user can put an additional button onto the system taskbar, and this button looks and behaves exactly as the system Recycle Bin icon on the desktop: a user can drag-n-drop any document onto it, left-click it to open the Recycle Bin folder and right-click it to invoke the Recycle Bin context menu (e.g. to empty the bin). As the taskbar always stays in sight, having the Recycle Bin on it allows to get rid of tedious manipulations with open windows, usually covering the Recycle Bin on the desktop. Actual Multiple Monitors allows putting the Recycle Bin onto secondary taskbars as well, providing the smooth unified operating method on any monitor.\nPricing and availability\nActual Multiple Monitors runs on all Windows platforms from Windows 2000 onwards (including 64-bit editions) and costs 24.95 USD for a single-user license. Discounts for volume buyers are available (please refer to http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/order/#volume_discounts). Additional information on Actual Multiple Monitors, a collection of tutorial articles and success stories, and a 30-day evaluation copy are available on the Actual Tools website.\nLinks\nCompany website: http://www.actualtools.com\nProduct page: http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/\nDownload: http://www.actualtools.com/multiplemonitors/download/#current\nAbout\nActual Tools delivers desktop and window management software for Windows since 2002.
