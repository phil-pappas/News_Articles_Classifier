Reuters/Beck Diefenbach \nEBay Inc reported quarterly revenue and profit above analysts' average estimate on Wednesday as its marketplaces business performed better than expected, sending its shares soaring in after-hours trading. \nThe quarterly results were the first for the company since it spun off its PayPal business in July. \nEBay, whose shares were up 8.6 percent in extended trading, faces intensifying competition across its businesses without PayPal, a leader in the fast-growing digital payment processing market. \nPayPal Holdings Inc, formerly eBay's main growth engine, became a separate company on July 18. \nEBay's competitors include not only Amazon.com Inc but a growing coterie of brick-and-mortar retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Macys Inc which are investing to boost their online presence. \nEBay's net revenue fell to $2.1 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.15 billion in the same quarter last year. \nAnalysts on average had expected revenue of $2.09 billion. \nNet income fell to $539 million, or 45 cents per share, from $673 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding items, the company posted adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents, compared with the average estimate of 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nGross merchandise volume fell 2 percent, including the effect of currency rates. Volume grew 6 percent on an forex-neutral basis. \nThe company's shares closed at $24.21. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr ) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:05:10.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
