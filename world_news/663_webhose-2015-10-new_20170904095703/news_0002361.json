He's launched a number of initiatives to tie the department closer with Silicon Valley and other research centers. \nThe Army itself is striving to \"win in a complex world\" — the title of its now year-old operating concept, a key tenet of which is to establish core competency in innovation. \nThe showroom floor was dotted with examples of new technologies from industry tailored to deal with emerging threats, showing innovation is not just Silicon Valley's game. \n\"If DoD is interested in mature off-the-shelf technology solutions, it should look not just to Silicon Valley, but into the [research and development] shops and development portfolios of its industrial base,\" said Jim Tinsley, a defense analyst and managing director of Avascent. \nOshkosh Defense debuted its Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) 6x6, a technology demonstrator vehicle that provides protection and off-road capability at about half the cost of a wheeled armored personnel carrier, said John Bryant, Oshkosh senior vice president for defense programs. The company has a rich history in M-ATV building, having delivered over 10,000 M-ATV 4x4 vehicles worldwide, including 8,700 for the US Army, he said. \n\"Our M-ATV 6x6 technology demonstrator was really done under Oshkosh internal research and development,\" Bryant said. \"We did not do it in reaction to any particular US government program. What we looked at, though, was that we see worldwide many of our military customers are looking to mechanize their infantry.\" \nBryant added the new vehicle shows the company is \"innovating on existing platforms\" and \"this is a great example of doing that.\" \nWith the US Army soon facing a surplus of hundreds of thousands of Humvees, Textron Systems developed a set of life-extending upgrades for the iconic vehicles that it hopes will save troops' lives as well. Textron unveiled its Survivable Combat Tactical Vehicle (SCTV), which puts a monocoque and v-shaped hull onto existing vehicles, at the AUSA expo. \n\"This is basically a big brother of a Humvee,\" said Jonathan Dalrymple, vice president of business development with Textron Systems' marine and land systems unit. The modifications come in five kits, which the customer can hand pick for their preferred vehicle, but all five need to be installed before a vehicle can be properly called an SCTV. \nBAE Systems also displayed a light tank developed for the Armored Gun System program that was canceled in 1997. The Army's new combat vehicle modernization strategy, revealed for the first time at AUSA, calls for mobile protected firepower (MPF) capability and the vehicle answers the call, BAE said. It combines an expeditionary, C-130 air-droppable, light tank based on technologies from the CV90 family of infantry fighting vehicles and the Bradley, as well as the M8 Armored Gun System. \nThe Army has put out a request for information for MPF, and \"the first thing the Army is going to do is look at what is available and we are responding to that with what we can do with the M8 vehicle,\" said BAE's New & Amphibious Vehicles director, Deepak Bazaz. \nByron Callan, a defense analyst at Capital Alpha, wrote in a memo last week that BAE's effort \"could be an interesting program to watch in FY17-20. Again, with all Army programs, there will be a question of where the funding will come from, but it could take a competitor several $100s of millions to develop their own vehicle.\" \nGeneral Dynamics Land Systems also highlighted an M-1 tank in an SEP V3 configuration that included new armor, an auxiliary power unit and line replaceable units for vehicle electronics, Callan noted. And the company showed a \"Laser Stryker\" capable of countering UAVs and counter-rockets, artillery and mortars, he added. \nBoth a Sikorsky-Boeing team and a Bell Helicopter-Lockheed Martin team showed how they are innovating existing platforms for the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) technology demonstration program prior to the launch of the Army's Future Vertical Lift program of record. Bell is building a next-generation tiltrotor helicopter using its experience manufacturing the V-22 Osprey for the Marine Corps. \nBell and Lockheed also showed a new cockpit design for the V280 Valor the team is building for JMR with one big touch screen spanning the front panel. \nSikorsky brought its S-97 Raider coaxial helicopter that expands on its X2 technology developed in the early 2000s, which broke a speed record in 2010. The company and Boeing are using the technology in X2 and Raider to build a JMR demonstrator called Defiant. \nLockheed Martin also revealed at AUSA its ICARUS counter-UAV system that uses electronic warfare and cyber capabilities against hostile drones. \nAnd BAE's also brought its Battleview 360 agile situational awareness system, which allows soldiers wearing a helmet-mounted monocle to \"see through\" their armored vehicle, made its US debut at the show. The company used its advanced jet fighter technology from the Eurofighter Typhoon helmet to develop the system that consists of a monocle and touch-screen display. The monocle has the ability to see a video feed — both visual and infrared — from the vehicle's cameras and relevant symbology. \nInvesting in innovation based on existing platforms \"would limit exposure to, and impacts of, major cancellations,\" Avascent's Tinsley said. \"And it encourages industry innovation — it provides multiple entry points and incentives for company-funded R&D and demonstration.\" \nAnd while innovation was a big theme at AUSA, Capital Alpha's Callan questioned the real meaning of such a buzzword. \"'Innovation' may prove to be as overused and commandeered a word as was 'transformation.'\" \nStaff writer Andrew Clevenger contributed to this report.
