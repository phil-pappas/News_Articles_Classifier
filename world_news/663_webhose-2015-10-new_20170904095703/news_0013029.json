The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ smartphone, released in September, features a 5.7-inch touchscreen that curves on both sides.\nJennifer Dudley-Nicholson and Rod Chester News Corp Australia Network SMARTPHONE season has struck again and you may face difficult decisions.\nIf you’re a big spender, Apple and Samsung have you covered with new offerings.\nIf you’ve got a smaller budget, Sony, Motorola and Alcatel are waiting to woo you.\nHere are five of the latest and best smartphones for your consideration.\nApple iPhone 6S\nApple / 4.5/5 / $1079-$1379 / apple.com/au\nA new type of touch ... Apple’s almost-released iPhone 6S will offer 3D Touch and a new pink hue. Source: Supplied\nAlong with the new colour option of “rose gold” (that looks just like pink), the 4.7-inch iPhone has been given a swag of improvements, starting with the faster A9 chip, iOS 9 software, and a stronger aluminium frame. Apple’s 3D Touch, which gives you quick access to features by pushing harder with your finger, is a terrific addition to simplify screen navigation. The rear-facing camera has had a major boost to 12 megapixels while the front camera now offers megapixels. Other improvements to impress iPhone photographers are 4K video shooting and the Live Photos feature that adds three seconds of video-like content to a still image. A disappointment with the upgrade is that battery life has not been improved. Out this Friday.\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge+\nSamsung / 4.5/5 / $1199 / samsung.com/au\nCurvy number ... The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ smartphone, released on September 4, features a 5.7-inch touchscreen that curves on both sides. Source: Supplied\nThe most striking member of Samsung’s new smartphone team, the Galaxy S6 Edge+, delivers a host of flourishes. They include curves down both sides of its 5.7-inch touchscreen, a slender 6.9mm body with metal border, and an iridescent finish. Its internal features are just as impressive, however, including wireless charging, a 16-megapixel camera that starts in seconds, five-megapixel front camera, revamped and reliable fingerprint scanner, and an octa-core processor and 4GB RAM to make the most of Google Android Lollipop. Elements have been cut in its makeover — you can no longer add a memory card, remove its battery, or use it as a TV control — but this is the most stylish phablet yet.\nMotorola Moto G 2015\nMotorola / 3.5/5 / $369 / motorola.com.au\nBudget smarts ... Motorola's newest smartphone, the Moto G 2015, features a waterproof body and 13-megapixel camera. Source: Supplied\nThe newest Moto G punches well above its weight, with the biggest upgrades made to its camera and battery life. This phone’s rear camera now boasts a 13-megapixel resolution, while its battery has increased to 2470mAh, which Motorola promises will last you more than a day. This solidly built 5-inch, 4G phone also delivers a full HD screen, 1.4GHz quad-core chip, 16GB storage and space for a card, a splashproof body, pure Android Lollipop, and, surprisingly, room for two SIM cards — a boon for travellers. Ultimately, its camera can’t match its pricey rivals, particularly in low light, and it only offers 1GB RAM, but this budget handset overachieves its price.\nSony Xperia C4\nSony / 3.5/5 / $499 / sonymobile.com/au\nSelfie snapper ... Sony's Xperia C4 smartphone is billed as a top \"selfie\" phone for its 5-megapixel front-facing camera. Source: Supplied\nSony is taking the “here’s looking at you, kid” approach to those who list selfies as one of the top reasons people want a smartphone. The front-facing camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and a 25mm wide-angle lens that will deliver better image quality, and some silly portrait “styles” including “vampire” and “mystery” which add little of value. With a 5.5-inch display, a 2600mAh battery, an octa-core processor, 16GB storage expandable through a memory card, and running Android Lollipop, this mid-priced phone has some features that match higher-end models. Weak points include its average battery life and the cheap-looking plastic build.\nAlcatel OneTouch Idol 3\nAlcatel / 3/5 / $379 / alcatelonetouch.com\nUpside down ... The Alcatel OneTouch idol 3 5 smartphone offers 4G connectivity for less than $400. Source: Supplied\nAlcatel is not a big name in local smartphones but this model, and its extended title, is worth remembering. Strangely, you can turn this phone’s screen upside down and use it just as well as the right way up. That’s thanks to two front-facing speakers that can be used interchangeably. The One Touch Idol 3 also delivers a 5.5-inch screen with 400 pixels per inch, a 13-megapixel rear camera using a Sony sensor, an 8-megapixel front camera, and a quad-core chip. It can show signs of lag occasionally, and its autofocus is sometimes slow, but this is a lot of technology for less than $400.", "external_links": ["http://www.apple.com/au/iphone-6s/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/016b4d7690398f524f78bd0af8f9d14e", "http://www.samsung.com/au/galaxy-s6/", "http://www.sonymobile.com/au/products/phones/xperia-c4/", "http://www.alcatelonetouch.com/global-en/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6f9f7bdefde7923e711f354c2e021ec8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/751f8773a5eb23a23914d81bfcce30e1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/28d67b2cd5bbae504e712d386a261ce6", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/79e879d38c840ab8024365e2df01a7b2", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/557b75e308bbda6dc27d4deeabd24943", "http://www.motorola.com.au/products/moto-g", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-01T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:20:10.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
