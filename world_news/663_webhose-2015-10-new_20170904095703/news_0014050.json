Under the SLSA terms, Canada's federal government agencies can now purchase the integration platform through Scribe's strategic partner, A Hundred Answers , at a pre-negotiated price without going through a competitive bid process. \n\"The addition of Scribe Insight to the SLSA is the catalyst government agencies have been waiting for,\" noted Chuck Emond, principal at A Hundred Answers. \"The Canadian federal government is standardizing on Microsoft Dynamics CRM as its new case management system, but until now, integration challenges posed a major roadblock to adoption. With instant, cost-effective access to Scribe, government agencies can easily integrate Dynamics CRM with all existing applications, unlocking the full value of the case management system.\" \nScribe Insight is the only integration platform for Dynamics CRM that has passed the technical and pricing requirements needed to be included on the SLSA, the Canadian government's pre-approved software list. With this approval, Scribe will accelerate government agencies' migration and integration of legacy data into the new Shared Case Management System (SCMS) based on Dynamics CRM. \n\"Our addition to the SLSA marks a major milestone for Scribe, building on our long history of successful use within government agencies across the world,\" said Shawn McGowan , CEO, Scribe Software. \"It's a reflection of the need for government agencies to improve service through better use of data, and of Scribe's ability to integrate siloed data in real time from diverse systems such as CRM and proprietary databases. We are thrilled to have been selected as the Canadian government's trusted integration platform, and look forward to working with A Hundred Answers to improve the key processes of Canada's government agencies.\" \nScribe Insight is a trusted integration enabler for government agencies throughout North America, including the USDA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Illinois Department of Corrections, the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities, the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania and more.

Whether the data is on premise, in the cloud, or anywhere in between, Scribe's platform includes pre-built adapters and an easy user interface that makes integration fast and affordable. \n\"Integration is a critical component of deploying new systems,\" continued McGowan. \"Canada's government agencies need a full 360-degree view of each individual they serve to successfully leverage the Shared Case Management System, and seamlessly connecting data from relevant sources is central to this view.\" \nTo learn more about the SLSA, visit: http://logiciels-software.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/aaall-slsa/gnrx-gnrl-eng.cfm \nFor more information on Scribe Insight, visit: http://www.scribesoft.com/scribe_insight \nAbout Scribe Software Scribe is an established global provider of solutions that easily bring data anywhere it is needed -- regardless of IT infrastructure.
