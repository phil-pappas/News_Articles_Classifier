October 20, 2015 By Brad Harbison ORLANDO, Fla. — More than 3,000 industry professionals from 80-plus countries have traveled to Nashville, Tenn., for PestWorld 2015, beginning today and concluding on Friday. Scott Ward, president of the Tennessee Pest Control Association, welcomed attendees to PestWorld 2015. Ward is owner of Scott Ward Pest Control, which is based in Alamo, Tenn. NPMA Chief Executive Officer Bob Rosenberg kicked off this year’s conference by reviewing some of the issues and opportunities NPMA works on that members may not be aware of, but have been critical to the industry’s success, including: Becoming a more durable organization. As Rosenberg noted, three years ago NPMA set out to “build a 21st century organization that would meet the needs of 21st century members.” To this end, NPMA has put in place proper internal controls; right-sized and reorganized its staff; rebuilt its committee structure; streamlined board meetings; created more opportunities for member engagement. Created a series of tangible member benefits. This includes the launch of the My NPMA online community which provides members a free photo library; free human resource consulting; discounted background screening services; respiratory fit testing; credit correction support, and more. Made improvements to members’ overall NPMA experience. For example, this past summer NPMA staff designed and implemented of the new comprehensive NPMA database. Played a pivotal role in preserving industry tools. “Probably the most important thing we do on your behalf…is the things that don’t happen,” Rosenberg said. For example, most of the products the structural pest control industry uses have been unaffected despite EPA pressures brought on by the pollinator issue. EPA’s public policy team worked with other groups to ensure that PMPs have the tools they need to get the job done. Following Rosenberg’s comments was the Opening Ceremony, sponsored by Bayer. This year’s performers were Street Corner Symphony, runners up on the 2010 vocal competition The Sing-Off. The group used little more than their own voices to connect with attendees with a set list that ranged from gospel and barbershop to rock and pop. At the Opening Ceremony's conclusion, attendees proceeded to the exhibit hall where they checked out the latest offerings from industry suppliers and networked with industry colleagues.
