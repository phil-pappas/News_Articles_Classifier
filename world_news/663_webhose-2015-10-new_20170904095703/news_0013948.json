On Tuesday, the company said its sales slipped to 154.2 million during the three months that ended in August, down 13 percent from the same period last year.\nThe company, which makes car-stereo antennas, entertainment systems and other electronics, said the lower revenue stemmed largely from the decline in the value of the euro, which fell 18 percent this year from the previous year.\n\"We had budgeted for most of this, though premium audio sales came in below our forecast given increased competition and pricing pressures in some of the retail categories we operate in,\" Voxx chief executive Pat Lavelle said.\nVoxx announced in January that plans to move its corporate headquarters to Orlando by the end of the year. The company, however, has said it will keep a majority of its 330 local jobs on Long Island.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:36:58.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
