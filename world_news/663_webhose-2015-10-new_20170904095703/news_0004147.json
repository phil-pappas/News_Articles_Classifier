The bank needed a secure solution to replace its fragmented loan process and ultimately improve the way loans move through the bank. With nCino’s Bank Operating System, FFSB aims to mend the disjointed flow of information and reduce errors by eliminating unnecessary duplicate data entry. \nKirby W. King, FFSB’s executive vice president and chief lending officer, explained, “nCino’s platform will accelerate our loan cycle duration, allow us to assign accountability to new areas and provide us with a comprehensive view of our customer portfolio. From these benefits we will gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace by making faster, better informed decisions on our customers’ behalf.” \nMichigan-based Oxford Bank selected nCino’s Bank Operating System to achieve similar efficiencies, as well as to enrich its clients’ borrowing experience. Mike Chatas, its senior vice president and chief risk officer, said, “nCino gives us the best opportunity to maximize coworker efficiency and identify and create value for our customers, employees and shareholders alike. Our current systems can inhibit the loan team from optimal performance levels, but the nCino platform is designed to simplify workflows and gain insight into our institution’s complete loan portfolio.\" \nChatas added,“Working faster and smarter to identify and deliver commercial loan solutions, we fundamentally improve the customer’s interaction with our bank. There is no other solution in the market that can support all of these pain points with the same ease and transparency as nCino.” \n“Growth in the market always excites us, and our recent momentum in the Midwest is especially meaningful,” said Josh Glover, senior vice president of community and regional financial institutions at nCino. “We recognize the need among both emerging and seasoned business owners in this region to receive quality, timely financing.
