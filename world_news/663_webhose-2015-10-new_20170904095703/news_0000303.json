CEO Daniel Zhang said.\nThe company, which already owns 18.3 percent of Youku Tudou's U.S.-listed shares, said it's proposing to buy the remaining stock for $26.60 in cash per share, or 30.2 percent more than the last closing price on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAfter subtracting Youku's approximately $1 billion in cash on hand, Alibaba is paying about $3.6 billion to buy the stake.\nThe offer follows a series of moves by Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. to expand into the film industry through its film arm, Alibaba Pictures Group. Recent investments include a deal to collaborate with Paramount Pictures to promote \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,\" the latest in the spy thriller series starring Tom Cruise, and an investment in a movie starring South Korean star Kim Soo-hyun.\nAlibaba made its initial investment in Youku Tudou, which is seen as China's version of Youtube, in 2014.\nThe deal gives Alibaba access to a sophisticated, user-friendly operation. Youku's two private streaming sites, which attract a young audience, have operated with fewer of the restrictions dogging state-run TV broadcasters, allowing it to introduce more varied and foreign content.\nYouku has never turned a profit by standard accounting measures. Its loss for the most recent quarter widened to 342 million yuan ($55.2 million) from 142.3 million yuan in the same period in 2014, according to its latest earnings report.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:46:19.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
