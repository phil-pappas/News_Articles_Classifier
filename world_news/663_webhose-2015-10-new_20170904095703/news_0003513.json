Clarke, Brown and a committee of about 50 organizations planned the parade - beginning at noon, Nov. 8, at South Broad and Walnut Streets - to be in advance of Veterans Day on Nov. 11.\n\"We didn't want to interfere with Veterans Day celebrations either,\" Brown said.\nThe parade starts at South Broad and Walnut Streets, marches north around City Hall and then turns east on Market Street to end at Independence Mall.\nAbout 175 groups have registered to march so far, and 55 vendors related to veterans' needs and benefits will be located at the end of the parade, between Fifth and Sixth and Market and Chestnut Streets, Brown said.\n\"There will be free vendors there helping veterans with all kinds of different services, including tax credits, Veterans Administration benefits, and so on,\" Brown added.\nInformation about the parade can be found at the website ( www.phillyveteransparade.org ).\nThe parade is open to the public, and volunteers are still needed.\nOther annual parades for veterans have taken place in towns such as Media and Bridesburg, but none had been held honoring all veterans in the city of Philadelphia.\n\"Our focus right now is on trying to get everyone all organized, in the proper formation, and help people arrange for parking and street closures,\" said Terry Williamson, a veteran and pro bono publicist for the parade.\nThe route is about one mile, and the event is expected to end at about 3:30 p.m.\nOn television, 6ABC will broadcast the event live until 1:30 p.m.\nThe citywide parade will highlight veterans through history, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, the 50th anniversary of the conflict in Vietnam and the 25th anniversary of Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf, Williamson said.\nThe parade will feature veterans of all eras, military units, civic and youth groups, as well as military and antique vehicles.\nBands from the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point will perform a joint musical program. The two bands next play at the annual Army-Navy football game here on Dec. 12, Williamson said.\nFunding for the parade is being provided by the Greater Philadelphia Traditions Fund, a nonprofit that helps the city finance parades such as the annual Mummers Parade.\nInquirer owner Gerry Lenfest, who served in the Navy during the Korean War, is the fund's top donor.\nearvedlund@phillynews.com\n215-854-2808 @erinarvedlund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:00:01.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
