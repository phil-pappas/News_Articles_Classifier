The researchers estimated the body belonged to a woman who had died between 18 and 23 years of age.\nThe mummified heart, esophagus and colon (containing an enormous amount of feces) were abnormally enlarged, suggesting a symptom of a chronic case of Chagas’ disease – a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi.\nA team of international researchers from California, Puerto Rico and Italy directed by Raul Cano, a professor at the California Polytechnic State University, was able to fully sequence the bacteria DNA in the mummy’s colon and feces.\nThe researchers found abundant DNA belonging to Trypanosoma cruzi, confirming the Chagas disease’s diagnosis already made by Fornaciari in 1992 by other methods.\nThe woman survived for some time, despite having advanced heart disease, megacolon and megaesophagus, suggesting that she was probably treated with drugs, possibly coca leaves.\nAnalysis of the mummy’s microbiome also showed the presence of other disease caused by bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile, from which C difficile infection that causes diarrhea and colitis originates, and some types of human papilloma virus (HPV), a sexually transmitted virus which causes cervical cancer.\nWhile the recovered T cruzi appeared more primitive than modern forms of the modern parasite, it was 98 to 99 per cent similar to today’s virus.\nThe researchers identified many antibiotic-resistant genes that would have made treatment with modern broad-spectrum antibiotics – such as fosfomycin and vancomycin – ineffective.\n“In particular, vancomycin was discovered more than 50 years ago, and vancomycin-resistant genes have been mainly implicated with the increased use of this antibiotic,” the researchers said.\nThe gut microbiome of the mummy, however, shows that antibiotic-resistant genes predate therapeutic use of these compounds.\n 22, 2015 7:28 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:32:32.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
