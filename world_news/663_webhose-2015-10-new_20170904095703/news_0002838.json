They don’t address the root cause for the university fees hike.\nIndeeed the otherwise lethargic student populace has found a legitimate cause to make their collective voice heard. But they need to make it known to the ANC government who is mainly responsible for causing this university fees crisis.\nBut in typical fashion, the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Blade Nzimande, abdicated responsibility during a recent press conference and deflected all blame on university management. He said nothing about how the ANC government have been eroding government funding from universities over the last 10 years or more. Through clever subsidy formulae university subsidies have been systematically siphoned and routed to self-enrichment and petty projects.\nUniversity management have had to be satisfied with the measly budget allocation they got from the Department of Higher Education. The only way universities could survive was to depend more on third stream income, that is income derived from sources other than public subsidies and student fees for tuition or accommodation.\nStudents have already rejected the cap fee hikes at 6% for 2016, announced by Nzimande after meeting with vice-chancellors on Tuesday afternoon, 20 October.\nNzimande told reporters in Cape Town, after the meeting with vice-chancellors from different universities, \"We really urge students to seriously consider the compromise… to seriously take this offer in the interests of the [higher education] system now that examinations are around the corner. We are already concerned about the possible impact of the lack of [teaching] days.\"\nBut vague rhetoric is just not enough. Government need to come up with something more concrete that Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene should address in his mini budget on Wednesday, 21 October.\nMisplaced Anger\nUniversities have borne the brunt of declining government funding. The students’ anger at universities is therefore misplaced and misdirected.\nThese protests are just a symptom of the chronic under-funding of higher education institutions and the R51bn shortfall in NSFAS funding. Nzimande is well aware that the budget of R43.8 billion for 2015/16 for universities is hopelessly inadequate.\nThe students blame the vice-chancellors and university councils for their woes, but it is the ANC government that had slashed the university budgets over the last few years relative to the rate of inflation.\nProfessor Habid, Wits vice-chancellor, who has been vilified and belittled cut a hapless figure while we watched on Sunday how that unruly and raucous student protest leader at Wits – an expelled SRC member in ANC colours, mind you –publicly admonished him.\nAsked to meet with student protesters, Habib was booed down earlier and gagged by the very students for which he, as vice-chancellor, is responsible. As the worst kind of humiliation it was too painfully ridiculous. It’s the meanest insult I’ve yet seen. There has not been such a public spectacle of contempt and disdain for a long time. If anything, our education system has failed to teach our youth simple decorum – to show a morsel of respect towards an elder. No matter how just the cause, it is no excuse for rudeness and disrespect towards your elders.\nWhen directed solely at university management student anger is misguided. The universities are caught between a rock and hard place, squashed between the ANC government’s demand for a drastic increase student enrolment and declining government funding, which to manage the institutions they require to do so.\nThe ANC government, especially Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande, should be held accountable not only for making vain promises they know they cannot keep, but for making impossible demands on university vice-chancellors, demanding that they simultaneously implement affirmative action and research standards and expand class sizes – with greatly diminished budgets.\nHidden Protest Agenda\nOne is struck by just how quickly the ANC jumped on this bandwagon.\nPresident Jacob Zuma’s so-called sympathy with students is therefore hypocritical. ANC spindoctor, Zizi Kodwa, said that they supported the call for fees to fall at higher education institutions. This is deliberate opportunism and duplicity.\nSASCO, the main agitator behind these student uprisings, is driving a hidden ANC political agenda: ahead of next year’s local government elections universities are the political hotbed for youth votes. Furthermore, SASCO believes that by emasculating the vice-chancellors’ authority through mass action, it can wield absolute power at campuses for its own self interest without unintended consequences.\nCorruption at NSFAS\nFees hikes are at the heart of the protests. But there’s a bigger elephant in the room which the protests is not addressing. We’re talking, of course, about the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). For the 2015/16 financial year the NSFAS received a budget of R4.094 billion for 405 000 university study loans from the Department.\nBut already in March 2015 allegations of corruption running into millions at the fund surfaced.\nIn May 2015 Blade Nzimande announced in parliament that an investigation has been launched into corruption at the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFA). “By the end of May 2015, a forensic investigation will have commenced to determine the depth of corrupt practices in the administration of the NSFAS,” he said.\nDepartment officials have openly admitted that the scheme is flawed.\n“We know that NSFAS is not sufficient to cover everyone and again there is an element of corruption and fraud that we are going to make an announcement soon for a forensic investigation around NSFAS because a lot of Money we are convinced gets diverted by university,\" said Higher Education spokesperson Khaye Nkwanyana.\nWith that being said, what has been done to stop the rot at NSFAS? Why has the report on the final outcome of the investigation not yet been released? The Minister should abolish NSFAS completely given its serious flaws or give it a complete overhaul.\nViolent Protests\nBut I had to remind myself that this was South Africa: nobody takes notice of your grievances if you simply hand over a petition.\nViolent protests that cause malicious damage to university and private property at campuses and attacks on fellow students and staff by protesters, like we have witnessed, are reckless and the perpetrators should be charged criminally and expelled. There is no justification for this sort of criminality. We are not educating youth to become learned tsotsies.\nThe disruption of classes and blockading campuses simply cannot be tolerated. This is a critical period on the academic calendar for classes and final exams. The national shutdown of campuses across the country is worrying.\nClasses have been suspended but they need to resume urgently before the fees protests escalate into full-blown higher education chaos. The longer the protests drag on, the more class days will be lost and this will have wider impact on university pass rates.", "external_links": ["http://whoswho.co.za/nhlanhla-nene-7647"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:56:17.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
