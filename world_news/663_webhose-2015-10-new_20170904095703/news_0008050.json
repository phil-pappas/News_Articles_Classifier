Londoners who are thinking of investing in a self-balancing scooter are being urged to reconsider by the Metropolitan Police, as a 180-year-old law means they can only be used on private land.\nAlthough they are powered vehicles, hoverboards are too unsafe to use on British roads, and cannot be licensed or registered under the Highway Act 1835.\nBut in England, Wales and Scotland, it is also an offence to take it for a spin on the pavement, as it can prove to be a dangerous hazard for others.\nGuidance from the Department for Transport says: \"You can only ride an unregistered self-balancing scooter on land which is private property, and with the landowner's permission.\"\nHoverboards have enjoyed an explosion in popularity recently – with Justin Bieber, Chris Brown and Kylie Jenner just some of the celebrities snapped on the \"personal motorised transporters\".\nIt seems unlikely that any enthusiasts will be prosecuted for whizzing down the street on a self-balancing scooter, yet offending Segway users have faced court action in the past.\nBack in January 2011, an unemployed factory worker became the first person in the UK to be convicted of riding a Segway on the pavement – and was slapped with a £75 fine.\nAt the time, campaigners who were pushing for wider Segway use expressed outrage at the ruling.\nThe vehicles do have form for veering off course unexpectedly – even making it difficult for the world's fastest man to leap out of the way in time.\nIn August, Usain Bolt was flattened by a cameraman on a Segway just moments after winning the 200m gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:48:06.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
