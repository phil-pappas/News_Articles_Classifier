The solution, ICARUS™, was designed to operate defensively in various threat environments. \n“The U.S. government is seeing an increase in the use of commercially available UAS platforms for surveillance and weaponization,” said Deon Viergutz, vice president of Cyber Solutions for Lockheed Martin. “What Lockheed Martin has developed in ICARUS is a system that can detect, recognize and counteract these systems with pinpoint accuracy.” \nLockheed Martin’s Counter-UAS system has been field tested and demonstrated to several domestic and international customers over the past year. Those tests demonstrated the ability of ICARUS™ to identify and intercept commercially available unmanned aerial systems. \nThe development of the ICARUS™ software system draws on Lockheed Martin’s rich history of innovations in electronic warfare, cybersecurity and countermeasures associated with sophisticated threats. It was developed through Lockheed Martin internal investment and combines advanced cyber and cyber electromagnetic activity experience with sensor technology and non-kinetic techniques. \nLockheed Martin is a leading provider of advanced cyber security solutions focused on military and intelligence customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:46:30.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
