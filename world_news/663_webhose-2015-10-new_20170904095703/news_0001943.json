Needless to say, what works in the U.S. doesn't necessarily work in China. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151014/276881 \nThose looking for pragmatic guidance on how to conduct PR in China will be interested in attending the seminar \"Cracking the China PR Code\" that will take place on Nov. 17 from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the offices of Andreessen Horowitz (2865 Sand Hill Road, Suite 101, Menlo Park, CA). \nThe session will examine questions such as: -- What are the PR mistakes that American companies make time and time again in China? -- Should you care about the \"De-IOE Movement\" if you're not IBM, Oracle or EMC? -- What is the media landscape like in China? -- How does social media in China intersect with business communications? \nThe seminar's four featured speakers bring 25+ years of hands-on experience in China: -- William Moss, Senior Director, Global Corporate Communications, Motorola Mobility -- Michael Pranikoff, Global Director Emerging Media, PR Newswire -- Cassandra Cheong, Managing Director, Hoffman Asia Pacific -- Jenny Chan, Vice President, Hoffman Asia Pacific \nDesigned for companies of all sizes, including startups, the seminar hosts a mix of speakers offering both in-house and agency perspectives. \n\"Simply reading the news accounts of China President Xi Jinping visiting the U.S. last month shows the complexity in the China dynamic,\" said Lou Hoffman, CEO of The Hoffman Agency. \"Still, U.S. tech companies need the air cover of PR to succeed in China. That's what this seminar is all about -- helping people with the day-to-day mechanics of PR in China.\" \nThe sponsors behind the seminar are PRWeek Asia , PR Newswire , The Hoffman Agency and Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition (SVTC). \nThere is a $35 charge for the seminar with all proceeds being donated to SVTC. \nSpace is limited to 80 attendees, so those interested are encouraged to sign up as soon as possible.
