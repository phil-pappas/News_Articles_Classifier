Related Content India's Modi set to meet with Zuckerburg \nOver the past few years, Microsoft has said that its Surface tablets would replace traditional laptops, but now the company has a backup product -- just in case. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book looks like a MacBook at a glance. How it works is much more interesting -- and intuitive. \nJust like the Surface, the new Surface Book can be used as a full-powered laptop or as a tablet. You can also snap the display screen to the back of the keyboard so it acts like a clipboard. \nLenovo has a similar product -- its Yoga series -- but Microsoft's Surface Book is thinner, lighter and easier to use. Microsoft also said it can run for 12 hours on a single charge. \nAt an event in New York Tuesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company's goal is to \"reinvent\" products. The 13.5-inch Surface Book will go on sale on October 26 (preorders start Tuesday) and will cost $1,499. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
