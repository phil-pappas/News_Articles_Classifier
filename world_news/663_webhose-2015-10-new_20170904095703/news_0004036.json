The two maps represent nearly back-to-back rotations of the planet, making it possible to determine the speeds of Jupiter’s winds.\nThe new images confirm that the Great Red Spot continues to shrink and become more circular, as it has been doing for years. The long axis of this characteristic storm is about 150 miles (240 kilometers) shorter now than it was in 2014. Recently, the storm had been shrinking at a faster-than-usual rate, but the latest change is consistent with the long-term trend.\nThe Great Red Spot remains more orange than red these days, and its core, which typically has more intense color, is less distinct than it used to be. An unusual wispy filament is seen, spanning almost the entire width of the vortex. In Jupiter’s North Equatorial Belt, the researchers found an elusive wave that had been spotted on the planet only once before, decades earlier, by Voyager 2.\nThe findings appear online in Astrophysical Journal paper.\n 14, 2015 9:03 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:13:24.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
