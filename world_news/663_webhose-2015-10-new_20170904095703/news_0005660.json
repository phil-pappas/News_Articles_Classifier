By JACK GILLUM and STEPHEN BRAUNAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The private email server Hillary Rodham Clinton used while secretary of state was connected to the Internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers. \nAn Associated Press review found her server used remote-access software that allowed connections directly from the Internet.

She has yet to detail how well it was secured, or if it received regular software updates that could have protected it from intrusions.
