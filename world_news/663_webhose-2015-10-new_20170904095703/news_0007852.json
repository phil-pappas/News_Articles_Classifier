Bloomberg Share on twitter by Sarah Danckert Lodging website Airbnb and online travel agency eDreams have been told to clean up their act after running afoul of Australian consumer law for slugging customers with service and other fees that were not properly disclosed when they were booking accommodation.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a statement both companies misled and deceived customers by failing to adequately disclose to consumers in Australia these mandatory fees, including service fees and, in the case of Airbnb, cleaning fees.\nThe ACCC has accepted court enforceable undertakings from the brands' respective parent companies – Airbnb Ireland and Vacaciones eDreams SL – following concerns that the companies made online price representations to consumers in Australia that were in breach of the Australian Consumer Law.\nAirbnb, a darling of the so-called disruptive or sharing economy, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct since November 2012 by failing to adequately disclose service fees and cleaning fees applied by the accommodation host, according to the ACCC.\nThe ACCC said from January to December 2014, eDreams engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by failing to properly disclose the service fee and payment fee charged to customers.\neDreams also failed to provide a single total price that included the mandatory service fee and payment fee as required by Australian consumer law.\nThe ACCC found both companies had engaged in \"drip pricing\", where the headline price advertised at the start of an online purchasing process is plumped up by the incremental disclosure of additional fees and charges.\n\"Drip feeding consumers with information about charges can cause detriment to competition and result in consumers paying a higher price than the advertised price or spending more than they realise,\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.\n \"The law does not prevent traders from charging fees. However, it does require that fees are disclosed clearly to avoid consumers being misled.\"\nThe ACCC said both groups had cooperated with the regulator during the investigation and accepted they had made the contraventions.\nA spokesman from Airbnb said: \"We've taken note of the ACCC's concerns, and we'll be working to make sure our platform addresses those concerns.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sdanck"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:19:52.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
