The non-employee workforce, including consultants, contingent, part-time and temporary workers, volunteers, and even vendor employees who work on-site, make up a significant segment of the workforce for many organizations. However, because these workers aren’t typically hired through the traditional, centralized human resources on-boarding processes, many companies neglect to background check them, leaving open a potential security gap. The alliance extends the IQNavigator ecosystem of technology and solution partners which is focused on solving complex contingent labor challenges.\nHireRight is a leading provider of global background checks and drug and health testing, which can also enable companies to screen and hire non-employee workers with the same due diligence that permanent hires receive. This alliance extends the IQNavigator ecosystem of technology and solution partners, which is focused on aligning the best possible set of solutions to solve complex contingent labor challenges. This partnership will result in an integrated solution that will allow IQNavigator customers to access, order, and manage background checks directly from their contingent workforce management system, improving workflow and efficiency, and speeding time-to-hire.\n“It’s estimated that contingent or contract-based workers account for about a third of the average company’s workforce. This represents a major slice of a company’s talent. Since all workers, both full-time and contingent, ultimately represent an employer’s brand, it is imperative that every worker passes the same level of due diligence. This ensures your company has the best people on your team and that you are protected from compliance and liability issues,” said Kevin Poll, Vice President of Strategic Alliances, IQNavigator. “We’re pleased to partner with HireRight, which has led the industry in innovative screening solutions for the contingent workforce.”\n“HireRight recently conducted a study that revealed only 29 percent of companies screen their non-employee workers—a statistic that illustrates how many companies leave themselves open to potential risk in terms of compliance and workplace issues,” said Mary O’Loughlin, Vice President of Customer Experience, HireRight. “HireRight’s solution helps companies find the right workers for the job and helps contingent workers get hired. At the same time, it ensures that these workers will be ambassadors for a company’s brand. We‘re happy to partner with IQNavigator to help customers make their hiring processes more secure.”\nTo learn more, visit IQNavigator at booth #2647 and HireRight at booth #1545 during the HR Technology Conference (HR Tech), October 18-21 in Las Vegas.\nAbout IQNavigator\nIQNavigator is the leading independent technology provider of Vendor Management System (VMS) software for Global 2000 companies.
