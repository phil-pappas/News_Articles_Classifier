Finalists were chosen from hundreds of businesses that entered or were nominated for the titles. \nWith ContactWorld, built on the Salesforce platform, Britain's leading floorcare brand has been able to offer its customer base a completely unique and personalized experience, boosting first contact resolution to an industry-leading 87 percent, while improving employee satisfaction and business efficiencies. Average call handling has been reduced by 20 seconds, the number of calls handled by advisors has increased by 25 percent, and employee satisfaction within the customer service team has rocketed, from being the lowest ranking department in the organization, to the highest. \n\"Customer experience is a top priority for Vax, so it's a real honor to be chosen as a finalist in both categories,\" said Carole Edwards, head of customer contact at Vax. \"I have to pinch myself. We've got a great new contact center, a highly motivated customer engagement team and efficiency has escalated. With NewVoiceMedia's technology we now have a 360-degree view of customer contact, automatic logging of all call activity, and are able to recognise customers at the point that the call is answered and offer them an excellent, personalized service.
