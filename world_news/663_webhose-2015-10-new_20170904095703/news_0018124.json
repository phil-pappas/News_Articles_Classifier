This release of the z/OS application profiler includes a z/Architecture instruction speed tester, which can determine the relative and actual speed of over 900 hardware instructions. \nFred Hoschett, Phoenix Software International president, said, \"Performance of individual z/Architecture hardware instructions vary considerably. Having the information that the zHISR Instruction Speed tester provides could be useful when trying to determine why a given area in the Spot Analysis is so 'hot.' With this feature, it's now even easier for programmers to pinpoint and optimize inefficient code.\" \nzHISR interfaces directly with z/OS Hardware Instrumentation Services on IBM Â®", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:01:27.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
