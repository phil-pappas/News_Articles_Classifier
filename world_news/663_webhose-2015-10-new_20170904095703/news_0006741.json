This new platform is designed to give drivers deeper insight about the driving experience-access to a variety of information about the status of the vehicle's vitals, remote control of things like auxiliary heating, the ability to open and close the door lock from afar, a convenient navigation tool via iPhone ( News - Alert ) and Apple Watch, and other new features. \nThe release of the Mercedes me app further positions Mercedes-Benz as a leader in an increasingly connected world. Digitization has been a key strategic issue in all areas of the company for several years. Core to this digital transformation is rapid software development that will enable the company to compete and win in the luxury automobile market and support ambitious company goals-by 2020, all vehicles will be emission-free and will feature autonomous driving and deep levels of Internet connectivity. \nTo support these important company initiatives, Mercedes-Benz looked to the agile software development services of Pivotal Labs and Pivotal's cloud native platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry supercharged with the developer framework Spring Boot. Mercedes-Benz can now implement the extremely rapid deployment of highly scalable and flexible products and solutions in response to demanding customer requirements. Within the project, Pivotal Labs brings the culture and successful methdology of software development from Silicon Valley to Stuttgart and helps Mercedes-Benz adapt and further develop this know-how. \nScott Yara, Co-President of Pivotal, and Christoph Hartung, Head of Connected Cars for Mercedes-Benz, presented the joint project at the Car IT Congress in Frankfurt and explained the background of the collaboration.
