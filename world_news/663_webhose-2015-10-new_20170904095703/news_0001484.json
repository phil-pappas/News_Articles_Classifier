At the time, the brewer said it expected the two transactions to close in November. On Monday, AB InBev said it was fielding questions on the deals from the Justice Department and California.\nThe maker of Budweiser is in discussions with the Justice Department and the California attorney general’s office about a plan to acquire two distributors in the state, deals that would give the beer giant more heft in California and potentially put pressure on craft brewers.\nKristin Ford , a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Kamala Harris , declined to comment on the distributor discussions. The company said it was cooperating with the attorney general and the Justice Department “to address any questions they have.” Peter Carr , a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment.\nAnalysts say it is likely that the U.S. Justice Department will seek the breakup of MillerCoors, the joint venture that SABMiller formed with Molson Coors in 2008 to combine their U.S. operations. That partnership owns several major brands in the United States, including Miller Lite, Coors Lite and Blue Moon .\nThe deal would also give Anheuser-Busch InBev more exposure to faster-growing emerging markets, particularly in Africa.\nUnder the terms of the latest proposal, Anheuser-Busch InBev is offering to pay about $67 a share for SABMiller. That is up from an offer of $66.30 a share in cash made Monday, and it would represent more than a 50 percent premium to SABMiller’s closing price in mid-September before Anheuser-Busch InBev’s approach was first announced.\nThe revised proposal also still depends on the support of SABMiller’s two largest shareholders: the U.S. tobacco giant Altria Group and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Combined, they own about 41 percent of SABMiller’s outstanding shares.\nThey would need to accept an alternative plan in which they would receive restricted shares and a smaller amount of cash at $59.56 a share, a discount to the cash price. Under that proposal, they would receive 0.483969 of a restricted share and $5.77 a share in cash for each share they hold in SABMiller.\nAs a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would probably pay $103.6 billion. As part of the latest proposal, Anheuser-Busch InBev would agree to pay a $3 billion fee to SABMiller in the event that the deal failed to receive regulatory approval, the companies said.\nBloomberg News contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:53:21.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
