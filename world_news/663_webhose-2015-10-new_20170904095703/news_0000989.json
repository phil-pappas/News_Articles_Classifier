Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operational performance. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating 8x8’s ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. \nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. \nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income Per Share \nWe have defined non-GAAP net income as net income for GAAP plus gain on patent sale, non-cash tax adjustments, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Non-cash tax adjustments represent the differences between the amount of taxes we expect to pay and our GAAP tax provision each period. We have excluded stock-based compensation expense because it relies on valuations based on future events, such as the market price of our common stock, that are difficult to predict and are affected by market factors that are largely not within the control of management. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because it is a non-cash expense that we do not consider part of ongoing operations when assessing our financial performance, as it relates to accounting for certain purchased assets. We have excluded gain on patent sale because we consider it to have been an isolated transaction and believe it is not reflective of our ongoing operations, and it reduces comparability of periodic operating results when it is included. We have excluded acquisition-related expenses because these expenses are difficult to predict and are often one-time. We define non-GAAP net income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. We define non-GAAP net income percentage of revenue as non-GAAP net income divided by revenue. The GAAP and non-GAAP weighted average number of diluted shares to calculate GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share are the same. We believe that such exclusions facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry, and provides investors with information that we use in evaluating management’s performance on a quarterly and annual basis. \nForward Looking Statements \nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
