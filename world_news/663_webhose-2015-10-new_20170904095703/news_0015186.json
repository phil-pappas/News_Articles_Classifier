The workshop topics are Park Systems AFM automatizing software using Self Optimizing Scan Control and Park Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) Technology and Its Applications. Park will also unveil the Park NX10 SICM module that enables innovative electrochemistry studies. This workshop is open to all interested in this topic and includes lunch. “Park Systems NX10 is the major nano scientific instrument and atomic force microscope used at our Nano Shared Facility and it is an honor to have founder Dr. Sang-il Park, return to his alma mater and present at the seminar,” states Tobi Beetz, PhD Associate Director, Stanford Nano Shared Facilities. “We encourage all researchers to attend this event and to utilize the state-of-the- art Park Atomic Force Microscope equipment that we have available.” Dr. Sang-il Park, distinguished Stanford Alumni and founder of Park Systems will present on Park’s continuous innovations in atomic force microscopy including the revolutionary advancement, SmartScan that automatizes the imaging function using AFM just like today's point-and-click digital cameras. Park Systems advanced SmartScan is a pioneering AFM intelligence that produces high quality imaging with a single click. SmartScan’s unique design opens up the power of AFM nanoscopic tools to everyone and drastically boosts the productivity of all users. “Park Systems unprecedented upgrades in AFM equipment over the years provide capabilities never before available that advance the ease at which we are able to examine nanoscale particles in various states,“ states Dr. Sang-il Park, Park Systems Chairman and CEO. “Our goal is to provide researchers with reliable and repeatable high resolution imaging of nanoscale cell structures in any environment by offering a platform of advanced easy-to-use nanoscale AFM and SICM tools.” The complimentary half day seminar titled, “The Latest Advances in Atomic Force Microscopy” on Nov. 10 at the Stanford Nano Shared Facility includes a complimentary lunch and is open to all interested in learning more about AFM. It will be extremely beneficial to researchers interested in nanoscale imaging, materials property investigation, bio sciences, semiconductor analysis, as well as biochemistry researchers (hydrogel, nanopore membrane, electrochemistry) and electrochemistry researchers. The seminar will include a live demonstration of Park NX-10 and discussion of Automatizing AFM using Self Optimizing Scan Control and use of Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy on Park NX10 AFM Systems. About the Seminar Title: A Live Demo Workshop: The Latest Advances in Atomic Force Microscopy Date: Tuesday, November 10, 9 am - 1 pm Place: Stanford Nanoshared Facility at Stanford University 450 Serra Mall Register: Online at http://www.parkafm.com or email inquiry(at)parkafm(dot)com About Stanford Nano Shared Facility The Stanford Nano Shared Facilities (SNSF) is a group of service centers (Nanofabrication, Electron & Ion Microscopy, X-ray & Surface Analysis and Soft & Hybrid Materials) that includes the Stanford Nanocharacterization Laboratory, the Nanopatterning Lab, the Ginzton Microfab, and the Soft and Hybrid Materials Facility. SNSF’s purpose is to provide shared scientific instrumentation, laboratory facilities, and expert staff support to enable multidisciplinary research and educate tomorrow’s scientists and engineers. All SNSF equipment and services are operated as a service center. SNSF has facilities in the McCullough, Moore, Spilker and Shriram buildings. The newest facilities are are located in the Spilker and Shriram buildings, at the heart of the new Science and Engineering Quad. Most of the SNSF laboratory space is located in an extensive underground level, 18 feet deep, accessible from the basement levels of both the Spilker, Shriram and the Huang Engineering Center, but seismically isolated from both. This space provides a home with cutting-edge specifications on the control of vibration, acoustics, electromagnetic interference, light, and cleanliness that are essential for the manipulation of matter down to the molecular and atomic scale.
