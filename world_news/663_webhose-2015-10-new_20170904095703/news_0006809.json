We have to strike a balance.\"\nPreviously, Mr Johnson said in his weekly Daily Telegraph column that the app was \"allowing private hire vehicles to behave like black taxis: to be hailed, to ply for hire in the streets, to do exactly what the law says they are not supposed to do\".\nBut it would be \"nuts\" to ban the technology behind the app and called for Uber, private hire firms and black cabs to work together and \"find a balance\" for the benefit of London.\nUber has criticised separate proposals to tighten private hire regulation in London following TfL's launching of a consultation on a series of measures that would affect minicab drivers.\nThey include the introduction of an interval of at least five minutes between a booking and the start of a journey, to allow drivers to plan an appropriate route.\nOther proposals involve a requirement for drivers to pass an English language test and a map reading assessment, while firms might have to operate a fixed landline telephone and accept bookings up to seven days in advance.\nUber has collected thousands of names from customers in a petition and warned the changes \"will mean an end to the Uber you know and love today\".\nPoll loading â€¦\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:34:23.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
