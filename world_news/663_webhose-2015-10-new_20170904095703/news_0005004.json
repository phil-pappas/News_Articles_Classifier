It said that the \"safe harbor\" deal enables interference by U.S. authorities with fundamental rights and contains no reference either to U.S. rules to limit any such interference or to effective legal protection against it.\nThe court said the effect of the ruling is that the Irish data commissioner will now be required to examine Schrems' complaint \"with all due diligence.\"\nOnce it has concluded its investigation, the authority must \"decide whether ... transfer of the data of Facebook's European subscribers to the United States should be suspended on the ground that that country does not afford an adequate level of protection of personal data,\" the court said in a summary of its ruling.\nFacebook said it couldn't immediately comment.\nSchrems said he hoped the ruling will be a milestone for online privacy.\n\"This decision is a major blow for U.S. global surveillance that heavily relies on private partners,\" Schrems said in a statement. \"The judgement makes it clear that U.S. businesses cannot simply aid U.S. espionage efforts in violation of European fundamental rights.\"\nHowever, he noted that the ruling doesn't bar data transfers from the EU to the U.S., but rather allows national data protection authorities to review individual transfers.\n\"Despite some alarmist comments I don't think that we will see mayor disruptions in practice,\" Schrems said.\nSophie In't Veld, a leading Liberal lawmaker in the European Parliament, welcomed the ruling and called the \"safe harbor\" decision \"a travesty of legality.\"\n\"We need clear rules to govern the transfer of personal data to the U.S. and other non-EU countries,\" she said. \"But they must be legally watertight, provide real and meaningful protection, and there must be proper enforcement.\"\n____\nGeir Moulson in Berlin and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to the story.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:24:56.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
