Amy Pollock has more. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nThere's much excitement around the possibilities of 3D printing. And now it could even capture German sweet lovers' imaginations. Candy-maker Katjes is tempting the taste buds of Berliners with custom-made fruit gum sweets, using a 3D printer they say is the first to print edible treats. The Magic Candy Factory in Berlin prints individual shapes from octopuses to pyramids - or even special messages in fruit gum candy. (SOUNDBITE) (English) (ENGLISH), MANAGING DIRECTOR MAGIC KATJES UK, MELISSA SNOVER, SAYING: \"The Magic Candy Factory focuses on the idea that science actually is magic and if we look at it that way and we focus on the amazing ability to create, and not the cold technology side, then we create an incredible experience for the customer and start getting people warmed up to 3D-printed food.\" Customers can choose from a range of 14 designs and several different fruit flavours on a tablet. The trade-marked 3D printer then expels heated fruit gum mixture to build the design into a 3D product. (SOUNDBITE) (German) MANAGING DIRECTOR \"MASALI\" PUBLIC RELATIONS, STEPHANIE SPECKMANN, SAYING: \"The heated fruit gum mixture is transmitted via a nozzle and line by line, it creates a shape or a word. Because the fruit gum mixture dries immediately, we are able to put one layer on top of the other. This is how we achieve the 3D effect.\" Creating your own candy shape comes with a price tag of five euros, or ten euros per word. Katjes hopes to entice kids both big and small into candy stores with its new customised confectionary.
