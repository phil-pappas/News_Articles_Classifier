EMV stands for Europay, MasterCard ( MA - Get Report ) and Visa ( V - Get Report ) - the companies that conceived the safety standard. \"It has been so easy for criminals to gather information off of the magnetic stripe on cards that the industry has moved to this EMV chip ,\" said David Brown, CEO of Atlanta-based Web.com Group (WWWW), an Internet marketing company for small businesses. \"The chip contains information, talks to the computer and validates the card.\" Wal-Mart ( WMT - Get Report ) , Target ( TGT - Get Report ) , Costco ( COST - Get Report ) and Walgreens ( WBA ) are among the major retailers that have equipped stores with credit card processors that can handle EMV credit cards. Consumers may have noticed that their credit card company sent them a new card. That's because credit card companies were issued a mandate to provide customers with the EMV enabled credit cards. The deadline was Oct. 1. The technology aims to decrease credit card fraud . Retailers or credit card issuers who don't comply with the new technology will be financially responsible for any fraud committed. Financial technology firm FIS says there are 1.24 billion cards and 15.4 million terminals in use worldwide, making the transition all the more complex. Small business owners are also coping with the change, but Brown says the switch shouldn't be costly. \"Most banks are being very helpful at providing that technology to small business owners at little to no cost, so it's just a matter of making the move,\" he added. The changes come as October has been designated National Cyber Security Awareness Month by President Obama. Brown thinks the government and corporate America are only now awakening to the full threat to cyber security. \"We've seen tens of millions of dollars invested by Target and Home Depot ( HD ) to protect themselves,\" Brown added. \"You're going to see a lot more investment [in cyber security] by businesses and the government.\" Check Out Our Best Services for Investors \nPortfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.
