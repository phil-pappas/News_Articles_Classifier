Photo: Justin Benson-Cooper\nDANIELLE LE MESSURIER PerthNow IT took a Beatles lyric, an aquatics instructor and social media to return Chloe Hutson’s long-lost holiday photographs five years after her camera fell to the watery depths of a river in the Czech Republic.\nAfter a whitewater-rafting misadventure in 2010, Ms Hutson thought her waterproof camera – containing more than 1000 travel photos from her European trip – was forever doomed at the bottom of the Vltava River.\nThrough a combination of extraordinary circumstances, the 28-year-old Murdoch University student was contacted out of the blue this week by a Czech woman on Facebook.\nChloe Hutson thought her camera was doomed to the bottom of a river in the Czech Republic.

Source: Supplied\n“She told me her husband was running an aquatics camp on the river and had found my camera when one of their boats capsized. She said that the camera had been destroyed, but amazingly the memory card still worked,” Ms Hutson said.\n“I was completely shocked. It came out of nowhere. I was just amazed she had been able to find me.”\nChloe lost the camera after she capsized on a river trip. Source: Supplied\nCzech couple Hana Zajícková and Lubomir Zajícek retraced the traveller’s steps through her photographs in an effort to track her down, even visiting the hotel she stayed at five years ago.\nThe couple also posted a photo of the “lost girl” that received more than 26,000 shares, making her the “most wanted girl in the Czech Republic”.\nA post on social media sparked a massive hunt for the camera’s owner. Source: Supplied\nMs Zajícková told The Sunday Times Ms Hutson had become a “big star”, not just in Prague, but throughout the entire Republic.\n“Many newspapers write about her, the radios speak about her – she is very famous. We are so glad we managed to find her,” she said.\nChloe and her friend by the wall at Abbey Road Studios in London where Chloe has written her name.

Source: Supplied\nMs Hutson said the remarkable set of circumstances wouldn’t have been successful without the dedication of the couple and the power of social media.\n“If Facebook didn’t exist they would have struggled to try and find me. Even with a name it’s one of those things that would have been really difficult,” she said.\n“With all the horrible things happening in the world at the moment it’s nice to know people actually still care, even if they’re random strangers.”\nThe camera and memory card are currently making the 13,000km journey back to Perth.\nOriginally published as Reunited after five years in watery grave", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/740243254a86b316696a80bdc7224628", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/15f9a8fb83398c0134046bc5dda2bc30", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/36dbc5013f6f6c96dd940614d7b49e10", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/perth-students-camera-returned-after-five-years-on-bottom-of-prague-river/news-story/dbd1ffd077ceaf10227169cd47dadd7b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/21b8daf6c5621d51398835d08536cd9e", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2c1b5a90654c67d21d3486d3a4f6312d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1ad59f139e78d569e57840ddfdca1774", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/bd9c7de3c8fb0423b300808436701178", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-20T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:24:07.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
