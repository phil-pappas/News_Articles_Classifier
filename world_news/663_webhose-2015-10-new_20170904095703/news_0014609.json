Fox as Marty McFly in the 1985 film 'Back to the Future'. \nHollywood star Christopher Lloyd has revealed he would “love” to return to the part of Doc Brown from 'Back to the Future'. \nThe 76-year-old actor appeared in the original movies in the ever-popular sci-fi franchise and has revealed he'd be keen to reprise the role, although he's admitted it's an unlikely prospect. \nHe told Entertainment Weekly: “It would have to be really, really innovative and match the quality of the first films, and that's a tough thing to do. \n“Usually sequels don't measure up to the quality of the original. It'd be tough at this point.” \nMeanwhile, Robert Zemeckis - who created and directed the original sci-fi movies, starring Michael J. Fox - revealed recently that he will block any attempt to make another 'Back to the Future' movie. \nAsked if he'd like to make another film, Robert said: “Oh, God no. \n“That can't happen until both [co-writer Bob Gale] and I are dead. And then I'm sure they'll do it, unless there's a way our estates can stop it.” \nThe original 'Back to the Future' movie was released in July 1985 and has made close to a billion dollars worldwide. \nFemaleFirst", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:24:43.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
