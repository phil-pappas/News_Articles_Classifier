Nationwide sales of non-hybrid electric vehicles almost tripled to 87,531 in the first nine months, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. \nBut that represented only about half of one percent of the total auto market. \nazk/slb/jom", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:36:28.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
