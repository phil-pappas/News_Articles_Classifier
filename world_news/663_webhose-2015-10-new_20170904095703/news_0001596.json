Its first product, which rolls out Thursday, lets Uber drivers get instant paychecks.\n“It’s essentially a cash advance,” said founder and CEO Andrew D’Souza. Drivers give Clearbanc access to their Uber accounts to verify their hours. (Other driver services such as SherpaShare , which analyzes earnings, also integrate with drivers’ Uber records.) Clearbanc deposits drivers’ earnings daily onto a Visa debit card for a $2 fee each time (with no fee on days drivers don’t work). D’Souza said the company may add an on-demand payment system. Uber pays drivers weekly.\nLyft last week implemented a similar service called Express Pay for its drivers , which carries a 50-cent fee each time they receive an immediate payment.\n“This is just the initial hook; we’ll roll out a complete suite of banking features,” D’Souza said. Future products will help with taxes, track income and expenses, and provide budgeting advice.\nSeveral companies are targeting financial products at freelancers, who now account for over a third of the U.S. workforce. Mountain View’s Intuit this year started a business unit called Self-Employed Solutions, and offers a version of its QuickBooks software for this market . But Zen99, a startup offering tax, financial management and insurance tools for freelancers, shut down in late August . \nD’Souza hopes Clearbanc will lure independent workers by providing a one-stop shop for all their banking needs — including eventually switching their bank accounts to it. It has partnered with Wave Crest, a Gibraltar bank with a U.S. presence. It’s also affiliated with the MoneyPass ATM network, which has more than 24,000 surcharge-free machines nationwide, he said.\n“No bank is designed for self-employed professionals,” he said. “We want to provide a better banking experience for them.”\nClearbanc is part of Y Combinator’s new YC Fellowship program aimed at very early-stage startups. The program included $12,000 in funding. D’Souza said other funding is in the works. He declined to say how many people work at Clearbanc, other than that it’s a “small but growing team.”\nCarolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
