The EU limits data-sharing with countries deemed lax on privacy, a list that particularly includes the US after Edward Snowden's allegations of en masse data collection by the US government.\nRecommended: Foreign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game The court ruling to remove Safe Harbor represents a culture clash, because the EU views data privacy as a fundamental right , while the US is willing to override that right in favor of national security.\nForeign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game The decision will affect major tech companies that require massive amounts of data sharing, such as Facebook, and Amazon.com, which stores data from European companies on its retail site.\n\"This is extremely bad news for EU-US trade,\" Richard Cumbley, the Global Head of technology, media and telecommunications at Linklaters law firm told Reuters. \"Without Safe Harbor, (businesses) will be scrambling to put replacement measures in place.\"\nThe decision does not automatically stop data transfers, The Wall Street Journal reports . What it does do is assign international tech regulators the right and responsibility to investigate the security standards of US companies. Before, regulators could not do so because of Safe Harbor.\nMany companies that have already put in place European Union-standard security methods should not need a significant policy change. What is different is that watchdogs no longer have to take such companies at their word.\nRecommended: Europe pivots between safety and privacy online \"Companies will be working in a legal vacuum,\" Paul Meller, communications director for tech-lobbying outfit Digital Europe, told the Journal. \"Many companies would be exposing themselves to legal action.\"\nUS companies that share data with countries in the European Union and regulators alike may now have a lot more work to do, because Safe Harbor had offered a blanket defense from lawsuits and investigations before.\nThis report includes material from Reuters.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-court-strikes-down-trans-atlantic-safe-harbor-data-transfer-pact-1444121361?mod=e2twhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-court-strikes-down-trans-atlantic-safe-harbor-data-transfer-pact-1444121361?mod=e2tw&cb=logged0.2517350285779685", "http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34442618"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:57:47.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
