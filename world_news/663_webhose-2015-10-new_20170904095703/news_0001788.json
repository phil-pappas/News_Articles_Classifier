Using the Gigwalk mobile app, volunteers from leading technology companies are delivering Disaster Preparedness Kits to homebound seniors in SROs across the City, while collecting critical data on living conditions, as part of the FSTF’s initiative to improve access to healthy and nutritious food for SRO residents. \nGigwalk’s location-based technology is directing volunteers to deliver more than 500 Disaster Preparedness Kits, containing a two-day supply of food, water, blanket, glow stick and whistle. Tech company partners include Gigwalk, Twitter, AdRoll, Splunk, Lyft, SuccessFactors, Zendesk and Pinterest. FSTF members represent 15 community based organizations and government agencies addressing hunger in San Francisco. \nCompiling the data will be critical to driving community interventions by FSTF member agencies and guiding long-term policy recommendations to the Board of Supervisors. Twenty-four percent of seniors served by MOWSF have no other source of food – making the kits critical should a disaster delay meal deliveries. \n“We’re thrilled to be working with local technology companies who’ve offered their time to ensure seniors are prepared in the event of a natural disaster,” said Danie Belfield, Director of Volunteers for Meals On Wheels of San Francisco. “Gigwalk’s app will enable volunteers to collect actionable data about living conditions, providing a new level of visibility into SRO conditions, so we can improve how we service seniors across the City.” \nTwitter will be contributing the largest number of employee volunteers as part of its #FridayForGood campaign, a biannual company-wide day of service to their communities. Training prior to the event will take place at Twitter HQ and will be streamed live to all participating company teams. \n“Tech companies need to spend time helping the communities where we work,” said Gigwalk CEO, David Hale. “Gigwalk is proud to partner with Meals on Wheels SF, the Food Security Task Force, and local tech companies to deliver disaster kits and to collect data about SRO conditions. Our work with MOWSF is an important part of Gigwalk for Good, our community outreach program.” \nAbout Meals On Wheels of San Francisco (MOWSF) \nMeals On Wheels of San Francisco and its volunteers provide seniors what they need to live independent and dignified lives – nutritious meals, professional social work and friendly human contact. This year we will deliver more than 1.5 million nutritious meals to homebound seniors living in every neighborhood of the city.
