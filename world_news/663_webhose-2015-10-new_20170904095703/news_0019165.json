Cedexis’ video solution significantly improves end users’ video experiences. Streaming Media 100 focuses exclusively on the technology companies that enable content creators and publishers to innovate and build their online video audiences. Cedexis flagship product, Openmix, is a key contributor to optimizing website and mobile performance for video content delivery, over multiple CDNs and hybrid CDN and cloud architectures.\nCedexis’ video solution has been referred to by its customers as the “ Buffer Killer .” As video encoding moves from 720p to 1080p and now 4K, the demands on Internet Service Providers, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Data Center/Cloud provider networks can become significant bottlenecks that interrupt the seamless delivery of high-resolution content. Cedexis customers have embraced a strategy of using multiple CDNs and/or cloud providers to avoid single points of failure or congestion. On average, Cedexis video customers have experienced a 45% improvement in buffering; 18% improvement in video start-time; and a decrease in video failures of up to 44%.\nCritical to this solution is the real-time performance monitoring provided by the free Cedexis Radar community of 800+ enterprises, as well as every major Cloud and CDN provider in the world. Radar collects billions of Internet performance metrics a day and reports when interconnections are congested or disrupted. Radar informs Cedexis Openmix, the flagship global load-balancing solution, which automatically performs load balancing between multi-CDN or multi-Cloud structures.\n“We are honored to be named a Streaming Media 100 company for the second consecutive year,” said Rob Malnati, VP of Marketing and Business Development at Cedexis. “Our portfolio of video- streaming customers is growing, including properties like PBS, ViewLift, Massmotionmedia and ViaPlay. As the Internet becomes increasingly video driven, Cedexis is taking a leadership role in ensuring quality of service for all end users worldwide.”\n“Out of all the companies delivering technologies and services in the streaming media industry, these are the 100 that our editorial team determined to be the most innovative, influential, and important,” said Streaming Media editor Eric Schumacher-Rasmussen. “They show an industry reaching maturity, as OTT has become mainstream in the home and video is far and away the preferred method of messaging in the corporate, government, and education sectors. The companies on this list are the ones fundamentally responsible for enabling this seismic shift in entertainment and the enterprise.”\nAbout Cedexis\nCedexis provides Web-scale, end-user-experience monitoring and real-time traffic routing across multiple clouds and networks.
