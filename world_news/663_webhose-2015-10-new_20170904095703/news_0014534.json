With an operational temperature up to +230°C, the accelerometer is ideal for measuring within applications that generate intense heat, such as powertrains, engines, vehicle exhausts and gas turbine equipment.\nIts small size and weight also enable the user to measure in locations where there has previously only been space for single-axis accelerometers – such as the engine mounts and the exhaust.\nThe connector and cable have been specially created to avoid triboelectric noise, which originates in the connectors and affects measurement data, in order to provide maximum measurement reliability for users.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/4_"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:56:05.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
