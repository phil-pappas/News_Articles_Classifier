He is a Board-Certified Plastic Surgeon who is actively involved in several scar-related basic and clinical research studies. He is the Principal Investigator in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of various scar treatments, including RXI-109, as well as studies assessing the quality of scar evaluation methods. In addition, Dr. Galiano assisted in the development of the Northwestern University human abdominoplasty in vivo scar model, a novel research model to assess the efficacy of scar therapeutics. \nThe PSF Industry Summit provides a venue to gather real-time data and market research from ~ 60 respected American Society of Plastic Surgeon including leaders, symposia faculty, committee chairs, and investment advisors. This event will connect innovators, companies and key opinion leaders (KOLs) in plastic surgery to gain valuable feedback. \nThe PSF takes place during, 'Plastic Surgery: The Meeting 2015'. Now in its 89 th year and with more than 3,000 attendees, this conference is the world's largest gathering of plastic surgeons and surgical medical professionals who are interested in bringing the most leading-edge clinical information to their practice, to enhance patient satisfaction and surgical outcomes. \nAbout the Plastic Surgery Foundation \nThe American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) works in concert with The Plastic Surgery Foundation. Founded in 1948, The PSF's mission is to improve the quality of patient care through research and development. The Foundation supports research through a variety of grants, clinical trials networks, training programs and forums that encourage innovation in medical devices and techniques. \nAbout ASPS \nASPS is the world's largest organization of board-certified plastic surgeons. Representing more than 7,000 Member Surgeons, the Society is recognized as a leading authority and information source on aesthetic and reconstructive plastic surgery. The ASPS comprises more than 94 percent of all board-certified plastic surgeons in the United States . Founded in 1931, the Society represents physicians certified by either The American Board of Plastic Surgery or The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada . The ASPS advances quality care to plastic surgery patients by encouraging high standards of training, ethics, physician practice and research in plastic surgery. \nAbout RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation \nRXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NASDAQ: RXII ) is a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing innovative therapeutics primarily in the areas of dermatology and ophthalmology that address high-unmet medical needs. Our discovery and clinical development programs are based on siRNA technology as well as immunotherapy agents. These compounds include, but are not limited to, our proprietary, self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA®) compounds for the treatment of dermal and ocular scarring. It also includes an immunomodulator, Samcyprone™, a proprietary topical formulation of diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), for the treatment of disorders such as warts, alopecia areata, non-malignant skin tumors and cutaneous metastases of melanoma. \nRXi's novel, self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA®) compounds are designed for therapeutic use and have drug-like properties, such as high potency, target specificity, serum stability, reduced immune response activation, and efficient cellular uptake. sd-rxRNAs have been shown, in vitro and in vivo , to achieve efficient spontaneous cellular uptake and potent, long-lasting intracellular activity. \nBuilding on the pioneering work of RXi's Scientific Advisory Board Chairman and Nobel Laureate Dr. Craig Mello , RXI-109, an sd-rxRNA compound, is the Company's first clinical development candidate. RXI-109 silences Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which plays a key role in tissue regeneration and repair and is initially being developed to reduce or inhibit scar formation in the skin and in the eye. RXI-109 is currently being evaluated in Phase 2a clinical trials in dermatology and a Phase 1/2 trial is planned to initiate this year in ophthalmology. The Company's sd-rxRNA technology platform is broadly protected by multiple issued patents and numerous patent applications. \nRXi's robust pipeline, coupled with an extensive patent portfolio, provides for product and business development opportunities across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas. We are committed to being a partner of choice for academia, small companies, and large multinationals. We welcome ideas and proposals for strategic alliances, including in- and out-licensing opportunities, to advance and further develop strategic areas of interest.
