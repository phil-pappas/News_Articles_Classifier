The switch also supports Transparent Clock operation according to IEEE 1588 Std 2008 (PTPv2). \nThe unit can be optionally equipped with a 40 pin connector to add four additional ports, expanding the port count to 16 ports. These additional 4 ports can be either SGMII, fiber or copper ports if PHYs are added to the front end board. \n28VDC power input is available through a 12 pin ERNI connector and up to 12 x 10/100/1000BASE-T ports are available via two 80pin ERNI connectors. LED, reset and RS232 signals are also available via the ERNI connectors. \nOyvind Holmeide, CEO of the OnTime Networks group said: “The CM-4012FX-SW is particularly geared towards customers that are developing military and civilian embedded network systems that are size, weight, power and cost (SWaP-C)-sensitive and require high-reliability in extreme temperature/high-shock/vibration environments. We provide a solution for ground vehicles, unmanned air systems (UAS) and fixed-or rotary-wing aircraft that require Ethernet connectivity for their on-board devices.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:02:00.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
