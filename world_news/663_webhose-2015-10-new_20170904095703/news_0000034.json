Advances in digital oilfield technologies will help improve production rates, redevelop existing oilfield wells, facilitate production from unconventional resources such as shale formation, and improve well management. These advanced drilling technologies with remote monitoring and intelligent well completion will significantly increase the efficiency, control, and monitoring of the well. The analysts forecast global directional drilling market to grow at a CAGR of 10.42% over the period 2014 – 2019.”\nThe complete report Global Directional Drilling Market 2015 – 2019 spreads across 99 pages is supported with 46 Exhibits is available at http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/directional-drilling-market-2015-2019-market-report.html .\nThe following companies are the key players in the Global Directional Drilling Market: Baker Hughes, Gyrodata, Halliburton, Schlumberger and Superior Drilling Products.\nOther Prominent Vendors in the market are: Cathedral Energy Services, Calmena Energy Services, General Electric Oil & Gas, Leam Drilling Systems, the Directional Drilling Company, Michels Corporation, and Nabors Industries.\nAccording to the report the increased consumption and demand for oil and gas from various end-user segments is driving the global directional drilling market. Vendors and governments of various countries are therefore investing in directional drilling to enhance the global oil and gas production and maintain the demand-supply balance in the market. The diminishing oil production from existing reserves will further drive the market in terms of increased applications and drilling of multilateral and extended reach wells.\nFurther, the report states that the decline in prices is expected to be persisting during the forecast period and reduce investments in drilling activities, which will negatively impact the directional drilling services market.\nThe global directional drilling market is expected to witness steady growth in the forecast period spurred by increasing energy demand, advances in technologies such as MWD and LWD, data analytics and digital oilfield, and sizable investments in countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico, US, and Angola. The Americas dominates the directional drilling market, followed by APAC and EMEA. In terms of services, the largest market share is held by the rotary steerable segment, which is expected to grow at a significant rate in the forecast period. Advantages like high efficiency and lower overall costs of directional drilling foster growth in this segment and results in its high market share of nearly 41% by 2019.
