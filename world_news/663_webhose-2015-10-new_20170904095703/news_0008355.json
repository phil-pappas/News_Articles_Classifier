Vimicro International Corporation (NASDAQ: VIMC) (\"Vimicro\" or the \"Company\"), a leading video surveillance technology and solution provider in China , today announced that it has entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Vimicro China (Parent) Limited (\"Parent\") and Vimicro China Acquisition Limited (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Parent will acquire Vimicro (the \"Transaction\") for US$3.375 per ordinary share of the Company (a \"Share\") or US$13.50 per American depositary share, each representing four Shares (an \"ADS\"). This amount represents a premium of 9.5% over the Company's closing price of US$12.33 per ADS on June 19, 2015 , the last trading day prior to June 22, 2015 , the date that the Company announced that it had received a \"going-private\" proposal, and a premium of 15.4% to the volume-weighted average closing prices of the Company's ADSs during the 90 trading days prior to June 22, 2015 .\nImmediately after the completion of the Transaction, Parent will be ultimately beneficially owned by Dr. Zhonghan (John) Deng , founder, chairman and chief executive officer of the Company, Mr. Zhaowei (Kevin) Jin , co-chief executive officer and a board member of the Company, Dr. Xiaodong (Dave) Yang and Mr. Shengda Zan (collectively, the \"Buyer Group\"). To date, the Buyer Group beneficially owns, in the aggregate, approximately 41% of the outstanding Shares (excluding outstanding options of the Company).\nThe Company's board of directors (the \"Board\"), acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the Board (the \"Special Committee\"), approved the Merger Agreement and the Transaction and resolved to recommend that the Company's shareholders vote to authorize and approve the Merger Agreement and the Transaction. The Special Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors of the Company who are unaffiliated with Parent, Merger Sub or any member of the Buyer Group or management of the Company, exclusively negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement with the Buyer Group with the assistance of its independent financial and legal advisors.\nPrior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Board, the Board approved and the Company has executed and delivered Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement, dated December 12, 2008 , as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Rights Agreement, dated June 18, 2015 (as so amended, the \"Rights Agreement\"), by and between RBC Corporate Services Hong Kong Limited (formerly known as RBC Dexia Corporate Services Hong Kong Limited), as rights agent. The Rights Amendment, among other things, renders the Rights Agreement inapplicable to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nThe Transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including a condition that the Merger Agreement be authorized and approved by an affirmative vote of shareholders representing two-thirds or more of the Shares present and voting in person or by proxy as a single class at a meeting of the Company's shareholders convened to consider the authorization and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Buyer Group have agreed to vote all of the Shares beneficially owned by them in favor of the authorization and approval of the Merger Agreement and the Transaction. If completed, the Transaction will result in the Company becoming a privately-held company and its ADSs will no longer be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nThe Buyer Group intends to fund the Transaction from the proceeds of a loan to be provided by Alpha Spring Limited pursuant to a commitment letter dated September 15, 2015 .\nThe Company will prepare and file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") a Schedule 13E-3 transaction statement, which will include a proxy statement of the Company. The Schedule 13E-3 will include a description of the Merger Agreement and contain other important information about the Transaction, the Company and the other participants in the Transaction.\nDuff & Phelps, LLC and Duff & Phelps Securities, LLC (together, \"Duff & Phelps\") is serving as financial advisors to the Special Committee.
