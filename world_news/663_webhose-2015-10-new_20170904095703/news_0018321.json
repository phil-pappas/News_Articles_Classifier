The partnership combines Telefónica’s ElevenPaths Latch second factor authorization-as-a-service technology with Vaultive’s cloud encryption capabilities to create a layered approach to Office 365 security. “Vaultive is the only solution in the market that can encrypt Office 365 data in transit, at rest, and in use while still providing a seamless experience to users,” said Chema Alonso, CEO, ElevenPaths. “Together with Latch, it creates a compromise-free Office 365 security approach that even the most risk-averse organizations can embrace.”\nTelefónica, one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies, delivers Office 365 services to over 100 thousand organizations worldwide. The combined capabilities of Latch and the Vaultive Cloud Data Protection Platform give Office 365 customers a set of elevated security measures that tightly manage application access and protect sensitive data hosted in the cloud.\nLatch helps IT organizations reduce the risk of attacks directed at their online services by:\nImplementing a “safety latch” on online services that limits access to services when they are not in use. Applying a second level of authentication to further protect against unauthorized access. Alerting IT teams of any suspicious user account activity.\nThe Vaultive Cloud Data Protection Platform adds further protection for Office 365 customers by:\nEncrypting data before it is transmitted to Office 365. Managing encryption keys independently from the Office 365 infrastructure for separation of control. Preserving essential application features like email message search, sorting, and filtering on encrypted data.\n“Telefónica has played a central role in Office 365’s success since day one, and its commitment to security has been instrumental in driving cloud adoption,” said Jonas Hellgren, CEO, Vaultive. “Combining Latch with Vaultive’s Cloud Data Protection Platform allows customers to achieve the business benefits of software-as-a-service with security and confidence.”\nVaultive’s founder and CTO Ben Matzkel will be presenting these new combined capabilities on stage today at the Security Innovation Day 2015 conference. The event will be streamed live and will be accessible over the web at: https://securityinnovationday.elevenpaths.com/eventcontent/streaming\nAbout Vaultive\nVaultive helps risk-conscious organizations move to the cloud securely by giving them complete control and ownership of their data wherever it resides.
