Carbon capture and storage (CCS) techniques aim to store carbon dioxide in depleted oil and gas fields or deep aquifers, preventing it from reaching the atmosphere. Widespread use of CCS in the future could help to reduce global carbon emissions , helping to slow global temperature rise. \nThe paper's authors, from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC), collected gas samples in 2009 and 2012 from wells at the Cranfield CO2-enhanced oil recovery field in Mississippi, USA. \nCo-author Professor Finlay Stuart of SUERC (University of Glasgow) said: \"We have shown for the first time that the naturally occurring helium, neon and argon in the injected gas is a unique 'fingerprint' that can be used to monitor the movement of the CO2, and determine how it is stored. \n\"Before CCS can become widely adopted as a method of CO2 mitigation we need to know how effective the gas can be stored underground. The noble gases are chemically inert so they are not affected by interactions with rocks or water in the way that carbon dioxide is, so they can be used to identify the physical processes that have affected the gas. They provide a cheap way to fingerprint injected gases in future large-scale carbon storage projects, and have the potential to provide a unique way to track the presence of deep shale gas and coal bed-derived methane in shallow aquifers during and after extraction.\" Test for carbon capture leaks developed December 14, 2011 \nScientists have developed the first ever fail-safe test to check for carbon dioxide (CO2) leaks from carbon capture and storage sites deep underground. Replacing coal and oil with natural gas will not help fight global warming July 21, 2014 \nBoth shale gas and conventional natural gas have a larger greenhouse gas footprint than do coal or oil, especially for the primary uses of residential and commercial heating. First large-scale carbon capture goes online in Canada October 1, 2014 \nThe world's first large-scale carbon capture and storage—built into a SaskPower coal-fired power plant in the Canadian prairies—will be inaugurated Thursday. Geochemists model underground movement of stored carbon dioxide February 26, 2015 \nComputer modeling by geochemists at Indiana University and colleagues in China and Sweden takes scientists several steps closer to understanding what happens when greenhouse gases are injected deep underground in a process ... Greenhouse gas-caused warming felt in just months June 2, 2015 \nThe heat generated by burning a fossil fuel is surpassed within a few months by the warming caused by the release of its carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to new work from Carnegie's Xiaochun Zhang and Ken Caldeira ... Accounting for short-lived forcers in carbon budgets July 15, 2015 \nLimiting warming to any level requires CO2 emissions to be kept to within a certain limit known as a carbon budget. Can reducing shorter-lived climate forcers influence the size of this budget? A new IIASA study published ... Recommended for you Asteroid impact, volcanism were one-two punch for dinosaurs October 1, 2015 \nBerkeley geologists have uncovered compelling evidence that an asteroid impact on Earth 66 million years ago accelerated the eruptions of volcanoes in India for hundreds of thousands of years, and that together these planet-wide ... Study reveals urban smoke absorbs sunlight, exacerbating climate warming October 1, 2015 \nCloaking urban areas and wildfire zones, tiny smoke particles suspended in the atmosphere have a sizeable effect on our climate. But the exact effect of many of these aerosols—such as how much sunlight they absorb, thus ... Plastic-eating worms may offer solution to mounting waste, researchers discover September 30, 2015 \nConsider the plastic foam cup. Every year, Americans throw away 2.5 billion of them. And yet, that waste is just a fraction of the 33 million tons of plastic Americans discard every year. Less than 10 percent of that total ... New dietary guidelines must be sustainable, regardless of politics October 1, 2015 \nThe new iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) must incorporate sustainability considerations - both for the health and wellbeing of Americans and the world in which we live, urges a new piece appearing in ... Signs of ancient megatsunami could portend modern hazard October 2, 2015 \nScientists working off west Africa in the Cape Verde Islands have found evidence that the sudden collapse of a volcano there tens of thousands of years ago generated an ocean tsunami that dwarfed anything ever seen by humans. ... New HOLODEC study on using holography to better understand clouds October 1, 2015 \nAs clouds change shape, mixing occurs, as drier air mingles with water-saturated air. New research led by Michigan Technological University analyzes this mixing with a holographic imaging instrument called HOLODEC and an ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:59:16.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
