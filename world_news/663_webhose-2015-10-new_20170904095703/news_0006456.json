Outlining the initiative at this week's Travel Convention in Costa Navarino, Greece, industry head for travel Ruairidh Roberts said the technology would help high street retailers measure the impact of mobile on their business. He said research showed that 80% of mobile searches are done with local intent. Of those, half of consumers visit a store and 18% go on to make a purchase, but there is a gap between the original search and the end result. The new technology, however, would help agents follow the journey better by correlating those people who have searched on their phone and then gone into a store. Roberts told delegates that Google technology could also be used to speed up the process of collating and making sense of customer feedback through surveys. \"Through digital you can do this much more quickly, within a day,\" he said. \nTuesday, October 13, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:06:14.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
