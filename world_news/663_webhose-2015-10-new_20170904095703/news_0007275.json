but potentially planet-saving - technology - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has asked private companies to submit their own designs for a robot capable of grabbing a 20 tonne, six metre wide boulder from an asteroid and then placing it in orbit around the moon.\nAlthough this sounds like a relatively simple task, it requires a \"20-fold improvement\" in the propulsion technology which is used to power crafts through the freezing vacuum of space.\nThe mission also has several other key objectives, including one scheme which could help make the United States even richer than it already is.\nNBC Space for expansion: American business moguls could one day build mine valuable substances from asteroids\n\"Redirecting and 'parking' a large asteroid boulder within reach of human and robotic explorers also will provide American commercial enterprises their first opportunities to investigate the viability of mining asteroids for precious metals and other resources,\" NASA added.\nThe mission will also play a role in helping humans get to Mars and \"set the stage for future integrated crewed and robotic vehicle operations in deep space\".\n\"The Asteroid Redirect Mission brings together the best of NASA's science, technology and human exploration efforts to accomplish several important objectives that are critical elements during our journey to Mars,\" NASA said.\nThe world has been gripped by doomsday fever in recent months, with a variety of apocalyptic predictions failing to come true.\nGetty Images Extinction: Meteor strike is thought to have blasted dinosaurs into oblivion\nBut it is inevitable that Planet Earth will one day be in the crosshairs of a comet which could be as big as the one which wiped out the dinosaurs, or even one small enough to simply annihilate a small town.\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-calls-for-american-industry-ideas-on-arm-spacecraft-development/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/jasperhamill", "https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=1f2abc476fe15dd49954dc197c472fd7&tab=core&_cview=0", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:42:10.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
