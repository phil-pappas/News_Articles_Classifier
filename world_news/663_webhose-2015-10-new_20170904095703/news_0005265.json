IBM acquired the firm in 2012, and in July, Kenexa's Peace Corps contract was renewed. \nOn Oct. 15, the IBM team released the latest plans for improving the Peace Corps' Volunteer Delivery System: moving to a hybrid cloud infrastructure model, expanding the public-facing application to mobile devices and enabling social media engagement. \n\"Federal agencies are viewing cloud much more strategically than infrastructure alone,\" said Anne Altman, general manager of U.S. federal government business at IBM. \"For the Peace Corps, it's about engaging an audience that wants to actively participate in the volunteer application process and is accustomed to using new tools for such interactions.\" \nIBM officials did not claim direct credit for the Peace Corps' application spike but noted that it seemed reasonable that a smoother process encouraged more people to apply. The Peace Corps did not return requests for comment. \nThe new capabilities, which IBM officials said they started working on this quarter, should position the Peace Corps to continue its momentum in attracting applicants. \n\"In the future, they'll be able to engage volunteers not just on a desktop\" but on mobile devices and social media, said George Cruser, IBM's vice president of federal cloud. The Peace Corps will even be able to connect new volunteers with one another. \nTo attract members of a generation who \"always seems to have a smartphone in their hands,\" those capabilities will prove invaluable, he added.
