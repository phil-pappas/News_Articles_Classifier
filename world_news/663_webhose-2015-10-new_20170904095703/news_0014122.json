For example, patients may select specialized care services, enter a zip code to locate facilities within a desired radius of their home, and choose their preferred insurance provider. The real-time information empowers patients to make the preferred choices most suited to them. \nAccording to the AHRQ, \"Roughly 40 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are discharged to a post-acute setting.\" Patients who find that they need continuum of care after a hospital stay must decide where to receive this care. It may range from a short-term stay at an SNF (skilled nursing facility), a rehabilitation center, or long-term recovery. Hospital case managers oversee the orchestration of care management by the clinicians and pharmacists involved with the patient's care. \nAbout Mountain States Health Alliance \nSince 1998, Mountain States Health Alliance has been bringing the nation's best health care close to home to serve the residents of Northeast Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, Southeastern Kentucky and Western North Carolina.
