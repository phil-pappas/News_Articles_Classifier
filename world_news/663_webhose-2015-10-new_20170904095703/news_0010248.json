Encrypted content – Protects the privacy of information shared by converting readable text to ciphered text. Only the intended recipient can ‘unlock’ the content. Blocking screenshots – SessMe on Android blocks the option of taking screenshots, making it impossible to obtain content without consent. iOS users will be notified when an image or video are screenshotted. Masking – When sending a picture to a friend you’re not sure you can trust, simply add a customized “mask” to protect your image. In that way, your friend can only see your image outlines without any details, making it significantly harder for them to save embarrassing screenshots of your private content. Pixelated images – When you send a picture, it will be delivered in a pixelated form and then reveal itself for only one second, after which it will become pixelated again, making it even harder for users to take screenshots. \nSessMe also includes the following features: Track content – Gain qualitative information on how many times content has been forwarded. Timed messages – Schedule texts or attachments such as photos, videos and locations to be sent out at a specific future date/time (very helpful in making sure you don’t forget an important birthday or anniversary) Public vs. private chats – Users have the option to chat publicly, or privately for more discreet conversations. Content private chats cannot be forwarded to other users. \nDownload SessMe on iOS and Android . \nAbout SessMe: \nCo-Founded in 2014 by Ofer Ben-David and Haim Saar, SessMe was created in order to tackle the problem of digital violence, and a lack of control over mass personal data in social networks.
