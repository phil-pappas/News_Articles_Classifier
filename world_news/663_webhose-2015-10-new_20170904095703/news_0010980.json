The company aims to commercialize the lamp in 2019. \nAt Ceatec Japan 2015, which runs from Oct 7 to 10, 2015, in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, Stanley introduced three functions of the lamp. They are (1) an emergency braking indicator, (2) reversing indicator and (3) turn signal. \nEmergency braking indicator \nThe emergency braking indicator is for notifying following vehicles of an emergency braking. When the driver of the vehicle suddenly applies the brakes, it blinks a red pattern on the road surface. \nThe pattern extends to adjacent lanes so that it can be seen by two following vehicles (not only the one right behind), Stanley said. To indicate an emergent situation, the pattern blinks on and off at a relatively high frequency of 5Hz. \nReversing indicator \nThe reversing indicator is used when the vehicle is moving backward. This function is expected to be used mainly at parking lots. It casts a white arrow-shaped striped pattern so that the direction of the vehicle's movement can be intuitively understood. \nAccording to Stanley, striped patterns instantly draw people's attention like crosswalks. The pattern blinks on and off at a frequency of 0.7Hz. \nTurn signal \nThe turn signal indicates direction changes and right and left turns. In conjunction with winkers, it continually emits orange light so that the drivers of other vehicles notice it. It blinks at a frequency of 1.5Hz. \nThe road surface-illuminated signal lamp takes in LED light, concentrates it at slits and forms a desired pattern. Then, the light is emitted to a road surface by using a projection lens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:55:05.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
