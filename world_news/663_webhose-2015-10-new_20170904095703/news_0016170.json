Other platforms, including the desktop, take the remaining 37 percent. \nLooking at phone-only traffic and Android pulls ahead with 52 percent compared to 42 percent on iOS (six percent goes to other mobile platforms). \nThe situation is reversed when looking at tablet traffic, with iOS tablets (iPads) making up a mammoth 68 percent compared to Android's 30 percent. \nWhat about time spent on the website? \n\"If we're going for efficiency here, iOS-based users get the job done faster. They tend to spend a mere eight minutes and 40 seconds on site when they visit Pornhub and tend to reach satisfaction after just 9.8 page views,\" the website explained. \n\"There is also an argument to be made for lasting power, which is where Android users shine. They spend a leisurely average 10:06 per visit and peak out at 10.9 page views.\" \nAnd the most popular search terms? \nThe top three search terms on Android are \"lesbian\", \"cartoon\" and \"black\", while the top three search terms on iOS are \"lesbian\", \"step mom\" and \"teen\". \nThe company also covered the most popular mobile operating systems, based on traffic to Pornhub. \nUnsurprisingly, the African continent was fully behind Android, with much of Asia and Europe following suit too. Apple's mobile platform dominated in the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan and several other countries.
