New digital and social technologies are constantly emerging, customer behaviors are evolving, and the marketing landscape is shifting. All of these factors are converging and brands are forced to change the way they attract and retain customers.\nFor financial institutions, there are multiple external forces at work that make loyalty more difficult, including the growth of digital banking, new regulations, and non-traditional competitors. This is why banks and credit unions should change their thinking about customer loyalty. Instead of sticking to the stale product-centric, transaction-focused approach of the past, they need a holistic approach that fosters continuous engagement and lasting connections. New research shows why and how to move from a deal orientation to true lasting loyalty among account holders, and this webinar will walk financial institutions through the process.\nOn Nov. 3, 2015 at 1 p.m. EST, Loyalty360 will host a webinar titled, “ Banking on Loyalty: Why Financial Institutions Must Foster Ongoing Engagement, Not Transactions ,” which will be presented by Deluxe Rewards .\nBy attending this webinar, attendees will:\nUnderstand why current approaches are not creating or sustaining loyalty Learn about the new loyalty models companies are adopting here and in Europe Find out how a loyalty program can bring siloed sources of customer data together Discover how to reward behaviors like learning, tracking and saving to achieve business goals\nThe scheduled webinar speakers are: Andrew Copeman, Aite Group Senior Analyst, who has more than 25 years of experience in the European retail banking and payments industry; and Jane Johnson, Deluxe Rewards Strategic Account Development Director, who has more than 25 years of experience providing marketing, data analytics and loyalty program services to hundreds of clients across multiple industries.\n“Everything about the way consumers interact with brands is transforming,” said Mark Johnson, CEO & CMO of Loyalty360 – The Loyalty Marketers’ Association . “This is true for organizations across all industries, and those existing in the banking and financial sector are certainly no different.
