It follows the daily lives of three children from South Sudan, eastern Ukraine and Syria. \n\"The power of VR is that it gives the viewer a unique sense of empathic connection to people and events,\" said Jake Silverstein, editor in chief of the Times Magazine. \n\"In the context of international reporting and conflict reporting, where our readers rely on us to bring them news and stories from remote and inaccessible places, this has huge potential. Through this immersive video experience, we can put our readers at the center of the most important story of our time.\" \nA two-dimensional version of the film will also be available on the Times website. \nA Cardboard software kit works with Apple or Android smartphones, turning the phones into screens for the low-cost viewers. \nHundreds of applications have been created to work with Cardboard, taking advantage of position-sensing capabilities in smartphones to give wearers a sense of looking around in virtual environments while turning their heads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:21:29.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
