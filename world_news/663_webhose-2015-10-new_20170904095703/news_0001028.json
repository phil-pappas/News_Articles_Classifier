(Photo: Sony)\nCONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Adding to its lineup of small cameras with remarkably huge pixel counts, Sony today announced its latest creation: the Sony Cyber-shot RX1R II. Boasting a 42.4-megapixel full-frame sensor, the RX1R II crams a lot of camera into a superbly tiny package.\nREVIEWED.COM CAMERAS\nSony Puts 42 Megapixels in Your Pocket With the RX1R II\nDespite weighing in at only 507 grams and with a body that can easily rest on an open palm, there's a lot of camera inside the RX1R II. Like previous cameras in the RX1 series, the RX1R II pairs its massive sensor with a speedy, fixed Zeiss Sonnar T 35mm f/2 lens. Much like the Leica Q, this Zeiss lens also features a macro shift ring for super close-up shots.\nREVIEWED.COM CAMERAS\nSony Alpha A7R II Digital Camera Review\nPros will appreciate the ability to capture 14-bit uncompressed RAW files, as well as significantly improved autofocus (AF) speeds over the RX1R. Sony claims that the new AF system enables a 30% faster lock speed. While shooting in various lighting conditions, the RX1R II can rely on its extensive ISO range, which extends from ISO 50 to ISO 102,400 while in expanded mode.\nMeet the RX1R II, the compact camera with guts that are anything but. (Photo: Sony)\nShooters picking up the RX1R II will have the option of using either a retractable 2.4m-dot electronic viewfinder with a 0.74x magnification, or a tilting 1.2m-dot LCD that tilts 109° upward, and 41° downward. The addition of a pop-up EVF is in line with Sony's RX100-seres cameras, and it's a major addition over previous EVF-less RX1 cameras.\nA 42.4 megapixel full-frame sensor in a compact camera was unheard of — until now. (Photo: Sony)\nIf you need to share your shots right now, the RX1R II also comes equipped with NFC and WiFi. Using Sony's PlayMemories app, you can port pictures directly to your smartphone for sharing over social media—after pairing your device with the RX1R II.\nIf this sounds like a camera to put on your holiday shopping list, it won't come cheap: The RX1R II will hit shelves this November for $3,300. There will also be a case available for purchase, the LCJ-RXH, but so far no pricing has been announced.\nCONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1Lupw9e TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1Lupw9e", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/914123983ec5897f79bc6f4b9a5ce228cf047895/c=44-0-624-436&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804396867757282-Sony-rx1R-II-news-sensor.jpeg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lupw9e&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9b11c182cdf444d09b552a6180fb12b05d51a2c/r=300/https/reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1442863453000/sony-a7r-ii-review-hero.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804375263820312-Sony-rx1R-II-news-hero.jpeg", "http://cameras.reviewed.com/news/sony-makes-42-4-megapixels-pocketable-meet-the-rx1r-ii", "http://cameras.reviewed.com/content/sony-alpha-a7r-ii-digital-camera-review", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/400790466ff3ba1039b01fdec23fc4f9a469d26e/r=500x221/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804375263820312-Sony-rx1R-II-news-hero.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6dca8922313f71a62f006d6ba2c44ea7e6b18099/c=31-0-520-368&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804395983849950-Sony-rx1R-II-news-camera-front.jpeg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e9b11c182cdf444d09b552a6180fb12b05d51a2c/r=300/https/reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/1444839170000/Sony-rx1R-II-news-hero.jpeg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lupw9e&text=Sony%20puts%2042%20megapixels%20in%20your%20pocket%20with%20the%20RX1R%20II&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16538cba9983bb99b27d7d20a9d2e05e26e16717/c=288-0-1113-620&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804375263820312-Sony-rx1R-II-news-hero.jpeg"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:06:52.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
