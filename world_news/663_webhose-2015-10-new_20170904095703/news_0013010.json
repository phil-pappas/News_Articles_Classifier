Lee said on Monday during an earnings conference that the company tried to keep Kau and asked him to reconsider his decision.\nKau's hiring comes about three months after Tsinghua made an informal $23 billion takeover offer for Micron that was rejected out-of-hand by the Idaho-based company's leadership, although the Chinese side has not given up on a deal, sources have said.\nKau, who played a role in the discussions between Tsinghua and Micron, will split his time between Beijing and Taiwan, the source said, adding that his precise role in Tsinghua was yet to be finalised.\nMicron was not immediately available for comment.
