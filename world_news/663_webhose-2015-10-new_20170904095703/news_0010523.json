Consumer-facing portal; 2. Treasury management capabilities; and 3. Mobile-first user interface October 21, 2015 07:40 AM Eastern Daylight Time \nWILMINGTON, N.C.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--nCino, the leader in cloud banking, today released the most significant enhancements to date of its Bank Operating System. Driven by a new mobile-first user interface (UI), this product iteration also introduces a comprehensive suite of treasury management sales and onboarding tools, as well as the highly anticipated Customer Portal. - Watch to learn more about these new enhancements from nCino. - \nTom DiVittorio, nCino’s chief product officer, explained, “Our customers have made radical changes to their business lending through the Bank Operating System ; now it’s time to take them even further ahead of the industry curve with these new offerings and enhancements. We are introducing a brand new UI that is mobile optimized, allowing bankers to work with their customers anywhere on any device. \n“The added treasury management capabilities are a logical progression in enabling bankers to support their business relationships more fully within nCino, extending beyond credit and commercial loan products. \n“And finally, our Customer Portal breaks the mold for how this industry defines consumer engagement. Now the banker and borrower can exchange and fulfill necessary loan documentation more efficiently and effectively using a single, secure electronic loan file.” \nCustomer Portal \nnCino’s Customer Portal is an extension of the Bank Operating System. The consumer-facing gateway creates a direct two-way dialogue between financial institutions and their customers throughout the loan lifecycle. It allows the borrower to visually see where service requests stand, securely receive and upload required documents from the comfort of their home, and monitor loan stages as they progress. \nThe nCino Customer Portal solves banks and credit unions’ basic customer service challenges while expediting general loan workflow. The financial institution controls users’ portal access, setting permissions and parameters around which loan stages and related information are visible. Customer Portal is also fully brandable to match any institution’s existing website domain, expanding their digital channel within the same seamless experience. \nMobile UI \nAll nCino customers are receiving an entirely new UI for the Bank Operating System, even more intuitive than before and created for the mobile banker. The responsive design makes it flexible across all devices whether it be laptops, desktops, tablets or mobile phones, therefore more efficient for bankers to originate loans and to broaden their role as a universal customer service representative. Built on the Salesforce Force.com platform, security is retained to the degree it’s always been. \nTreasury Management \nNow available within the Bank Operating System are treasury management sales and onboarding tools, complete with features to identify new opportunities, facilitate a more effective onboarding process and better manage individual treasury relationships, as well as those across the enterprise. Unlike other treasury management point solutions, nCino has brought together sales, onboarding and fulfillment in a single platform, supporting the treasury process and each stakeholder from the initial sale through implementation and servicing. \nnCino’s integrated view of treasury management functions allows customers and business channels alike to seamlessly interact while creating an automated environment around these services. \nIn addition to these three enhancements, this release of nCino’s Bank Operating System includes many other key updates to existing features, including: Integration to the Small Business Administration’s e-Tran, and other SBA lending workflow improvements; Comprehensive Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC) checking; Workflows specific to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA); Addition of flood insurance forms; and Automated credit score checking. \n“Multiple reports this year have dubbed technology as ‘the great equalizer’ in helping financial institutions achieve optimal customer satisfaction, ultimately winning new business and keeping current customers happy for the long term,” said Pierre Naudé, CEO of nCino. “While this industry once lacked the technology to effectively mobilize bankers and also accommodate increasing regulatory pressures, we are changing that – today. nCino is working toward creating a single, cloud-based, mobile platform for use across all lines of business to fulfill selling, onboarding and relationship management in a compliant fashion. The features unveiled today represent major steps forward in that direction and demonstrate our continued commitment to transforming financial services.” \nAbout nCino \nnCino is the leader in cloud-based operating solutions for the financial services industry.
