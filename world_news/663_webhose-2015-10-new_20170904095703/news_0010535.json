In these areas, optical fibers have made significant advances in the past few years. The field of global optical fiber sensors market , especially, has come a long way in terms of technical advancements and development of innovative new products as well as their adoption across a variety of application areas. There are many advantages of fiber optic sensors above conventional electronic sensors that make them a better candidate for monitoring environmental changes. Some of these features, which make fiber optic sensors more viable than electronic sensors, are: Their easy integration into a wide array of structures and composite materials, with very little interference owing to their small size and cylindrical shape Non-conductance of electric current Immunity from radio frequency interference and electromagnetic interference Light weight High resistance to harsh environments High sensitivity Capability to sense a variety of attributes such as corrosion, strain, pressure, acoustic signals, and temperature Technological Progress Leading to High Use of Fiber Optic Sensors Over the years of continued use, a lot of research has gone into fiber optic sensing technology and the field has become increasingly sophisticated with every passing day. From their early use in the telecommunication industry and LAN operations, fiber optic sensors are currently widely used in the oil and gas industry, the field of wind energy generation, smart buildings, a variety of sensitive construction sites, and homeland security operations, among others. The global market for fiber optic sensors is being driven by their continuously expanding set of applications across a number of industries along with the technological advancements that are leading to the development of increasingly advanced and reliable sensors. Compared to other sensing mechanisms, fiber optic sensors are known to have accuracy of a level that can spot cracks and structural damage as minute as 0.15 mm in concrete structures. High Deployment Costs Restrict Global Fiber Optic Sensors Market The global market for fiber optic sensors is primarily driven by factors such as rising investments in smart civil structures, smart manufacturing facilities, and the continuously expanding set of applications of these sensors across a number of industries. Their capability of monitoring the physical health of buildings in an extremely sensitive and reliable manner is making them highly viable in areas that are most prone to earthquakes and other such natural calamities. Todayâ€™s ultra-miniature, power-efficient, and highly robust, reliable, and sensitive fiber optic sensors are becoming an integral consideration in civil planning and construction activities. However, certain factors such as their high deployment costs and unfamiliarity remain the primary barriers to their widespread adoption. Sluggish growth of the oil and gas industry in current times is also hampering the adoption of fiber optic sensors across the global oil and gas industry to a certain extent.
