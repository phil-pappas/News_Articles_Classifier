Seamlessly integrated into Starbucks world-class mobile app and My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, the feature will be available for customers using the Starbucks app for iPhone (in the Greater Toronto Area including Markham, Scarborough, Richmond Hill, Unionville, Vaughan, Etobicoke, Aurora and Thornhill). Starbucks plans to expand Mobile Order & Pay to other select Canadian cities in 2016. \n“Toronto is the largest city in Canada and also home to some of Starbucks busiest North American stores,” said Jessica Mills, director brand and digital, Starbucks Canada. “We know that sometimes, customers have to choose between going to Starbucks and making their next meeting or appointment. The simple, convenience of Mobile Order & Pay means customers can bypass the line. It represents a significant opportunity for us to enhance the customer experience and significantly save customers some time.” \nStarbucks was the first national retailer to offer its own mobile payment technology combined with a deep loyalty program. Today, mobile payments represent 18% of all in-store transactions in Canadian Starbucks stores and more than 1 million Canadians are active My Starbucks Rewards members. With the Mobile Order & Pay feature, customers have the same Starbucks Experience they would have in store, including the ability to customize orders through the app with the convenience and speed of placing and paying for an order in advance. Estimated pick up times are shown in-app before a customer confirms their order. \nTo use Mobile Order & Pay from the Starbucks app for iPhone Click on the “Order” option at the top right of the screen Select the food and beverage items to order: Beverages are customizable, including the option to modify size, number of espresso shots, dairy selections and more Select the participating store for pick up: Approximate wait times will be viewable on the customer’s phone prior to selecting store location.
