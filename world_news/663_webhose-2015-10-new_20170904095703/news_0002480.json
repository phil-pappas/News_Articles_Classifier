The two companies would retain their respective brands and management structure and independently operate their businesses. \nThe Didi-Kuaidi deal prompted speculation among China's tech investors and bankers that more such mergers might follow, given the intense and often unprofitable competition between leading companies in China's Internet sector. \nSpeculation of a merger between Dianping and Meituan had swirled in early 2015, as Dianping finished raising more than $800 million in capital at a valuation of $4 billion. \nMeituan and Dianping had discussed a potential combination before, but the talks never evolved as the rivals wanted better valuation terms, the source said. More recently, the two were in the process of raising more funds and decided to give the combination another try, at the urging of several investors who wanted the companies to preserve cash. \nChina Renaissance served as exclusive financial adviser to both Meituan and Dianping. The investment bank was also adviser to both Didi and Kuaidi in their deal. \n(Additional reporting by Matthew Miller; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:11:58.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
