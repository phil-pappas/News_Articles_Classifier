More than 30 customers representing two dozen companies will have the opportunity to network, share challenges and best practices for managing their communications environments, learn about industry trends and opportunities, and celebrate customer successes. \nThe three day event begins Wednesday with a welcome reception, and is capped Friday with the 4 th annual vCom Golf Tournament in Half Moon Bay. The conference, held Thursday, includes roundtable discussions; a customer panel; and planning session to strategize for 2016. A new segment this year is a solution panel exploring vFixed (wireline), vMobile (mobility), and vConnect (conferencing and collaboration), and ways in which customers can improve their current communications environments, gain increased control and visibility, and realize greater ROI for their telecom spend. The day concludes with an awards ceremony celebrating customer success. \n\"Each year, this proves to be an invaluable experience for both vCom and our customers,\" says Jenifer Frey, Vice President of Client Engagement. \"Our customers learn best practices from other customers, and gain industry insights from our panel of experts, and go back to their organizations with immediate opportunities to improve their communications environments and gain improved ROI from their overall communications spend. Additionally, both our customers and our employees get to put faces to names, which helps build our relationships and improve customer satisfaction.\" \nThe core of the event is vCom's Customer Advisory Council, during which customers provide direct feedback about vCom's software solution, vManager, and its professional services. \"This workshop enables us to directly address customer feedback and understand what their priorities are for the next year. This open discussion allows us to constantly improve our solution offering, and directly impacts our strategy and IT roadmap,\" says Sameer Hilal, Chief Operating Officer. \nFollowing last year's summit, vCom launched vManager 6.0, 6.1 , and several minor enhancements; made some major upgrades to vMobile, our mobility lifecycle management solution; and launched vConnect for conferencing and collaboration lifecycle management. \nAbout vCom Solutions \nvCom Solutions revolutionizes the way enterprises manage their entire communications lifecycle. vCom customers gain control over inventory, expenses and carrier relationships, achieving better business intelligence that drives profitability. vCom's communications lifecycle management solution, vSuite, is an integrated offering for managing fixed, mobile and collaboration technologies, leveraging on-demand cloud-based telecom management software tools, complemented by a full portfolio of professional services.
