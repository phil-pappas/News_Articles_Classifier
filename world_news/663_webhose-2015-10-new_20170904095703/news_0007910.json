More Yahoo in search drive with Google deal \nChipmakers and older tech companies in developed economies have been on a mergers and acquisition spree since the start of the year as they try to fix the industry’s troubles with deals they hope will cut costs and boost growth. \nM&A in the tech sector has recorded its strongest year since the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. Overall deals in tech so far have hit about $435bn in value this year, up 85 per cent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters. \nWestern Digital, which makes the hard disc drives used in laptops, has been hunting for growth as its traditional revenue base declines. This month Western Digital received a fresh injection of cash from Tsinghua Unigroup, a Chinese state-controlled tech investment group, which bought a 25 per cent stake for $3.8bn. \nTsinghua’s investment will help fund the acquisition of SanDisk, as long as the Chinese group closes its deal with Western Digital before the SanDisk acquisition, which is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2016. \nWestern Digital ’s cash-and-stock offer values SanDisk at $86.5 per share, a 40 per cent premium to SanDisk’s share price last week before news of the merger talks broke. Lam Research’s cash-and-stock offer values KLA-Tencor’s at $67 per share, a 24 per cent premium as of Tuesday’s closing. Silver Lake and Thoma Bravo will pay SolarWinds ’ shareholders $60.10 per share, a 20 per cent premium to Tuesday’s close. \nAnalysts say the consolidation in the semiconductor industry is likely to continue. “In a low interest rate environment, where growth is harder to come by, M&A becomes more likely,” said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG who upgraded SanDisk on Wednesday’s news. \nSanDisk, the California-based maker of flash memory, had earlier been in talks with several possible buyers, including Micron. \nWestern Digital’s acquisition comes after Intel bought Altera for $17bn in June, Singapore-based Avago acquired US rival Broadcom for $37bn in May and Netherlands-based NXP took over Freescale for $12bn in March. \nCheap debt and benign capital markets combined with slowing growth for western-based companies vis-à-vis increasing competition from China has convinced many chief executives of large semiconductor groups to act now, say analysts. \nBoth Western Digital and SanDisk face rising costs and falling prices for their product, and on Wednesday Western Digital reported that its revenues fell 13 per cent year on year for the quarter ending October 2. SanDisk, which released earnings the same day, saw a 17 per cent decline in quarterly revenue from the previous year. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
