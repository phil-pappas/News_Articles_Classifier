I suppose the Universities are supposed to decrease the study fees at the Universities as they are unaffordable at the moment. Government must increase student funding and the private sector must partner with government on this phenomenon.\nGovernment must reduce on social expenditure and invest in education. Children grants, land reform and social housing budget must be reduced as these categories do not improve South Africa's economy but negatively affect our growth.\nGovernment and the private sector must create an environment whereby education is accessible to all so that people will start to build their own houses rather than relying on government and raise their children rather than relying on government. Our social economy is unsustainable, we cant have an environment whereby enabled man much to the street for free houses. That suppose to be ashamed. We are a developing country at a low rate at the moment because of the way we spend our limited resource (money). Another thing the state needs to implement its national development plan so that the gap between the poor and rich will be minimised and the balance be maximised. We cant accept an environment whereby one gets a salary of R250000 PM and another person earns R1250 a month. Those who earn high they mostly get increments than those earning lower. I suppose without addressing these phenomenon South Africa is going nowhere. strikes and boycotts will prevail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:14:09.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
