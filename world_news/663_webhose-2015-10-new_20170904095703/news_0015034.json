Interbrand’s 16th annual Best Global Brands report, released today, identifies the 100 most valuable global brands and for the third year in a row, Apple (#1) and Google (#2) claim the top positions. The annual ranking identifies the 100 most valuable global brands by analyzing the many ways a brand benefits an organization—from delivering on customer expectations to driving economic value. Interbrand’s Best Global Brands methodology was the first brand valuation method to become ISO certified. The list is based on a combination of attributes that contribute to a brand’s cumulative value: financial performance of the branded products and services, role the brand plays in influencing customer choice and the strength the brand has to command a premium price or secure earnings for the company.Valued at USD $170.276 billion, Apple increases its brand value by 43 percent. Google, valued at $120.314 billion, increases its brand value by 12 percent. Microsoft (#4) edges ahead of IBM (#5), and Amazon (#10) enters the Top 10 for the first time with a brand value of USD $37.948 billion.Five new brands entered this year’s ranking: Lego (#82), PayPal (#97), MINI (#98), Moët & Chandon (#99), and Lenovo (#100). Lenovo is the second Chinese brand to appear on the Best Global Brands ranking. The first was Huawei (#88), which entered the ranking in 2014. Technology and automotive brands dominate this year’s ranking, holding a combined 28 positions. Technology brands, in particular, dominate—collectively making up more than a third (33.6%) of the total value of all 100 brands.
