Credit: Gilles Tisseraud \nOriginal scientific research by two recent graduates from UH Mānoa's Global Environmental Science (GES) undergraduate program has shed new light on Hawai'i's past and current natural environment. \nCamilla Tognacchini's senior research project began with the goal to assess how the removal of invasive mangroves affect the health of Heʻeia Fishpond, a 600- to 800-year-old productive fishpond on the windward side of Oahu. During the two-month study period, which included a mangrove removal effort, Tognacchini and mentor (Oceanography Professor Margaret McManus) monitored salinity, water clarity and water movement in the fishpond, as well as weather conditions including rainfall, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric pressure. By fortune, the study period also captured the effects of three tropical storms – Wali, Iselle and Julio – thus expanding the scope of the study to include the effects of anthropogenic, as well as natural perturbations on the health of ecosystem. \nHe'eia Fishpond can serve as a model to quantify impacts of watershed management to the coastal ocean. The study indicates how essential pond management and watershed management are in protecting coastal ocean resources. \nHawaiian fishponds are unique and advanced forms of aquaculture found nowhere else in the world. Hawaiian coastal waters have been, and continue to be, subject to major anthropogenic impacts from land use changes, which have altered the characteristics of the coastal environment. \n\"Increased ocean temperatures increase the frequency of tropical cyclones near Hawaiʻi,\" said Tognacchini. \"It is critical to have an understanding of how increased temperature and rainfall affect our coastal waters. With this understanding, areas like Heʻeia Fishpond can be properly managed to mitigate future climate variability.\" A small wedge of ohia shows promise as an indicator of past climate. Credit: Justin Thayer \nFrom the curious mind to resource managers and community planners, many are interested in understanding how local climate has varied in the past. Scientists have long known that the form of carbon – that is, which isotope of carbon – a plant prefers to take in during photosynthesis can be influenced by environmental factors, such as rainfall. \nAs a GES student, Justin Thayer worked with mentor and Oceanography Professor Axel Timmermann to evaluate whether the carbon isotopic composition of 'ōhi'a trees at Hakalau, Mauna Kea, on Hawaiʻi Island could provide a reliable indicator of past climate conditions. Thayer and Timmermann's work established that 'ōhi'a may indeed be a window into historical conditions on Mauna Kea. \nSaid Thayer, \"Given the numerous parameters that influence the Hawaiian climate, elucidating the climate history of the Hawaiian Islands is pertinent to understanding and predicting future climate conditions. Since ʻōhiʻa grows in a wide range of climate types and given its potential long lifespan, the carbon isotope signature of ʻōhiʻa may be the perfect tool to provide high-resolution reconstructions of the climate history in the Hawaiian Islands.\" Changes in rainfall patterns are projected for next 30 years October 11, 2011 \nManoa have projected an increased frequency of heavy rainfall events but a decrease in rainfall intensity during the next 30 years (2011-2040) for the southern shoreline of Oahu, according to a recent study published in the ... Is Hawaii prepared for the impacts of climate change? August 21, 2014 \nThe Hawaiian Islands represent a wide diversity of ecosystems and environments, including areas of breathtaking natural beauty as well as densely populated coastal cities. These unique environments are already changing under ... Tree rings on Hawai'i could hold new knowledge about El Nino August 24, 2015 \nTrees can record centuries of history in their rings – changes in rainfall and temperatures, even evidence of fires sweeping through a region or the climatic impacts of volcanic eruptions. Annual rings are common in trees ... NOAA's new Climate Science Strategy outlines efforts to build resilience August 25, 2015 \nAs ocean conditions continue to change, putting ocean ecosystems and the communities that rely upon them at risk, today, NOAA took a first step in providing regional fisheries managers and stakeholders with information they ... Urgent research needed on predicting future regional climate change, report demands September 10, 2015 \nCrucial research into the changing spatial patterns of future climate patterns is urgently needed, a new review article has concluded. Local habitat conditions can safeguard cutthroat trout against harvest, climate change October 1, 2015 \nLocal habitat variability in northwest streams can help shield coastal cutthroat trout from the effects of forest harvest and climate change, a new U.S. Forest Service-led study has found. Recommended for you Spring to come three weeks earlier to the United States October 13, 2015 \nScientists have projected that the onset of spring plant growth will shift by a median of three weeks earlier over the next century, as a result of rising global temperatures. Climate scientist hits out at IPCC projections October 13, 2015 \nAs a new chairman is appointed to the Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change (IPCC) a University of Manchester climate expert has said headline projections from the organisation about future warming are 'wildly over optimistic.' 'Bridge' fuel may escalate atmospheric greenhouse gas October 13, 2015 \nWhile the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests there has been a decline in measurable atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use in the U.S. for the past seven years, a Cornell scientist says ... Study sees powerful winds carving away Antarctic snow October 13, 2015 \nA new study has found that powerful winds are removing massive amounts of snow from parts of Antarctica, potentially boosting estimates of how much the continent might contribute to sea level. Up to now, scientists had thought ... Hydraulic fracturing components in Marcellus groundwater likely from surface operations, not wells October 13, 2015 \nUS natural gas production increased by 42% between 2005 and 2014, largely due to recent advances in horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing. One of the largest natural gas reservoirs in the US, the Marcellus ... What are those phytoplankton up to? Genetics holds some clues October 13, 2015 \nTiny microbes called phytoplankton are churning away in the oceans, taking in carbon dioxide and producing the oxygen we breathe. Scientists recognize their value, but many questions remain about what will happen to their ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:58:53.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
