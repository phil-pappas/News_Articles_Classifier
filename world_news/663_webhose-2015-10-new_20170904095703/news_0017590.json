Some, like the ACT government, are stepping their way through this in a considered way. Justin McManus by Ed Husic Imagine you're among the first people to decide to send a message to a work colleague from your computer, instead of sending them a letter.\nAfter pressing the return key, there's a knock on the door and your computer is seized by the government.\nIt justifies its decision by explaining how it has invested millions of dollars in its mail network, get millions back via postal charges and can't afford to have people sending electronic mail via an unregulated, possibly risky new \"email\" system.\nRemember that weird example as you reflect on the fact that last week the NSW government cancelled the licences of 40 NSW drivers because they provided an uberX​ service.\nLabor MP Ed Husic says the public debate about technology and digital disruption must become better informed. Alex Ellinghausen Taxis have been around for generations. Yet in its first year of operating in Sydney, Uber's drivers have provided one million trips to Sydneysiders. That's disruption.\nI'd say an accepting public is largely \"voting with their apps\".\nManaging, not stopping change I understand why taxi drivers are uptight about Uber. Governments have a role in managing – but not stopping – change. Some, like the ACT government, are stepping their way through this in a considered way.\nTaxi drivers vent their anger over the ride-sharing service Uber at a protest outside the NSW Parliament. Daniel Munoz But this wave of disruption will not peter out. You can already notice the shapes of the next waves of change.\nFor example, amid the furious reaction to Uber, few ask: what happens to Uber and taxi drivers when driverless cars arrive? Uber has started planning for this, opening an advanced technologies centre in the United States.\nDon't focus just on the challenge of driverless cars. The Internet of Things, machine learning, robotics, and 3D printing are already here in some form. We should be thinking about the way they will increasingly pressure how we work, relate – and regulate.\nIn the 1980s, governments did the heavy lifting on economic liberalisation, because they played such a massive role in their economies.\nWaves of innovation The biggest liberalising force now is the ever-accelerating innovation unleashed by the internet. Hordes of start-ups, run on a shoe-string by young founders, are whipping up waves of change.\nWhen they have detected customer dissatisfaction in a market, the most powerful tool of a start-up isn't just technology – it's a simple question of \"What if?\"\nBy probing weakness in how big market players deliver goods or services, small ideas are funnelled into creating an app that chips away at existing business models, potentially leading to disruption and change.\nGovernments and much of the media focus only on technological disruption at the point of impact, where they're spending time calming – or reporting on – those whose livelihoods are being up-ended.\nBy this point, it's much too late. It needs to happen much earlier.\nGeorge Megalogenis has written that in the 1980s, politicians and the press formed a loose alliance in the national interest to smooth out the process of liberalisation. \"The opening up of the economy was a noble pursuit and the media felt they had a role to play in educating the public,\" he wrote.\nMedia tech knowledge I'd say the demand for that \"noble pursuit\" has re-emerged. Parliamentarians and the media must develop a keener appreciation of technology. Not for the sake of being able to work out the way an Apple Watch or 3D printer works, but because economies, communities and governments are set to change as a result of technology.\nIn Australia's case, 13 of our 19 industry sectors are going to be affected by technology, IBISWorld says. We'll need to get a sharper sense of the change that will probably happen.\nImportantly, we shouldn't shun the change opened by technology. We should welcome it as a chance to boost growth, reform and improve government and communities.\nAnd let's not just focus on the nuts and bolts of technology. Let's also ask ourselves about what policies are actually going to create a better environment for start-ups and early-stage innovation to emerge.\nAustralia has reportedly got some of the lowest rates of start-up formation in the world. Who would know this is a problem? Who is questioning why this is the case? How is the mainstream media needling politicians and governments to move on this, tackling the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics talent shortages or capital and regulatory blockages that are holding us back in this space.\nJust like three decades ago, when politicians and the media were forced to familiarise themselves with the concepts of deregulation and economic rationalism that were sweeping the world, current generations of parliamentarians and journalists will have to shed a view that technology is just the \"geeks' preserve\".\nIn understanding this, we can appreciate better the role innovation can play in helping generate the type of economic and employment growth necessary to maintain the living standards we enjoy as a result of the reforms of the 1980s and 90s.\nEd Husic is Labor member for Chifley and shadow parliamentary secretary to the shadow treasurer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:30:09.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
