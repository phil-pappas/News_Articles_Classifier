Josh Alcorn, a senior adviser to the super PAC and a Biden family friend, said nobody respects Biden and his family more than Draft Biden.\nBiden has said he's considering entering the presidential race, but has yet to make a decision, to the dismay of ardent supporters calling for him to run. He would challenge front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\nAlthough Draft Biden is an independent group and legally barred from coordinating with a campaign, it has attracted a number of supporters with close and longstanding ties to Biden and President Barack Obama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:04:48.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
