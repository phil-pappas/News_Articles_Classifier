Featuring a familiar, swipe-to-view, tap-to-buy mobile interface, users can quickly browse collections assembled by style curators and instantly tag which looks are a \"hit\" and which are a \"miss.\" Just like close friends can pull the best pieces for one another when shopping, Hit or Miss learns your personal style to do the same. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277931 \nHit or Miss gives time-starved women shoppers the thrill of finding new wardrobe staples and investment pieces in mere seconds--no slogging through hundreds-per-page product views or navigating clunky brand sites not optimized for mobile. The app simultaneously delivers a solution for retailers who are not optimized for mobile that render poorly and are difficult to navigate. When viewed through Hit or Miss, fashion is presented in an aesthetically-driven and tactile experience that fosters an emotional connection with each product. \nSince its recent soft launch, Hit or Miss has already established itself as an addictive shopping experience that connects users with obsession-worthy fashion in seconds. Thanks to its clean, image-driven design and intuitive interface, early adapters are logging serious engagement time. The app has featured over 400 luxury and contemporary brands and 10,000+ products. The app is powered by Skull Ninja Labs' own Wallabii shopping platform, which showcases a bundle of convenient mobile shopping features, including social product trends, ratings, recommendations and price tracking. \n\"Over half a billion people last year used their mobile device to make a purchase, and apparel and accessories lead the way in m-commerce growth,\" said Skull Ninja Labs Co-Founder Amber Reyngoudt. \"But until now there has not been a dedicated mobile commerce channel that integrates fashion bloggers and tastemakers within a transactional context, to create a fully optimized and satisfying mobile experience. We're navigating Hit or Miss into a unique space that truly empowers discovering new looks, optimized for our mobile lifestyle.\" \nSkull Ninja Labs' Amber Reyngoudt and Dave Peck have a history together creating innovative apps. Their previous collaboration with Kevin Rose on Milk Inc., where the duo helped develop Oink, a food-rating app acquired by Google. The team has consulted many San Francisco start-ups, North Technologies, Airbnb, about.me, and Madison Reed; it's now focused on further fostering brand and retailer relationships for Hit or Miss, along with evolving and elevating app functionality and partnering with fashion influencers to feature their favorite trends and brands. \nMedia Contact: Amber Reyngoudt, Skull Ninja Inc., 4157228011, amber@skullninja.com \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com \nSOURCE Skull Ninja Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:38:29.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
