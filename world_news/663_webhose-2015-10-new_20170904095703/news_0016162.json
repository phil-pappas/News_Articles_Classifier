Indeed, many people in Britain had probably not even heard of the Spanish bank until it emerged with a deal to acquire TSB for £1.7bn this year. \nBut the chief financial officer of Spain’s fifth-largest bank by assets has grand plans for TSB as part of the lender’s strategy to grow in the UK. More Credit Suisse wins exemption for US pension business \nBritain’s banking sector is ripe for disruption from new so-called challengers, and Mr Varela believes TSB, with its established brand, can spearhead this revolution with the backing of Sabadell . \nIn Sabadell’s first interview in London since completion of the acquisition, Mr Varela says: “Awareness of the Sabadell brand in the UK is understandably low. TSB is a very powerful brand.” \nDigital services is a key part of this mission, as is expanding into the business banking market as soon as possible, he says. \nLeveraging off Sabadell’s technological capabilities, TSB will launch a range of digital services in the UK next year, before the challenger is fully integrated on to the Spanish lender’s technology platform. \nThe new digital services will include Instant Money, which allows customers to send a text via mobile phone with a code, enabling the receiver to collect cash from a TSB ATM. Sabadell will also launch Mobile Pay — similar to Apple Pay but using the bank’s own systems — allowing customers to make contactless payments using a mobile phone. \nMr Varela says Sabadell’s bank technology platform, Proteo, was designed to facilitate the development of such digital services and acquire banks. He says: “We provide one of the best digital platforms in Spain. Part of Proteo is that it gives customers digital opportunities. \n“We are planning to give the UK these features over the second half of 2016 before finishing the migration.” \nMr Varela is confident that Sabadell’s migration of TSB on to a UK version of its Spanish technology platform will fall within the £450m that Lloyds must provide as a condition for receiving state aid during the financial crisis. \nHowever, some analysts are less optimistic . Huw van Steenis of Morgan Stanley describes the cross-border acquisition as a “strategically risky move due to IT complexities”. He believes migrating TSB on to a new platform will cost another £200m on top of the £450m from Lloyds Banking Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T13:19:43.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
