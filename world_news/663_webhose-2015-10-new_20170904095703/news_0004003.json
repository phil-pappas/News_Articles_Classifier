CHRIS RATCLIFFE by Marie Mawad and Lucas Shaw Music streaming site Deezer is seeking at least €300 million in a Paris IPO valuing it at as much as €1.1 billion, as it tackles Spotify's bigger and better-known service and Apple's more recent products.\nThe initial public offering would value the French company at €900 million to €1.1 billion after it sells 8.2 million new shares at €36.40 to €49.24 apiece, it said Thursday. Existing shareholders, including founder Daniel Marhely, Idinvest Partners and French telecommunications tycoon Xavier Niel, may sell stakes through an over-allotment option representing as much as 15 per cent of the sale, Deezer said.\n\"The music market is rebounding after some tough years, and the streaming segment should grow even faster,\" Chief Executive Officer Hans-Holger Albrecht said in a conference call. \"We're just at the beginning.\"\nStarted in 2007 by Marhely, who quit school at 16 to work as a developer for Internet startups, Deezer had 6.3 million subscribers at the end of June, according to the IPO filing. The company, whose largest shareholders also include Leonard Blavatnik's Access Industries, is smaller than Swedish rival Spotify, which has more than 20 million paying subscribers and was said to be valued at $US8.5 billion in its most recent financing round.\nApple Competition Deezer now faces intensified competition after Apple introduced its music-streaming offering in June. Albrecht said it hasn't hurt Deezer so far. If anything, Apple will have a positive effect by helping to develop the streaming market, he said.\n\"Since the launch of Apple's service we haven't seen any kind of impact on our business,\" Albrecht said. \"Apple doesn't change things fundamentally. We're used to tough competition.\"\nAs the competition in music streaming intensifies, companies are branching out into events and merchandising to make their services more appealing to consumers and artists. Last week, Pandora, the world's leading online radio service, paid $US450 million for Ticketfly, a ticketing service. Deezer said Thursday it will also partner with BandPage to include concert listings in artist profiles and alert fans to upcoming offers.\n The company has a track record of teaming up with phone companies to sell its premium subscriptions coupled with mobile- phone packages and, since it launched in the US about a year ago after a long hold off, has partnered with speaker makers Sonos and Bose. Deezer plans to use the IPO money to boost its sales network and increase market share through partnerships.\nThe subscription period for shares will end Oct. 26 for the French public and the following day for international investors, Deezer said. Trading on the Paris exchange will begin Oct. 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:20:25.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
