Part of the reason could be due to getting more sun during pregnancy, which can lead to higher birth weight and later onset of puberty, said authors of the study, which was published in the journal Heliyon . \nResearchers, from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Epidemiology Unit of the University of Cambridge in the UK, looked at growth and development of about 450,000 men and women from the UK Biobank study. Comparisons showed that babies born in summer months of June, July and August were taller as adults, and weighed more at birth. The results for the first time also found that the onset of puberty happened later for girls born during the summer, which is an indication of better health later in life. \n“This is the first time puberty timing has been robustly linked to seasonality,” said lead author John Perry, Ph.D. “We were surprised, and pleased, to see how similar the patterns were on birth weight and puberty timing. Our results show that birth month has a measurable effect on development and health, but more work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this effect.” \nResearchers believe higher vitamin D exposure, because of more sunlight, in the second trimester of pregnancy, could be the driving force, but note that more research is needed. \n“We don’t know the mechanisms that cause these season of birth patterns on birth weight, height, and puberty timing,” Perry said. “We need to understand these mechanisms before our findings can be translated into health benefits.” He said the scientists believe that vitamin D exposure is important and hopes the team’s results will inspire others to research the link between long term effects of early life vitamin D and health and puberty timing.
