Toshiba plans to sell its image sensor manufacturing plant in Oita, southern Japan, and pull out of the sensor business altogether, said the sources, who declined to be identified. \nThe sale is likely to be finalised soon, the sources said. \nToshiba is considering several options for its system LSI semiconductor business and its discrete semiconductor business and that debate is ongoing, a Toshiba official said when contacted. \nAn official from Sony declined to comment. \nMasashi Muromachi, who became Toshiba's CEO following the accounting scandal, has promised to restructure lower-margin businesses. \nThe deal for the image sensor business would be the beginning of the restructuring, Nikkei reported earlier on Saturday. \nSony is already a dominant player in the image sensor market, with its products used in phones made by China's Xiaomi and India's Micromax Informatix Ltd ( IPO-MINF.NS ).
