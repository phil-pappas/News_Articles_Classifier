Growing up in a single-parent family meant we didn’t always have the money to buy the latest thing, so the more successful I’ve got the more I’ve enjoyed being able to see what’s out there. I have loads: cameras, video cameras, consoles, headsets, about 50 pairs of headphones.\nDoes tech help with gymnastics? \nThere’s not a lot of tech in gymnastics, but there are some things you can use in training. I use the slow-mo on my phone, so I can see what I am doing frame by frame.\nHow often do you Google yourself? \nI have some alerts on my phone, which means quite often I wake up to things that aren’t true. That can be quite scary. But I don’t search for myself very often.\nIf you could travel back in time, where would you go? \nI’d go to the 50s or 40s, to London or America. I love the swing, doo-wop, Charleston, Motown-type vibe. I know it was harder for my ethnicity back then but I’d put up with it.\nWhat would be the first thing you’d make with a 3-D printer? \nA kind of plinth for my Olympic torch. I haven’t got it anywhere decent, it’s just sitting next to my fireplace, so I’d like a stand for it.\nWhat social media do you use? \nI use them all: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I like Twitter and Facebook for the videos. And I use Snapchat, too. That’s mainly for the fans – I can add things on My Story, which is pretty cool.\nFavourite app? \nITunes is my favourite but I’ve recently got into this thing called Thug Life. You make your own videos, like when a cat pushes a glass off a table and then you add chains and sunglasses to it. It’s hilarious.\nDo you speak on your phone at the checkout? \nIf it wasn’t important I’d put it in my pocket. It’s rude. I’ve got friends that are always on their phones at meals, which I really don’t like.\nDo you use text-speak? \nNo, I write everything out properly. Or leave a voice note. That’s quite easy.\nFavourite computer game? \nCall of Duty : Black Ops 2 is the best, I think, but I always play the most up-to-date version online. MW2 was good, too. I have an Xbox One and a PS4. I play fans on PlayStation. And I also have a PSP.At competitions and training camps there’s sometimes quite a lot of downtime, and especially if you’re in a different timezone you can’t just message someone, so it’s good to have something to do.\nMost expensive piece of tech? \nI have a brilliant party house. There’s a Sonos music system built into the house, with the speakers integrated and wired in. That cost about 12 grand. And my TV cost about seven and a half – it’s a 75-inch. I bought it just before the 4G screens came out, and I’m tempted by them, but my TV’s all right for the minute.\nI hear you are a fan of hot tubs ... \nYep . If the party moves out to the garden I’ve got my Louis Smith hot tub as well which is really good because it is a big seven-seater. It’s multipurpose – I use it a lot for muscle recovery after training.\nShould anything be censored online? \nDefinitely. There’s some messed up stuff on the internet. Nothing terroristy should be allowed – war crimes, beheadings, anything that can radicalise people. Anything that’s illegal, obviously. Porn’s all right.\nRelated: No sex, please, they're robots, says Japanese android firm \nWould you have sex with a robot? \nIn 30 years’ time, I might do. The technology doesn’t seem great at the moment. I have a girlfriend so I think I’d rather stick with the real thing.\nWould you want a driverless car? \nNo. It would take all the fun away. I have a Nissan Skyline GT-R and I love driving it. I wouldn’t want a robot car unless the robot was programmed by Lewis Hamilton. That would be all right.\nWould you try Oculus Rift? \nI’d love to. The Gadget Show did something where they wired the system to paintball guns – so when you got shot a paintball gun would shoot you. And you were on a treadmill so when you walked forward you walked in the game. I’d want one of those in my house.\nRelated: Six of the best noise-cancelling headphones to silence the commute \nFavourite headphones? \nI have some Jamaican Beats [by Dre]. I had some GB ones at the 2012 Olympics and swapped with one of the Jamaican team. I’ve got wireless ones, bass buds with diamonds in them. They’re a bit flashy.\nWhich emoji do you use most often? \nProbably the laughing one where he’s got two tears coming out.\nCandy Crush \nIf anyone else sends me a Candy Crush invite on Facebook I’m going to unfriend them. It looks like the most tedious game ever.\nDo you have a selfie stick? \nNo, but I have a stick for my GoPro that’s kind of similar. My girlfriend gave it to me for my birthday. I haven’t done much with it yet except attach it to the dog. But I’m going to try to incorporate it into my training, to get some cool gymnastics shots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:47:06.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
