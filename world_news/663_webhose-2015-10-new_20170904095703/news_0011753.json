Last year, it was split into two firms: an education-loan manager known as Navient Corp. and a consumer-banking operation that continued under the Sallie Mae brand.\nFor the quarter ended Sept. 30, Sallie Mae earned $40.8 million, or nine cents a share, compared with $78.1 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Year-over-year comparisons reflect a large gain on loan sales in the 2014 quarter.\nCore earnings fell to 10 cents a share from 17 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projected 10 cents a share.\nNet interest income rose 22% to $175 million.\nMeasureOne, which tracks student loans, said in a June report that private-student-loan lenders provided $6.7 billion to enrolled undergraduate and graduate students in the first three-quarters of the 2014-2015 academic year, up 7.4% from a year earlier. The firm said loan losses continued to fall amid tighter underwriting standards.\nNavy Federal Credit Union, the largest U.S. credit union by assets, began offering private student loans earlier this year. Wells Fargo & Co., the second-largest private student lender by origination volume behind SLM, has also been moving to increase originations.\nWrite to Josh Beckerman at josh.beckerman@wsj.com\n 21:05 ET (01:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:05:26.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
