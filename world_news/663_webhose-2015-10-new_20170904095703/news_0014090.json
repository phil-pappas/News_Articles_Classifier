QPID Health , which helps hospitals and medical groups achieve their quality goals with software that generates actionable information from electronic health records, today announced the availability of QPID Groupers for Epic. The Company's clinical content enhances Epic functionality by linking entities such as a specific disease with related medications and labs. The results are enhanced Problem List, Synopsis View, and Chart Search functions in Epic deployments. The QPID Grouper content takes just minutes to load, using a new import mechanism released by Epic for its client base. Currently, Epic clients must create Grouper content in-house, and manually, using teams of MDs, RNs and PharmDs across various departments. With QPID Groupers for Epic, QPID Health's clinical experts handle all curation and maintenance, helping hospitals reduce costs and eliminate redundant work across departments. QPID Groupers are continually updated as guidelines change and new therapies are released.\nJohn Lee , CMIO of Edward Elmhurst , an integrated healthcare delivery system serving the state of Illinois , explained: \"QPID Groupers for Epic has solved a problem for us, which is shared by our colleagues throughout the Epic user community: how to eliminate the ad hoc creation of clinical content and use of in-house clinical resources for a time-intensive process. The volume of work becomes overwhelming when you try to accommodate changes, which are constant. QPID Health eliminates this by providing a body of validated clinical content that is updated on a regular basis.\"\nDelivered as a subscription service of clinical content, QPID Groupers are uploaded using a new import tool developed by Epic. The first deliverable in the subscription service includes the Top 100 medical conditions and associated laboratory tests and medications, as well as disease-centric Groupers as defined by the Value Set Authority Center (VSAC).\nOnce loaded into the Epic instance, the QPID Grouper clinical associations enhance clinical workflow as follows:\nThe Problem List enhances problem-based charting by including richer information such as prescribed medications, organized in a clinically oriented way. Chart Search expands beyond free-text search to include elements such as related labs and medications for a certain disease. Synopsis View provides building blocks of patient information relevant to the specialist using the system. The VSAC content provides building blocks for reporting on quality measures. For example, when reporting to the clinical quality measure NQF 0070 – beta-blocker therapy for prior myocardial infarction or left ventricular dysfunction –VSAC Groupers help identify the specific groups of patients that would qualify for the condition \"myocardial infarction\" and the specific prescription for \"beta-blocker\". QPID Groupers will then identify the correct drugs (by brand and generic names) associated with the prescription so providers are compliant with quality measures.\nMike Doyle , QPID Health President and CEO stated: \"We are excited to announce this offering from our clinical content experts, made possible by our collaboration with Epic. The QPID Groupers for Epic service eliminates the need for hospitals to create and maintain Groupers in-house, meaning that they can get more value from their Epic EHR investment, at lower costs.\"\nAbout QPID Health:\nQPID Health helps hospitals and medical groups achieve their quality goals with software that generates actionable information from patient records. QPID Health's clinical reasoning software combines advanced natural language processing (NLP), clinical logic, and machine learning to locate and synthesize patient facts in medical records.\nWith 8500 active users across major integrated delivery networks including Partners HealthCare and Providence Health & Services, and over 10 years of use in demanding clinical settings, QPID Health software is clinician proven and scalable.
