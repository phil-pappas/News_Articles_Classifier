However the concern for me came after the defacing of the statues and protests in institutions became a monthly event. To qualify my concerns I will pick a part the two concerning issues and how they have created a could of confusion as to what people are really fighting for.\nFirstly as a leader of any calibre you are aware of social injustices that exist and it would be safe to assume that is how one landed up in a position of leadership to fight those very injustices. If that is established one is aware of the massive responsibility being a leader and to say the least the leaders of these organizations seem as though they omitted the responsibility part of being a leader. As a leader you are also responsible for the actions of the people that you lead. Students abandon their classes and participate in demonstrations led by these leaders in the voice of fighting for what they believe in, however if those students are not well informed it would result in biting more than you chew. If 1+1 makes 2, surely missing classes and protesting leads to failure. This not just a students concern but parents that have invested dearly in their child’s education. I am not a critique of what is being fought for rather the manner in which people are being directed to protest. Revolutions are useful and it’s the youth‘s duty be a part of it ,as a revolution is a disagreement between generations as to how they want the future to be.\nThe second concern is the political influence that has tainted the image of the protesting students. Various political organizations have hi-jacked the students train and are derailing it with politicking and finger pointing. What this is doing is buying the institutions time they didn’t have before as students where hot on their heels. What has become of a promising revolution is a broken record with no clear direction or particular demands as the lines have been blurred poor leadership tactics from various political organizations outside university halls. The one danger is mercenaries as they are always willing to fight and passionately but not for the sake of your cause but the thrill in the fight. People like that can only bring harm to an organization as they only want masters to serve and the purpose of that is to disobey. A house divided will never stand and this has become of the familiar trend with organizations these days. Leaders of these said organizations need to differentiate themselves from being another promise of a revolution, identify their position and not only have demands but have people in the background actively working seeking solution that are of relative freedom as opposed to absolute freedom, unless the aim is to win an ideological battle, if so Marx was right, China is liberal and South Africa is free of social injustices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:02:03.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
