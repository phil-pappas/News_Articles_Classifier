It is the largest-scale solar power plant in commercial operation in Japan. About 510,000 solar panels were set up on 253ha of land, which is equivalent to an area 50 times the size of the Tokyo Dome. \nThe mega (large-scale) solar power plant consists of two sites in Mutsuogawara Development District: \"Chitosedairakita Area\" (inland) and \"Takahoko Area\" (near the sea), which transmit 55MW and 60MW of electricity, respectively, to the power line. \nThe two sites are about 5km away from each other, and electricity generated at the sites is transmitted to Rokkasho Transformer Station of Tohoku-Electric Power Co Inc via the extra-high-voltage power line (154kV). A 16.4km-long cable was installed under a road between each of the two sites and the transformer station. \nShimizu Corp provided EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) services. The solar panel and PV inverter used for the Chitosedairakita Area are products of SunPower Corp and Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corp (TMEIC), respectively. And those employed for the Takahoko Area are products of Mitsubishi Electric Corp and TMEIC, respectively ( See related article ). \nThe Eurus Rokkasho Solar Park is Eurus Energy's seventh solar project in Japan. The total capacity of its solar power generation facilities is now 232.5MW in Japan and 281.468MW on a global basis (the amount of electricity transmitted to power grids).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:58:24.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
