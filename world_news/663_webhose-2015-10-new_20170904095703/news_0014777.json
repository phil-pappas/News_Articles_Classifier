Air Fuel Synthesis shows petrol from air has future October 19, 2012 \n(Phys.org)—Petrol from air at first glance from this week's headlines, claiming scientists have turned fresh air into petrol, looked as if this was yet another over the top claim about a killer solution to solve the environmental ... Global warming pioneer calls for CO2 to be taken from atmosphere and stored underground August 28, 2014 \nWally Broeker, the first person to alert the world to Global Warming, has called for atmospheric CO2 to be captured and stored underground. He says that Carbon Capture, combined with limits on fossil fuel emissions, is the ... Reducing greenhouse gas emissions with a more effective carbon capture method March 4, 2015 \nTrapping carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants and various industries could play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the future. But current materials that can collect CO2—from smokestacks, ... Global carbon dioxide levels reach new monthly record (Update) May 6, 2015 \nIn another ominous sign of human-caused climate change, US government scientists said Wednesday that global carbon dioxide concentrations have reached a new monthly record of 400 parts per million. Bioethanol from waste gases facility plan in Europe announced July 13, 2015 \nThree companies announced they have entered into a letter of intent to build Europe's first commercial-scale production facility to create bioethanol from waste gases produced during the steelmaking process. The announcement ... We can turn CO2 in the air into new materials, but don't expect that to stop climate change August 26, 2015 \nWhat if there were a way to suck carbon dioxide right out of the air and turn it into useful products? It might seem fantastic but scientists have actually proved it's possible. One of the challenges with making it a viable ... Recommended for you Horn of Africa drying ever faster as climate warms October 9, 2015 \nThe Horn of Africa has become increasingly arid in sync with the global and regional warming of the last century and at a rate unprecedented in the last 2,000 years, according to new research led by a University of Arizona ... Could 'The Day After Tomorrow' happen? October 9, 2015 \nA researcher from the University of Southampton has produced a scientific study of the climate scenario featured in the disaster movie 'The Day After Tomorrow'. How we discovered that the Earth's inner core is older than previously thought October 9, 2015 \nAccording to recent estimates, the Earth's solid inner core started forming between half a billion and one billion years ago. However, our new measurements of ancient rocks as they cool from magma have indicated that it may ... Scientists find formula for rate of glacial erosion October 9, 2015 \nIt's a truism that mathematical relationships are present nearly everywhere in nature, probably more than we realise. The latest place they have turned up is on the underside of glaciers. Unexpected information about Earth's climate history from Yellow River sediment October 9, 2015 \nBy meticulously examining sediments in China's Yellow River, a Swedish-Chinese research group are showing that the history of tectonic and climate evolution on Earth may need to be rewritten. Their findings are published ...
