But Shelf Awareness , a bookseller newsletter, published an item with some interesting hints.\nThe possible site is in University Village, an upscale outdoor mall north of the University of Washington that's already home to thriving Apple and Microsoft stores.\nConstruction is underway at the site of a recently closed sushi restaurant at the mall.\nSeattle's Department of Planning and Development permits list the retailer moving into the space as \"Ann Bookstore\" and \"Project Anne.\" The first permit for the construction was issued on August 4, 2015.\nThe management office of University Village did not respond to a request for comment.\nA GeekWire reporter who visited the site reported seeing boxes of books and bookshelves being installed there.\nAccording to Shelf Awareness, none of Seattle's large independent bookstores say it's anything they're working on.\nSeveral employees of Seattle’s Third Place Books were contacted by Amazon about jobs via their LinkedIn pages a few months ago, said managing partner Robert Sindelar.\n“Their resumes and credentials are that they’re tenured book sellers,” he said.\nThe employees weren’t told much when they called Amazon but from what they could piece together, it sounded like Amazon was hiring for some sort of retail bookstore, he said.\nThere have been rumors for years in Seattle’s bookselling community that Amazon might open a physical location but these are the most concrete.\nThird Place Books runs two bookstores with another opening in 2016. Its flagship store is just a mile and a half from the potential new Amazon store.\nStill, Sindelar isn’t worried. Customers come to his bookstores for their robust and deep selection of books as well as the \"third place,\" home away from home experience they offer.\n“People say they’re going to be selling what we’re selling, so it’s going to eat into our business. But my core customer base isn’t supporting us because they can’t find books someplace else. People come here for the experience.”\n1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RyJkJw TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyJkJw&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RyJkJw&text=Is%20Amazon%20opening%20a%20bookstore%20in%20Seattle%3F&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800065045587174-AMAZON-GERMANY-CENTER-66943124.jpg", "http://www.geekwire.com/2015/is-this-amazons-first-bookstore-mystery-surrounds-secretive-seattle-retail-site/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6396456d9c64b32271ba281facbc93eb30f07301/c=199-0-3302-2333&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800065045587174-AMAZON-GERMANY-CENTER-66943124.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800065045587174-AMAZON-GERMANY-CENTER-66943124.jpg", "http://www.shelf-awareness.com/issue.html?issue=2609#m30086", "http://usat.ly/1RyJkJw"], "published": "2015-10-10T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:23:56.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
