The final IPO size could be different. \nSquare said it would apply to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SQ”. \nThe company said net revenue grew 54 per cent to $850.2-million in 2014. \nEarlier today, Twitter named Google Inc executive Omid Kordestani as its executive chairman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:56:49.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
