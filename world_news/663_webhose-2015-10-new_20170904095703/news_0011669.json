(the \"Corporation\") (TSX:RVX) today announced the commencement of a Phase 3 clinical trial called 'BETonMACE' with lead drug apabetalone (RVX-208) in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Resverlogix has received initial approval from the regulatory authority and ethics committee in the first three countries: Belgium , Hungary and Israel , which will represent approximately 15 investigative sites of an expected 175 site trial. The first site initiation visit was held today and with drug now available to the centers, enrollment of patients will commence. Over the course of the coming months, additional investigative sites will be activated. \nAbout BETonMACEBETonMACE will assess the effect of apabetalone (RVX-208) on time to first occurrence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) in high-risk type 2 DM patients with CAD. The Phase 3 trial will be double-blinded, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, with up to 104 weeks of dosing. MACE is defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization for cardiovascular disease events or stroke. All subjects will remain on a high-dose statin therapy (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin), with the experimental group receiving 200 mg/day of apabetalone in the form of 100 mg capsules twice daily. Primary outcome measures will be time to first occurrence of MACE as defined above. Secondary outcome measures and additional trial details and updates can be found at: www.clinicaltrials.gov and/or www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ . \nAbout ResverlogixResverlogix is developing apabetalone (RVX-208), a first-in-class, small molecule that is a selective BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) inhibitor. BET bromodomain inhibition is an epigenetic mechanism that can regulate disease-causing genes. Apabetalone is the first and only BET inhibitor selective for the second bromodomain (BD2) within the BET protein called BRD4. This selective inhibition of apabetalone on BD2 produces a specific set of biological effects with potentially important benefits for patients with diseases such as high-risk cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, Orphan diseases, and peripheral artery disease, while maintaining a well described safety profile. Apabetalone is the only selective BET bromodomain inhibitor in human clinical trials. Resverlogix's Phase 3 clinical trial BETonMACE in high-risk CVD patients with type 2 DM and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has now commenced.
