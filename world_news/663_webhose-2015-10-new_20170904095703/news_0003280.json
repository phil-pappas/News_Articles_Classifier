It is to date the world’s largest container vessel in terms of loading capacity, being able to accommodate 19,224 TEU.\nThe requirements of some port infrastructures in Europe has obliged MSC to limit the length of the ship to 395.4 metres, with a width of 59 metres, and maintaining a draught of 16 metres.\nOscar has a deadweight tonnage up to 196,000 tonnes.\nWith an optimised hull shape for business speeds lower than before, the maximum speed of the vessel is higher than 22 knots.\nThe MSC Oscar is operated on the Albatross Asia-Europe service. This service directly links the Asian ports of Dalian, Busan, Qingdao, Ningbo, Shanghai, Xiamen, Yantian, Tanjung Pelepas to the port of Le Havre – the first port of call on the North-European range.\nIn other news, MSC has announced the withdrawal of its ‘Great Sea’ service that operates between Asia and the Black Sea. The service will cease operation on Asia export sailings from the first week of November. The string currently operates nine vessels with a nominal capacity of 5,500 TEU.\nCaroline Becquart, Senior Vice President of MSC, said: “The decision to withdraw this service is due to unexpectedly low demand out of Asia. We have to adapt our capacity to the demand in these difficult times.”\nFact File: MSC is a privately-owned global shipping company founded in 1970 by Gianluigi Aponte.
