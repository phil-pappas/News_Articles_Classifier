The highest ranked vendors in customer satisfaction and client experience are announced in twenty-four financial solution functionalities and systems. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273284 \nAdditionally, 2,250 respective hospital CFOs, CIOs, business office managers, tech and financial staffers contributed their perceptions on Financial Systems Software and Services Solutions to Black Book(TM) between April and September 2015. Additionally the business managers of 607 outpatient, alternative care, and physician practices owned by hospital systems also submitted ballots and evaluated separately. 528 hospital and inpatient organizations were represented in the survey in total. \n\"Most hospital CFOs have no choice but to leverage next generation financial system solutions including software and outsourced services in order to keep their organizations solvent. The reimbursement challenges ahead to get paid may require several new applications. The frank reality is that outdated, understaffed and failing current solutions could quickly close a marginally performing hospital for good,\" said Doug Brown, Managing Partner of Black Book Market Research. \n88% of chief financial officers with negative 2014 operating margins report slow or no progress towards orchestrating a technology infrastructure to support value-based models. \n\"Given the complexities of each individual hospital, implementing the right software and outsourcing solutions in delicate sequence is crucial as to not create an even more adverse situation through the transition,\" said Brown. \"Trends in Medicare reimbursement, declining inpatient volumes, rising expenses and bad debt have most hospitals across the country struggling to avoid a financial stability crisis.\" \n70% of struggling hospitals are putting population health, analytics, physician practice acquisitions and recruitment, and patient engagement on the back burner, an improvement from 84% in 2014. \nIn contrast, 89% of CFOs hospitals performing at margins supporting long term viability (over 3%) report successful revenue cycle management transformations initiated, with 2016 capital expenditures planned for upgraded tools such as dashboards, analytics and business intelligence, population health, physician portals, patient engagement solutions and continued acquisitions. \nBlack Book(TM) also announced the top performing financial software and outsourced services vendors as ranked by customer satisfaction on eighteen client experience based key performance indicators in thirty-four categories of financial services and technology solutions. \n\"With so many organizations facing operating margins below the minimal thresholds for long-term financial stability and sustainability, boards and CEO's are moving financial support solutions and outsourcing initiatives to the top of their 2016 capital expenditure priorities,\" said Brown. \nBlack Book's 2015 financial solutions survey results can be viewed at http://www.blackbookmarketresearch.com/finance-revenue-cycle-management/ \nRanking highest in financial services client experience are: \nAccountable Care Organization Financial Software & Services - Conifer Health \nAccounting & Audit Outsourcing Firms -McGladrey \nBenchmarking and Performance Measurement - Truven Health Analytics \nBusiness Decision Support Software - Allscripts EPSI \nBusiness Intelligence Dashboards - Tableau \nCapital And Equipment Planning Software - Infor \nCFO & Board Strategic Financial Advisory Consultants - Beacon Consultants \nCharge Capture & Charge Master Tools - MedAssets \nClaims Management/Clearinghouse - Availity \nCollections Outsourcing & Accounts Receivables Debt - Transunion Healthcare \nComputer Assisted Coding & Medical Records Solutions- Nuance \nCost Accounting - Strata Decision \nDenial Management/Third Party Recovery - Adreima \nEarly Out/Self Pay Solutions - Avadyne Health \nEnterprise Master Patient Index Tools - Allscripts \nEnterprise Scheduling Software - Avantas \nEnterprise Resource Planning Software - Infor \nFinancial Documentation & Content Management Solutions - Streamline Health \nInsurance & Payer Eligibility Verification Solutions - Recondo Technology \nManaged Care Payment/Reimbursement Solutions - Wellcentive \nMedical Transcription Services Outsourcing -M*Modal \nOperational Budgeting & Forecasting Software - Healthcare Insights \nOutsourced Financial Analytics - TriZetto Provider Solutions \nPatient Accounting - Siemens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:30:34.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
