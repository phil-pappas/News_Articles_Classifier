In addition to streamlining the Court’s internal operations, Benchmark will provide online access to court information for attorneys and the general public. The project completion time was unheard of in the industry, and a demonstration of Pioneer’s commitment to its customers. The Probate Court’s previous system was unsupported, leaving the Court in a precarious position. A typical system installation time is twelve to fifteen months; Pioneer was able to assist the Court in less than six.\nThe Mobile County Judge of Probate Court , Don Davis had this to say: “The last year has been taxing on the Court's administration as well as the judicial and IT divisions of the Court. AMCAD's collapse left the Court in an untenable situation and to be able to launch Benchmark in such a compressed time frame is a great relief to the Court's staff and me. I want to thank the Probate Court's staff and Pioneer for the way they worked to make the very aggressive timeline we established possible. These conversions are very complicated and it has truly been a team effort to get us to this point. We are hopeful that this is a long and successful partnership that will greatly enhance our service to the citizens of Mobile County and beyond.”\nBenchmark moves the Court closer to a paperless process, allowing users of the system to route and sign documents electronically. Mobile is one of the state-selected beta sites for electronic filling of Probate Court pleadings. Benchmark will be a critical part of the e-file transition, and will provide attorneys with electronic access similar to what they use in other Alabama courts, and in the federal court system.\n“Mobile is an important partner in our growth, representing our third Court in Alabama and our first Probate Court in the state,” said Steve Rumsey, President of Pioneer. “It represents an important step forward for establishing a presence within the state. We hope this installation demonstrates our commitment to our customers to other Alabama courts, and are happy to welcome Mobile as a member of the Pioneer family. We look forward to building on the relationship.”\nAbout Pioneer Technology Group\nPioneer Technology Group (PTG) is a leading developer of software solutions and services to Governments and the private sector.
