Credit: Erika Fish, QUT Media. \nEver wanted to track a rock wallaby in the rugged Australian bush or watch an orangutan swing past you in the wild jungles of Borneo but without the dangers of being there? \nTo better protect threatened habitat, wildlife experts and QUT researchers have combined to create an \"immersive environment\" to predict, locate and track species, through virtual reality. \nProfessor Kerrie Mengersen, from QUT's School of Mathematical Sciences, said the information gathered from field trips she headed enabled a virtual platform to monitor critically engangered animals like rock wallabies, koalas, cheetahs, Sumatran orangutans and sun bears. \n\"It's expensive, time consuming and sometimes dangerous to physically obtain data describing these elusive creatures,\" Professor Mengersen said. \n\"Habitat suitability maps are very sketchy and the potential conservation areas are huge. \n\"Our project aims to fill the gap in the evidence for deciding which areas to preserve.\" \nProfessor Mengersen and a team of scientists use high-resolution, 360-degree cameras with sound recording equipment to provide real-time panoramic displays of the species' environments. \nThe 2015 ARC Laureate Fellow and her QUT and CSIRO colleagues demonstrated the model worked in a small case study that predicted the whereabouts of rock wallabies in remote areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales. \n\"These wallabies live in inaccessible places and are rare. However, working with ecologists' data, we built a predictive model into a virtual reality environment and used it to locate where the habitat exists across a broad landscape,\" Professor Mengersen said.

It's extracting information and feeding it into a model that can be used to analyse, predict and conserve.\" \nProfessor Mengersen, who is Deputy Director of ACEMS, the ARC Centre for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers, was recently awarded ARC Laureate Fellowship valued at $2.4 million over five years to translate statistical knowledge to challenges in industry, environment and health. \nProfessor Mengersen was a key speaker at the International Conference in Statistics, Mathematics, Teaching and Research at the State University of Makassar, South Suawesi, Indonesia on October 9-10. \nShe discussed the results of the rock wallaby pilot study with the paper titled: \"The power and promise of immersive virtual environments: extracting expert information to support rare or unseen spatial events.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:46:26.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
