Inside these dense clouds , gravity pulls the gas and dust together until temperature and pressure are high enough for stars to be born. Sifting through dust near Orion's Belt May 2, 2012 \nthe surface grime that hides the beauty of an object. But this new image of Messier 78 and surroundings, which reveals the submillimetre-wavelength radiation from dust grains in space, shows that dust can be dazzling. Dust ... Deep astrophoto of LDN 673 August 5, 2014 \nWhat a stunning view of this dark region of space! This image, by astrophotographer Callum Hayton shows LDN 673, a molecular cloud complex that lies in the constellation Aquila. This region is massive—around 67 trillion ... Hubble looks in on a galactic nursery July 27, 2015 \nThis dramatic image shows the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope's view of dwarf galaxy known as NGC 1140, which lies 60 million light-years away in the constellation of Eridanus. As can be seen in this image NGC 1140 has an ... Image: Hubble peers into the heart of a galactic maelstrom September 7, 2015 \nThis NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows Messier 96, a spiral galaxy just over 35 million light-years away in the constellation of Leo (The Lion). It is of about the same mass and size as the Milky Way. It was first ... Image: Hubble sees a galactic sunflower September 14, 2015 \nThe arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflower. So the nickname for this cosmic object—the Sunflower ... A cosmic rose with many names September 23, 2015 \nThis new image of the rose-colored star forming region Messier 17 was captured by the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. It is one of the sharpest images showing the ... Recommended for you Missing gravitational waves lead to black hole rethink October 21, 2015 \nHuman understanding of galaxies and black holes is being called into question after an 11-year search for mysterious gravitational waves—famously predicted by Albert Einstein 100 years ago—failed to find anything. In unexpected discovery, comet contains alcohol, sugar October 23, 2015 \nComet Lovejoy lived up to its name by releasing large amounts of alcohol as well as a type of sugar into space, according to new observations by an international team. The discovery marks the first time ethyl alcohol, the ... Astronomers peer inside stars, finding giant magnets October 22, 2015 \nAstronomers have for the first time probed the magnetic fields in the mysterious inner regions of stars, finding they are strongly magnetized. Most earth-like worlds have yet to be born, according to theoretical study October 20, 2015 \nEarth came early to the party in the evolving universe. According to a new theoretical study, when our solar system was born 4.6 billion years ago only eight percent of the potentially habitable planets that will ever form ... Final kiss of two stars heading for catastrophe October 21, 2015 \nUsing ESO's Very Large Telescope, an international team of astronomers have found the hottest and most massive double star with components so close that they touch each other. The two stars in the extreme system VFTS 352 ... Milky Way photo with 46 billion pixels is the largest astronomical image of all time October 21, 2015 \nAstronomers at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum have compiled the largest astronomical image to date.
