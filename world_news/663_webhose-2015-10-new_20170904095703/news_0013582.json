The other reason – and this is a sadder reason – that despite all the idealism of the environmental movement, when you move away from energy sources like natural gas and oil, you inevitably move toward coal. If you want to get rid of nuclear power, you’re basically saying we want to burn more coal. \nRhodes said increased energy demand worldwide means use of natural gas and nuclear energy will expand as the 21 st century progresses. \n“You can actually mark the point where a society reaches 70 years of life for its average citizens in terms of how much energy they use – three to four thousand kilowatts per person,” Rhodes said. “If you put these countries and their individuals on a graph, you find countries where people are not doing well – way below four thousand kilowatts. Energy in a certain sense is life. If you decide you’re going to cut off one source, you end up with another source.” \nRhodes is working on a book about the future of the world’s energy usage that he hopes to publish in the next two years. \nUT-Battelle manages ORNL for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science.
