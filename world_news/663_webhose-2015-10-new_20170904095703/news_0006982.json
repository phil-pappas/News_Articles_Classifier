All they need is to have an android phone and then install 'Hyderabad Traffic Live' app launched by the Hyderabad police. \n\nLaunching the app at his office in Basheerbagh on Tuesday, Hyderabad police commissioner M Mahender Reddy explained about its various features which would enable citizens to not only navigate through the city smoothly, but also allow them to report rule violations and get a prompt response from a traffic cop nearby in minutes. \n\nThe app has nine categories including public interface, auto fare estimation, live traffic, nearest police stations, e-challan status, find your towed vehicle, vehicle RTA details, public service complaint and public information. Some of the key features available in each of the nine categories include reporting an offence of crime with photograph to police and based on the location of the complainant, mobile traffic constable of the concerned area would reach the spot and address the complaint. \n\n\"We have provided android phones with the special app designed to see the complaints, details of the complainant along with exact location and acknowledge them to 100 traffic constables in the city, at an average of four cops each from the 25 traffic stations. These constables on traffic mobile bikes will automatically receive the complaint based on the location of the complainant. After verifying the basic facts, they rush to the spot to address the issue. Once the issue is resolved, the same will be acknowledged by the constable and the entire process will be monitored by senior officers,\" the commissioner said. \n\nIn addition to reporting a violation like an auto driver refusing to turn on the meter or misbehaving with passenger or wrong parking, the app also allows people to see live traffic status through red, orange and green lines on a particular stretch. If a motorist feeds his destination, the app automatically suggests a best possible route to travel. \n\nPeople could also know details of a vehicle, pending e-challans and towed vehicle location by keying in the registration number of the vehicle. The traffic cops were also provided with tabs with a special app to register road encroachment cases under section 39(b) of the CP Act. While registering cases with photograph, the officer would also record the licence details of the shopkeeper and recommend to GHMC for cancellation of licence in case of a repeat offence. \n\n\n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:17:44.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
