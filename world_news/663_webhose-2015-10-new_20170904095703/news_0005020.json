Most utilities have been looking at tariff structure alternatives to the traditional energy consumption approach. Different types of peak-power tariffs are commonly explored. \nThis presentation discusses the results of a Swedish project in which Big Data analytics were used to evaluate different tariff structures based on real consumption measurement data. This makes it possible to revise tariff structures to influence adoption of green technology and smooth the daily demand curve and ensure greater profitability through the trend toward distributed power generation, photovoltaics, and electric vehicles. This analysis can be made annually, monthly, daily or even hourly, and it can be made with regard to the whole network, specific substations or specific customers. By extension this also allows the possibility to identify customer groups that will be highly affected by a tariff structure change and therefore will need thorough information about the change. The project also simulates how a possible change of tariff structure will affect customers' behavior. \nWho: Magnus Lindén,Senior Consultant, Energy Markets Group of Sweco Energuide.Mr. Lindén has over 17 years' experience of the liberalized Nordic electricity market. Before joining Sweco, Magnus was a partner at EME Analys. His areas of expertise include advising larger electricity customers on their electricity procurement strategy, regulation surrounding metering and settlement, energy statistics, market design and renewable energy issues. Magnus has taken part in several investigations commissioned by different stakeholders including regulators, the Swedish government and private commercial companies. \nWhen: Thursday, October 8, 2015 at 9:00 a.m. PT \nWhere: Hilton Orange County, Costa Mesa, CA \nAbout the Conference: The 2nd Annual Demand Response World Forum will bring together professionals from around the world to explore the latest auto-DR technologies and strategies for meeting the changing energy landscape of the 21st Century. Technology innovators and business leaders will meet for three days to discuss the evolving role of ADR in enabling an integrated and flexible network that is responsive to a wide range of energy resources, marketplace entities, and customer energy demand and generation. \nSee how Lavastorm makes it easy for customers like Sweco to accelerate business insights by visiting: http://www.lavastorm.com/resources/case-studies/ \nInterested in learning more about solving today’s big data issues?
