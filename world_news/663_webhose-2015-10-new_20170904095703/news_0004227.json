UrbanHello’s REMI seeks to help parents monitor and improve their baby’s sleep and young kids settle into healthy bedtime and morning routines. REMI is also a great way to start teaching little ones better sleep habits at a young age to help the whole family get a better night’s rest.\n“As parents ourselves, we were driven to create everyday products that would help make life easier for other parents and families,” said Catherine Seys, co-founder of UrbanHello. “We designed REMI to have a myriad of features that make it easy to teach children better sleep habits and monitor their sleep routines, whether they’re newborns, toddlers or growing children.”\nREMI is a Bluetooth nightlight that conveniently fits on a child’s nightstand or with the child in his or her crib. It stays with the child from the time they fall asleep at night to the time they wake up in the morning. The device is completely customizable, giving parents the ability to create alerts, talk to the child, display different lighting, play music and more. With REMI, parents are able to track their child’s sleep patterns by creating a sleep diary within the app, which helps identify what conditions are ideal to foster healthy sleep routines. Parents can also avoid midnight wake-up calls and early Saturday morning surprises by using REMI’s mobile app to adjust the settings so their child will understand when it’s ok to get up.\nWhat really makes REMI unique and invaluable is its mobile app for tablets and iOS or Android smartphones. The app makes it easy for both parents and children to navigate the device and includes, but is not limited to, the following features:\nView REMI’s date, time and other settings from mobile device Set up multiple REMI devices within the app for each child Hear and talk to the child with the babyphone Receive detailed information about the child’s sleep patterns from the tracking diary Set alarms and alerts so the child knows when to get out of bed Set up regular nap times Customize REMI’s lighting, color and intensity Record lullabies, play REMI’s sounds or upload the child’s favorite songs Share tips with friends and family to Facebook\nThe earliest backers will be able to pre-order their very own REMI for only $45, which is 55% off retail value. For anyone with one child to three or four, there are many perks available that are sure to fit any family’s needs.
