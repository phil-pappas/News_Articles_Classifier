We use our electronics everywhere we go. Whether we like to admit it or not, we use our tablets while cooking, shopping, using public transportation, and of course, using the bathroom. Our touchscreens touch what our hands touch and all the bacteria we touch is transferred to our tablet. Since tablets are warm and stored in dark places like bags and purses, the bacteria breed and multiply. Technology is no-doubt a contributor to the spread of sickness and disease. \nThe Solution: While there are multiple ways to clean a device, PhoneSoap XL is the safest, most effective way. PhoneSoap XL does not use liquid, heat, or any harsh chemicals--only light! Using 4 powerful UV-C bulbs, the PhoneSoap XL encompasses your tablet in germicidal light. In just 5 minutes, your device will be completely sanitized. With PhoneSoap XL, you can sanitize tablets, multiple phones, or any other objects that fit inside in just 5 minutes. Use it to sanitize your keys, your mouse, your Apple Watch--if it fits, it cleans! Additionally, you can make your sanitizing process part of your charging routine by using the built-in USB port. \nA few key product highlights: \n4 Germ Killing UV Lamps \nModern Design", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:03:19.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
