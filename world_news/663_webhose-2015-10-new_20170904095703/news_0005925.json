Now, the incubator wants to help those companies grow into young adulthood. To that end, Y Combinator announced on Thursday that it had raised a $700 million fund aimed at investing in later-stage companies. The move is a departure from the incubator’s traditional focus on early-stage funding, or “seed rounds.”\n“Our mission at YC is to be the organization that enables the most innovation in the world,” Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, said in a blog post announcing the fund. “Capital — especially long-term capital willing to invest outside of the current trends — is an important ingredient in that mission, and I’m excited we are now able to better support some of our companies.”\nThe new fund, which is called the Y Combinator Continuity Fund, will be run by Ali Rowghani, a former chief operating officer at Twitter who joined Y Combinator as a part-time partner last year.\nTraditionally, Y Combinator accepts batches of start-ups twice a year in a semester-like system and gives them money, advice and access to a vast network of start-up founders and technologists who can advise them. Y Combinator also makes a $120,000 investment into each of the companies. For that monetary investment and the other help, Y Combinator is typically granted a 7 percent stake in each company.\nAfter the start-ups “graduate” from the process, founders have been left largely on their own — any additional financing coming from outside investors. The founders can continue to use the Y Combinator network for advice and experience.\nThat process won’t change. But with the new fund, Y Combinator will be able to participate in subsequent financing rounds of these companies after they graduate. The firm’s ownership stake could therefore increase even years after the start-ups have left the incubator.\nIncreasing its ownership stake in some start-ups over time could prove lucrative for the firm, which has been home to such companies as Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe. But it could also put Y Combinator in the precarious position of picking some of the more promising companies in its classes over others.\nMr. Altman said the company would participate in later funding rounds for all Y Combinator companies that raise another round at a valuation of up to $300 million. The firm will be more selective about investing in companies valued above that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:58:45.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
