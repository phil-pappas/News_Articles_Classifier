He says Kordestani is a proven and experienced leader that will coach him and help recruit the best people to Twitter.\nKordestani joined Google, which recently renamed itself Alphabet, in 1999 and currently serves as that company's chief business officer. He previously worked for Netscape, Hewlett-Packard and Go Corp.\nKordestani says he's excited to work with Dorsey and Twitter's board.\nThe news comes a day after Twitter announced plans to lay off up to 336 employees as part of its cost-cutting efforts. That's about 8 percent of its workforce of 4,100 people.\nIts shares rose 5 cents to $29.11 in midday trading.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:37:55.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
