Photo: Supplied\nWashington: Russian computer attacks have become more brazen and more destructive as the country grows increasingly at odds with the United States and European nations over military goals, first in Ukraine and now in Syria.\nAlong with reported computer breaches of a French TV network and the White House, a number of attacks now being attributed to Russian hackers and some not previously disclosed have riveted intelligence officials as relations with Russia have deteriorated.\nThese targets include the Polish stock market, the US House of Representatives, a German steel plant that suffered severe damage and The New York Times .\nThe US has previously accused China of cyber espionage on American interests, now Russia is in the frame. Photo: Fairfax Media\nUS officials worry that any attempt by the Russian government to use vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure like global stock exchanges, power grids and airports as pressure points against the West could lead to a broader conflict, according to two people familiar with the debate inside government and who asked to not to be named.\nAdvertisement When NATO officials met last week, they voiced alarm about Russia's rapid involvement in Syria, including the firing of cruise missiles, and vowed the biggest reinforcement of their collective defence since the end of the Cold War.\nThe Warsaw Stock Exchange is but one example of the heightened cyber activity. Hackers who rifled the exchange last October, in a breach that set off alarms among Western intelligence agencies, proclaimed they were Muslim militants angry over Poland's support for a bombing campaign against Islamic State.\nUS officials worry that Russian hacking may lead to a broader conflict.

Allahu Akbar!\"\nWhile stealing some data, the attackers also made dozens of client logins public, opening the exchange's systems to additional chaos from cyber criminals of all stripes. It was sabotage by crowd-sourcing.\nExcept the infiltrators weren't Islamist militants at all. Behind the smokescreen was a group of hackers with ties to the Russian government, according to three people familiar with the Polish investigation.\nThe attack has prompted the Polish government to begin an upgrade of computer systems in government offices, the financial sector and hospitals, said one of the people.\nDmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, rejected suggestions that Russia is behind the attacks. \"These are absolutely unsubstantiated allegations, which are often absurd,\" he said. \"We also have been the targets of attacks, which again shows that everyone can just as easily be subject to such attacks. International cooperation is required to expose and deal with these threats. But unfortunately, we don't always see a constructive approach on this issue from our partners.\"\nRussia is considered America's biggest cyber threat by US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. But so far, Washington has not made any public response to the suspected acts.\nRaising alarms in Europe, Russian hackers damaged a blast furnace early last year at a plant in Germany owned by ThyssenKrupp, the country's biggest steelmaker, according to four people familiar with the attack. In that case, malware found in the system had previously been tied to Russian espionage activity, but US intelligence agencies have not linked the incident directly to the Russian government.\nKilian Roetzer, a spokesman for ThyssenKrupp, denied any such attack occurred, as has every other company operating a blast furnace in Germany. A furnace attack was disclosed by the German government last year without naming any company or perpetrator.\nIn April, the same group that last year attacked the Warsaw stock exchange hit the operations of TV5Monde, according to security firms tracking the incidents. The attack shut down the major French television network on April 8 and 9, and restoring the system fully will cost of â‚¬15 million ($23.6 million), its executives estimate.\nAs economic sanctions have punished Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, the Russian leader has used a combination of regular and irregular cyber forces that are now jockeying for resources and accolades from Moscow, according to Jason Lewis, a former network exploitation specialist with the US Defence Department.\nHits by Russian hackers on the email systems of the White House and the State Department were disclosed earlier this year, but they represent only a fraction of the overall activity, according to government and private security specialists.\nThe same group that breached the Warsaw exchange and the French TV station recently penetrated the email system of the House of Representatives, giving Russia access to the communications of legislators, according to a person familiar with that investigation. Dan Weiser, a House spokesman, declined to comment.\nAnd in July and August, US government agencies were bombarded with poisoned emails loaded with malware sent by two different Russian hacking groups. Tom Kellermann, chief security officer at Trend Micro, a Tokyo-based security firm, said one of those waves targeted 2000 senior officials, including at least one member of US President Barack Obama's cabinet, as well as the personal email accounts of their spouses.\nAnother person familiar with the emails said the attacks were certain to be detected because of their profusion and the high ranks of the targets, but that did not make them totally unsuccessful. Investigators spent hundreds of hours trying to contain the impact, hacking into servers controlling the attacks and scrubbing government networks, according to people familiar with their efforts.\n\"Russia is exceptionally skilled,\" said Mike Buratowski, vice-president of cyber security services for Fidelis Cybersecurity. \"If you see them, chances are it's a decision: Russia is OK with you seeing them, or wants you to see them.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:22:09.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
