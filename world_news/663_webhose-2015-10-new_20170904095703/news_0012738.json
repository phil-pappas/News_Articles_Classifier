This time, we’ve got digital receiver called the Sangean WR-22. \nVintage Looks \nOnce pulled out of the simple box, I found a hefty machine with a pseudo-wood finishing. This gives it a slightly vintage look that is pleasant to look at. \nBells and Whistles \nWhat’s great about the WR-22 is that it can be used as more than just a FM radio. It also functions as a speaker, allowing you to connect digital devices or hardware, like a PC or MP3, to it via Bluetooth, Aux In, and USB. In practice, the Bluetooth works best with smartphones, but I’m not too sure about MP3 players since we didn’t have any at hand. However, I’m quite sure you can use the Aux In or USB input for that. \nUnderwhelming Sound \nWhile the features are nice, the WR-22’s audio quality left much to be desired. There was no way for tweak the sound signature using EQs either, so that’s another demerit. Max volume is decent, but besides that there isn’t much else that makes it sound good. All in all, good connectivity, but sub-par audio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:43:46.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
