The total capacities of solar panels and PV inverters installed at the mega (large-scale) solar power plant, \"Solar Park Shinmaiko,\" are 12.855MW and 9.02MW, respectively. \nThe plant was built on a waste disposal site (about 217,000m 2 ) that Nagoya Port Authority owns in the Fifth South District of Nagoya Port. Mounting systems were fixed on foundations (installed just by placing components on the ground) on land that had been covered with soil after land reclamation, and, then, 48,328 solar panels were set up. \nC-Tech provided EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) services. Mitsubishi Electric Corp's monocrystalline silicon solar panel and Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corp's (TMEIC) PV inverter were employed for the plant. The expected amount of electricity generated at the plant is 15,000,000kWh per year. \nThe power generation project was carried out as an effort to promote the use of new natural energy and new energy businesses and contribute to the prevention of global warming under the \"Course of Nagoya Port\" long-term vision held by Nagoya Port Authority. \nAs efforts to contribute to the vitalization of local communities, C-Tech cited (1) information transmission using the \"community channel\" of a local cable television, (2) installation of display units in the administration building of Shinmaiko Marine Park, (3) cooperation for \"Nagoya Minato Festival,\" (4) supply of electricity free of charge at the time of disaster, etc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:08:34.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
