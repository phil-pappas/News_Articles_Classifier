This is a transformation of an already strong, prioritised business platform, with attractive market prospects that is poised to contribute significantly to Group EBITDA by 2018.\" \nCocoa business is one of six prioritised platforms identified as part of Olam's strategic plan 'to invest and grow'. \nOlam expects to gain synergy impact of between $35m and $40m by 2018. \nLast month, the commodity trader had indicated that it intends to use S$2.72bn ($1.94bn) on acquisitions to benefit from the global slump of agricultural commodity prices. \nThere has been a shift in Olam's acquisition strategy, which earlier focused on smaller transactions, some of which were just above $10m.
