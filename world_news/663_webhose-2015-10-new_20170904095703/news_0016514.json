They argued the Youth Criminal Justice Act couldn’t adequately punish the accused given the horrific facts of his crime.\nBut Queen’s Bench Justice Sadie Bond disagreed, ruling Friday that he should remain under the jurisdiction of the YCJA. She imposed the maximum youth sentence of two years custody and supervision, which is broken down as two-thirds custody, one third community supervision.\nThe Crown has 30 days to decide whether to file an appeal.\nCourt heard the victim and accused had been drinking together at a home when they decided to go for a walk. The girl wanted to try and find her boyfriend, and the accused offered to help. But once they got outside, he pulled her into a nearby van and began demanding sex.\nWhen the girl resisted and pleaded for him to stop, the accused punched her several times in the face, pulled her hair and forced her to undress. He then committed a serious sexual assault. She eventually managed to break loose and jump out of the parked vehicle, screaming for help and running to safety. She was treated at hospital for several injuries.\n\"The sexual assault was brutal and must have been horrific to the victim,\" Bond said Friday. However, she said the accused’s tender age, personal background and heavy use of alcohol at the time of the incident were all factors she considered in not imposing an adult sentence.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:24:45.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
