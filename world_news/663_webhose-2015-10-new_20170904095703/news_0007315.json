When a third entrant comes into the country, it starts becoming a price game,” he said. \n“As long as you still have two players in a given market, I expect to see more promotion and marketing-driven campaigns, as opposed to price-based competition.”\nMuhamed Rafi from Kerala said he hoped to see a dip in rates because price was the most important factor for him when choosing a service provider.\n“I’m living in Mussaffah with my family, and there is only one provider, Etisalat,” he said. “If du offered me a better price, I would switch.”\nSpokespeople from Etisalat and du said they were ready to sign up new customers immediately.\nAs the TRA’s announcement excludes television services, Mr Masarweh said a substantial number of residents in the UAE are already subscribed to value-added bundled services that include fixed phone, broadband, as well as television — which could become subject to competition in 9-12 months, du’s chief executive said this week. \nWith built in savings in bundling, he said they will see little incentive to switch providers for the sake of better broadband prices.\n“The vast majority of fixed services subscribers are already accustomed to bundled services, as it’s been an integral part of operator fixed strategies,” he said.\n“If you want to enjoy cost benefits and synergies, then you get all of your services from one operator.”\nesamoglou@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:21:58.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
