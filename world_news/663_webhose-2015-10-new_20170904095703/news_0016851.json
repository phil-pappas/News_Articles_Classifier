Come to the #1 American City to Own a Business Houston TEXAS! We have the strongest economy in the US. We are the oil capitol of the world. We have a very large international community. Texas is a ''Business Friendly'' State. After having come to Houston 37 years ago, I started this business with only $500 with the intentions of having a small manageable business that I could work with. Unfortunately, or fortunately as some say, it grew so fast it has gotten too big for one old man to handle and I am not interested in growing it and adding personnel, etc.When I first started I had nothing but a 10 x 10 storage area. Within a couple weeks I had to buy another. A couple weeks later had to buy a 1000 sq ft storage area. One month later I closed all those down and moved into where I am now a 1200 sq ft office/warehouse. The problem now is I have out grown it too. This is all too much for one guy to handle and it's time to hand it off to someone younger who wants to grow a business. I have seen others here in this industry, who have surrounded themselves with good people, turn into millionaires in a very short period of time. But at my age I have chose to keep it simple and small. . .but you don't have to! We sell to individuals, small and medium businesses, call centers, resellers locally and in Mexico and Africa, and consultants. Additionally we utilize several online out lets as well.
