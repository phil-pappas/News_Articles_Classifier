For the first time ever on iPhones, it opened up the ability to block ads on websites in its Safari browser. Mr Arment’s app which provided the ad blocking service skyrocketed to the top of the App Store, and at $2.99 a download, it would easily have been on its way to bring in millions of dollars.\nBut the developer, who previously had created Instapaper and was heavily involved with social blogging platform Tumblr explained in a blog post that making money while others lost it “just doesn’t feel good”.\n“Achieving this much success with Peace just doesn’t feel good,” wrote Mr. Arment.\n“Ad blockers come with an important asterisk: while they do benefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don’t deserve the hit.”\nIt hit number one in 36-hours.\nThe addition of ad-blocker supporting in iOS 9 has divided the internet. Extensions to block ads on your desktop browser have been available for a long time now, but up until now, the most used mobile browser in the world has not supported it.\nFor Apple, they will publicly say that they introduced the support for a cleaner, faster web experience, however their goal is clear: to get publishers to push people to use Apple News.\nWhile the ad-blockers work on Safari, they won’t work through Apple News. Conveniently, Apple will sell ads for publishers through Apple News and take a handy cut from the revenue themselves.\nAmerican technology website The Verge , wrote about how the push by big companies like Apple and Facebook for news to be consumed within their apps will force publishers to survive, but will most likely wipe out smaller publications.\n“Taking money and attention away from the web means that the pace of web innovation will slow to a crawl,” The Verge’s Editor in Chief Nilay Patel wrote.\n“Innovation tends to follow the money, after all! And asking most small to medium-sized sites to weather that change without dramatic consequences is utterly foolish.”\nBut those small publishers falling are merely collateral damage in a war that’s much bigger than a few independent websites.\nWho needs to go to Google when you can search straight from your home screen?\nIf you look through iOS 9, it starts to become clear that Apple has a plan to use the world’s most popular phone to suck a big chunk of Google’s revenue stream dry. Not only does it block the ads on websites that are mostly served by Google, but the new iOS search feature allows you to make internet searches without ever going to the search engine’s website. No clicks on the websites, no ads seen, no money for Google.\nApple hasn’t just escalated war against Google, it’s armed the nukes and is preparing to drop them.\nFor consumers though, the question is: who do you trust more?\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dab181b40c5a0e6821c279e10c8695f8", "http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/23512df505110aec8240d0feb5e8e7d4", "http://news-whistleout.s3.amazonaws.com/News_Deals_300px.html", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f6eac11badfae4cac8593d46d875a43b", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-19T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:21:21.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
