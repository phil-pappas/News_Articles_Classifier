Photo: Supplied\nDo you remember how in the good old days camera makers boasted that their video cameras produced \"broadcast quality\" pictures? You don't see that claim any more for a very good reason – broadcast quality, as set by our primitive television networks with their Third World 576-line standard, is nothing to boast about. If your new camera produced broadcast quality pictures you would demand a refund.\nThese days, to see what real video looks like, as seen by the rest of the world, you have to look to Stan, Presto or Netflix streaming services. Even without setting our sights as high as the Netflix 4K standard, we get picture quality from the HD (1080-line) streaming services that puts free-to-air operators to shame. Streaming video is the new standard, and the good news is that there are now domestic-amateur cameras that can come close to that quality. The really good news is that some of these cameras will fit in your pocket.\nWe have been out and about with the new iPhones – the 6s and 6s Plus – shooting video in the 4K mode and the results are sensational. (We are going to be plundering the thesaurus for superlatives before we get to the end of this piece.) Now, 4K video, as you know, is four times the resolution of high definition. And 4K is not some esoteric standard from the future, it is here and now and the price of ultra-high definition TVs is now about the same as ordinary HD sets.\nThe new iPhones, as well as a growing number of conventional digital cameras, will record video in the 3940x2160 format. Comparing 4K files from various sources, it appears that they all use greater or lesser compression to produce manageable files but we haven't seen any worrying compression artefacts.\nAdvertisement We have been using the two iPhones in full tourist mode, pointing and shooting at anything with colour and movement and we have noted a few relevant facts.\nFirst, you may be making the definitive documentary of the World's Most Liveable City but no one will notice you doing it. Nobody takes any notice of yet another tourist apparently taking iPhone selfies. Smartphone videography is totally inconspicuous.\nSecond, you don't have to adjust focus, shutter speed or aperture as you go. You can't. The phone does it its own way or not at all. Because of the extreme wide angle of the lens everything from the end of your nose to the horizon will always be in focus, which is not to everyone's liking. However, with 4K the detail resolution is so fine that there is excellent subjective separation of layers in the image.\nExposure adjusts quickly as you pan and tilt, but white balance can be caught out in movement from sunlight to shade which can add a yellow cast to skin tones.\nThe iPhone 6s Plus has image stabilisation (the smaller 6s doesn't), and we found the hand-held pictures to be as rock steady as if we were using an expensive steady-cam apparatus. You can even walk with this camera and get impressively steady footage. And that is just as well, because the only form of variable focal length available with the iPhones is pedestrian zoom. If you need it bigger, get closer.\nThe auto exposure comes close to miraculous. We shot in bright sunlight, high contrast situations and the pictures are perfectly exposed. We shot in the art gallery interior and inside a big church and exposure is spot on. We even shot in the nocturnal house at the zoo, where the little creatures frolic in the artificial moonlight and we were amazed – the camera captured the scene exactly with no exposure boosting to make everything conform to the 18 per cent grey scale standard. On a 4K television the moonlit scene displays as we had seen it, with every hair on the spinifex jumping mouse as sharp as a tack with no discernible image noise.\nSlow motion and time lapse effects, beloved of contemporary documentary makers, are built in, but slow motion only works with the 1080 or 720 resolution. The audio recording is adequate for capturing ambient sounds.\nNone of this technical stuff conveys the real pleasure of shooting ultra-high definition video with an iPhone – put simply, it is fun. The video clips can be edited in the phone, but we copied the files to the computer and did the editing in Final Cut Pro. iMovie will do the job just as well. We viewed the finished masterpiece (over and over again) on the Sony Bravia UHD television and we have to say, it is close to true (not Australian) broadcast standard.
