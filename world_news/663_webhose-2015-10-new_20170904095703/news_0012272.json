It's all on paper, it's all a myth,\" he said. \nGurley has been outspoken in the past about a valuation bubble -- and in March, he predicted that some billion-dollar startups would fail this year. \n\"It's my belief that Silicon Valley and the VC-backed businesses have moved into a world that is both speculative and unsustainable,\" he said on Tuesday. \"If we continue down that path, there's going to be more damaged caused.\" \nRelated: Are there dead unicorns on the horizon? \nThere are more than 140 \"unicorns,\" or private companies valued at $1 billion or more. But there have been only 17 tech IPOs this year, according to Renaissance Capital. That's the lowest, so far, since 2009. \n\"Every single one of these companies is going to get evaluated over time in a more scrutinous manner,\" Gurley said. \nHe added that if a company doesn't show signs of going public anytime soon, investors should get a discount on future funding rounds. \nWe're starting to see evidence of the overblown valuations. \nGurley said there have been a \"number of rounds\" in the past six weeks where entrepreneurs have set out to raise a certain amount and come back with just 50% of what they were looking for. \nHe added that it's \"really easy\" to grow revenue if you can burn through a lot of money to get there. \n\"Anyone that's raised $400 million is probably spending $100 million a year,\" he said. \"Until you get liquid, you haven't really accomplished anything.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:33:33.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
