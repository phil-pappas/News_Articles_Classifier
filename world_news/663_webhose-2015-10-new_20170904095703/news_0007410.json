Chris Field of the United States was one of three other candidates. Each country is allowed one vote for climate panel leader\nLee is president of the government affiliated Korea Energy Economics Institute and past dean of the College of Environment at Keimyung University. In his campaign for the job, Lee pledged to work more closely with business and industry and pay special attention to job creation, health, poverty reduction and technology development.\nSeveral climate change scientists said they didn't know Lee. Princeton's Michael Oppenheimer said Lee is known for being \"relatively quiet.\"\nIn a brief telephone interview, Lee talked about the \"carbon budget\" — the amount of carbon dioxide that can still be emitted before the world warms another two degrees — and thinking about those figures \"in the context of a financial budget.\" He added that \"the linking of science and policy requires a very close understanding of the carbon budget.\"\nLee said international negotiators who will meet later this year in Paris have been given a document that gives them pathways to prevent that dangerous two-degree warming, but the key is \"we need to act very, very soon.\"\nThe previous chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, resigned in February after charges of sexual harassment were leveled against him in his native India.\n———\nOnline:\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: http://www.ipcc.ch/ \n———\nSeth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears\n0 Shares Email Star Comments Korean Energy Economist to Head UN Climate Science Panel   \nLong Island Doctor Found Dead After Night Out \" \nAmazing   \nSeattle   \nGun Store Opens Near School, Prompting Protests in Community \" \nWhere Democratic Candidates Agree and Disagree on Gun Control \" \nUS 'Mistakenly Struck' Kunduz Hospital, Gen.
