It also says UK financial services licensing is more accommodating towards Lend2Fund's business model, which creates a digital marketplace to offer commercial property loans to professional investors with debentures.\nThe move also reflects better opportunities for seed funding in the UK, where the Conservative government led by Prime Minister David Cameron has introduced upfront tax rebates for angel investors to build deeper pools of capital, Lend2Fund says, and will allow it to be closer to the head offices of global investment banks wanting to use the platform to take commercial property assets off their books and activate commercial-mortgage-backed security deals.\n\"Australia's fintech scene is about five to seven years behind the UK and seriously needs to play catch-up; there is simply more enthusiasm and appetite in London to trial the new wave of financial technology appearing on the scene,\" said Lend2Fund co-founder Paul Missio, who used to work at Macquarie Group and Westpac.\n\"Australia can't match the powerhouse of London for a fintech company that has global ambitions. The UK nurtures fintech for global scale but we aren't seeing a cohesive 'global' vision in Australia.\n\"In London, there is a greater support for emerging fintech start-ups like ours, on all levels, from government, capital markets, through to those simply wishing to provide advice and mentorship. I dare say others will be tempted to make the move to friendly waters.\"\nLend2Fund has been in discussions with ASIC for more than a year on its structure. Its model seeks to build loans through an open bidding process by sophisticated investors, akin to the institutional bookbuild in equity markets.\nASIC has insisted that under Australian law, the company must operate through the managed investment scheme regime, which builds in various investor protections.\n But Lend2Fund co-founder Michael Smolenski said \"This is like a making a square peg fit into the round hole of existing regulations.\n\"An MIS requires a company to hold an AFSL [Australian Financial Services Licence], making it very difficult for a start-up to get off the ground, as this requires a significant amount of upfront cost in legal fees and time to attain.\"\nIn contrast, the UK FCA has indicated Lend2Fund can start operating immediately there. The company is bringing investors onto the platform and plans to have a pilot operating in January.\nLend2Fund, which has been based in the Tyro fintech hub in Sydney, is still pursuing its regulatory application in Australia, which remains important as both a market for deals and a launchpad into Asia. It wants to run its pilot in Australia too.\nEven though ASIC has made inroads to get closer to the start-up community by establishing an \"innovation hub\" to deal with applications and a \"digital finance advisory committee\" , Lend2Fund said the UK's FCA and its Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) are more collaborative and are willing to provide individual guidance and informal advice.\n\"We have also seen UK regulators far quicker to evolve to the changing fintech landscape,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, their counterpart here in Australia has a very long way to go to provide the same level of service.\"\nASIC commissioner John Price, who has been engaging with the fintech community in recent months and will address a fintech meet-up in Melbourne on Tuesday night, said peer-to-peer lending did throw up \"complex legal and technical challenges\" for ASIC when it first emerged two years ago in Australia, but ASIC is now getting across the issues.\nHe said the regulator is willing to use its powers to provide exemptions from meeting the strict corporate law requirements case by case, and is looking to further streamline its approach. He would not comment on Lend2Fund specifically.\nLend2Fund's move follows a trip to London fintech week last month organised by UK Trade & Investment, which has three staff in Sydney and one in Brisbane spending significant time trying to lure start-ups to Britain . The UK's focus on attracting fintech firms comes as Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Malaysia ramp up efforts to build fintech industries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:22:24.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
