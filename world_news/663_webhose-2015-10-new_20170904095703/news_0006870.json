Comment Subscribe to the O’Reilly Solid Podcast for insight and analysis about the Internet of Things and the worlds of hardware, software, and manufacturing. \nMachines have been able to talk to each other and to computers for a long time, so what’s the big deal with the IoT? That’s the first question I ask Joe Biron, my guest on this episode of the Solid Podcast. Biron is VP of IoT technology at ThingWorx, a PTC business that offers a platform for rapid development of Internet of Things applications. \nThe answer, says Joe, is that where the machine-to-machine (M2M) model is stovepiped and specialized, the IoT entails a platform approach. Machines on the IoT are abstracted, which makes decentralized application development possible. And it’s more flexible: the platform will eventually be able to accommodate new applications that haven’t been conceived yet. \nOther things we discuss: Prototyping platforms like Arduino , Raspberry Pi , and Intel Galileo and Edison are best known as hobbyist tools, but they’re becoming an increasingly important part of real product development in platforms like ThingWorx’s IoT Platform .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:01:50.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
