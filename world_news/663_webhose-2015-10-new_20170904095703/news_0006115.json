It can be easily interfaced with any computer or company network. President Peter Kaub, says, \"The user can preset the test conditions for the system and these will run automatically so he/she can do something different while the test is running; this usually takes as long as two hours.\"\nMeanwhile, Re-Sol's high flow diesel measurement system goes up to 47kg per hour and has two meters and two pumps onboard for large diesel applications. Itâ€™s also very mobile meaning it can be wheeled from one test cell to another.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/RS955%20Compact%20Mobile%20Semi-Automatic%20Calibration%20System.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:42:36.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
