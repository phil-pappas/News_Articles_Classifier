A recent study, however, shows evidence of an even more imminent threat: climate change. The researchers fear that, if climate scenarios are proven right, a permanent change in the western Amazon may start to take place within 10 years. Their article was published in Geophysical Research Letters . \nIn 2005, the Amazon forest experienced a strong drought, considered by experts the worst in 100 years. This event was followed by an even more severe drought in 2010, raising the red light among scientists and environmentalists. The impacts of these events have been broadly discussed, but a complete understanding of the consequences is still missing. \nNow a new study led by researcher Eduardo Maeda from the University of Helsinki has put together a unique combination of satellite data and hydrological measurements to study the problem. The results are a reason for concern. \n\"What we see is that while some areas of the Amazon forest seem to be resistant to these extreme climatic events, other large areas show a fragile equilibrium. The problem is that when this equilibrium is broken, the impacts for the hydrological system and vegetation seem to be rather persistent, taking 3 to 4 years for the system to recover\", says Eduardo Maeda. \nThis kind of disruption seems to be triggered only by rare extreme events, which occur in average every 20 years or more. This interval, in theory, would then be enough to allow a full recovery of the hydrological patterns and vegetation. But climate scientists are not so optimistic. Previous studies have shown that climate change may increase the frequency of droughts like the one occurred in 2005. \n\"Model simulations from previous studies by other groups indicate that, by 2025, the frequency of these events could be as high as 1 every 2 years\", he says. \nIf these climate scenarios are confirmed, the study conducted by Maeda and collaborators indicates that the hydroecological system would no longer have time to recover. This would lead to serious consequences for a forest area almost 2 times bigger than Switzerland, causing massive tree mortality, and permanently change the face of the western Amazon. Parts of Amazon on the verge of forest-to-grassland shift September 3, 2013 \nThe stability of the Amazon rainforest, and the ecosystem's resilience to widespread deforestation, may be much lower than previously thought. The replacement of stands of trees with grassland changes evapotranspiration rates ... Amazon rainforest more able to withstand drought than previously thought November 14, 2013 \nNew research suggests that the Amazon rainforest may be more able to cope with dry conditions than previously predicted. Researchers at the University of Exeter and Colorado State University used a computer model to demonstrate ... Fire and drought may push Amazonian forests beyond tipping point April 14, 2014 \nFuture simulations of climate in the Amazon suggest a longer dry season leading to more drought and fires. Woods Hole Research Center scientists Michael Coe, Paulo Brando, Marcia Macedo and colleagues have published a new ... Amazon's carbon uptake declines as trees die faster March 18, 2015 \nThe most extensive land-based study of the Amazon to date reveals it is losing its capacity to absorb carbon from the atmosphere. From a peak of two billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year in the 1990s, the net uptake ... Amazon rainforest losses impact on climate change, study shows April 21, 2015 \nHuman activity has removed more than one-tenth of trees and plants from the Amazon rainforest since the 1960s, a study shows. More extreme weather projected in the Amazon could have global climate consequences October 12, 2015 \nA new paper co-authored by WHRC scientists Philip Duffy and Paulo Brando evaluates the accuracy of current climate models and uses them to project future drought and wet periods in the Amazon. They conclude that the whole ... Recommended for you Spring to come three weeks earlier to the United States October 13, 2015 \nScientists have projected that the onset of spring plant growth will shift by a median of three weeks earlier over the next century, as a result of rising global temperatures. Climate scientist hits out at IPCC projections October 13, 2015 \nAs a new chairman is appointed to the Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change (IPCC) a University of Manchester climate expert has said headline projections from the organisation about future warming are 'wildly over optimistic.' Sea level rise will swallow Miami, New Orleans, study finds October 12, 2015 \nSay goodbye to Miami and New Orleans. No matter what we do to curb global warming, these and other beloved US cities will sink below rising seas, according to a study Monday. Could 'The Day After Tomorrow' happen? October 9, 2015 \nA researcher from the University of Southampton has produced a scientific study of the climate scenario featured in the disaster movie 'The Day After Tomorrow'. Horn of Africa drying ever faster as climate warms October 9, 2015 \nThe Horn of Africa has become increasingly arid in sync with the global and regional warming of the last century and at a rate unprecedented in the last 2,000 years, according to new research led by a University of Arizona ...
