To be fair, the goals it’s talking about are lofty as well. \n“Like the Apollo Program, we embark on this journey for all humanity. Unlike Apollo, we will be going to stay,” it reads. \n“Mars is an achievable goal ... We are developing the capabilities necessary to get there, land there, and live there.” \nYou can read the whole document here , if you have the time. Otherwise, we’ve outlined the basics below. NASA says it’s closer to sending humans to Mars than at any other point in history. Source: AFP \nNASA’s plan is split into three distinct “phases”. The first, which is called Earth Reliant, involves research about the International Space Station. The agency says it will use the orbiting station to test new technology and improve humans’ ability to remain healthy in space. \nThe second phase, known as the Proving Ground, takes things further away from home, giving NASA an opportunity to test two pieces of technology that are currently in development: the Space Launch System, and the Orion spacecraft. Operations in this phase will primarily occur in “cislunar space”, which refers to space between Earth and the moon. \nThe final phase, Earth Independence, will send humans to both the moons and surface of Mars itself. The goal is to create “habitats that support human life for years, with only routine maintenance”, and to relay scientific data from Mars to Earth within just 20 minutes.

NASA believes it already has much of the information it needs to make such a mission viable. \n“Mars orbiters have mapped with high precision the topography of the planet, begun mapping the distribution of water ice below the surface, imaged geologically ancient river deltas, and discovered likely seasonal outflows of salty liquid water in the present,” the agency says. \n“They have mapped detailed mineral composition in select areas and located suitable landing sites for future robotic and human missions, many with incredible science potential. \n“Robotic landers have measured radiation in transit and on the surface, and gathered data for defining entry, descent and landing approaches for future human missions.” \nYou have to admit, that’s an impressive list. NASA is also working on new types of technology to make deep space operations easier. \n“Focus areas include solar electric propulsion with advanced ion thrusters, habitation systems, nuclear fission for Mars surface power, laster communications for high data rate transmission, deep space atomic clocks for precise navigation, and many others,” it says. \nObviously, there’s still a long way to go, and it may be decades until a manned mission is dispatched to the red planet. But it sounds like we’re well on the way. How robotic missions will progress over the next few years.
