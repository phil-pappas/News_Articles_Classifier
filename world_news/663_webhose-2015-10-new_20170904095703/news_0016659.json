Prior to that, he filled a number of IT security posts at the federal Finance department, Macquarie Telecom, and security services company CyberTrust. \nEarlier this year the force revealed it was looking for a chief information security officer to run security and risk for the department in response to the \"heightened threat level to law enforcement\". \nWA Police CIO Mike Schuman told iTnews at the time it was \"critical to have credible, executive leadership with expertise in cybersecurity\". \n\"WA Police is seeking a strategic thinker to take a risk-based approach to security decision making and a fact-based approach to their communications both internally and externally,\" he said. \nTran's remit involves security governance and compliance; the development of a strategic infosec roadmap; risk management; third-party audits and white-hat services; enterprise cybersecurity awareness; and ensuring infosec is embedded in project lifecycles.
