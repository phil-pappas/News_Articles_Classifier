Stop it.\"\nThe book also described a moment after a press conference in Cairns when Mr Newman realised he would lose his inner-Brisbane seat of Ashgrove, admitting to then-Barron River MP Michael Trout he was relieved because: \"That's the last time I'll ever have to talk to that pack of bastards\".\nHe also criticised the dirty campaign tactics of Labor and the unions against the LNP, singling out Deputy Premier Jackie Trad while she was working on the 2012 campaign before she became an MP.\nMr Newman, through Mr King, suggested the LNP would have won the 2015 election if it did more negative campaigning like Labor did.\nThe book also reveals a plan for Mr Newman to run for the LNP leadership in 2011 was kept from his wife Lisa for weeks and he only told her on the day speculation was due to appear in the news.\nThe secrecy sparked months of bitterness between the pair.\nThe book was initially supposed to be released next week but Dymocks in Brisbane's CBD began selling it on Friday, insisting it wasn't aware of an embargo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:37:05.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
