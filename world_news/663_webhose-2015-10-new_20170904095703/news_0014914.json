The minister of high education today suggested the 6% cap for fees increment for 2016, the question is, the minister is well aware of a big gap between the haves and have not that is huge and children of poor parents are seriously marginalised and denied an opportunity to attend and or accepted in the tertiary institutions. He is also well aware that tertiary institutions fees are so high that even the middle class citizens struggles to pay. The question is a minister of high education who also a GS of communists party which in my view believes in an all inclusion to all facilities for all citizen regardless of their economical condition but as a minister who is on the gravy train tend to forget that. Very disgusting\nThe marikana disaster, Lonmin waited for the disaster to happen for them to take workers issues into account even though they have not addressed them. Now a police commissioner is suspended even though the president was warned during her appointment that she had no police background but he went ahead and appointed her, now a lots of people lost their life due to her incompetent on the job, now the president sees that she can not do her job. The question is why the president waited for disaster to happened for him to see that she was not competent?\nNot so long ago two men were drown to a dam in Joburg and before that people have been singing asking for our parks to be guarded to protect visitors on the facilities but nobody listened. Now every municipalities are willing to engage and make budgets available to assist protecting people on the parks. The question is why all stake holders waited for people to lose life for them to act?\nIn the working environment the employers normally wait for a situation to reach a crisis for them to improve their offers, is it because as a country we prefer disruption to think?\nThe same goes for service delivery, as long nothing is burning nobody will listen. Malamulele wanted their municipality but until schools and other government building were in ashes that's when government decided to do something. Very sad.\nCorruption is now business as usual, so are we waiting for country to burn down for us to do something? All of us are aware that corruption deny this country economical growth, deny us of essential services and the only thing it does is creating few millioners especial those who are political connected and have friends in high places. Very sad indeed.\nAre we waiting for Mandela to serve another 27 years in jail to change, Are we waiting for Solomon Mahlangu to hanged again for us to change or for Chris Hani to be killed again for us to change?\nSouth Africa wake up before it is too late. Before we are like Somalia, before die of hunger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:31:23.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
