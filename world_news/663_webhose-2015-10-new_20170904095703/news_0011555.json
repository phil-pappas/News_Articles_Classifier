(Photo: MasterCard)\nOn Monday, MasterCard announced the program to make it happen, with an assist from a variety of industry partners. There’s Qualcomm and NXP on the tech side, Capital One as the first banking issuer, and General Motors with designs on producing that first payments-capable key fob, the idea being that you might pay for food or gas when making a pit stop on a road trip.\nOther partners include Ringly, which makes \"smart rings\" for women, Nymi, which has a wearable biometric band that uses your heart rate to authenticate your identity, and TrackR, which sells a Bluetooth location-tracker. Fashion designer Adam Selman is also designing products from which you’ll be able to transact.\nMasterCard Chief Emerging Payments Officer Ed McLaughlin says such nascent “Internet of Payment Things” represents the next wave in commerce. The first of these payment-capable products are expected to roll out in the U.S. in 2016.\nUSA TODAY\nVisa prototype would let you lease car — from within car\n“Everyone is seeing that payments are moving beyond mobile,” McLaughlin said during an interview. “For a long time the focus was on the smartphone itself. We believe every device will be used for payments.”\nAdds Tom Poole, the managing vice president for digital payments at Capital One: “We really want you to use the form factor (to pay) that makes the most sense for you.”\nCompatible products will have an NFC chip inside and leverage “contactless” payment terminals, similar to the way you might pay with your phone. Transactions will be “tokenized” and secure, MasterCard says.\nYou’ll be able to monitor transactions and accounts through an app on your phone, and most importantly be able to remotely turn off the payment mechanism in a product that gets lost or stolen. You can use your existing MasterCard credit card accounts, and earn any eligible loyalty or rewards points.\nUSA TODAY\nMasterCard tries out 'selfie pay' for online purchases\nCapital One’s Poole says a number of factors are coming together to make this possible. Hardware costs are dropping. Technical and industry standards around NFC terminals and chip cards are getting adopted. Huge investments are being made on the security side. “Banks are perpetually upping their game,” Poole says.\nTo be sure, challenges remain for a mobile payments industry still trying to persuade consumers to increasingly eschew physical wallets and plastic credit cards and transact instead with their smartphones and watches.\n“As with all of this stuff there’s going to be a learning curve or adoption curve. This vision doesn’t come to life overnight,” says Jordan McKee, an analyst with 451 Research.\nBut McKee figures Visa and other financial companies will follow MasterCard on a similar mobile payments strategy.\nYou can check out MasterCard's video on this below.\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n5 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1S6Kvjw TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d36d50a4220a9415399258a5ba17595bbe4a228b/c=138-52-570-484/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797558486878516-ThinkstockPhotos-533647449.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1S6Kvjw", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814642208588990-mas231-key-fob.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6Kvjw&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812188682342085-xxxx.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e3bff266982469a700bebacaefc86fdaa29e89c/c=242-0-1678-1080&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814642208588990-mas231-key-fob.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSiBlFFwALU?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33d97f8a03d5ea06baca0f7a30eca34c8bd87643/r=500x281/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814642208588990-mas231-key-fob.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6Kvjw&text=MasterCard%20and%20GM%3A%20Pay%20with%20your%20key%20fob&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a2da059931b9e1abd6dfc4936a84cf4542f612e0/c=242-0-1678-1080&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814642842889056-mas231-ring.jpg", "http://twitter.com/edbaig"], "published": "2015-10-26T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:09:05.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
