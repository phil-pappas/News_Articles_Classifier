Respondents More Likely To Purchase A Cloud Communications Solution ... October 05, 2015 -- \nWAYNE, Pa. , Oct. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Evolve IP , The Cloud Services Company, today announced the results of its 2015 Business Communications and Collaboration Tools Survey . With 1,024 participants, the groundbreaking research revealed new insights into why businesses are adopting business communications tools, how often they replace their systems, along with some stark differences in satisfaction between those with cloud communications systems and those using legacy, premise-based PBX systems. \nOne significant finding from the research showed that mobility enablement is now the most prominent feature wanted in a new communications system and, when comparing user satisfaction for mobility enablement, organizations with cloud systems were markedly more satisfied. 61.5 percent of cloud users were 'very satisfied' or satisfied with their mobility capabilities compared to just 44 percent of premise users. Working hand-in-hand with mobility for many companies is BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and 5 in 10 cloud users were 'very satisfied' or satisfied with their systems BYOD enablement vs. 28.5 percent of premise. \nIn addition to findings around mobility, this year's research re-confirmed the fact that despite the ongoing push of analysts, and the communications industry itself, survey respondents (IT professionals and executives) have little understanding of the term, or concept, of unified communications (UC). In fact, just over 1 in 4, a slight decrease from Evolve IP's 2013 survey, stated they were \"very familiar\" with UC and 35 percent stated they were \"not at all familiar\" with UC. Google searches indicated similar lack of traction with just 7,560 monthly searches for the term \"unified communications\". In contrast, a UC feature, \"video conference\" returned 19,430 estimated average monthly searches. \nOther findings include: Nearly 3 in 4 businesses with cloud phone systems plan on purchasing another cloud system with just 2 percent planning to return to a premise-based PBX. Meanwhile, of those on premise systems, just 24 percent are committed to staying with a premise system and 17 percent indicated they plan to switch to the cloud. 38 percent of organizations replace their phones every seven to 10 years and currently 1 in 4 organizations have communications systems that are seven or more years old. 76 percent of organizations have implemented some form of video communications with only 1 in 10 users, on average, expressing that they felt uncomfortable using the technology. 66 percent of organizations with cloud phone systems have successfully implemented WFH programs while just 47 percent of premise-based companies have done so. \n\"This year's survey demonstrates very clearly why organizations are retiring their legacy PBXs and moving their business communications and collaboration tools to the cloud,\" says Tim Allen , Chief Sales Officer of Evolve IP. \"Mobility enablement across the enterprise is a key driver and one that the prospects we talk to latch onto quickly. With Evolve IP's 98 percent annual customer renewal rate, our business also supports the survey's finding that cloud customers are more satisfied with their system and are overwhelmingly committed to staying in the cloud for their next system.\" \nOne of the nation's fastest growing cloud companies, Evolve IP provides cloud services to some of the world's best known brands in virtually every industry including: healthcare, legal, insurance, banking, technology, travel and retail.
