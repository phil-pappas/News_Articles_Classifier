A Medical College of Georgia researcher hopes a new nanotechnology technique will ... Faster dental treatment with new photoactive molecule April 30, 2014 \nPhotoactive materials are used in modern dentistry, which harden when they are exposed to light. Usually, only thin layers of up to 2 mm can be hardened, due to the limited penetration depth of light. A new dental filling ... Nano in food and agriculture: Regulations require collaboration to ensure safety September 11, 2015 \nAn overview of regulatory solutions worldwide on the use of nanotechnology in food and feed production shows a differing approach: only the EU and Switzerland have nano-specific provisions incorporated in existing legislation, ... Nanodiamonds might prevent tooth loss after root canals October 16, 2015 \nPeople undergoing root canals may have gained a powerful, if tiny, new ally. Researchers from the UCLA School of Dentistry have found that using nanodiamonds to fortify a material used in the procedure could significantly ... Recommended for you Nanotechnology inspires next-generation dental materials October 19, 2015 \nHave a cavity? Ask your dentist about filling it with a mixture of nanoparticles including silica and zirconia. These white fillings (known as nano-composite resins) resemble teeth better than their metal alternatives and ... Experimental treatment regimen effective against HIV October 19, 2015 \nProtease inhibitors are a class of antiviral drugs that are commonly used to treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center designed a new delivery system for these drugs that, ... New graphene-based inks for high-speed manufacturing of printed electronics October 19, 2015 \nA low-cost, high-speed method for printing graphene inks using a conventional roll-to-roll printing process, like that used to print newspapers and crisp packets, could open up a wide range of practical applications, including ... Researchers discover graphene spirals could challenge macro solenoids October 19, 2015 \nIn the drive to miniaturize electronics, solenoids have become way too big, say Rice University scientists who discovered the essential component can be scaled down to nano-size with macro-scale performance. Significant advance in stabilizing perovskite solar cells October 19, 2015 \nUCLA professor Yang Yang, member of the California NanoSystems Institute, is a world-renowned innovator of solar cell technology whose team in recent years has developed next-generation solar cells constructed of perovskite, ... Is black phosphorous the next big thing in materials? October 16, 2015 \nA new experimental revelation about black phosphorus nanoribbons should facilitate the future application of this highly promising material to electronic, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices.
