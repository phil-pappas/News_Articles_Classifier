The first tweet announced “breaking news” in all capital letters and unconfirmed reports of an explosion at the Singapore Marina.\nLater tweets announced declarations of a state of emergency and martial law, along with the dispersion of riot police and attempts by people to flee a new “quarantine zone.”\nSeveral news organizations posted screen captures showing that the “Call of Duty” Twitter feed’s user name, profile image and background photo were changed to look like those of a news organization, though the @callofduty Twitter handle remained unchanged.\n Some Twitter followers appeared confused initially, tweeting replies such as “what the heck?” Then replies grew critical, calling the tweets “utterly distasteful” and “irresponsible.” ”This tweet comes at a bad time considering with what’s going on in the world,” another read.\nThe account later stated that the tweets were promotional and the account reverted back to its usual appearance, but the tweets were still posted Thursday.\n“Call of Duty: Black Ops III” takes place in a fictional city overrun by zombies. Officials for Activision Blizzard Inc. of Santa Monica, California, which produces the “Call of Duty” games, didn’t immediate respond to requests for comment.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:27:24.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
