It’s also in the mid to lower end of the large client market segment where Microsoft’s hybrid cloud messaging is getting a positive reaction.”\nWhile Microsoft’s cloud business has made substantial gains in the Australian market, AWS continues to dominate with a sizeable lead on Azure, especially at the high end of the market.\n“We see large AWS customers accelerating their consumption at increasing rates. The most telling sign is that the bulk of large organisations with cloud migration strategies are talking about AWS as a key provider,” Dr Sweeney said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:38:27.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
