It wasn't clear which products IBM was allowing reviews of or how much time MIIT officials can spend looking at the code.\nIBM Greater China General Manager Shally Wang referred questions to the company's media-relations office on Friday. An IBM China spokesman didn't respond to requests for comment. Officials at the Chinese ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.\nChinese media reported that IBM Senior Vice President Steve Mills disclosed the source-code sharing in a speech in Beijing Thursday, saying that IBM needed government support to continue its growth in China. Mr. Mills' remarks couldn't be immediately confirmed.\nChina has been pressuring U.S. tech companies to hand over source code for its products to prove there are no security risks, after former U.S. security contractor Edward Snowden disclosed in 2013 that the U.S. government tapped into overseas electronic gear to spy on other governments. U.S. tech firms have grappled with a sales chill in China since then.\nAlthough U.S. tech companies are striking more alliances with state-owned Chinese companies to retain market share, they have largely resisted pressure from Beijing to share source code. Disclosing source code would reveal the companies' core intellectual property and raise the risk that Chinese competitors could copy their products. Earlier this year, under pressure from the U.S. government and trade groups, China's banking regulator suspended the implementation of rules that would force Chinese banks' equipment suppliers to open their source code for review.\nIBM has been willing to strike closer partnerships with China's government than many of its fellow U.S. tech companies, people familiar with the company's strategy said. This has caused consternation among some rivals and the Obama administration, as it makes it more difficult for them to take a hard line with Beijing, they said.\nIt wasn't clear to what extent IBM's source code review is a symbolic gesture, as the people briefed on the practice said Chinese officials can look at the code only during visits and can't remove it for thorough review. In a short amount of time, it would be extremely difficult to comb through all the code for a product for potential \"backdoors\" that would allow spying on users.\nLilian Lin contributed to this article.\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"NIRI Demo Co\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014\n 16, 2015 06:25 ET (10:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:18:51.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
