She was hospitalized in critical condition.\nPolice withheld the names of all three people pending notification of relatives.\nThe shooting in the village of Omeath, on the border with Northern Ireland, is a relative rarity in the Republic of Ireland. Most Irish police carry no firearms. The previous fatal shootings of police happened during a bank robbery in 2013 and in a friendly-fire accident in 2001.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:44:16.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
