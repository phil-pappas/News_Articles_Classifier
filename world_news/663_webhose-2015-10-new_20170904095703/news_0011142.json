The policeman was identified as Rabie Mostafa. Police have cordoned off the area and are searching for the perpetrators, the ministry added.\nThe statement did not provide further details.\nNorthern Sinai has been largely closed off to the media since Egypt's security forces launched a campaign against a long-running insurgency there. The insurgency escalated after the military ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi in July 2013 amid massive protests against his rule and cracked down on Islamic groups.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:04:12.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
