Having said that, I am a little worried about the way some of the companies are scaling now,” Arora said in a candid fireside chat organised by IT industry group NASSCOM at its ongoing product conclave in Bangalore. \nIn India, SoftBank backs branded budget hotels marketplace OYO Rooms , online cab booking service Ola and realty portal Housing.com. Last month, it invested $500 million more in online marketplace Snapdeal along with other investors like iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. In September, SoftBank participated in a $225 million (Rs 1,478 crore) fundraising round at Mumbai-based ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, which runs Ola. \nIn what seemed to be a reference to Housing.com’s aggressive marketing spend under its former CEO Rahul Yadav, Arora said: “If we take the example of companies in the West, be it Google or Facebook, they spent many years in perfecting the product. There are very few companies which spend $100 million in marketing at the early stage of their lives.” \nHousing.com is said to have spent about Rs 120 crore in marketing under Yadav. The portal went through several months of top-level turmoil that concluded with the unceremonious exit of Yadav in June. Since then, Rishabh Gupta has been running the show as interim chief while an operating committee headed by Jonathan Bullock, a representative of the lead investor SoftBank, has been overseeing the company’s operations. \n“I told some of them privately and spoke publicly as well that you can’t take a bad product and spend a lot of money on marketing that. I think that is where people are getting confused,” Arora added. \nThe Housing.com episode has raised questions about SoftBank’s approach in India. However, Arora is unperturbed. “Remember, we have a portfolio approach. VCs have a portfolio approach. They expect probably one or two out of 10 companies to succeed. In our case we come at a late stage, so we must do six out of 10. We want to do 10 out of 10 but that does not happen,” he said. \n“We expect some companies do not turn out to be the way we want them to be and we are prepared for that,” Arora added. \nFrom Arora’s perspective, Housing.com is still a good investment for SoftBank. “The idea of Housing.com is very relevant. They built a significant product,” he said. “That product eventually turns to a business and that business needs to succeed. We are happy and satisfied about the product being created and about the team. It is unfortunate that Rahul, who had the passion, is not there. But I don’t think we have made a bad choice,” he added. \nSoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son believes India would be a big market in 15 years and wants to explore investment opportunities in India. Snapdeal was the first Indian firm to capture SoftBank’s attention. \nRecounting SoftBank’s foray into India, Arora said: “I spent time with some of their (Snapdeal) investors – Vani (Vani Kola of Kalaari Capital) and Sudhir (Sudhir Sethi of IDG Venture). In the process, we understood a lot about the Indian startup ecosystem. It just turned out that time was ripe for making investments in India. We came back with a list of 14 startups and eventually invested in one or two. In the last count we have investments in five.” \nTo a question on how the global economic situation would impact startup investments, Arora said that good ideas would always find funding. \nAsked about how SoftBank chooses firms to invest in, Arora quipped: “Don’t find me, I will find you.” \nArora joined SoftBank in September last year as vice chairman besides having direct responsibility of SoftBank Internet & Media Inc as CEO. He was recently elevated to COO and president of SoftBank, strengthening his position as the de facto number two behind Masayoshi Son. Prior to joining SoftBank, he was senior vice president and chief business officer at Google. He is now one of the four non-Japanese on the 14-member board of SoftBank. \nIn August, Arora said he would make a personal bet on the Japanese telecom and internet giant by investing JPY60 billion ($482.2 million, or Rs 3,147 crore) to buy shares of the company over the next six months. \nSoftBank paid Arora about JPY16.5 billion, or $137.7 million, in executive compensation for the year ended March 31, 2015. It is arguably the highest sum raked in by an India-born professional ever in a single year and one of the highest globally for a public listed firm last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:48:29.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
