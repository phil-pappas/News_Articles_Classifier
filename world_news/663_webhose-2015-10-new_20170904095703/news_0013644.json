EMC had been under growing pressure from activist investors, who had prodded the company to better exploit the value of VMware Inc., which accounts for roughly half EMC's market value but 35% of its revenue.\nIn the latest quarter, VMware's revenue rose 10% but EMC took a $48 million loss from its 80% stake in the company, which Dell is also acquiring. The loss widened from $40 million a year earlier.\nMeanwhile, in EMC's information infrastructure business, revenue fell 3% but rose 2% when currency fluctuations are stripped out. A jump in storage revenue helped counter softer storage sales. In the company's Pivotal unit, a data analytics and cloud-computing business, revenue increased a currency-adjusted 18%.\nIn all, EMC reported a profit of $480 million, or 25 cents a share, down from $587 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items and aided by a lower share count, per-share slipped a penny to 43 cents.\nRevenue edged 0.8% higher to $6.08 billion. Analysts expected 44 cents in earnings per share on $6.17 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\nOverhead expenses increased 7.8% to $2.15 billion and EMC booked a $68 million expense stemming from restructuring and acquisition-related charges, up from $39 million a year earlier.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n 21, 2015 08:13 ET (12:13 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:09:45.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
