(There are currently IKEA stores in the Central Florida cities of Orlando and Tampa as well as the South Florida cities of Sunrise and Sweetwater.) Pending approvals, construction of IKEA Jacksonville could begin Summer 2016, with an opening in Fall 2017. \nLocated approximately 10 miles southeast of downtown Jacksonville, the 294,000-square-foot proposed IKEA store and its 1,200 parking spaces would be built on 25 acres along the northwestern corner of Interstate 295 and Gate Parkway. Store plans reflect the same unique architectural design for which IKEA stores are known worldwide. IKEA also will evaluate potential on-site power generation to complement its current U.S. renewable energy presence at nearly 90% of its U.S. locations. \n“We are excited at the possibility of growing our southeastern U.S. presence with this proposed Jacksonville store,” said IKEA U.S. president Lars Petersson. “This proposed location in an emerging retail corridor would provide our already 110,000 Jacksonville-area customers their own store and introduce the unique IKEA shopping experience to other consumers throughout North Florida, Southern Georgia and beyond.” \nIKEA Jacksonville would feature nearly 10,000 exclusively designed items, 50 inspirational room-settings, three model home interiors, a supervised children’s play area, and a 350-seat restaurant serving Swedish specialties such as meatballs with lingonberries and salmon plates, as well as American dishes. Other family-friendly features include a ‘Children’s IKEA’ area in the Showroom, baby care rooms, play areas throughout the store, and preferred parking. In addition to the more than 500 jobs that are expected to be created during the construction phase, approximately 250 coworkers would join the IKEA family when the new store opens. IKEA Jacksonville also would provide significant annual sales and property tax revenue for local governments and schools. \nDrawing from its Swedish heritage and respect of nature, IKEA strives to minimize its operations’ carbon emissions because reducing its environmental impact makes good business sense. IKEA evaluates locations regularly for conservation opportunities, integrates innovative materials into product design, works to maintain sustainable resources, and flat-packs goods for efficient distribution. U.S. sustainable efforts include: recycling waste material; incorporating key measures into buildings with energy-efficient HVAC and lighting systems, recycled construction materials, warehouse skylights, and water-conserving restrooms; and operationally, eliminating plastic bags from the check-out process, phasing-out the sale of incandescent light bulbs, facilitating recycling compact fluorescent bulbs, and sells only LED bulbs. IKEA U.S. has installed electric vehicle charging stations at 13 locations, and has solar arrays at 90% of its locations, and owns two wind farms in the U.S. \nSince its 1943 founding in Sweden, IKEA has offered home furnishings of good design and function at low prices so the majority of people can afford them. There are currently more than 370 IKEA stores in 48 countries, including 41 in the U.S. IKEA has been included in rankings of “Best Companies to Work For” and, as further investment in its coworkers, has raised its own minimum wage twice in two years. \nIKEA incorporates sustainability into day-to-day business and supports initiatives that benefit children and the environment.
