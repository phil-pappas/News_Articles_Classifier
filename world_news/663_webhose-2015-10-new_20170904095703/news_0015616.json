(NYSE: KEYS) today announced the VXT PXIe vector transceiver , a fully calibrated instrument module that provides vector signal generation and analysis in four slots. With accelerated measurements and deep software, the VXT is purpose-built for rapid solution creation and faster throughput in manufacturing test of wireless components and “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices. \nSystem developers can easily create test solutions for power amplifiers (PA) and front-end modules (FEM) using the VXT’s ready-to-run software and FPGA-accelerated measurements. To reduce programming time, Keysight provides an open-source PA Reference Solution that includes proven system configurations and example software routines for PA and FEM testing. These capabilities accelerate time to insight and reduce effort compared to general-purpose alternatives. \nTo accelerate test throughput, the VXT includes features such as real-time FFTs that enable high-speed measurements of signal power and adjacent-channel power ratio (ACPR). For faster automated testing, a built-in servo routine quickly reaches an accurate, optimized final setting for PA output level. \n“As a focused but adaptable tool, the VXT enables test engineers to compress time, compress test and start closer to their finish line,” said Nana Amoa, product marketing manager of Keysight’s Communications Measurement Solutions Division. “The VXT also delivers an important business benefit in that, rather than constructing or acquiring new buildings, manufacturers can easily create more capacity in their existing facilities and quickly scale to volume.” \nUp to four VXT modules can run in a single 18-slot PXI chassis. System developers can also create versatile single-chassis solutions that include one VXT running alongside Keysight’s DIO cards and its award-winning one-slot PXI VNA. VXT calibration is ensured because it is a fully integrated instrument module. \nThe VXT covers 60 MHz to 6 GHz and provides 160 MHz I/Q bandwidth in both vector signal generation and analysis. With a maximum of +18 dBm output power, the vector signal generator can compensate for signal losses through switch matrices. \nA variety of Keysight software titles support the VXT. For example, developers can simplify the creation of specific test signals using Signal Studio software . In addition, they can easily troubleshoot test setups using detailed displays in compatible X-Series measurement applications and the 89600 VSA software . \nU.S. Pricing and Availability \nThe VXT PXIe vector transceiver is available now at a starting price of $36,400 for the 3.8 GHz model. \nProduct details are available at www.keysight.com/find/VXT and www.keysight.com/find/pxi-poweramplifier .
