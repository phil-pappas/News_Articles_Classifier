Cardinal Oswald Gracias, who heads the Asian bishops' conference, suggested the omission was a compromise designed to ensure all bishops could sign onto the appeal, which is the first of its kind for the episcopal conferences from each of the five continents. \nIn his landmark encyclical \"Praise Be,\" Francis denounced what he called the \"structurally perverse\" fossil fuel-based world economy that he says exploits the poor and destroys the Earth in the process. \nThe bishops from Africa, Asia, America, Europe and Oceania were somewhat more reserved, recognizing that \"accelerated climate change\" is the result of \"unrestrained human activity ... and that excessive reliance on fossil fuels is primarily responsible.\" \n\"The building and maintenance of a sustainable common home requires courageous and imaginative political leadership,\" the appeal said. \"Legal frameworks are required which clearly establish boundaries and ensure the protection of the ecosystem.\" \n___ \nFollow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
