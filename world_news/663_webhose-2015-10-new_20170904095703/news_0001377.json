Charlie Sheen thrown out of bar Stella McCartney sues Steve Madden for copyright We could be actually living on Mars within next few decades as NASA has unveiled its plans of building colonies on the Red Planet.\nNASA said that moving to have “Earth Independent” colonies on the Red Planet will be the end point of years of research, but it plans for that to be complete by the 2030s, the Independent reports.\nNASA’s document ‘Nasa’s Journey to Mars – Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration’ lays out the three stages of its plan to get to Mars. The first is Earth Reliant, when ; the second is Proving Ground, where the operations will be tested out in deep space, but in an environment that allows humans to get back to Earth in days.\nThe document sees the Earth Independent colonies as being a global achievement that marks a transition in humanity’s expansion as we go to Mars not just to visit, but to stay.\nWhile there, humans will live and work within habitats that support human life for years, with only routine maintenance. They’ll harvest “Martian resources to create fuel, water, oxygen and building materials” and use “advanced communication systems” to send information back with only a 20-minute delay.\nBut before it gets to that stage, it will begin in the Earth Reliant one. Research in that stage will be based entirely on the International Space Station and it will include making sure that equipment works and learning more about the effects of spending extended periods of time in space.\nIt will then take the knowledge learned there to the “Proving Ground” stage. There, the research will go towards practicing for deep-space operations, allowing those in space to conduct work with less and less reliance on the Earth and move towards the journey to Mars.\nThe report concludes “Was Mars home to microbial life? Is it today? Could it be a safe home for humans one day? What can it teach us about life elsewhere in the cosmos or how life began on Earth? What can it teach us about Earth’s past, present and future?”\n 10, 2015 1:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:14:36.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
