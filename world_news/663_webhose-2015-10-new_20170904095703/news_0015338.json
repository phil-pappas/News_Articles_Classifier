For companies seeking a competitive edge across all channels, commercetools provides the fastest development, easiest integration and lowest TCO. \nKey benefits include: -- Improve Speed to Market: By leveraging micro-service integrations businesses are not tied to specific platforms or third-party solutions so they can stay in control, regardless of marketplace channels, without being restrictive or wasting valuable deployment time. API first strategies significantly reduce the complexities faced by the development and marketing teams in building and maintaining innovative commerce applications that radically decreases development and operating costs all in the same step. -- Unleash Creativity: Decoupling the front and back end will give the power to marketing departments to work creatively with their front end, while a cloud-based platform satisfies the needs of the IT department for a secure, highly scalable and robust back end solution. \nDemonstrations will be available at booth #1068.
