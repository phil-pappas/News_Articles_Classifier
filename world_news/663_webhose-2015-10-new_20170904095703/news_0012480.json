All, of course, are geared toward fulfilling a mission to \"increase romantic connectivity worldwide.\" \nThe Match Group has been a part of IAC/Interactive ( IACI ) , the conglomerate run by media mogul Barry Diller. \nCNNMoney report: Love, Inc. \nThe Match Group had 4.7 million paying subscribers worldwide at the end of the third quarter. It reported revenue of nearly $900 million in 2014 and net earnings of $148 million. \nIn its filing, Match Group said it would consolidate the roles of CEO and chairman by the end of 2015, which are currently held by Greg Blatt and Sam Yagan. Blatt will take over both roles and Yagan, who cofounded OkCupid which was later acquired by Match, \"is expected to continue to serve in a senior leadership position.\" \nIAC also owns many other popular websites and apps -- including Vimeo, The Daily Beast, About.com and search engine Ask -- which many still remember as the old Ask Jeeves. IAC has sold off pieces of other units to the public before, including Expedia ( EXPE ) , TripAdvisor ( TRIP ) , HSN ( HSNI ) and Live Nation ( LYV ) . \nCNNMoney's Paul La Monica contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:08:09.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
