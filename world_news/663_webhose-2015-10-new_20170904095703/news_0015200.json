The official did not dispute them, however.\nAcquisitions\nHumana OKs\nAetna deal\nHumana shareholders have overwhelmingly approved the company’s takeover by fellow insurer Aetna.\nThe company said Monday that more than 99 percent of the shares voted at the meeting were in favor of the deal, which was announced in July. \nSeparately, Aetna says that shareholders approved the issuance of stock to Humana shareholders.\nThe $37 billion deal will create the country’s second-largest managed care company. It’s still subject to approval by regulators and other closing conditions. Humana Inc. and Aetna Inc. expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2016.\nMedicine\nDrug might\nfight Crohn’s\nJohnson & Johnson’s immune disorder drug Stelara significantly reduced symptoms of the inflammatory bowel condition Crohn’s disease with just one infusion in about half the patients tested, according to the company.\nThe results, released Monday, are the first from multiple late-stage studies — normally the last stage before seeking regulatory approval for Crohn’s, which J&J plans to do this year. Stelara is already approved for treating plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.\nChronicle News Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:26:20.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
