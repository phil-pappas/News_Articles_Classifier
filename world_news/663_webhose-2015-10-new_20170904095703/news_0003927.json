However, we already have a close working relationship with HNZ and we expect that to continue,” TIA Chief Executive Chris Roberts says.\nTIA is the only association that represents all sectors of New Zealand’s large and diverse tourism industry, including accommodation, transport, attractions and activities. Collectively, TIA members make up around 85% of New Zealand’s tourism turnover.\n“TIA will continue to look after the tourism interests of all accommodation providers, including hotels, motels, apartments, lodges, backpackers, holiday parks and B&Bs.”\nIn the last 12 months TIA members provided almost half of all guest nights in commercial accommodation across New Zealand. However, compared with other types of accommodation, TIA has relatively few motels as members.\n“In the past we have encouraged motels to be members of MANZ and provided support to their association. TIA will continue to work closely with HNZ on various hospitality-related issues. There continues to be an opportunity for all accommodation providers who want to be directly connected on the key tourism issues to take up a TIA membership,” Mr Roberts says.\n“Guided by the Tourism 2025 growth framework, we are creating a strong platform for growth across the tourism industry value chain and ensuring we have the right operating environment for the tourism industry to succeed.”\nSource:- Tourism Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:26:47.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
