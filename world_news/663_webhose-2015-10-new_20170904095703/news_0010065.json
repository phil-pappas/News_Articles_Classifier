In the middle of a moment where diversity in comics and geek media is more talked about than ever, though, an overriding theme of the panel was concern that geekery wouldn’t be able to continue diversifying in the future. \nThe panel was moderated by Diana Pho of Tor.com and included Camilla Zhang of DC Comics and Marvel Comics; TV director and graphic novelist Eric Dean Seaton; Melissa Grey, author of The Girl at Midnight ; N Steven Harris of DC Comics and Marvel Comics; Shelley Diaz, senior editor of the School Library Journal ; podcaster Tatiana G. King-Jones; and Tracey John of Gameloft. The State of Geek Media \nPrevious Geeks of Color panels have focused on the need for diversity in media . They argued that giving young readers the opportunity to see themselves in the media they consume is enormously powerful. Not only that, increased diversity in creators and subjects more accurately reflects the wide range of people who consume geek media — which is demonstrated best by simply looking at the thousands of attendees at NYCC. The panelists, though pleased with the efforts made to bring more diverse voices to geek media, were concerned about what would happen next. “We’re all kind of excited but anxious about where everything is going to go,” said Zhang. “It’s dangerous to use diversity as a marketing tool,” she continued, expressing concern that the nuance and complexity of diversity would be lost. \nAnother common concern the panel touched on was a backlash against diversity among some fans. “Of course [diverity] is going to seem forced, because it wasn’t there before and now it’s coming in pretty strongly,” said Harris. He called the blowback a “remnant of resistance.” John agreed. “If you look at the internet at all, it’s apparent that there’s not just a need for diversity but also a need for tolerance of diversity.” \nKing-Jones suggested that some of that skepticism might be from speed with which companies have moved to introduce more diverse characters and storylines. “Now [companies] are realizing that people of color like geek stuff, and now they want to jump on the bandwagon. That’s where the skepticism comes from.” Despite the interest paid to topics of diversity, Seaton delivered a sobering assessment of the industry today. “Diversity is a hot word right now, but it’s simply a word. We have a long, long way to go.” He said that in his experience, even if a person of color or other minority is given a leading role in a film, that person is never backed by a diverse writing or production staff. He held up Empire as a notable exception, but stressed that one show is not a trend. Make Media Better \nAlong with the panels concern about the indiustry came real, tangible advice for creators and fans who want to see more diversity in their geek media. While comics and movies got most of the attention at the panel, and at NYCC in general, John said that video games presented a unique opportunity for people of color to create art. “I think there’s even more opportunity for indie developers and minorities to tell their kind of stories.” She pointed to virtual reality projects such as HoloLense as particularly new, open territory. \nSeaton drew from his experience as a director as an opportunity to change people’s minds. “I’ve found that if you treat everyone special, then they may not like your race but they’ll like you. I don’t know if that’s a cop-out, but it’s a survival tactic.” The panel also encouraged people of color who aspire to work in media and the arts to not give up. “The only way you can really fulfill those needs is to keep applying for jobs,” said John. “Don’t give them an excuse not to hire people of color.” \nOne thing that this and other panels made clear to the gathered attendees is that if they want change in their media, they should vote with their wallets.
