Developed in combination with T4 and finer mesh leaded and lead-free alloy powders, M8 provides stable transfer efficiencies required for today’s challenging applications. A novel activator system provides powerful, durable wetting action accommodating a wide range of profiling processes and techniques. M8 eliminates HiP defects on BGA and reduces voiding on QFN/BTC components while producing bright shiny solder joints, leaving minimal, high purity residue engineered to be safely left in place.\nAdditionally, AIM will highlight its liquid fluxes, tin/lead and lead-free alloys, including SN100C. To discover all of AIM’s products and services, including lead-free and halogen-free solder, visit the company at SMTA Connecticut Expo & Tech Forum for more information.\nAbout AIM\nHeadquartered in Montreal, Canada, AIM Solder is a leading global manufacturer of assembly materials for the electronics industry with manufacturing, distribution and support facilities located throughout the world.
