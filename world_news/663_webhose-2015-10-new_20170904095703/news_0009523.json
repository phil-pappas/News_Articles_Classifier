Data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, late on Wednesday estimated that inventories rose by 9.3 million barrels last week.\nRising inventories is a bearish sign for the market as the mismatch between supply and demand, which has battered oil prices since last summer, shows few signs of abating.\n\"The ongoing high level of oversupply on the oil market is blocking any increase in oil prices,\" analysts at Commerzbank said in note to clients.\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.2 per cent to $US49.51 a barrel on London's ICE Futures exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading down 1.1 per cent at $US46.12 a barrel.\nOil briefly rose above the $US50-a-barrel mark last week after a string of oil executives and leaders from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hinted a price recovery was on the horizon. But strong output data, including from OPEC itself, and expectations of Iranian oil returning to the world market, coupled with tepid demand from China, rattled market confidence.\nAnalysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the EIA data to show an increase of 2.6 million barrels a day. Last week, the EIA reported a 3.1 million-barrel jump in stockpiles.\nOne of the reasons for the increasing US inventory levels is that many refineries go into regular maintenance after the end of the summer driving season.\n\"It appears that the maintenance is full on and will last well into November, depressing crude demand and depleting product inventories,\" said Tamas Varga, an oil analyst at PVM.\nBesides inventories, the EIA will also release its weekly estimate of US oil production, which peaked in April at a multidecade high of 9.6 million barrels a day. US output has fallen below 9.2 million barrels a day since then as companies idle drilling rigs and shelve projects amid the slump in prices.\n\"Supply growth might stagnate next year but inventories will keep growing,\" Mr Varga said. \"If the underlying bearish global supply backdrop is coupled with downward revisions in global demand growth then revisiting this year's lows and even lower is not out of question.\"\nNymex reformulated gasoline blendstock -- the benchmark gasoline contract -- rose 0.8 per cent to $US1.32 a gallon.
