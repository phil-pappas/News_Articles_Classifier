Heroine Chic is the brainchild of renowned writer David Tischman (Batman, Angel, Teen Wolf) with artwork by breakout illustrator, Audrey Mok.\nSet in a New York City full of superheroes, Heroine Chic is inspired by real-world fashion icons and designers. The story’s main character, 23 year-old Zoe Porter, just graduated from Parsons and dreams of launching her own line at Fashion Week. Until then, she’s working as stylist/assistant to Dyna Cuff, the biggest designer of superhero costumes in New York. Dyna is a cutting edge fashion genius but a difficult boss, and her super-powered clients are vain and insecure.\n“Zoe has no super powers, she is not a superhero -- but she will become the hero of her own life, and she’s going to do it with style,” Tischman said, adding that he was first inspired by Mary Quant and London fashion in the early ‘60s.“This ‘Devil Wears Prada’ meets ‘The Incredibles’ world is such a powerful visual, and I’m so excited to launch Heroine Chic with LINE Webtoon.”\n“The LINE Webtoon audience is one of the most diverse in the world. Not only will fans of superheroes and fashion find something in Heroine Chic, our millennial audience will identify with Zoe Porter and the challenges she faces as a young woman in New York City.” said JunKoo Kim, Founder and Head of LINE Webtoon.\nAlready a huge success for more than 10 years in Korea, LINE Webtoon launched in the U.S. in 2014, and is rapidly expanding with the onboarding of new artists, partners, expansion of ways to interact with the content, and much more. On the heels of LINE Webtoon’s announcement earlier this summer that beauty entrepreneur Michelle Phan will also be launching a comic on the platform, Heroine Chic further appeals to the increasingly large audience of female comic readers on LINE Webtoon.\nFans can begin reading the first chapter of Heroine Chic here , and other LINE Webtoon comics by visiting http://www.webtoons.com .
