The numbers represented the latest in a long succession of disappointing performances for Yahoo, with the company's net revenue slipping 8 percent from the previous year.\nYahoo Inc. tried to team up with Google in search during 2008 as part of its defense against a takeover attempt by Microsoft. The Google alliance unraveled after the U.S. Justice Department threatened to block the partnership on the grounds that it would thwart competition.\nThe new deal still must be approved by antitrust regulators. Yahoo will still rely on technology from Microsoft's Bing search engine as part of a 6-year-old partnership.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:46:09.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
