Ronthal, and Terilyn Palanca, published October 12, 2015. The Gartner Magic Quadrant is a leading bellwether of positioning for technology vendors, assessing vendors based on completeness of vision and ability to execute. \nGartner defines a Leader as follows: “Leaders generally demonstrate the most support for a broad range of operational applications, based on support for a wide range of data types and multiple use cases. These vendors demonstrate consistent customer satisfaction and strong customer support. Many have competed in this market for many years, and have built a wide partner ecosystem for their products. Hence, Leaders generally represent the lowest risk for customers in the areas of performance, scalability, reliability and support. As the market's demands change, so Leaders demonstrate strong vision in support not only of the market's current needs, but also of emerging trends. Finally, the messaging, product R&D and delivery of Leaders are in line with today's market and with new trends in both DBMS software and hardware technology.” \nRobert Nagle, InterSystems Vice President of Database Platforms, noted, “We believe the Gartner Magic Quadrant report shows that our clients like doing business with us; it’s why many of our original customers have stayed with us for decades.” \nHe added, “Our InterSystems Caché multi-model data platform can manage the immense volumes and variety of data our clients encounter today. It supports all types of data – structured and unstructured, SQL and NoSQL, centralized and distributed – and delivers massive horizontal and vertical scalability. Most importantly, Caché enables analytics at the point of action, for just-in-time insight.” \nIn its report, Gartner stated, “For this Magic Quadrant, we define operational DBMSs as systems that also support multiple structures and data types, such as XML, text, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), audio, image and video content. They must include mechanisms to isolate workload resources and control various parameters of end-user access within managed instances of the data.” \nTo view the full report, \"Gartner Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems,\" by Donald Feinberg, Merv Adrian, Nick Heudecker, Adam M.
