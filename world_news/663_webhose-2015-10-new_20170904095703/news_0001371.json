Currently, excipient-grade poloxamer 188 NF, marketed by BASF under the Kolliphor ® P188 brand, is a polymer used in a variety of pharmaceutical and biological applications, such as a shear protectant in cell culture production. Poloxamer 188 is the starting material for Mast's lead product candidate. Under the agreement between BASF and Mast, BASF will develop a higher purity poloxamer 188 and provide Mast with clinical quantities of the new material to be used for specific therapeutic indications. \n\"The work we are doing with Mast is one example of our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to develop high purity poloxamers for a variety of applications for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology value chains,\" said Daniele Piergentili , Head of Global Marketing and R&D, BASF Pharma Ingredients and Services. \"Our work with Mast will enable them to develop new products intended to treat patients with life-threatening illnesses.\" \n\"As the leader in the use of poloxamer compounds to treat human disease, we are pleased to be working with BASF, the world's leading chemical company to enhance the purity of our starting material. We believe that our relationship with BASF will enable us to develop an improved product with application in a variety of therapeutic indications,\" said Brian M. Culley , Chief Executive Officer of Mast. \"We already have been successful in advancing a second-generation poloxamer 188, known as vepoloxamer, which is being tested in a 388-patient clinical trial in sickle cell disease, and we are excited to explore further improvements in this class of compounds to treat other serious or life-threatening conditions, such as heart failure and stroke.\" \n\"BASF is committed to innovate with companies such as Mast in order to achieve the best possible solutions for our partners and ultimately for their patients\" said Scott Thomson , Head of BASF Pharma Ingredients and Services. \nIn addition to poloxamer 188 NF, BASF also offers comprehensive solutions to the pharmaceutical industry for both small and large molecule formulation needs. \nAbout Mast Therapeutics, Inc. Mast Therapeutics, Inc. is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego , California. The Company is leveraging its molecular adhesion and sealant technology (MAST) platform, derived from over two decades of clinical, nonclinical and manufacturing experience with purified and non-purified poloxamers, to develop vepoloxamer (also known as MST-188), its lead product candidate, for serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions typically characterized by impaired microvascular blood flow and damaged cell membranes. The Company is also developing AIR001, a sodium nitrite solution for inhalation via nebulizer, for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). \nVepoloxamer is an investigational new drug being tested in a pivotal Phase 3 study called EPIC for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. The Company also plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of vepoloxamer in chronic heart failure later this month. AIR001 is an investigational new drug being tested in two institution-sponsored Phase 2a studies in patients with HFpEF.
