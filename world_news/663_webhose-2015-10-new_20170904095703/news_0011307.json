G reconciliation table on last page. \n\"The end-market challenges of weak agricultural commodity prices and reduced mining and energy driven demand, along with unfavorable currency translation, persisted during the quarter,\" said Mogens C. Bay, Valmont's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our goal in this environment remains to drive earnings improvement next year despite continued difficult market conditions. During the quarter, we continued our restructuring efforts and are on track to complete most initiatives by year-end. We now expect annualized cost savings from restructuring and cost reduction actions to approximate $30 million per year, compared to our prior expectations of $19 million in annualized savings.\" \nRestructuring Plan Update \nThird quarter progress on the Company's 2015 restructuring efforts entailed numerous actions to streamline management structure, consolidate production to lower cost facilities and reduce overhead. The major actions that took place during the quarter were as follows: In the Engineered Infrastructure Products Segment, overhead reductions occurred in all geographic regions, plant consolidations took place in access systems in Australia and a small facility in China was closed. In the Coatings segment, the idling of one Australian facility was completed. \nThe total restructuring costs incurred during the third quarter for the above actions, plus other restructuring activities, were $8.8 million pre-tax. The restructuring charges comprised of $5.5 million of cash expenses and $3.3 million of non-cash asset impairments. As part of the Company's annual impairment testing of intangible assets, during the third quarter, a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $15.2 million was recorded on certain intangible assets, including a $10.2 million impairment of certain intangible assets in the Coatings Segment. \nThird Quarter Segment Review \nEngineered Infrastructure Products Segment (41% of 3rd Quarter Sales) \nEngineered structures and components for global lighting and traffic, wireless communication, roadway safety, offshore structures and access systems applications. \nThird quarter sales were $259.9 million, compared to $294.9 million in 2014, of which currency translation represented $30.0 million of the decline. \nIn North America, sales of lighting and traffic products increased due to the acquisition of Shakespeare, a composite structures manufacturer, in October, 2014. Wireless communication structure sales were lower due a major carrier's absence from the market. \nIn Europe, lighting and traffic structure sales declined slightly in local currency reflecting continued restraint in government investment in infrastructure due to general economic conditions in the region. Offshore structure sales were lower as investments in the energy sector were curtailed. A customer's delayed introduction of larger next-generation wind turbines also pushed out offshore structure deliveries into next year. \nIn the Asia-Pacific region, an increase in wireless communication structure sales benefitting from China's investment in its 4G wireless technology rollout was more than offset by engineered access system sales declines due to lower oil and gas investment in the region and a reduction of new investment in the Australian mining sector. \nOperating income was $14.2 million, or 5.4% of segment sales, (9.1% before charges) compared with $33.2 million or 11.3% of segment sales in 2014, (included approximately $4.0 million reversal of a contingent purchase price provision related to the 2013 acquisition of Locker). Volume deleverage, impairment and restructuring charges and currency translation effects accounted for most the decline. \nUtility Support Structures Segment (26% of 3rd Quarter Sales) Steel and concrete structures for the global electric utility industry. \nSales of $164.7 million were 9% lower than 2014, due to the revenue impact of lower steel costs, modest volume declines and continued competitive pricing. International sales were comparable with last year. \nIn North America, utility investment in transmission this year, in some cases favored capital deployment to coal plant retirements required by the EPA. \nSegment operating income declined to $14.5 million or 8.8% of segment sales, (9.5% excluding charges). Operating income as a percent of sales was 9.4% in 2014. \nCoatings Segment (12% of 3rd Quarter Sales) Global galvanizing, painting and anodizing services. \nGlobal Coatings Segment sales of $76.2 million were 12% lower than last year. Sales declined in Australia due to reduced volumes related to mining and energy development projects. In North America, both custom and internal irrigation volumes declined. Custom volumes were slightly lower mostly due to weaker demand from agricultural customers. \nOperating income was $3.1 million, ($14.2 million, or 18.6% of net sales excluding restructuring and impairment costs of $11.0 million), operating income was 20.2% of net sales last year. \nDuring the quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of American Galvanizing, located in Folsom, New Jersey. This operation provides an important galvanizing presence for Valmont in the Northeast U.S. for both custom and internal volumes. \nIrrigation Segment (18% of 3rd Quarter Sales) Agricultural irrigation equipment and related parts and services worldwide. \nIrrigation Segment sales fell 36% to $112.2 million due to the absence this year of approximately $25 million in sales to replace and repair storm damaged machines that were included in last year's sales of $174.3 million, and the impact on demand of lower global farm income. In North America, favorable growing conditions lowered operating run-times on irrigation equipment, also reducing demand for aftermarket parts. Sales declined in international markets, due to currency translation effects and reduced volumes, particularly in South America. \nOperating income was $10.5 million or 9.4% of segment sales, primarily reflecting lower sales volume and related manufacturing and SG&A deleverage. \nOutlook: \n\"At this time, we are not expecting the current market environment to improve and our immediate focus remains on aligning our cost structure through the planned restructuring activities, but still investing in product line development to strengthen our leading market positions. We expect a meaningful improvement in 2016 earnings,\" said Mr. Bay. \nAn audio discussion of Valmont's third quarter results will be available live by telephone by dialing 1-877-493-2981 and entering Conference ID#: 66187261 or via Webcast at 8:00 a.m. CDT October 22, 2015 at https://engage.vevent.com/rt/valmontindustries_ao~102215 .
