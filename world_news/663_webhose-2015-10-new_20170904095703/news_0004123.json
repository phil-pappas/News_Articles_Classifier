The Ventana Research Technology Innovation Awards showcase what vendors have done to advance technology to drive better efficiency and productivity, as well as the outcomes and performance, of an organization.\n“Our awards recognize pioneers who have developed clear visionary and transformative technology that goes well beyond dashboards, reports or visualization,” said Mark Smith, CEO & Chief Research Officer, Ventana Research. “Visier’s approach to empowering its powerful workforce analytics with predictive analytics demonstrates its knowledge of what business and HR leaders need to guide them to take action and make decisions that can engage and retain their people.”\nWith Visier’s predictive analytics capability, organizations can tap into a unified workforce data ecosystem, uncovering actionable predictions with an unmatched level of precision and flexibility. For example, Visier recently validated that its “at risk” predictive analytics technology is up to 8 times more accurate at predicting who will resign over the next three months than a manager’s personal assessment -- and up to 10 times more accurate when focusing on the top 100 “at risk” employees.\n“We are honored to receive this recognition,” says John Schwarz, CEO, Visier. “Often predictions about risk of exit are based on gut feel or limited data sets. Visier looks in real time at hundreds of employee attributes, generated by all of a company’s disparate HR systems. The end result is a more accurate prediction and understanding of what drives individual employee resignation, as well retention rates for any particular group of employees.”\nRead the Visier blog post on this topic: Fact or Hype: Do Predictive Workforce Analytics Actually Work?\nFor more information, visit: http://www.visier.com\nFind data-driven HR insights and tips at http://www.visier.com/blog\nFollow Visier on Twitter @VisierAnalytics\nLike Visier on Facebook\nAbout Visier\nA leading innovator in Applied Big Data cloud technology, Visier provides Workforce Intelligence solutions that are enabling a rapidly growing number of the world’s best brands to maximize their business outcomes through their people.\nVisier’s solutions let organizations understand and plan -- with precision -- how to best and most cost-effectively recruit, retain, and develop their workforce.
