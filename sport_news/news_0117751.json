(Image Source: Alex Goodlett/Getty Images) \nNew York Giants game balls for Week 5 go to… \n- Other than two errant throws, QV Eli Manning was simply terrific. He completed 41 of 54 passes for 441 yards and three touchdowns along with one interception. Manning quickly had the 49ers on the ropes during the final drive while it has become quite clear that he has completely mastered Ben McAdoo’s offense. If the Giants can ever get Victor Cruz back onto the field, their offense could be scary good. \n- RB Shane Vereen had didn’t have a single reception last week against Buffalo. We mentioned in our preview that Vereen could have a big day against the 49ers and he did. Vereen responded with eight catches for 86 yards and a touchdown while adding five rushes for 24 yards —by far his best day as a Giant. \nWhat made his effort more impressive was that he was at his best on the final drive with three catches for 47 yards, all while Odell Beckham Jr. and Reuben Randle were out. NBC analyst, Cris Collingsworth even suggested that the 49ers should double-team Vereen on the final drive. Looking back, they probably should have. \n- Second-year man Odell Beckham Jr. had a quiet night on Sunday but stepped up big time against the 49ers. Even thought he missed basically the entire fourth quarter, ODB still finished with seven catches for 121 yards and a touchdown. \nIn just his second season, it’s still hard to believe how good he with the ball in the open field. Though Beckham didn’t catch a pass on the final drive, he still forced a key pass interference penalty that put the ball on San Francisco’s 12-yard line. What a player. \n- After an underwhelming performance against Buffalo in his NFL debut, undrafted rookie Will Tye was pretty impressive against the 49ers. He caught four passes for 48 yards and had a long of 18. Tye didn’t look like a rookie and seemed pretty comfortable playing a lot of snaps. \nHe also looked good after the catch, which is the complete opposite from Larry Donnell . With Daniel Fells out for the season, Tye is going to have a chance to be a real contributor on this team. \nTo more New York football insider news be sure to check out the new NUC at NFLDraftBible.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:56:39.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
