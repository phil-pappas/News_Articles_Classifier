The kids are happy. And the weather is nice.”\nIndeed, with late-morning temperatures in the high 70s, conditions were much more comfortable than a year ago when the highs on opening day of the fair soared into the low triple-digits.\nKatelyn Bloor, 12, of Moreno Valley identified her favorite activity early on — the Wow bubbles.\n“It was just, like, an adrenaline rush,” Katelyn said.\nYou’ve seen the bubbles. They’re made of thermoplastic polyurethane and float in a shallow pool of water. The idea is to stand up and walk, generating a hamster-cage effect. That’s the idea, anyway.\n“It’s really hard to stand,” Katelyn explained. “I mean, I fell a lot of times. It’s not easy.”\nSo what’s next?\n“The monster trucks,” she said emphatically.\nShe wasn’t alone. A couple thousand people packed the main grandstand for the first of two monster truck shows at Budweiser Arena.\nAs the drivers posed in front of their gargantuan rigs, Gabriel Baleanu, 30, of Moreno Valley knelt a few yards from the fence that separates the fans from the track, trying to frame his 2-year-old son, Michael, and 4-year-old son, Gabriel, for a photo in front of Dawn Creten and her monster truck, the Scarlet Bandit.\n“They love big trucks,” Baleanu said.\nNext up for him and the boys would be the livestock exhibit at the north end of the fairgrounds. The fair is an annual outing for Baleanu and the boys.\n“Every year it’s a beautiful thing,” he said. “The Orange County and L.A. fairs are a little bit too much for me. But the (Lake) Perris Fairgrounds is great.”\nContact the writer: 951-368-9682 or tsheridan@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:22:14.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
