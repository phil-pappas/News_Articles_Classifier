We have massive wealth and inequality. It’s cost us millions of decent jobs. The American people want to know whether we’re going to have a democracy as a result. Enough of the emails. Let’s talk about the real issues facing America.”\nThe Vermont senator’s speech drew thunderous applause from the Las Vegas Wynn casino-hotel audience.\n“Thank you, Bernie,” Clinton said, as she reached out and the two shook hands smiling, as the crowd continued to cheer.\nCooper then rediected the issue to Lincoln Chafee, who criticized Clinton’s handling of her email for undermining the United States’ international credibility.\n“Anytime somebody is running to be our leader and a world leader—which the American president is—credibility is an issue out there with the world,” the former Rhode Island senator and governor said. “And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone who has the best in ethical standards as our next president.”\n“Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?” Cooper asked.\nWithout missing a beat, she deadpanned.\n“No.”", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/BrBXcKcviuc", "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-2016-emails-213241"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:26:06.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
