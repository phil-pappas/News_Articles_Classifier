LOS ANGELES – An eight-season playoff drought ended here at Dodger Stadium Friday night, a moment made possible by a talented collection of overpowering arms.\nJacob deGrom, whose journey from a college shortstop to Mets ace has become legendary in Flushing, earned the honor among those arms to start this game.\nWhen he ended his outing after 121 pitches, deGrom had etched his name into the record books alongside Hall of Famer Tom Seaver. No longer was Carlos Beltran looking at strike three the last playoff moment for this franchise. DeGrom created a new memory.\nDeGrom fired seven shutout innings and outpitched Clayton Kershaw to lead the Mets to a 3-1 victory over the Dodgers on Friday night at Dodger Stadium in Game 1 of the NLDS. DeGrom tied Seaver's playoff mark with 13 strikeouts, and Daniel Murphy added a homer while David Wright had the difference-making two-run single.\nNoah Syndergaard will attempt to give the Mets a 2-0 series lead tonight.\n“To have (deGrom) go out there against Clayton tonight and win the game is a huge lift for us,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “This is a good start for a team that hadn’t been in the postseason for a long time. We needed a confidence boost, and Jake gave it to us.”\nThe Mets franchise waited an agonizing nine years for this moment, and it became a prosperous night due to a classic performance from deGrom.\nFriday’s matchup was billed as a pitcher’s duel and it did not disappoint with DeGrom and Kershaw dominating opposing hitters, and deGrom ultimately prevailing.\nCatcher Travis d’Arnaud said he came away from deGrom’s pregame bullpen session knowing deGrom would be on point, and it translated once the game started.\nDeGrom came out the gate showcasing his high-octane fastball, which sat at 97-98 mph in the first inning, and threw fastballs with 17 of his first 20 pitches.\nHe said he actually was nervous in the locker room, but it went away after the first pitch. DeGrom struck out the side swinging in the first, all on 98 mph fastballs.\nThe Dodgers had scoring opportunities early in the game against deGrom, twice due to defensive blunders in left field by Michael Cuddyer, but he held the Dodgers 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position through the first four innings.\nThose blunders caused deGrom’s pitch count to hit 80 through four innings, but he posted three straight perfect frames to end his night, and retired the last 11 batters he faced.\n“I knew what (Kershaw) was doing, but my game plan stays the same and let’s go up and put up zeroes and keep us in a position to win the game,” deGrom said. “So I try not to get caught up in it too much.”\nDeGrom threw a season-high 121 pitches, one short of his career-high set last May, and allowed five hits.\n“He was lights out today. He had everything,” d’Arnaud said. “I can’t even describe how good he was today.”\nAs deGrom kept the Dodgers down, it gave the Mets batters time to try to capitalize on any mistake Kershaw might make, and they finally did so in the fourth when Murphy connected on his second homer of the year against a southpaw.\nMurphy had just a .633 OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage) against lefties in the regular season, and may not have started this game were it not for a chest injury to veteran infielder Juan Uribe that sidelined him for this series.\nIn a scoreless game, Murphy pounced on  2-0, 94 mph fastball and hit it deep into the Mets bullpen in right field for the game’s first run.\n“He doesn’t make a lot of mistakes,” Murphy said. “I felt really fortunate to put a good swing on the ball he threw me.”\nAside from the homer, the Mets were unable to mount much early against the reigning Cy Young champion, but they grinded out at-bats in the seventh to expand their lead to 3-0.\nLucas Duda, Ruben Tejada and Curtis Granderson each walked to load the bases with two outs, and with Kershaw sitting at 113 pitches and Wright due up, Kershaw was pulled for Pedro Baez. Wright, the only Met who was part of the Mets last postseason team in 2006, stroked a two-run single on a 3-2 pitch to give the Mets the 3-0 lead.\nTyler Clippard allowed a run in the eighth that sliced the lead to 3-1, but Jeurys Familia recorded the last four outs to secure the Mets first playoff win since Oct. 18, 2006.\n“I would say that it was cool. It was fun, and that’s what I love to do,” Wright said. “That’s about as sweet as I thought it was going to be.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:53:46.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
