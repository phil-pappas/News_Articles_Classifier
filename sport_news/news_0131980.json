The current population is over 10 lakh and a majority of those residing there commute to Mumbai for work,\" said Yadunandan Ambadkar, who initiated the signature campaign demanding an extension.\n\"As not all trains start from Bhayander and a majority come to Vasai, Nallasopara and Virar, it is impossible for Mira-Bhayander commuters to board trains during rush hours. The only road connecting with Mumbai – Western Express Highway --is also clogged, making it miserable for residents of Mira-Bhayander and we are treated as second-class citizens,\" said Shailesh Singh, a resident of Mira Road.\n\"Due to overcrowding there have been several cases of commuters falling off locals and getting run over by trains. How can this be ignored by the authorities? Why have the metro only within Mumbai civic limits? Why such unfair treatment with 10 lakh plus population?,\" questioned Mukhtar Khan from Democratic Youth Federation of India.\nOn the subject of extension of the metro line to Mira-Bhayander limits, MMRDA commissioner UPS Madan said, \"There was a demand earlier to have a metro line there, but at the moment there isn't any such demand. There isn't enough ridership potential. In the future if we feel that there is ridership, we will extend it to Mira-Bhayander.\"\nWHERE TO SUPPORT?\nwww.change.org – Extend Mumbai Metro to Mira-Bhayander", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/117839337456897481906/posts"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:11:58.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
