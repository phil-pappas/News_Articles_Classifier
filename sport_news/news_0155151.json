The Supreme Court through its interim order during August allowed the use of Aadhaar only for those drawing benefits under the Public Distribution Scheme (PDS) and LPG. Besides directing the government to give wide publicity that the card is not mandatory, the apex court also said production of the card will not be a condition for obtaining any benefits due to a citizen and that information of resident collected by the Unique Identification Authority shall not be used for any other purpose except for the PDS, including kerosene and LPG distribution scheme. Sources in the government said as per available data, 91.68 crore people have been registered under the voluntary enrolment programme and secured Aadhaar, which has become the largest-ever identity issuer. In a third of the numbers enrolled, Aadhaar is the only identity proof these individuals posses that made accessibility to services easier. Before the order, the government had linked a third of nearly 34 crore unique identity number to schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), Social Assistance schemes, including pension for the old and widow, Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana, life certificate of pensioners and Provident Fund etc, for seamless transfer of funds to 11.61 crore beneficiaries. The data with various government agencies show that in 2014-15, some 5.70 crore Indians held passports, approximately 17 crore the Permanent Account number, 60 crore the Election Commission Pictorial Identity Card, 15 crore held ration cards and over 17 crore a valid driving licence. The feeling in the government is that Aadhaar is a tool to bring about “behavioural and usage changes to achieve a corruption-free environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:20:43.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
