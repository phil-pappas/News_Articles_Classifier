The long-term plan Cherington and his front office put into action last winter began to hint at coming to fruition not long after Cherington walked away. Xander Bogaerts and Mookie Betts both look like stars. Jackie Bradley Jr., Travis Shaw and Blake Swihart all look at least like quality contributors. Henry Owens and Eduardo Rodriguez have pitched like potential rotation stalwarts. Not one of those players is older than 25. Even better, a disappointing starting rotation gave reason for optimism down the stretch, particularly with the way both Joe Kelly and Rick Porcello pitched after stints at Triple-A Pawtucket and on the 15-day disabled list, respectively. Neither is likely to be the ace Boston still seeks, but both look more like part of the solution than part of the problem — something that wasn’t the case two months ago. Unlike the total rebuild Cherington faced — and, to his credit, executed — after the 2012 season, Dombrowski and Mike Hazen now helm a team with an enviable young core as well as the financial flexibility and the minor-league talent necessary to make a major move or two. The team still has holes — it probably needs an ace, and it certainly needs a bullpen overhaul -- but few other non-playoff teams would not trade rosters with the Red Sox at the moment. That’s not to say Dombrowski inherited an instant winner. The executive who built contenders in Montreal, Florida and Detroit has plenty of work in front of him as the offseason gets underway. His two primary tasks involve confronting the most significant shortcomings of the roster Cherington built a winter ago: first, the absence of an ace; second, the presence of Hanley Ramirez and Pablo Sandoval, statistically two of the worst players in baseball this season. Finding an ace An ace is not a prerequisite for contending in the American League East, as Baltimore showed a year ago and the New York Yankees showed this year. Top-to-bottom quality matters more over 162 games than a stud who pitches once every five days. But it’s difficult not to look at what David Price did for the Toronto Blue Jays and at what Cole Hamels did for the Texas Rangers as examples of the way an ace can take control and set the tone for an otherwise middling starting rotation. Boston already has a bounty of pitchers capable of pitching in the middle of a rotation: Kelly, Owens, Porcello, Rodriguez, Clay Buchholz and Wade Miley. What it doesn’t have is that tone-setter at the top of the rotation, and that figures to be a Dombrowski priority. Recent history makes clear that it’s a bad idea to pay big money for pitchers beyond the age of 30, the age Price turned in August, a fact that makes the task more difficult. Albatross contracts Rather than backing up the truck last winter for free-agent aces Jon Lester or Max Scherzer, Cherington guaranteed $183 million to Ramirez and Sandoval, a pair of moves that reflected his belief that offense was a more scarce commodity than pitching and defense. Neither Ramirez nor Sandoval hit anywhere near their career norms. Neither performed defensively anywhere near their career norms, either. The Ramirez experiment in left field was the single greatest factor in the demise of what should have been a contending team, a point made clear by the way the team played after Ramirez stopped playing left field. What Dombrowski must do now is figure out how to extricate the Red Sox from that particular mess. Ramirez went through drills at first base for a month but never played the position in a game. If Boston is to entrust first base to Ramirez next season, it will require the same leap of faith that burned them so badly when they entrusted left field to him this season. It seems almost unfathomable that could happen. It seems far more likely Dombrowski seeks out a more established hitter with at least some experience playing first base — be it a big-ticket free agent like Chris Davis or a more creative solution like Mike Napoli was for the Cherington regime. Sandoval was not the disaster Ramirez was, but he was hardly the championship-caliber player Boston thought it had signed. His downward offensive trend didn’t reverse itself as the team had hoped; it accelerated. Making matters worse, his defense regressed. It’s not imperative that the Red Sox move Sandoval. It’s also not hard, however, to foresee a scenario in which Shaw — a third baseman in college who has showed impressive aptitude at the position this season — is a more productive player next season than Sandoval. Fixing the bullpen Boston’s porous bullpen was a particularly glaring weakness in an era when many of the most dominant teams do so behind the arms pitching the seventh, eighth and ninth innings. Dombrowski generally was unable to build quality bullpens during his years in Detroit, but he’ll have to rectify that deficiency this winter in Boston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:43:38.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
