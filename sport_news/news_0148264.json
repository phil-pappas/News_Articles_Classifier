Citing the statements of Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma, who recently said the mob in Dadri did not attack the young daughter of victim Mohd Iqlakh, Congress leader Pramod Tewari said, “PM’s colleagues in the council of ministers are making hateful statements and the PM is doing nothing to stop them. He is granting silent approval to all that is being said. Going by the principle of collective responsibility, he is guilty of provoking sentiments just as his ministers are.” The Congress also attacked SP leader Azam Khan for saying that he would raise the Dadri incident at the UN. “What kind of a statement is that? Is India not capable of handling its issues? We ask Azam Khan if his party agrees to his statement,” Tewari said. He accused PM Modi of betraying the promise of “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas” by condoning the statements of Sharma and of BJP MLA Sangeet Som, who delivered a provocative speech in Dadri on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:10:06.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
