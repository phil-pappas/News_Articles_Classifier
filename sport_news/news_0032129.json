His artwork was previously featured on the 2009 trout stamp, the 2010 walleye and turkey stamp, and the 2013 pheasant stamp. \nThe pheasant stamp validation costs $7.50 and is required for pheasant hunters ages 18 to 64. For an extra 75 cents, purchasers can receive the pictorial stamp in the mail, as well as the validation. A pictorial collectable stamp without the validation is available for $8.25 but is not valid for hunting. Revenue from stamp sales is dedicated to pheasant management and habitat work. Four entries advanced as finalists and were selected Sept. 24 at DNR headquarters in St. Paul. Other finalists were Dean Kegler, second place; Dean Dykema, third place; and Bradley Hadrava, fourth place. \nThe DNR offers no prizes for the stamp contest winner, but the winning artist retains the right to reproduce the work. The 2016 pheasant stamp will be available for sale in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:46:57.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
