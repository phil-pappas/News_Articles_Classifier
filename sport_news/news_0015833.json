(Photo: The Enquirer/Sam Greene) \nMatchup of the Game: Bengals’ interior line vs. Bills’ defensive tackles \nClint Boling, Kevin Zeitler and Russell Bodine all shared the same kind of half shrug when initially talking about Kyle Williams and Marcell Dareus of the Buffalo Bills. The Bengals’ guards and center don’t talk trash, or anything close to it – and they are sure to pay proper respect to the players they’ve already squared up against through five weeks. \n“It’s been a big stretch,” Boling said. “We’ve played some really good D-lines recently. But that’s just the way it is in the NFL. You’re going to get big matchups and big challenges so you just gotta be prepared.” \nBut, there is something different about Williams and Dareus. After all, even in a league of the best football players on the planet, there are tiers. Starters. Pro Bowlers. All-Pros. Future Hall of Famers. \nWilliams is a four-time Pro Bowler, with 35.5 career sacks as a defensive tackle in over nine years in the league. Dareus is a two-time Pro Bowler coming off an All-Pro campaign. He has 29.5 sacks in just over four seasons in Buffalo. He also signed a $100 million contract in the offseason. \nTheir pass rush ability isn’t just above average either. The pair are complete players. \n“These guys probably are the best interior so far,” Zeitler said. \nHe squinted. \n“Now that I’m trying to think on the fly – they are the best interior. So us interior guys are going to have make sure we get our jobs right, we have to communicate well and deal with the noise and everything.” \nPart of what separates Dareus and Williams – what jumps off the film to the Bengals – is not just their technical proficiency in shedding blocks, or the obvious physical gifts. It’s their constant motor. \n“You just gotta go out there and know what you’re getting yourself into,” Bodine said. “You gotta block them to the echo of the whistle.” Bengals' Film Session: Facing the Bills \nSo, Sunday isn’t just about a fight. It’s about going all 15 rounds - and then some - to win. \n“Those guys play hard,” Boling said. “Kyle’s been in the league 10 years and that’s what he’s done to make it that long. I think some of that kind of rubs off on the other guy Marcell. It’s a big challenge. We’ll just have to do the best we can with it.” \nZeitler, Boling and Bodine may not have the same acclaim as their counterparts this week in Buffalo, but they have managed, along with tackles Andre Smith and Andrew Whitworth, to keep quarterback Andy Dalton upright and the Bengals' running game effective enough to rank 10th overall in rushing. Meet the Bengals' offensive line \nThe trio inside has had to maintain their level of play against some of the best defensive fronts in the game in Baltimore, Kansas City and Seattle, but this may be their toughest test yet. \n“You can always draw experience from something,” Zeitler said. “But these guys, I’d say they’re different.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:56:39.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
