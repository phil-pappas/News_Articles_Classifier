Jeffersonville was eighth. \nIt was the last HHC Tournament. Next season, each conference team will play a traditional round-robin league schedule to determine the HHC champion. \nNew Albany (13-15) began the day with a 25-19, 26-28, 25-13 victory over the host Cubs in the first round. \nSophomore Allyson Cathey led the Bulldogs with 20 kills, 13 digs and four blocks. New Albany setter Sadie Meyer distributed 26 assists and teammate Emma Balmer made 16 digs. \nThe Bulldogs lost in the semifinals to eventual conference tournament champion Columbus East, 25-11, 25-20. Cathey smacked six kills, while Meyer and teammate Kyla Weber each made seven digs. Meyer dished out 10 assists. \nNew Albany lost the third-place match to Bedford North Lawrence, 25-22, 22-25, 25-19. Cathey had 13 kills, while Meyer passed 25 assists. The Bulldogs’ Shea Collett had 11 digs. \n“At times, we played pretty well in spurts. I felt like in the Bedford match and the Madison match we were right there,” Bulldogs’ head coach John Breeding said. “I would’ve liked to have finished strong. But I felt like that the kids played hard. We just have to finish matches. \n“We’re working hard. We’ve just got to smooth some things out.” \nThe Highlanders (17-9) started the tournament with an opening-round setback to East, 28-30, 25-19, 25-18. Floyd Central rebounded by winning its final two matches of the day. The Highlanders beat Madison in the consolation semifinals, 26-24, 25-11. In the fifth-place match, Floyd Central downed Jennings County, 25-16, 25-14. \n“We really didn’t play well against Columbus East,” Highlanders’ head coach Bart Powell said. “We had an opportunity to get some momentum going. We had our chances to win a championship and we didn’t do it. \n“Against Madison, we played OK. I thought our communication was better than it has been all year. We played well against Jennings County.” \nThe Red Devils went 0-3 Saturday. They suffered a 25-9, 25-10 loss to Seymour in the first round. \nJeff lost in the consolation semis to Jennings County, 10-25, 25-21, 26-24. Alexis Bassett paced the Red Devils with 11 kills, while teammate McKenna Woodard had 11 digs and seven kills. Jeff’s Carley Calabro made 17 digs. The Red Devils served 16 aces. \nJeff lost the seventh-place match to Madison, 25-19, 19-25, 26-24. Bassett and teammates Madison Conn and Cameron Kearney each had five kills. The Red Devils’ Mallory O’Brien served four aces. Calabro had 19 digs. \n“[We have] a talented team but can lack the drive to fight to the finish,” Jeff head coach Renee Stock said. “[The Devils] have improved but they get down on themselves and don't know how to rally. They had Madison down 24-21 in the third set and let it slip away. \n“[The Devils] looked calm and ready to defeat Jennings County. [We] took the first game then got overconfident in the second. The third game was a dogfight, ending in a controversial call.” \nNew Albany is off until Thursday, Oct. 15 when it will host Heritage Hills. Floyd Central will host Louisville Male on Tuesday. The Red Devils will travel to Jennings County on Tuesday. \nHOOSIER HILLS CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT \nNEW ALBANY 2, MADISON 1 \nNew Albany 25 26 25 \nMadison 19 28 13 \nNEW ALBANY STATISTICS \nKills: Allyson Cathey 20, Shea Collett 6, Parker Andres 2, Sadie Meyer 2, Alexis Smigel 1; Aces: Andres 2, Meyer 2, Emma Balmer 1, Collett 1, Kyla Weber 1; Assists: Meyer 26, Cathey 2; Blocks: Cathey 4, Smigel 2, Meyer 1; Digs: Balmer 16, Cathey 13, Weber 8, Andres 5, Skylar Hunter 5, Meyer 5, Collett 4, Smigel 1, Morgan Waters 1. \nSEYMOUR 2, JEFFERSONVILLE 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:00:06.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
