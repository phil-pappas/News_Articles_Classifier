But still, hearing the news, it’s kind of like being kicked in the stomach, truly,” said Johnson.\nIt’s a feeling shared by many in the small town.\n“If you’ve gone to school here, or worked here, you know someone along the generations that have worked there at the mill,” said Sharon Moore. “We just want to come together and support our mill workers and see what they need.”\nMoore is part of a group of growing people who say that can’t just sit back and do nothing.\n“I had a friend who said, ‘Let’s do something,’ and I’m a big doer, so I said, ‘OK, let’s have a meeting,’” said Amy Rockwell. “We want to help, this community wants to help.”\nMonday, under the roof of Rockwell’s church, a group of some 30 people came together to figure out how best to help the 210 workers that will soon be without a job, and the families they all support.\nThe group is in the process of planning clothing drives, shoe drives and even finding ways to deliver food to families on Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n“You just can’t believe how the community is coming together,” said Johnson. “It’s phenomenal, this is just what we do.”\nIt’s a show of a support to an industry that’s supported their town for generations.\n“It’s one employer, but it sponsors a lot of little leagues, it sponsors our town festival in the Summer, it supports a lot of other businesses,” said Moore. “Let’s show Newberg what we’re all about, let’s show the state of Oregon what we’re all about.”\nFor more information on efforts to help workers visit: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1472957466345999/?fref=ts\nEmployees say they’re being told the mill will shut down mid- November.\nAdministrators tell FOX 12 say they’re trying to do all that they can to help employees during this difficult time, but would not elaborate on those plans.\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
