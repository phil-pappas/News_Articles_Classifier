Deerfield Beach, 33-15 \nThis week: West Nassau (4-0), 7:30 \nGlance: The Bulldogs have been very good so far against a quality schedule. They’ve only lost three district games since 1992, all of them to Raines. \nLast week: d. Wolfson, 45-0 \nThis week: Off \nGlance: Sure, the Vikings haven’t faced a difficult opponent yet (their front half of the schedule is a combined 4-19), but that changes considerably after the bye week. Raines has looked the part of a team that could play for a title. \nLast week: d. Bartram Trail, 24-17 (OT) \nThis week: Englewood (4-1) \nGlance: Their mastery of the Bears continued for a 15th consecutive year. They’ll look for district win No. 49 in a row over the Rams. \nLast week: d. Creekside, 47-29 \nThis week: Off \nGlance: The Mustangs got everything they wanted from winless Creekside last week, probably a good wakeup call entering the second half of the season. \nLast week: d. Fort White, 35-13 \nThis week: at Harvest (0-5) \nGlance: The Christians open district play with the first of two games that they should win in running-clock efforts. Their big District 2-2A challenge comes on Oct. 16 against Cedar Creek. \nThis week: d. Parker, 45-13 \nThis week: Flagler Palm Coast (1-3) \nGlance: A win over the Bulldogs would put the Saints in a very good spot in District 1-8A with a rapidly approaching showdown against Mandarin on Oct. 16 possibly for the title. \nLast week : d. Clay, 48-20 \nThis week: Fleming Island (2-2) \nGlance: Oakleaf followed a lethargic offensive showing in Week 4 with a vicious outing against the Blue Devils. There’s no room for another district loss though. \nLast week: lost to Pensacola Escambia, 44-41 \nThis week: Off \nGlance: A bad first half against Escambia ended the Tigers perfect start. They’ve played a tough schedule, and that continues when they return from bye week with a trip to Bolles. \nLast week: d. Melbourne Central Catholic, 18-7 \nThis week: Off \nGlance: The state-ranked Tigers make their Power Poll debut after a fantastic front half of the season. Quarterback Ty Cook is the area’s top passer and one of the best in the state. \nDropped out: Ponte Vedra (4-1), Class 5A \nOn the bubble: West Nassau (4-0), Class 4A.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:32:38.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
