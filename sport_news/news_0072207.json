(AP) — The Lakers have exercised their $3.26 million contract option for the 2016-17 season on forward Julius Randle, who has played just one regular-season game for Los Angeles. \nThe Lakers made the move Thursday. \nRandle was the seventh overall pick in the 2014 draft from Kentucky, but he broke his right leg during the Lakers’ season opener last fall. The power forward missed the rest of the season. \nRandle has looked impressive in training camp this month, averaging 12.8 points, 6.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists while playing an average of only 24.5 minutes in the Lakers’ five preseason games. \nRandle will make $3.13 million this season.
