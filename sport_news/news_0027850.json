I hit a good drive and just got stuck in a terrible lie and it was a bad five,\" Lahiri said in an Asian Tour release. \n\n\"I think I played well, pretty similar to yesterday. But the couple of times I missed the fairway, I found some difficult lies in the rough,\" the Bengalurean added. \n\nChiragh got an eagle on the 13th, alongwith birdies on the second, seventh and eighth holes for a 67 that helped him share the spot with Lahiri, South Korea's Jeunghun Wang (68) and Brazilian Adilson Da Silva (65). \n\nAustralian Scott Hend, winner here in 2013 and runner-up to Lahiri last season, stayed in the hunt with a 68 leaving him two back with countryman Sam Brazel, who charged up the leaderboard with a 66. \n\nAmong other Indians in the fray, Rashid Khan (65) and Rahil Gangjee (68) were tied eighth on a 36-hole total of seven-under 135. \n\nAbhijit Chadda (70) and Gaganjeet Bhullar finished tied 14th on 137, while S.S.P. Chawrasia, third in the Asian Tour Order of Merit list, scored 68 to be tied 19th on 138. \n\nFormer Asian Tour champion Jyoti Randhawa scored two-over 73 and was lucky to make the cut that was declared at even-par 142. \n\nS. Chikka (71), Shiv Kapur (70), Manav Jaini (71), former Asian Tour champion Arjun Atwal (72), Himmat Rai (74), Kapil Kumar (79) and Khalin Joshi (75), Subhankar Sharma (76) and Angad Cheema (77) missed the halfway cut. \n\nAmong the big names who failed to make it to the final 36 holes were four-time Major winner Ernie Els of South Africa and two-time champion Zhang Lian-wei of China. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:34:14.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
