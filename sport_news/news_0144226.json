Henkle is using the Owl tackle, a rugby-style technique being taught by defensive coordinator Brian Newberry. KENNESAW — Kennesaw State’s football program is trying to play the game smarter and safer by incorporating the tackling techniques employed by the Seattle Seahawks.So far, the techniques seem to be working.After the Owls’ 12-7 victory over Gardner-Webb on Saturday, Kennesaw State moved to 5-1 and the defense padded its already gaudy statistics of allowing only 272.3 yards and 14.7 points per game this season. One of the reasons for its success is the team’s use of the Owl tackle, a rename of the Hawk tackle, which is a rugby-style tackle that is taught by Seattle coach Pete Carroll and his staff.“The Owl tackle is where you go for a certain place on the hip,” Kennesaw State coach Brian Bohannon said. “It’s going low, wrapping and rolling. It takes the head out of the equation a little bit.”Carroll has been using the technique during his stay with Seattle and before that with USC. He has created a Youtube video to show and demonstrate the way the team utilizes the Hawk tackle and that is where Owls defensive coordinator Brian Newberry became aware of its effectiveness.“There are a few things I like about it,” he said. “First, it’s a much safer way to tackle, and it’s a very effective way to tackle. It’s just coming into the world of football today, but I think it’s getting some legs.”In the video, Carroll talks how with the rule changes in the NFL, it has made tackling, and being physical, more of a challenge. He said what this style of tackling allows is to keep standards high, allow for the natural physical play of the game and keep players safe.The Owl tackle focuses on the opponent’s inside hip. The tackler keeps his shoulders square and uses his leverage to make the hit, wrap up around the waist and then continue driving his feet through the tackle. The Seahawks also have a Hawk roll tackle where the defender, upon making contact with the ball carrier, uses his leverage to roll the player onto the ground. Newberry has also instituted this into the Owls technique. Newberry also said when the players use the technique properly, it cuts down the chances of missed tackles. He said the staff has been teaching the Owl tackle since the program’s first practice, but it is still a challenge to get the players comfortable enough with it where it becomes second nature. It’s because live tackling is something that is difficult to practice during the season.To date, Newberry said the players that have taken to the Owl tackle the quickest are defensive backs Derrick Farrow and Taylor Henkle. He said it is no coincidence that Farrow (30 tackles) and Henke (27) lead the team in tackles.“Out on the perimeter and in space it’s a better way of tackling,” Newberry said. “And it’s a good thing that (Farrow and Henkle) are good, because they are the last line of defense.”BIG SOUTH AWARDS: Quarterback Trey White and kicker Justin Thompson picked up some Big South Conference accolades after their performances against Gardner-Webb.White was named the Big South Offensive Player of the Week after rushing for 170 yards and completing 9-of-14 passes for 114 yards.Thompson was named Big South Freshman of the Week after tying the conference record of four made field goals in a game. He connected on kicks of 30, 33, 26 and 31 yards.White and Thompson became the second and third KSU players to earn Big South honors. They join Farrow, who was named Big South Defensive Player of the Week following the Edward Waters game last month.GETTING NOTICED: Jacksonville State and the Big South’s Coastal Carolina hold the top two spots in the Stats FCS poll this week. But look closely in the portion of “Others receiving votes,” because Kennesaw State, in its first year of existence, received two votes.
