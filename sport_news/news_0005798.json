For the first 11 years of his life, the sides never played each other, so he naturally assumed New Zealand’s natural enemy in rugby was closer to home. \n“I grew up during the apartheid era when Australia were the traditional foes,” centre Smith told reporters. \n“But now South Africa have come back into it and I think it’s got back to where it was and they are our ultimate rival.” \nSouth Africa returned to international rugby in 1992 and hosted the World Cup in 1995. Perhaps due to fate, they played the All Blacks in the final, winning 15-12 in extra-time after an epic struggle in Johannesburg. \nSince then, the teams have played each other annually, initially in the Tri-Nations and now in the expanded Rugby Championship, and twice more at the World Cup. \nIn 1999 South Africa beat the All Blacks in the third place playoff and four years later New Zealand defeated the Springboks in the quarter-finals. \nOn Saturday, the two rugby superpower will meet again in the semi-finals and both teams were relishing the prospect. \n“There’s something special about playing them and playing them in a semi-final will be extra special,” Smith said. \n“We have a good relationship with most teams we play, but South Africa have a special respect for the game and that’s why two minutes after the game we are able to shake hands, walk off the pitch and have a chat with them.” \nThe All Blacks will go into the match as strong favourites after demolishing France 62-13 in the quarter-finals while South Africa got off to a terrible start in the tournament when they lost their opening group match to Japan. \nBut the Springboks have not lost since, steadily growing in confidence, and Smith is expecting another titanic struggle. \n“They are always tight match-ups with the Springboks and I’m sure this one will be the same. They’ve been impressive so far and individually they have great players,” he said. \n“Although we beat them in our last outing in the Rugby Championship, we weren’t proud of the way we played. We know we are playing a very good, physical side.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:30:27.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
