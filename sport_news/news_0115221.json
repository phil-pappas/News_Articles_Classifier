Westlake (1-5, 0-1) enters the game on a three game losing streak while Iota (1-5, 0-1) has lost five straight since beating Sacred Heart in quadruple overtime in Week 1. The biggest struggle for both teams this season has been more about stopping the other team than their own offense. Westlake is allowing 408 yards and 37.7 points per game while Iota is allowing 375 yards and 41.7 points per game. Westlake senior quarterback Hunter Racca threw for over 200 yards last week for the third time this season and now has 1,105 yards (77-130-3, 8TD) in six games. Meleick Pappion (25 rec., 470 yards, 4TD) and Joseph January (23 rec., 349 yards, 2TD) give the Rams to potent downfield threats. Iota has a nearly balanced offense this season led by running back Kaleb Guillory who has 781 yards and seven touchdowns on 146 carries. Quarterback Trae Rambin had completed nearly 50 percent of his passes for 568 yards and six touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:40:21.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
