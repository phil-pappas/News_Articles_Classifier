The logic of fairness ends when we blame an object for mistakes made by people. The fault here should be directed to a public education system that refuses to teach our citizens to respect and appreciate our constitutional rights. Tim Flanagan ‘Menagerie’ impresses To the Editor: My husband and I attended the production of “The Glass Menagerie” at Stage 3 Theatre Company this afternoon and were very favorably impressed with the outstanding acting, and overall excellence of the performance. We felt very fortunate to be able to attend this event, especially at an affordable price. We make it a point to take in one of Stage 3’s productions whenever we are in the area and have never been disappointed. However, this theater company seems to be a well-kept secret, as there was only a small audience in attendance. We are worried that the 2016 season may be the last, if Stage 3 is not able to attract larger audiences. We hope theater-goers will support Stage 3 so that Sonora does not lose this great community asset. Wendy Presley A concerned citizen To the Editor: As a concerned citizen living in the La Contenta Subdivision in Valley Springs, I believe the new asphalt plant that has been proposed must have a health study completed for the safety of all family’s living in our County. My home is less than one mile from the site as a bird flies. Dr. Estoesta wrote “the toxic chemicals used in making asphalt can cause Chronic Illness and Cancer” in his letter to the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors. The site, about 100 yards downstream from the New Hogan Dam sits right next to the Calaveras River. As the river flows past this proposed site, how much pollution will enter the water? A few yards past the plant down river is our water treatment plant where thousands of family’s living here receives their water. The plant would also add many large trucks driving through the small two-lane county road past the homes of families in our area. The State of California and our county will be working to clean up the hazardous waste from the Butte Fire home sites and that is smart government helping our neighbors restart their lives. Why are they considering approval of a polluting business here? All we ask is for a health study to be done. I would ask all Calaveras voters, please stand together and support a safety study on this Asphalt Plant. The Planning Commission’s next meeting on the Ford/CB Asphalt Appeal hearing will be on Nov. 19.
