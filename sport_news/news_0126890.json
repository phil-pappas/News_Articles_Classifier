Whatever happens, we need to move forward as one now,\" he wrote. \n\"I don't think there's a reason to panic and think that the English game is doomed. There are still a lot of world-class players in that England squad. \nHe added: \"For me, playing for England is still my dream. \n\"The commitment and drive to put on the white shirt is still there. Everyone is going to go out there and put their hands up and say 'pick me'. \n\"Sale Sharks are now my priority along with getting stuck into the season. If I play well for them, that's all I can do to be selected for the Six Nations squad.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:50.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
