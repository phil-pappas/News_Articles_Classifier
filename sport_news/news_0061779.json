So close to the end zone, just 20 yards out? My God, what had he had done to deserve such kind fortune? Probably not since Tyler Russell was Mississippi State’s QB1 and Prescott the young backup thrown in as a change-of-pace has an opposing defense set up quite like this. Three men were on the line of scrimmage, and the only other Wildcat in the middle of the field set up 11 yards behind the line of scrimmage. Kentucky was in a state of confusion, because how else to explain the six guys pointing and motioning to each other about how to defend four receivers as the ball was snapped? Kentucky was basically saying, \"Hey Dak, here's a touchdown.\" \n\"It was honestly a weird look, because I don’t think anybody has left the box open like that ever against me,\" Prescott said. \"I was quick to change to that play and it was an easy touchdown.\" \nIt was the fourth of Prescott’s amazing six touchdowns Saturday, no doubt his easiest and also the most memorable. Not only because we have so rarely seen Prescott be able to run like this in 2015, but also because it came at the end of a minute of play that featured 14 MSU points and a Kentucky turnover. It was in that moment that Mississippi State took over, leading to a 42-16 win. \n\"Our two touchdowns late really shifted momentum and really gave us some when we didn’t have a whole lot during the first half,\" coach Dan Mullen said. \nIt was as if all of a sudden the north endzone had been picked up off its soil, tilting everything with it towards the Mississippi State endzone. Mississippi State had the lead and the ball with 3:10 remaining, but it had been a relatively even game up to that point. But then Prescott found four-straight receivers -- that one for 12, then another for 13, and then two more for 18 each -- and, with the ball at the UK 8, dropped a pass into Brandon Holloway’s hands in the corner of the endzone. \nKentucky had to answer. The Wildcats are an improving team, and this was the moment to prove they could run with the big boys and score points when they had to. Patrick Towles had been hounded all night and repeatedly chased out of the pocket, but he had time to stand and make the throw he wanted into single coverage along the sideline. Only the cover guy was Taveze Calhoun, who was a step ahead of the receiver and ran it down for the first of what would be two interceptions on the night. \nPrescott got the ball back with 1:03 remaining and immediately completed a pass to Holloway that ended up going for 63 yards. A play later Prescott had a 20-yard trot into the endzone to make it 28-10. Prescott was awesome all night -- 25-of-35 passing for 348 yards and three touchdowns, and 117 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 13 carries. But he was at his best late in the second quarter. \nThere were 59 other minutes Saturday, and in a lot of them Mississippi State looked just OK. Two-thirds of the way through the season the Bulldogs are still a little rough around the edges, which means they’ll probably just always be that way. They make some plays, then give some up. This is what young teams do. They made more than they missed on Saturday, and you have to give respect to any 26-point win against an SEC team that is liable to go bowling. \nBut for that one moment in the second quarter Saturday Mississippi State looked all of a sudden like the 2014 Bulldogs, the guys that would just overwhelm the opposition. When Prescott gets going and the defense is flying around and hitting everything it can, these guys can be pretty dang good. That we know they’re capable of these stretches of play is important, because Kentucky kicked off a five-game, six-week stretch that features no more nonconference layups. What happens next is anyone's guess, but this version of Mississippi State has a lot of possibilities. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1S3FPLg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:57:20.135+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
