Seven newcomers to the program were involved in a workout at Cameron Indoor Stadium. “I think you’re going to love our team this year,” Krzyzewski said among his occasional remarks to the several hundred onlookers who gathered to watch from the upper level. It’s a vastly reworked roster from the group that won the national championship in April. But it’s clear that championship game hero Grayson Allen has become among the fan favorites. The two-hour session involved Krzyzewski directing a video review of certain pointers at the outset. The practice was full of instruction from Krzyzewski. He stopped one drill when he apparently sensed the communication defensively wasn’t up to snuff. “We can’t have a team of not talkers,” he said. When it came time for scrimmage-like activity near the end of practice, the team selected by center Marshall Plumlee came out on top (ahead of the unit picked by Amile Jefferson). Members of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets staff attended the practice as well. The Nets are holding preseason training camp in Durham. The onlookers also included Duke graduate and ex-NBA executive Danny Ferry and former Navy and NBA standout David Robinson. Robinson gave pointers to post players after the formal session concluded. The practice came as a prelude to homecoming festivities beginning on campus. Krzyzewski’s closing remarks to the crowd included encouraging fans to attend today’s football game against Boston College.
