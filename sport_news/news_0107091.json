The combined loss of 14 yards forced Nevada to punt after it had recovered an onside kick to begin the drive deep in A&M territory. The plays finally wrapped up a 44-27 win for the Aggies (3-0) in front of an announced crowd of 102,591 at a steamy Kyle Field.\nThe Aggies won their 19th straight nonconference game, but Nevada (1-2) made the tuneup for next week's SEC opener messier and closer than A&M would've preferred. The Aggies next take on Arkansas at Arlington's AT&T Stadium.\n\"What a tough guy,\" A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said, noting Garrett could hardly pull on his helmet earlier this week after his wisdom teeth came out last Sunday and barely practiced. \"I was glad he could get his helmet on today. ... He's a game-changer.\"\nGarrett finished with 31/2 sacks, upping his total for the season to 51/2. He said he didn't feel well the whole game and didn't play much of the third quarter.\n\"When it's crunch time and someone has to take over, I have to do it,\" Garrett said. \"I can't wait for anybody else to do it. We're a collective unit and we can all make plays, but I have to hold myself accountable when ... we don't get the stops. So if I can do it, I will.\"\nA&M always had enough big plays and flashes of strong play to remain in control of Nevada, but there will also be plenty to work on when the Aggies regroup on Monday.\n\"The big takeaway in the locker room was that, hey, listen, we won, but we still have to be more consistent,\" Sumlin said. \"We have to be honest with each other, not pat each other on the back. Come in Monday, address issues and get better this week.\"\nWith the game knotted at 7 in the first quarter, Nevada appeared to sack quarterback Kyle Allen and return his lost fumble for a touchdown and the lead. But a defensive holding penalty wiped out the play. A&M responded by marching down the field, capping the drive with a touchdown on a 10-yard pass from Allen to Speedy Noil. A&M led 24-10 at halftime.\nAllen was 18 of 31 for 270 yards and four touchdowns passing and rushed for 55 yards and a touchdown. He showed off the ability to scramble, in part, Allen and Sumlin revealed, to make opposing defenses respect that he's not always just going to drop back in the pocket.\nTra Carson rushed for 137 yards and Christian Kirk had 120 yards receiving for A&M.\nThe offensive line's pass protection needs to continue to improve, Sumlin said. A&M went 4 of 12 on third downs and three times settled for field goals instead of touchdowns.\nA&M had 16 tackles for loss, including freshman tackle Daylon Mack busting through to take down running back James Butler.\nStewart passed for 206 yards and two touchdowns and Butler rushed for 107 yards for Nevada, coming off a rough week in which the school fined coach Brian Polian for his sideline behavior in the prior week's loss to Arizona.\nSumlin said A&M would focus on erasing \"bad football.\" When Allen threw an interception in the third quarter, trying to force a play wasn't all of the problem, Sumlin said. He also pointed to an incompletion and a rush for a loss that set up the third-and-14 situation at A&M's 12.\nBut looking at the entirety of the last three weeks, Sumlin and A&M players said they feel well-positioned for the start of SEC play.\n\"I think we're ready for the jump in competition and competitiveness,\" offensive tackle Germain Ifedi said. \"This team has been waiting to get into that meat of the schedule. ... We're proud of where we are. We still have things we need to get fixed, but what team doesn't at this point?\"\nFollow Kate Hairopoulos on Twitter at @khairopoulos.\nMORE TEXAS A&M COVERAGE\nHairopoulos: Garrett puts teeth in A&M's D; Ags overcome 'bad football' in 44-27 win over Nevada\nTexas A&M-Nevada notebook: Brandon Williams becomes Aggies' first two-way player since '70s\nFive Thoughts: Kyle Allen has five touchdowns; Myles Garrett 3.5 sacks in No. 17 Texas A&M's 44-27 victory over Nevada\nPhotos: Texas A&M dances day away in win over Nevada\nClick here to visit the Texas A&M page\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesports/2015/09/19/photos-texas-dances-day-away-win-nevada", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/texas-nevada-notebook-brandon-williams-becomes-aggies-first-two-way-player-since-70s", "https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-kyle-allen-five-touchdowns-myles-garrett-35-sacks-17-texas-ams-44-27-victory-nevada", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/hairopoulos-garrett-puts-teeth-ams-d-ags-overcome-bad-football-44-27-win-nevada"], "published": "2015-09-20T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:06:16.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
