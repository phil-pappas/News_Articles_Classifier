Pittsburg soccer ended their regular season in style, going on the road to beat Independence 1-0. “It was a tough match as we were missing some key personnel on our squad tonight,” Pittsburg head coach Sean Lauderdale said. “We moved some players around and were able to find the right mix that helped us get the job done, though. “Several players have stepped for us, including Lukas McConnell and Ivan Walter. They’ve taken on critical roles for the squad and held us intact and given us key opportunities to make goals and win matches.” With the win, Pittsburg ends their season with a 14-2 record and went undefeated in league play as the SEK Champions. “The last two out of our three matches, against Basehor-Linowood and Independence, were critical,” Lauderdale said. “They will give us a lot of confidence going into regionals, knowing we can get some wins despite not having to work hard through the duration of the match to find ways to score goals and win.” After a scoreless first half of play, the Dragons put up their first goal of the game in the 47th minute when Jose Ayala found the back of the net. The Bulldogs were never able to capitalize as the Purple Dragons held them silent all evening. Senior goaltender Sullivan Lauderdale had nine saves in the shutout performance. Shots on goal from PHS came from Jamie Maldonado, Alex Arriola, Calderon, Lukas McConnell and Ayala.
