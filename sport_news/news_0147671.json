The 79-year-old organist has been playing at Dodger Stadium for 28 years. \nHefley took over from Helen Dell in 1988 and has become as much a fan favorite as Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully and retired manager Tom Lasorda. She began playing the piano at age 4 and at 13 she talked her teacher into showing her the basics of the organ. \nHefley commutes to each homestand from her home in Silver Springs, Nevada, while renting a second home locally. She is accompanied by her husband, Bill, whom she met while playing the organ at church. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
