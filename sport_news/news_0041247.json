A teenager was beaten to death and his younger brother was badly hurt inside a secretive upstate New York church — and their parents are among the six church members charged with the crime, police said Wednesday.\nThe investigation was launched after the parents of 19-year-old Lucas Leonard showed up at a hospital Monday with their badly beaten son, who later died.\nWithin an hour, a police SWAT team descended on the Word of Life Church in New Hartford, N.Y., where they found his battered 17-year-old brother, who remains hospitalized in serious condition.\nBruce and Deborah Leonard have been charged with first-degree manslaughter. Four other members of the church have been charged with second-degree assault.\nNew Hartford police were expected to divulge a possible motive for the bizarre beatings and more details about their investigation later Wednesday.\nMore members of the church, which has been housed for decades inside a former grade school and which neighbors have described as a “cult,” could be arrested, police warned.\nPolice have already removed several children from the church and turned them over to child welfare officials.\nThe brutality of the beatings were revealed Tuesday when the victim’s parents were arraigned.\nBoth teens suffered injuries to their abdomens, genitals, backs and thighs, police said.\nBruce Leonard, 65, and his 59-year-old wife, Deborah, both of Clayville, N.Y., pleaded not guilty and were dispatched to the Oneida County Jail after they were unable to raise the $100,000 bail.\nNew Hartford Police Department via AP From top left, Deborah Leonard, Bruce Leonard and Linda Morey. From bottom left, Joseph Irwin, Sarah Ferguson and David Morey. The Leonards of Clayville, N.Y., were charged with first-degree manslaughter in the beating death of their 19-year-old son. The four other suspects — Joseph Irwin, 26, of Chadwicks, N.Y., David Morey, 26, of Utica, N.Y., Linda Morey, 54, also of Utica, and Sarah Ferguson, 33, of Clayville — were each ordered held of $50,000 bail.\nThe Leonards’ neighbors told The Post-Standard of Syracuse they couple homeschooled their kids. They said the family did not celebrate Christmas and weren’t allowed outside during Halloween.\nResidents who live near the church told the Syracuse paper that members would rarely venture out in the daylight hours and those that did were often men wearing what they described as “long, black trenchcoats.”\nThey said they would hear strange chanting coming from the building as late as 3 a.m.\nA Post-Standard reporter who ventured inside the building on Tuesday found police tape across two bathrooms, one labeled \"Adam\" and the other \"Eve.\"\nThe reporter also said there was a framed message hanging on one wall that read, in part:\n“We have been commissioned through the written word of God to reach out to those who have not experienced the love of Jesus Christ in their lives ... Through the systematic training up of saints.”\n— With News Wire Services\ncsiemaszko@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:08:14.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
