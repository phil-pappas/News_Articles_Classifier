Image 11 of 11 Troy High grad has record-breaking game for Iowa football 1  /  11 Back to Gallery Former Troy High standout Jordan Canzeri had a record-breaking game to help the unbeaten University of Iowa football team defeat Illinois 29-20 in a Big Ten Conference matchup Saturday in Iowa City.\nJordan carried the ball a school-record 43 times for 256 yards — the third best total in Iowa's long history – to lead the Hawkeyes.\nThe 5-foot-9, 192-pound senior scored two touchdowns — one on a 75-yard run and the other on a 17-yard pass reception. \n\"We saw something special; it was a tremendous gutty performance,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz told the media after the game. \"He stepped up big and he wanted to. I had no idea he had 43 carries, and he never looked to the bench. It was one of those shots where he was going to keep going. That's reflective of the attitude of our football team and Jordan represents those guys well.\" \nLate in the final quarter, Canzeri carried the ball 11 straight times for 58 yards to run the clock down and set up a field goal.\nOn the season, Canzeri has carried the ball 132 times for 595 yards (5.3 per carry) and scored nine touchdowns. He also has caught 16 passes for 174 yards and a score to help Iowa start the season with a 6-0 record and a 2-0 mark in league play. \nIowa already is bowl eligible and faces a big test next Saturday against nationally-ranked Northwestern in Evanston, Ill. The winner will be in a great spot to earn the West Division title and play for the league's championship Saturday, Dec. 5 in Indianapolis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:31:53.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
