(AP) — Jim Caldwell doesn't want to talk any more about the controversial way his Detroit Lions lost Monday night — and he doesn't want his players talking about it either.\nCaldwell says he doesn't want the Lions to be distracted by more discussion of Calvin Johnson 's fumble on Detroit's final possession in a loss to Seattle.\nThe ball was knocked out of the back of the end zone by the Seahawks ' K.J. Wright . Rather than flag him for illegally batting the ball, officials ruled the play a touchback.\nCaldwell said he spoke with NFL VP of Officiating Dean Blandino on Tuesday, but the Detroit coach would not go into detail about that conversation.\nCaldwell says defensive tackle Tyrunn Walker is out for the season with a dislocated ankle and broken leg.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:29:03.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
