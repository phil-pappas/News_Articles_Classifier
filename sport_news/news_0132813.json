Leila Navidi – Star Tribune INDIANAPOLIS ­— After a week’s worth of games as tight as a snare drum there was finally one that lacked drama Sunday night. And not in a good way for the Minnesota Lynx or their fans. In position to close out the best-of-five WNBA finals, with an opportunity add a fifth title in three seasons, the Lynx came out at Bankers Life Field house and were soundly beaten. Using full-court pressure nearly from the start, taking advantage of game-long foul trouble that rendered Lynx center Sylvia Fowles insignificant, the Indiana Fever used a 20-8 third-quarter run to take control for good in a 75-69 victory. It evened the series at two games each. Game 5 will be Wednesday night at Target Center. It will be just the fourth time there has been a Game 5 since the league went to the format in 2005. But the Lynx are going to have to figure out a couple things by then. Fever guard Marissa Coleman tried to pivot around the defense of Lynx forward Maya Moore during the first quarter of Indiana's 75-69 victory in Game 5 of the WNBA Finals on Sunday. One, how to keep a star player out of foul trouble. Minnesota was able to overcome Maya Moore’s foul trouble in Friday’s Game 3 victory. But they couldn’t get past Fowles foul trouble Sunday. Most critically in the third quarter. The Lynx were down four at the half. But they scored the first six points of the third to take a two-point lead. But then, with 6:40 left in the quarter Fowles picked up foul No. 4 when Fever guard Briann January drove into the lane. Fowles left the game and January went to the line. Her two free throws started a 20-8 run to end the quarter that put the Fever up 12 entering the fourth. That lead eventually grew to 14 before the Lynx made it look closer at the end. Moore scored 18 points for the Lynx. Lindsay Whalen had 16 and Seimone Augustus had 10. The Fever got 15 from Marissa Coleman, 14 from Sherise Johnson and 12 from January had 13. The Fever turned 15 Lynx turnovers into 17 points and won the battle of the boards. The Lynx bench, so good in Game 3, was out-scored 23-14 The Lynx led 20-15 after the first quarter thanks to incredible balance; four of the five starters and Anna Cruz off the bench all had four points for the Lynx, who used an 8-0 mid-way through the quarter to take the lead. Not surprisingly four different players scored in that run. Augustus hit a jumper, then Cruz scored on a drive. Brunson hit a jumper then Moore hit two free throws for a 16-11 lead. Up 18-15 late in the quarter Brunson hit from just inside the free throw line. The Lynx were up five early in the second quarter when things went awry. Fowles picked up her third foul early in the quarter. Then Indiana coach Stephanie White had her team start defending the Lynx full-court. Down five a minute into the quarter, Natasha Howard had five points, Johnson and January four each in a 15-4 run that put the Fever up 32-26 on Johnson’s layup with 3:20 left in the half. That where the lead stood until late, when the Lynx turned Catchings’ turnover into Whalen’s layup, pulling the Lynx within 36-32 at the half. It appeared the Lynx were ready to take control at the start of the second. Moore hit a three-pointer. Then Whalen forced a jump ball and won it. Fowles was fouled and made one to tie the game. Then Fowles scored again and the Lynx – on an 8-0 lead dating back to Whalen’s layup at the end of the first half – were up two. But Fowles picked up an ill-advised fourth foul with 6:40 left and all the air went out of the Lynx.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:15:01.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
