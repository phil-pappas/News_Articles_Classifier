(Associated Press) Comments \nSPRINGFIELD - Teams that accomplished noteworthy \"firsts\" will be part of the Class of 2015 in the Springfield Public Schools Sports Hall of Fame. \nThe new electees also include 31 athletes, two coaches and two contributors. The Class of 2015 will be inducted Nov. 21 in the Central High School gym. \n\"Our committee decided that it was time to begin recognizing teams that brought honor to Springfield,\" chairman Mike Martin said. \"It's a daunting task, considering the long history of high school sports in the city, so we decided to begin with some teams that were the first champions in various sports.\" \nThe honored teams: \nCommerce 1935, undefeated and Western Mass. soccer champion. Coached by Hal Jones. \nTech 1937, undefeated and regional football champion under the ratings system then in place. Coached by Chief Walmer. \nTech 1953-54-55, only city golf teams to win three straight Western Mass. titles. The '55 team also won state honors. Coached by Henry Batt and Al Johnson. \nTech 1957, the city's first Western Mass. public school champion in baseball. Coached by Johnny Kalloch. \nTech 1968-69-70, the first and only city teams to win three straight state titles in baseball. Coached by Howie Burns. \nClassical 1948, the city's first Western Mass. champ in basketball. Coached by Sid Burr. \nTech 1965, the city's first WMass public school champion in hockey. Coached by Ed Mason. \nCommerce 1976-77-78, the first teams to win three straight state titles in basketball. Coached by Mike Martin. \nTech 1977, the city's first state champion in wrestling. Coached by Fred Scyocurka. \n\"We realize this list is heavy with teams from Tech, but we must remember that the school was a regional sports power in its day, and therefore would have several 'firsts,'\" Martin said. \nBoth Tech and Classical closed in 1986, replaced by Central. \nIn addition to enshrining teams and individuals, the Hall of Fame committee will salute the family of Bill and Peg Clark for its contribution to high school sports in the city. Seven Clark siblings - Doug, Gavin, Andrew, Will, Connell, Molly and Nora - played varsity sports at Central. \nEnshrinement as contributors will go to Tom Shea and Larry Silber, who gave extensive coverage to high school sports in their time with the Springfield Newspapers. \nFor the first time, rowing is represented in the Public Schools Hall of Fame. Honored from that sport is Bob Rubner, a 1949 Tech grad who was a \"one-man rowing team\" as a schoolboy. In 1948, he won the national high school singles championship. Now 83 years old, he resides in Enfield, Conn. \nAlso part of the Class of 2015 is Rick Bennett, whose hockey coaching career at Union College includes an NCAA Frozen Four championship in 2014. Bennett played for coach Jim Carlin on a Western Mass. championship team at Classical in 1985. \nAthletes in the Class of 2015: \nClassical/Central: Rick Bennett, Eddie Green, Gregory Hall, Raymond Joyner, Gary Lemoine, Joseph Murphy, David Ramos, Sha'ki Wheeler, Tony Wiggins. \nCommerce: Bob Belli, William Dawkins, Craig Kormannshaus, Jordan Long, Alex Lovejoy, Pat Ochoa, Joshua Tate. \nTech: Dwayne Dawson, Paul Letourneau, James Long, Chris Robbins, Robert Rubner, Lawrence Scheeser. \nPutnam/Trade: James Hester, Larry Landry, Nelson Merced, Wesley White, Loren Wilder. \nSci-Tech: Kyle Atkinson, Dwayne Kirby, Lewis Lee, Miseal Ramos. \nCoaches: Darby McLaughlin, Bill Ross. \nGarry Brown can be reached at geebrown1918@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:08:40.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
