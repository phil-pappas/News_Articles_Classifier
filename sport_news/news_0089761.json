But I was confident that once we opened the floodgates a little bit and scored one in the second half, we could get the win.\" \nSCORELESS FIRST HALF \nThe two teams finished the first half scoreless, with each side putting a few shots on goal. Nolan started the game with a quick chance just inside the box, but her shot was blocked by a Tenafly defender. The freshman followed up a few minutes later with a run down the right side and fired a shot on goal that was saved by Tenafly keeper Maia Katz. \nTenafly's Sabrina Jayson answered with two shots of her own. In the first opportunity, Jayson received the ball near the top of the box, turned around and fired a quick shot on goal that was saved by Demarest freshman goalkeeper Emma Miller. \nAfter a rush down the field by the Tigers, the ball found Jayson near the top of the box again, and her shot was saved once again by Miller. \nNear the midpoint of the half, Nolan had two more long shots on goal that were saved by Katz, neither one being a particularly difficult stop for the Tenafly keeper. \nThe remainder of the first half went without any real scoring opportunities, with the majority of play consisting of possession battles in the midfield. \nA HAT TRICK \nThe action picked up once again in the beginning of the second half. \nDemarest senior Carly Latner fired a hard shot wide to the left of goal about five minutes into the period, just outside the post. Jackie Brocco took a corner kick for the Tigers that curled in towards the goal itself, forcing Miller to make a save for the Norsewomen. \nWith just over 12 minutes left in the game, the Demarest offense finally was able to capitalize on the scoring chances they were creating. Nolan fired a bouncing shot on goal that was misplayed in goal by the Tenafly keeper and trickled into the back of the net at the 12:08 mark in the second half. \nLittle more than three minutes later, at 8:58, Nolan received a pass on the left side of the box, took two steps and fired a shot over Katz's hands and high into the goal. \nLess than a minute and a half after the second goal, Norsewoman junior Kristina Connolly passed it to Nolan in the center of the field. She fired another shot, this time in the upper left corner of the net, giving the freshman her first career hat trick. \nBREAKOUT GAME \nThe three goals give Nolan a total of nine on the season, the most for any Demarest player. \n\"This was a real good breakout game for her,\" Eftychiou said. \"She scored some really good goals. For a freshman to be able to score a hat trick at the varsity level against any team is pretty impressive.\" \nWith just 7:32 left to play, the Norsewomen were able to maintain their lead for the remainder of the game, taking home an emotional 3-0 win. \nThe Norsewomen honored nine seniors before the game, all of whom were playing in the last home game of their high school careers. The nine seniors on the roster are Latner, Brooke Levinson, Christie Chen, Gabriella Tait, Danielle Mandelblatt, Kelsea Masterson, Gabriella Georgio, Leah Field and Kelly LaMorte. LaMorte was a three-year starter in goal for Demarest, tallying 479 career saves, but missed her entire senior year after suffering a torn ACL while playing for her club team. \n'NOTABLE MEMORY' \nIn a gesture to the keeper who meant so much to the program during her career, the team started LaMorte in goal for the opening seconds of the game, before bringing in Miller to actually play in goal.
