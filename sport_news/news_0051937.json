(Photo: Jason Bean/RGJ) \nIn games this season, you could tell whether the Nevada football team had won or lost not by looking at the scoreboard but by simply looking at the stat line of running backs Don Jackson and James Butler. \nIt’s really been that simple. \nIn Nevada’s three wins, Jackson and Butler have rushed for 258.7 yards per game, 7.5 yards per carry, hit the 100-yard mark five times and scored six times. In Nevada’s four losses, Jackson and Butler have rushed for 114.8 yards per game, 4.2 yards per carry, hit the 100-yard mark once and scored four times. \nWhen the Wolf Pack running backs have a good game, the team wins. When they don’t, it loses. \nBut offensive coordinator Nick Rolovich has learned more about his backs in the losses than the wins. \n“In games where we can run the ball, they’re excellent,” Rolovich said as Nevada prepares to host Hawaii on Saturday. “In games where we struggle to run the ball, they’re even better because they don’t get selfish, especially Don being a vocal leader keeping things positive. You talk about unselfishness, they’re sharing the carries and all that but when they have to go pass block they go do it very willingly.” Wolf Pack players to fans: Don't give up on us \nYou could make the argument Jackson and Butler are the best running back duo in the nation. \nThey’re the only teammates in the FBS with at least 600 yards each this season and they’re both on pace to hit 1,000 yards. If they accomplish that feat, Jackson and Butler will become just the third running back duo in Nevada history to hit 1,000 yards in the same season (it happened in 1983 and 2009). \nBut, for Jackson, a senior, and Butler, a sophomore, the focus hasn’t been about stats. It’s been about the unselfish tone they’ve set. Despite the team’s struggles this season, they’ve been a bright point. \n“They’ve been two consistent guys that every week you can count on them to play hard, they don’t make silly mistakes and they’ve done a great job of taking care of the football,” Wolf Pack head coach Brian Polian said. “When you’re looking for things that you can count on, you can look at those two tailbacks and know you’re going to get a really consistent, high-level effort from both of them.” \nTheir success is in large part dependent upon the offensive line, a group that has been up and down this season as it’s dealt with major injuries to the guard position (Nevada has started its No. 4 and 5 guards the last two games). With the line’s starting five uncertain at times, Nevada has been able to rely on Jackson (613 yards, 5.3 ypc, eight touchdowns) and Butler (622, 6.4 ypc, two touchdowns). \n“They’ve been playing well, which we expect out of guys who are experienced,” running backs coach Lester Erb said. “The biggest thing between the two is there’s no selfishness, which is pretty uncommon with skill-position guys and two guys who are basically splitting reps. You have a senior captain and sophomore tailback and they’re right down the middle and there’s no selfishness. They’re the first two guys to help each other out and that’s what good teammates are supposed to do.” \nThat tone was set by Jackson, who took Butler under his wing last season when Butler was a true freshmen. Instead of feeling threatened by Butler, Jackson helped his transition to college, so much so Butler felt it necessary to tell him Jackson “thank you” last season because he was being so nice to him. \nWhile at Iowa Western Community College, Jackson shared time in the backfield with two other FBS backs in Aaron Wimberly and Vernard Roberts, who both played for Power 5 schools. The experience of sharing carries there, and winning a national title, and his high school experience bred the unselfishness. \n“In high school, I’ve been there when I had 2,000 yards rushing on a 3-7 team,” Jackson said. “I would have traded 1,000 of those yards for wins. That’s the reality of it. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how good I do. Nobody will respect you if you don’t win. At the end of the day, my goal is winning.” Wolf Pack football building a Polynesian pipeline \nWith the Wolf Pack struggling of late, with two bad losses in the last three games, Jackson has been one of the team’s positives forces. His energy and optimism has been evident this week as Nevada tries to break into the win column again and salvage the rest of the season. Nevada’s West Division title hopes and bowl aspirations aren’t dashed yet, but it will have to play a lot better to reach those goals. \nJackson and Butler are two key forces in the quest to turn the season around. Their team-first mentality has spread through the team and set the foundation for the future, Nevada’s coaches said. \n“That culture in that running back room is going to be good for a very long time because of those two guys,” Rolovich said. “They’re a real solid foundation of our offense. I like the mentality of that room and we want to feed them and ride them a little bit. The rest of the offense sees how they approach whatever job they have to do and I think that makes them appreciate those guys and want to follow.” \nJackson and Butler are the only FBS teammates on pace to hit 1,000 yards this regular season. The only two running back teammates in Nevada history to hit 1,000 yards in the same season are Vai Taua and Luke Lippincott in 2009 and Otto Kelly and Anthony Corley in 1983. That’s a goal for Jackson and Butler. \n“That would be crazy,” Butler said. “That’d be real nice. But the main goal is to win games.” \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
