The New York Yankees are No. 1 with an estimated value of US$3.2 billion. \nThat increase in the team’s value is partly driven by the funds pulled in at Wrigley, where the Cubs have the third highest ticket prices in the league and generate even more from concessions, according to research firm Team Marketing Report, which tracks the industry. Cubs tickets average almost US$45 apiece, compared with a league average of nearly US$29. \nAttendance at Wrigley Field, which can seat over 41,000 people, hit almost 3 million this season, good for sixth in the league. That is an increase of almost 12 percent from 2014, when the Cubs ranked 11th in attendance. \nBased on merchandise sales at MLB.com/shop, Cubs merchandise finished sixth overall in the league as sales rose 80 percent, league officials said. That was up from ninth place last year and far better than the league average of an increase of 5-6 percent. \nTo the victor... \nWith the team’s success, however, both attendance and ticket prices may continue to rise. \nFamous for its ivy-covered outfield walls and urban location where home run balls sometimes drop onto a residential street, Wrigley Field is a top tourist attraction and has been declared a city landmark. The ballpark is over 100 years old. \nThe Cubs last fall started the renovation of Wrigley, which will be completed in phases. It has included a controversial left field videoboard and a right field sign that were protested unsuccessfully in federal court by owners of rooftop bars across the street from the ballpark, who complained their views into the stadium would be blocked. The project has also entails the addition of new bleachers, a new clubhouse, a restaurant and an outdoor plaza. It is expected to be completed by opening day in 2019. \n“They’ve taken all the steps to turn the Wrigley area into a Cubs experience and they didn’t do that just to make the fans happy,” said Michael Cramer, director of the sports media program at the University of Texas and the former president of a group that previously owned the Texas Rangers baseball club. The real big payoff is still to come, as the Ricketts plan to establish a Cubs regional sports TV network following the 2019 season. \nGiven the development of digital technologies, a Cubs network likely be worth more than the US$3 billion at which the New York Yankees’ YES Network was valued, analysts and bankers said. \n“We look at ourselves as a baseball team first, but lots of businesses after that, and on the media side we’re really excited about the future,” Crane Kenney, the Cubs president of business operations, said in an interview. \n“We’re in the third inning of our plan,” he added. “We’re very, very early in our growth cycle.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:58:10.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
