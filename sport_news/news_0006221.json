Johnell Barnes must sit out because of his fourth-quarter ejection for a targeting hit in the victory against Georgia Tech on Saturday. “We’re going to look at it as a plus,” Cutcliffe said. “We don’t like it (that he has to sit out). …We’ll have a fresh Johnell Barnes in the second half. I’m going to view it as we’ll have a fresh player at halftime.” Barnes was on punt coverage when his infraction occurred. Georgia Tech’s Jamal Golden mishandled a punt, and Barnes’ head-on-head hit came on the play. Barnes exited with 2:52 remaining, with the Blue Devils holding a six-point lead in their eventual 34-20 victory. Barnes leads Duke with 17 catches and 200 receiving yards. He has one touchdown reception. His absence could mean more chances for Chris Taylor, Ryan Smith and Anthony Nash. Duke might need all the weapons possible against Boston College. The Eagles rate first nationally in total defense by allowing 118 yards per game, though two of their four opponents were from the Football Championship Subdivision. The Blue Devils had some good news since the Georgia Tech game because starting right tackle Casey Blaser’s foot injury isn’t as serious as initially believed. There’s no fracture and so his status for this week is undetermined with what has been labeled a sprain, Cutcliffe said.
