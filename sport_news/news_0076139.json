Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more to help No. 14 Oklahoma State defeat Kansas 58-10 on Saturday, hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during the school's homecoming festivities. \nThree people were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. Oklahoma State considered postponing the game, but in the end, opted to go ahead with it. \nThe flag at Boone Pickens Stadium was lowered to half-staff and Cowboys players knelt down on the field and prayed before the coin flip. \nMason Rudolph completed 20 of 26 passes for 305 yards and had a touchdown for Oklahoma State (7-0, 4-0 Big 12). Kansas (0-7, 0-4) lost its 10th straight game overall and 36th on the road. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:46:46.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
