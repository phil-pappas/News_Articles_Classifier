Alberto decided to use the bat of teammate Delino DeShields and produced the go-ahead hit, and then DeShields used it for an infield hit that drove in an insurance run. \n\"I didn't even ask him for it,\" Alberto said. \"Good wood, too, you know?\" \nAlberto, batting last and only in the lineup because star third baseman Adrian Beltre was out with a strained back, made an error that led to Toronto's first two runs but redeemed himself with his big hit in extra innings. \nAlberto, who made his big league debut this season, also had a sacrifice fly. \n\"It's extremely special for him,\" Rangers first-year manager Jeff Banister said. \"Really, a guy that has sat at the end of the bench for us, an extra player.\" \nAnother packed crowd at Rogers Centre that made a lot of noise early was quiet at the very end. Toronto, back in the postseason for the first time since winning the 1993 World Series, lost for the second straight day at home. \nTexas' Rougned Odor hit a two-out single in the 14th but was nearly thrown out after going too far around second base on a single by Chris Gimenez, with the call confirmed by replay review. \n\"You wonder if 50,000 could be wrong,\" Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar said. \"I'm pretty sure I saw some daylight there.\" \nThat call proved pivotal when Alberto lined a single to center, sending Odor tumbling home. \nKansas City rallied from a three-run deficit, getting a go-ahead single from Ben Zobrist in the seventh inning, and edged Houston 5-4. \nIn a tight game that brought back memories of the Royals' nip-and-tuck postseason last year that carried them to the World Series, Kansas City knotted the game at 4-4 in the sixth inning. Kansas City took the lead in the seventh when Alcides Escobar led off with a triple and Zobrist followed with his single. \nRoyals' closer Wade Davis produced the save in dramatic style. After issuing a one-out walk, the speedy Carlos Gomez came in as a pinch-runner. Davis snapped a throw to Eric Hosmer at first, and he neatly snagged it on one hop as Gomez made a dive back to the bag. Gomez was initially ruled safe, but the call was overturned upon review. \nJose Altuve then grounded out to end it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:02:28.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
