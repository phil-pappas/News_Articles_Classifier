Andrew Tropeano, a technology expert and the host of NewsWatch, conducted the review and shared with viewers how they conducted a survey about hearing loss which resulted in interesting key findings.\nAccording to the American Academy of Audiology, hearing loss is the third most common health problem in the U.S., affecting more than 48 million Americans. When untreated, hearing loss has been linked to a multitude of issues like social isolation, cognitive decline, and even dementia.\nDr. Eric Branda from Sivantos sat down with NewsWatch to discuss their recent survey about this condition. Dr. Branda said, “We enjoy communicating with friends and family and hearing loss directly affects communication. We recently did a survey in 2015, a life at 50+ survey, and some of the key findings that were interesting were the amount of hearing loss out there. For people with mild to moderate hearing loss, only 16% are doing something about it.”\nTo learn more about the Sivantos study on hearing loss or their latest hearing aid devices, head on over to usa.bestsoundtechnology.com.\nAbout NewsWatch\nNewsWatch is a weekly 30-minute consumer oriented television show that airs on the Discovery Channel and ION Network.
