When he has to, [he can] take it himself, he can pass it off, he can get goals off of crosses, whether finishing with his feet or with his head. He just does it in a variety of ways.” \nHis coach says there’s something else that sets Clem apart: \n“He just loves to play.” \nIn fact, during the offseason, if he can’t find a game in Nixa, Clem will head to Springfield and the intramural fields at Missouri State, ones with an affectionate nickname. \n“Taco Bell fields, that’s what it is in Springfield,” Clem said of the fields that back right up to the fast food restaurant on the Bear campus. “Anywhere I could play during the summer, I would.” \nHe faces a variety of players. \n“They’re a lot older than me,” he said. “It can range anywhere from college kids, usually, to grown men.” \nClem said playing against the older, bigger players helps him translate his game back on the high school level. It seems to have worked, and Joey Clem is the Ozone Athlete of the Week.
