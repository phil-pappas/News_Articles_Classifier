An egregious choice of words, considering he tossed his then-girlfriend on a futon filled with automatic weapons.\n“Oh my goodness,” Jones told Sports Illustrated at the NFL owners’ meeting when told of the comments by SI.com before pausing and continuing.\n“Well, you’re not allowed to have guns on the football field. We all know that’s just a way of expressing yourself. I hope his guns are ablazin’.”\nAnd Jones did not seem offended at all by Hardy’s creepy comments about hoping to see Tom Brady’s wife, Gisele Bundchen, and her sister at the game this week. In fact, he might be interested in seeing the Brazilian supermodel, too.\n“When I saw him marry her [Gisele], Tom went up in my eyes 100 percent,” Jones said. “She’s very very attractive, and it shows what an outstanding individual Tom is.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under dallas cowboys ,  greg hardy ,  jerry jones ,  new england patriots ,  tom brady", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:29:53.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
