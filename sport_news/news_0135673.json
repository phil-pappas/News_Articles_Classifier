She’s an accomplished model who you probably know best as the only reason to be an adult male watching ‘The Price Is Right.’ \nManuela moved to New York in 2006, and quickly became a finalist in the 2008 season of ‘Nuestra Belleza Latina,’ a reality TV beauty contest on the Spanish TV network, Univision. She came in 6th; we honestly cannot imagine what #1 must have looked like. \nThat same year, she became one of 5 finalists in ‘The Price Is Right’ model search contest. Though she didn’t win, she impressed them enough to be hired as a model for the show anyway in April 2009. In 2012 Complex Maazine named her as #1 on their list of ‘The 25 Hottest Game Show Eye Candy.’ Now that’s more like it. \nSince then, she’s appeared in several music videos, including Diddy’s ‘Loving You No More,’ and was featured as a trophy model during the 2012 Grammy Awards. We’re straight up in love with her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:08:14.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
