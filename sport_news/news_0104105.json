But one thing I learned: For the first time, it's a good idea to go with someone familiar with the trails.\nThe trails provide some beautiful views of the Bushkill Creek and the Lehigh and Delaware rivers. Just don't get fooled (like I was) that the trails will connect easily or seamlessly as you go from one to another.\nI tested out three of the area's trails: the Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor trail, Palmer Township Recreation Trail and Tatamy Trail.\nI rode my Trek mountain bike, but happily found I could have used a road bike on the paved Palmer Township and Tatamy trails.\n \n11.2 miles from Freemansburg to Wy Hit Tuk Park \nThis is the easiest to find and travel upon thanks to signature signage and distinctive D&L mile markers along the route.\nADDISON GEORGE / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL Sarah D’Alessio and 4-year-old daughter, Mackenzie, walk the Riverview Park section of the D&L Trail.

The trail is almost completely flat, with a slight elevation decline from north to south and west to east. (ADDISON GEORGE / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) This trail is the gold standard for ease of use, thanks to detailed interactive maps on the D&L's website, www.delawareandlehigh.org . It's easy to find trailheads and know which direction you wish to go.\nYou can find trailheads to travel from Freemansburg to the Route 33 boat launch, or from Palmer Township's Riverview Park to Hugh Moore Park. If you want to go farther, you can continue from Hugh Moore Park to the Forks of the Delaware, and from there to Wy Hit Tuk Park in Williams Township.\nThese are all portions of a historic pathway that carried coal and iron from Wilkes-Barre to Philadelphia. The Delaware & Lehigh National Heritage Corridor trail, some of which is still under repair or development, will eventually run from the Seven Tubs area near Wilkes-Barre to Bristol, Bucks County.\nIn the Easton region, the section from Freemansburg to Wy Hit Tuk Park is 11.2 miles. But with the number of well-marked trailheads along the way, it's pretty easy to go as far or as close as you want.\nThe trail is almost completely flat, with a slight elevation decline from north to south and west to east, The surface is mostly crushed limestone; some portions near the Palmer Township trail are paved.\nPalmer Township Recreation Trail \n7.8 miles horseshoe trail, out and back \nThis paved trail, which makes its way through Palmer and Bethlehem townships is relatively easy to find. But it can be confusing at the starting point if you're getting on it at Easton's Riverview Park.\nHere's some advice: When you start, keep heading into the park along the paved portion of the D&L. When you see a parking area straight and to the left, stay to the right on a slight uphill climb for about the next two miles. The Lehigh River is well below the trail, not alongside it. Just after the trail makes a gentle near-180-degree turn back and to the north, you pass a gate at the back of St. Luke's Anderson Campus.\nThis trail isn't well marked along the way, and it took a few tries to get someone willing to stop to help with directions. There are several offshoots along the horseshoe-style out-and-back trail that aren't marked but that are used by those familiar with the trail. If you're new to it, turn around when you reach 25th Street.\nAccording to the TrailLink website, www.traillink.com , the trail ends at 25th Street. But some of the veterans I spoke with said the trail extends beyond that busy road. I chose to explore that option, and the trail went downhill, around some businesses and eventually ended at a parking lot.\nIf you go that far and turn around, remember to turn left uphill after one of the businesses when you cross Freemansburg Avenue. Otherwise you will come out at a different crossing on 25th Street, facing Easton Area High School. (I made that mistake. I ended up retracing my route until I found the cutback going uphill.)\nIf you decide to exit Riverview Park on the paved trail, you are on the D&L. You'll cross a small iron bridge heading into Hugh Moore Park.\nTatamy Trail \n6.6 miles from West Easton to Tatamy \nThere are several trailheads to enter this paved pathway. The hardest to locate, by far, is the one that starts at Easton's Hackett Park and heads up to Tatamy. The key is to take the paved park road heading downhill from the stone gate. (If you go in the other direction and cross the road, you go behind a landscape dumping area on a downhill and access the short Wilson Trail to 25th Street.)\nOn the Tatamy Trail, you go mostly downhill on the Hackett Park section of the trail. Outside the park, you end up behind buildings owned by Crayola.\nI had a lovely shaded bike ride for about two miles along the Bushkill Creek until I hit the wide-open area after the scenic Penn Pump Park. The northern section of the trail passes both Keystone and Mill Race parks.\nThe Penn Pump, Keystone and Mill Race parks have relatively easy-to-find trailheads. There's another trailhead near the Crayola complex but I'd avoid that one because it's difficult to find.\n \nAll three of these trails have their good points. The D&L is by far the easiest to use because it offers near-flat terrain and well-marked access points.\nThe Palmer and Tatamy trails feature hills that probably aren't appropriate for younger children. Those two trails also have warnings at road crossings to dismount and walk your bike across. The warnings are there for good reason.\nAs running or walking trails, the Palmer and Tatamy paths are outstanding once you get used to their layout and learn to contend with the crossing roads.\ngary.blockus@mcall.com \nTwitter @gblockus \n610-820-6782", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:08:53.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
