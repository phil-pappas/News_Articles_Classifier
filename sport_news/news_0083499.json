The lanky speedster bowled in four short spells and got wickets in three of those spells.\nFor Vidarbha, Faiz Fazal (55) and Subramanium Badrinath (44) added 89 runs for the third wicket in 38.4 overs. While they steadied the innings from 16/2 after Wasim Jaffer (0) was run out without playing a ball.\nThe other important partnership was 71 for sixth wicket between Aditya Shanware (41) and Jitesh Sharma (35 batting).\nHowever, the day was about Ishant showing that he is a class apart from other bowlers. While fellow paceman Pradeep Sangwan (2/34) barely got the ball to bounce above shin, Ishant was getting it to rear awkwardly. Ganesh Sathish got one that bounced and the resultant slash was taken by Vaibhav Rawal at third slip.\nHis second wicket was well set Fazal, who gloved it to Mohit Ahlawat behind stumps as it kicked up from length.\nShanware at the end of the day got one that had shade extra bounce and moved away as Ahlawat took a simple catch. It was Jitesh, whose cheeky shots got the score moving after Vidarbha were stuck for better part of the day.\nBrief Scores:\nVidarbha 1st innings: 222 for 6 (Faiz Fazal 55, S Badrinath 44; Ishant Sharma 3/26) vs Delhi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:12:45.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
