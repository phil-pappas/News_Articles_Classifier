The lone loss was a second-place finish in the Sorrento Stakes at Del Mar to Songbird, one the leading contenders later this month for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies.\nPretty N Cool, with Martin Garcia aboard, set the pace after the early miscue, running six furlongs in 1:09.73 over the fast track.\n''We were confident,'' Baffert said. ''We knew going in she was doing really well, and six furlongs is her distance. She has a lot of quality.''\nIt was a rare Belmont starter for the California-based Baffert who made history at the track in June when American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes to end the 37-year Triple Crown drought.\nPretty N Cool, the 4-5 favorite, paid $3.80, $2.50 and $2.10.\nConstellation returned $3.30 and $2.50, and Tonasah paid $3.30 to show.\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing Martin Garcia Belmont Park Belmont Stakes   195/73864   154/1704   266/4545  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:09:54.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
