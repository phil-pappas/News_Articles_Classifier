The video — although the audio is unclear, making most of the conversation inaudible — purportedly shows Nitish Kumar sitting on a charpoy with the tantrik (faith healer). JD (U) candidate from Mokama, Neeraj Kumar, was also pictured. The tantrik, however, is believed to have been heard asking Kumar why he forged an alliance with Yadav. The tantrik, who is also believed to have said, \"Nitish Zindabad and Lalu Murdabad\", was later seen blessing and hugging Kumar. Quick to take advantage of development, BJP attacked both leaders. “Lalu Prasad had recently, while attacking Prime Minister, said he knows the formula to ward off evil forces. But before he could do so his younger brother (Nitish Kumar) reached a tantrik to get rid of Lalu Prasad,\" Union Minister of State Giriraj Singh told reporters. Asked about the video, Union Minister Arun Jaitley said: \"When the situation is bad, even 'tantra-mantra' does not help\". Asked why BJP was targeting Kumar when the saffron party leaders are often seen with 'babas', Jaitley retorted, \"Yes they are, but not to plot against their own associates\", a veiled reference to Nitish-Lalu rivalry. When a question was asked to RJD President Lalu Prasad about Kumar meeting the tantrik, Yadavd said he was not aware of the video, but quipped: \"I am a bigger tantrik than these tantriks.\" Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi said since voters have rejected Nitish Kumar and his grand secular alliance in the first two rounds of voting, Kumar is now making rounds of tantriks and faith healers to invoke divine blessings in the elections. Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi also attacked Kumar saying: \"He claims to be a socialist leader but promoting orthodox believes by visiting tantriks\".
