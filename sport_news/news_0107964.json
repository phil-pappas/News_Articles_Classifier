You can explain that you would like to invite them to dinner when your financial situation changes. Or better yet, you may volunteer your time and help out at the wedding with decorations, guest book, cleanup, etc. The gift of time is oftentimes more valuable than a material gift.\"\n— Jacqueline Whitmore , founder of The Protocol School of Palm Beach , a business etiquette consulting firm\n\"Your question creates the only appropriate response: If you're planning to be a guest at the wedding, then it is never appropriate to skip giving a gift! Your very presence implies your endorsement of the event, and it means that you should provide a present. Some couples request cash, but I think that's crass. If you hate shopping off a store registry, you can get creative. I've given small gold coins, with the wish that their life together be 'golden.' You could give a one-year subscription to a magazine you enjoy, or to a wine or beer club. Those gifts will continue to remind the couple of your good wishes.\n\"Even if you can't attend the ceremony for a good reason, you should send a gift — and better before the event than after.\n\"Now, if you're planning not to attend because you don't 'approve' of the match, you don't have to worry about a gift, even if you were invited.\"\n— Terry Savage , personal finance expert and co-author of \"The New Love Deal : Everything You Must Know Before Marrying, Moving In, or Moving On!\"\nSocial Graces is a weekly series asking two experts for advice on awkward situations.\nabowen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @byalisonbowen\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626686d/turbine/sc-social-graces-no-wedding-gift-family-1020-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:52:12.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
