And it ended just in time for New England to hold on for a victory. Brady overcame New England’s shaky first three quarters by throwing for a pair of touchdowns in the fourth quarter. The Super Bowl MVP completed 14 of 17 passes in the final quarter to overcome a 20-16 deficit and give New England (6-0) a two-game lead over the Jets in the AFC East. Brady was 34 of 54 for 355 yards overall, numbers that would have been even better if not for the 11 drops by his receivers, six by newly activated Brandon LaFell. The Jets (4-2) rallied in the final minute, kicking a field goal on first down with 23 seconds left to get within one score before Brandon Marshall recovered the onside kick. But after a short pass over the middle to Eric Decker left the Jets 37 yards away from tying the game, Marshall failed to get set on Ryan Fitzpatrick’s spike to stop the clock; the false-start penalty ended it. “I feel like we had them,” offensive lineman Willie Colon said. “I feel like we were the better team out there, but obviously we were not. ... They beat us fair and square.” Fitzpatrick completed 22 of 39 passes for 295 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Chris Ivory, who entered as the AFC’s leading rusher, was held to 41 yards on 17 carries. \nDolphins 44, Texans 26 \nMIAMI GARDENS, FLA. \nMiami became the first team since at least 1940 to score four offensive touchdowns of at least 50 yards in a half. The Dolphins led 41-0 at halftime, making the drubbing even more emphatic than a 38-10 win at Tennessee a week earlier in Dan Campbell’s debut as head coach. Now he’s the fifth interim coach of 26 since 2000 to win his first two games. Since the firing of Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, the Dolphins (3-3) have gone from notorious underachievers to contending for their first playoff berth since 2008. The Dolphins had been 0-7 previously against Houston (2-5). Miami’s four long scores in the first half were the most in at least 75 years, according to STATS. \nRaiders 37, Chargers 29 \nSAN DIEGO \nDerek Carr threw three touchdown passes, including a 52-yarder to Amari Cooper, and Oakland turned two interceptions of Philip Rivers into 10 points on their way to an easy victory over in what could be the last game of the AFC West rivalry played in San Diego. It was the first meeting of the Raiders (3-3) and Chargers (2-5) since their owners announced plans to build a $1.7 billion stadium in an industrial Los Angeles suburb if they can’t get new stadiums in their home markets. Coming off an open week, the Raiders looked quicker and more efficient. Cooper, the first-round draft pick out of Alabama, caught a short pass from Carr on an inside screen and raced through the defense to give Oakland a 30-3 lead just before halftime. \nJaguars 34, Bills 31 \nLONDON \nBlake Bortles threw a touchdown pass to Allen Hurns with 2:16 remaining and Jacksonville rallied in the game at Wembley Stadium. Bortles’ second TD pass of the game came a short time after Buffalo safety Corey Graham intercepted a pass and returned it 44 yards to put the Bills ahead. The Jaguars (2-5) won their first game in London after losing in each of the past two seasons at Wembley, the home of England’s national soccer team. The Bills (3-4) were playing in the British capital for the first time. \nNFC \nGiants 27, Cowboys 20 \nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \nDwayne Harris sped 100 yards with a kickoff return against his former Dallas teammates seconds after the Cowboys had tied the game, and New York moved atop the NFC East with a victory. Harris spent four seasons in Dallas without running back a kickoff for a score. But he tied a Giants record set in 1994 by romping untouched to the end zone. New York (4-3) snapped a five-game slide against Dallas (2-4) thanks to big plays by its defense and special teams. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions, returning one 58 yards for a touchdown. The Cowboys, losers of four in a row without injured offensive stars Tony Romo and Dez Bryant, got a big game from Darren McFadden. Starting running back Joseph Randle left early with a strained back, and McFadden rushed for 152 yards and a TD. \nRedskins 31, Buccaneers 30 \nLANDOVER, MD. \nKirk Cousins threw three second-half touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score with 24 seconds left, to lead Washington to the largest comeback in franchise history. Tampa Bay (2-4) was up 24-0 in the second quarter, before Cousins ran for an 8-yard TD to get Washington (3-4) on the board. Cousins hadn’t completed more than one TD pass in any game all season. But he got a pair of 3-yard scores in the third quarter, sandwiched around an onside kick, to make things interesting. Then, trailing 30-24, Washington got the ball at its 20 with a little less than 21/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Cousins capped the drive with a 6-yard TD toss to Jordan Reed. \nVikings 28, Lions 19 \nDETROIT \nTeddy Bridgewater threw for a season-high 316 yards and two touchdowns for Minnesota. Adrian Peterson rushed for 98 yards as the Vikings (4-2) won an NFC North game on the road for the first time in three years. The Lions (1-6) had an 11-point lead after Matthew Stafford threw TDs on their first two drives, but they blew it because they couldn’t protect the quarterback. Minnesota had a season-high seven sacks, which also was a season worst for Detroit. \nINTERCONFERENCE \nFalcons 10, Titans 7 \nNASHVILLE \nMatt Ryan threw for 251 yards and a touchdown pass, and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards. The Falcons (6-1) bounced back from their first loss by grinding out a road win and overcoming two interceptions. Freeman notched his third consecutive game with at least 100 yards, and Atlanta outgained Tennessee 378-256. The banged-up Titans (1-5) lost their fifth straight overall. They played without rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was replaced by Zach Mettenberger — intercepted by safety Robenson Therezie with 1:31 left to seal the win. \nSaints 27, Colts 21 \nINDIANAPOLIS \nDrew Brees threw for 255 yards and one touchdown, Khiry Robinson ran for two scores and New Orleans held on for the victory. New Orleans (3-4) has won three of its past four. Indy (3-4) still leads the AFC South despite losing its second straight. Brees finished 28 of 44 and was helped by a running game led by Mark Ingram, who ran for 143 yards and one score as New Orleans took a 27-0 lead. Andrew Luck threw TD passes of 87 and 46 yards to T.Y. Hilton, and an 8-yard TD pass to Donte Moncrief with 3:46 left. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:18:56.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
