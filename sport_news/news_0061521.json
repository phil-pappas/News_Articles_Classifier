Here are your start/sits as you begin to shape your team for a playoff push.\nStart\nJimmy Graham , TE, Seattle Seahawks\nI know, it's a complete 180 from where I was last week but the world of fantasy football is ever-changing. Bottom line is that the Seattle Seahawks found some success in the passing game by feeding tight end Jimmy Graham. Sometimes you just have get the ball in the hands of a playmaker. If the Seahawks do it again, Graham should find success against a 49ers' defense that ranks dead last in the league for passing yards allowed per game at 306. Much like Eagles' running back DeMarco Murray who is seeing more production from an increased workload, Graham should return to fantasy superstardom with an increase in targets.\nLatavius Murray , RB, Oakland Raiders\nOakland running back Latavius Murray cooled down significantly after posting some big games in Weeks 2 and 3 of the season. After he posted 139 rushing yards and touchdowns on the Browns in Week 3, he followed it up with 49 rushing yards and 12 receiving yards (he was also involved in a couple turnovers) against the Chicago Bears. In Week 5, Murray had just 57 scrimmage yards against the Denver Broncos. On top of that, Murray has been dealing with a shoulder injury. But after a bye week and with the Raiders playing the Chargers, I'm predicting a bounce back week for Murray. The Chargers rank 29th in the league in terms of rushing yards allowed. They have allowed close to 133 yards per game in six games.\nAdvertisement John Brown , WR, Arizona Cardinals\nArizona wide receiver John Brown has only found the end zone twice this season but he hit pay dirt last week with 196 receiving yards in Pittsburgh . Brown has another plus matchup against the Baltimore Ravens who are allowing 286 passing yards a game. Expect Brown, quarterback Carson Palmer and the Cardinals to be more crisp this week after a surprising loss to the Steelers last Sunday.\nStefon Diggs , WR, Minnesota Vikings\nHere's a sleeper for the week that could make a good flex start. Wide receiver Stefon Diggs has been Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater's favorite target in their past two games. Diggs has posted a combined 216 passing yards in his two games against Denver and Kansas City. That first matchup is particularly impressive considering Denver has one of the best pass defenses in the league (Diggs posted 87 yards against the Broncos). In those two games, Diggs has been targeted an equal number of times as No.1 receiver Mike Wallace. Diggs could have long-term upside as Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer is no stranger to making position changes in midseason. Last year, receiver Charles Johnson replaced an ineffective Cordarrelle Patterson. This year Johnson has been ineffective, posting just 46 yards in three games. Diggs already has over four times the number of yards in two games this season. The one hindrance is that Diggs is playing in a run-first offense with Adrian Peterson in the mix. Hopefully that will set up the pass. Also, Diggs has a favorable matchup against Detroit this week.\nSit\nColin Kaepernick , QB, San Francisco 49ers\nWhile the Seattle Seahawks and the Legion of Boom are no longer the dominant, shutdown defense they once were, I expect the Hawks' familiarity with the 49ers and the tendencies of quarterback Colin Kaepernick to give them an edge. Kaepernick has been on a roll lately but that should come to an end as he has floundered against Seattle historically. Through six games against Seattle, Kaepernick has thrown two touchdowns and seven interceptions, averaging just under 200 passing yards per game. The Seahawks have kept \"Kap\" in check on the ground as well, limiting him to just 35 rushing yards in those six games. Anything could happen in a Thursday night divisional tilt, with Seattle trending down and San Francisco coming off a win, but I would look at other options at quarterback for Week 7.\nJoseph Randle , RB, Dallas Cowboys\nSitting running back Joseph Randle isn't so much an indictment of the Cowboys' matchup against the Giants (which is actually quite favorable) as it is of Randle who is in danger of losing his starting position. Averaging just 3.9 yards per carry for 291 yards on 74 carries isn't cutting it. Especially when you consider that Dallas has one of the best offensive lines in the league right now. Pro Football Focus ranked them first in run blocking prior to Week 5. Last year, former Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray was averaging 4.9 yards per carry and had a whopping 785 yards by the end of Week 6.\nJordan Matthews (81) of the Philadelphia Eagles carries the ball during the third quarter against the New York Giants at Lincoln Financial Field on October 19, 2015 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ( Rich Schultz, Getty Images ) I don't think the Cowboys truly considered Randle as anything more than a guy they would use in transition between Murray and their next starter. Proof is in the pudding as Randle's preseason battle with fellow running back Darren McFadden came down to the wire with Dallas never committing to a starter until way late in the preseason. Now, the Cowboys seem to be ready to move on from Randle and running back Christine Michael is the next man up. Randle is still the starter but I expect a big drop in production starting this week.\nIt should be noted that Cowboys' offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said Thursday not to anticipate \"big, huge changes for [Dallas] at this point at the running back position.\" However Michael's role should still increase. The news seems to bode well for Randle and Randle owners but remember, this is a story because of Randle's lack of production. Also, if he finds himself in a timeshare that would be detrimental to his status in fantasy.\nJordan Matthews , WR, Philadelphia Eagles\nEagles receiver Jordan Matthews is yet another testament to how crazy this year has been. Since Chip Kelly took the reins as the Eagles' head coach in 2013, the team's No.1 receiver has been a top-ten fantasy wideout. Desean Jackson was No.10 in 2013 and Jeremy Maclin ranked ninth last season. It stands to reason that the same would hold true this year for Jordan Matthews right? So far that hasn't been the case. Matthews has just one game where he eclipsed 100 yards receiving and just one score on the season. I don't think things will be any better this week as the Eagles travel to North Carolina to take on the undefeated Panthers. Matthews will probably see shutdown corner Josh Norman a bunch which doesn't bode well for his production. Norman has limited Brandin Cooks, Mike Evans and Allen Robinson to mediocre outings and will do the same to Matthews on primetime Sunday night. If the Eagles are smart they won't throw to Norman which means bad news for those who have Matthews in their lineups.\nJosh McCown , QB, Cleveland Browns\nBrowns quarterback Josh McCown has been one of the sweet surprises this fantasy season. McCown is top 15 quarterback this season despite missing a game. He's also put up the second-most fantasy points among quarterbacks in the last four weeks according to NFL.com. McCown ran into trouble in the form of the Denver defense last Sunday. He threw for 213 yards two touchdowns, two interceptions and lost a fumble. He'll see more trouble this week as the Browns head to St. Louis to face the Rams who have been brutal against quarterbacks this season. The Rams have limited the production of the opposing quarterbacks holding them to an average of 235 yards over the course of five games. Russell Wilson had 251 passing yards, 31 rushing yards, a touchdown and an interception against them in Week 1. Carson Palmer had 352 yards one touchdown and one interception against St. Louis in Week 4. Even Aaron Rodgers struggled against the Rams, throwing for 241 yards two touchdowns, two picks and lost fumble at home in Week 5.\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\nTom Brady , QB, New England Patriots\nThis week it's the unstoppable force against the immovable object as the 5-0 Patriots host the 4-1 Jets in Foxborough. Winner takes control of the AFC East division. The statistics are crazy for this one. The Patriots are second in the league for passing yards per game with 325. The Jets are second in the league for pass defense allowing 187 yards a game. Something's got to give and the weight lands on the shoulders of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Brady has been up and down against the Jets dating back to 2010. Generally speaking, he plays better at home which bodes well for this particular matchup. Brady has averaged 214 yards in his last four games against the Jets. He had five touchdowns and two interceptions during that time.\nHugh Johnson: 303-954-1037, hjohnson@denverpost.com or @HughJohnsonDP", "external_links": ["http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/2015/10/22/linehan-not-planning-big-changes-rb-michael%E2%80%99s-role-increase", "http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015101802/2015/REG6/cardinals@steelers#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000559946&tab=recap", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1022/20151022__jordan-matthews~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:03:06.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
