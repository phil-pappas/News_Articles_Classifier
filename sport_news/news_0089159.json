Prior to acquiring Jon Bostic this past week, Patrick Graham’s been working with four players on the active roster – Jerod Mayo, Jamie Collins, Dont’a Hightower and Jonthan Freeny – and two on the practice squad – Darius Fleming and Brandon King. Life as a coach in the NFL can be stressful, but for the Patriots linebackers coach, it's a little easier when you’re dealing with this group. “It’s a fun group to coach. I like these guys because they work hard,” Graham said. “They’re football players. They work on the field and off the field. It always makes your job a little bit easier when guys have the want to and put the team first. The biggest thing I would say is the mental-toughness element that they all have in terms of being able to deal with the daily grind and understanding that the No. 1 goal is to get better every day.” This season marks Graham’s seventh with Bill Belichick and the Patriots. The 36-year-old has climbed up the ranks, too. He started as a defensive coaching assistant in 2009 and has settled in as the linebackers coach after coaching the defensive line in 2012 and 2013. This past summer, Belichick gave Graham the keys to the defense by allowing him to call plays on the sideline during the team’s preseason finale against the Giants. Graham, like most assistants in the NFL, has career goals. And this coach certainly sounded like Belichick when asked about them. “My career aspirations? Get better every day, keep working on my craft, work hard and do what the heck coach tells you,” Graham said. “Nothing different for me as a coach as opposed to what we ask players to do. In terms of my focus since I was younger, a head coach told me that. He told me, ‘Pat, stop worrying about the other things. Just work on getting better at your craft.’ That’s what I’ve been doing for 14 years.” Graham has played a role in developing two of better young linebackers in the NFL, Collins and Hightower. They are first and second on the team in tackles, Collins with 22 and Hightower with 21. Collins’ development has been rapid. He didn’t have any sacks as a rookie, finished with four last season and through three games leads the Patriots with 3.5. Hightower has been a starter from day one with the Patriots, and finished last season with a career-high six sacks. This season, Collins has played 95 percent of the defensive snaps and Hightower has played 84.7 percent. The Patriots have brought along Mayo, who is coming off a knee injury that ended his 2014 season, slowly. He’s played in 21.8 percent of the snaps so far. “The goal for us as a group, and this comes from Bill, is to get better every day. I think those guys take it to heart,” Graham said. “All six of those guys, just working hard every day to get better. Keeping that in mind, we know we have a lot more to improve upon. As long as we keep that as a focus – getting better and working hard – we’ll be OK.” The coach’s impact goes beyond the starting players. Freeny’s only been on the team since this offseason and already he’s impressed by Graham. “He’s someone who is most definitely dedicated to what he does,” said Freeny. \"He’s always trying to find different ways to help us out, whether it’s little techniques or just things that he sees on film. Things that we could do to change up the way we’re doing things. He’s most definitely one of the most committed guys I’ve ever seen in football. Anytime you pretty much go into the linebacker room, he’s in there breaking down film. He’s a guy that loves the game and is very committed.\" As one would imagine, Graham said one of his biggest helpers has been Belichick, who is often regarded as a defensive genius. Graham’s learned a lot throughout the past seven seasons and continues to do so. “It’s a great experience for me to be underneath a head coach who’s so knowledgeable about the game and is very good to us as coaches,” Graham said. “It’s been a great experience for me. I can’t complain about it. I’m just continuing to learn from him every day. I’ve been here for seven years and I’m still learning.” You could see a little of Belichick in him, too, this past week. When asked about his experience calling all the defensive plays against the Giants and what it meant to him, Graham smiled before answering. “I’m on to Dallas,” he said.
