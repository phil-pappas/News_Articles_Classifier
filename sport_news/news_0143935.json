(AP) _ Former NFL star Irving Fryar has been sentenced to five years in a New Jersey prison for his role in a mortgage scam. \nHis mother, Allene McGhee, also was sentenced to three years' probation. \nFryar and his mother were convicted in August of applying for multiple mortgage loans in quick succession while using the same property as collateral. \nFryar claimed he was the victim of a con artist who told him to carry out the scheme. \nThe 53-year-old Fryar was a star at New Jersey's Rancocas Valley High School before making his name as a wide receiver at the University of Nebraska and as an NFL player for the New England Patriots, the Miami Dolphins, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins.
