He was 12-7 with a 3.51 ERA in 24 starts this year and lost to Houston in the AL wild-card game.\nTanaka was on the disabled list from April 23 to June 3 with right wrist tendinitis and a forearm strain, then missed a September start because of a strained right hamstring.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
