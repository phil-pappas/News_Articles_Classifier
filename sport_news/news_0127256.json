Plus, the Colts and Jets, who are the Patriots’ opponents in Weeks 6 and 7, most recently started backups Matt Hasselbeck and Ryan Fitzpatrick. They’ll make way for Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill and Redskins signal caller Kirk Cousins. And before this, the Pats saw Tyrod Taylor and Blake Bortles.\nThere are murderers’ rows. Then there are guys who get busted going 56 in a 55 mph zone.\n“They might not be the top tier, but they’re still quarterbacks who can make throws,” Pats safety Duron Harmon said. “If you look at Weeden, his last possession of the New Orleans game, he led them down there and made great throws. That touchdown (to Terrance Williams) was one heck of a throw, and you can see he has the ability to make those types of throws. All you can do is prepare like you’ve been preparing for any other quarterback. I think what separates the great players from the good is everybody is (treated) the same. It doesn’t matter who we’re playing.”\nThe Patriots drew Ben Roethlisberger in Week 1, and visit the Manning brothers in Weeks 10 (Eli, Giants) and 12 (Peyton, Broncos). Obviously, they could still land injured Andrew Luck next week at Lucas Oil Stadium.\nAside from that, there’s nothing that replicates the six-game stretch they encountered last season with Jay Cutler, Peyton Manning, Luck, Matthew Stafford, Aaron Rodgers and Philip Rivers. Then again, that was also Weeks 8-14, when the Patriots defense had hit its stride and was ready for the challenge.\nNow, the Pats are in the process of trying to lock down their identity, so they care more about their defense’s development than the quarterback on the other side.\n“When it’s later in the season, you have a ton of games to go off of what you’re doing and how you’re playing, and I think you’ve got a rhythm for everybody,” safety Devin McCourty said. “For us, it’s only our fourth game. We haven’t been out there a lot to just know what we’re doing and know exactly where everyone is going. It’s still a work in progress. We’re still trying to get better to get to that point where we were at during that stretch toward the end of the season.”\nThe defending Super Bowl champs know their season won’t be defined by anything that happens shy of the New Year, so they aren’t worried about style points at the moment. Naturally, it’s easy to wonder how much they benefited last season by that daunting stretch, but it’s not like the Patriots can order up a healthy Romo or Luck, or request a scrimmage with Rodgers or Cam Newton.\nSo the Pats will focus on Weeden’s best work. Yeah, he has a 10-game losing streak dating back to 2012, but he caught their attention by completing five of his last seven passes for 91 yards and a beautiful 17-yard, game-tying touchdown on fourth down in his last series against the Saints.\nFor a team that compartmentalizes as well as Bill Belichick’s Patriots, that’s all they needed to take Weeden seriously.\n“At some point this season, we’re going to play teams and quarterbacks who are really good and on top of their game,” McCourty said. “This week is a guy that hasn’t had a ton of reps with the starters, but you see him make more and more plays each week. I think that was evident in the Saints game where a lot of people probably counted him out with a two-minute drive when they needed to score, and he marched them down the field.\n“That’s what it comes down to, no matter how big your name is, it’s what you do in that particular game, so we’ve got to prepare and be ready for Weeden.”\nThe Patriots have also pointed toward Weeden’s first start in Week 3, when the Cowboys built a pair of two-touchdown leads against the Falcons before tumbling down the stretch. Weeden isn’t a high-profile quarterback, but the Patriots have treated him like a superstar this week.\nThat’s how they’ll continue to prepare for this stretch.\n“We don’t look at Weeden as a backup quarterback,” safety Patrick Chung said. “He’s a starter. He can play. He can go out there and play. You can’t look into all that stuff like that.\n“Just go in there and watch the film like he’s a starter, an All-Pro and go play some ball.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:47:00.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
