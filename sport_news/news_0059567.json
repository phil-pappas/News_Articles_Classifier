The junior had six catches for 82 yards and a touchdown has 104 catches in his career. WR Hasaan Henderson also went over 100 catches in his Nevada career after hauling in a season-high eight balls for 112 yards. Henderson, a junior, has 107 catches in his career. \n* QB Tyler Stewart completed a career-high 25-of-41 passes for a career-best 287 yards and two touchdowns. Stewart’s previous career best was 206 yards earlier this season against Arizona. This was the fourth multi-touchdown passing game of his career and his second straight multi-touchdown game. \n* WR Wyatt Demps , a sophomore, set career highs in receptions (six) and yards (53). Wolf Pack grades: Lots of Cs lead to an L \n* LB Jordan Dobrich led the Wolf Pack in tackles for the second straight game. He posted 12 tackles in last week’s win over New Mexico and had 13 in the loss to Wyoming. Those were the most tackles he’s had a single game since posting 16 against Air Force last year. Dobrich has 45 tackles in six games. \n* Former Nevada player Jacob Hollister had a nice game for Wyoming. Hollister began his college career as a walk-on quarterback for the Wolf Pack in 2012. He spent 2013 at a junior college before becoming a scholarship player for Wyoming last season. Hollister, now a tight end, caught three passes for 36 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown pass. He is second among MW tight ends with 18 receptions. \n* Wyoming RB Brian Hill rushed for 188 yards on a career-high 33 carries. Hill, who entered the game fifth in the nation in rushing yards, hit the 100-yard mark for the ninth time in his last 12 games. Hill is just 15 yards shy of 1,000 on the season. \n* OGs Ziad Damanhoury and Daren Echeveria both started for the second straight game in place of the injured Jeremy Macauley (knee), Joey Angelmire (knee) and Adam Khouri (concussion). Macauley, who was injured on Oct. 3 against UNLV, traveled and dressed for the game but did not play. Echeveria was flagged for a chop block and a false start. Nevada was held more than 100 yards under its season rushing average (118 on 30 carries) and allowed just one sack, on Nevada’s final play of the game. \n* OLB L.J. Jackson got his second straight start in place of Bryan Lane Jr. (ankle). Lane, who missed last week’s game, did get on the field and split time with Jackson. Both players had four tackles. \n* K Brent Zuzo , who had made his first seven field-goal attempts this season, missed his only attempt Saturday, a 52-yarder in the second quarter that had plenty of distance but went wide right. \n*After being flagged for just one penalty last week, Nevada was penalized five times for 41 yards. Wyoming, which also had just one penalty last week, was penalized seven times for 71 yards. \n* Nevada trailed 21-7 at halftime, matching its largest halftime deficit of the season. The Pack is 5-14 all-time under coach Brian Polian when trailing at halftime, including 0-4 this season. Nevada is 2-4 this year when the opponent scores first. Nevada hasn’t scored on its opening drive since the season opener. \n* For the first time this season, Wyoming’s offensive line held an opponent without a sack. The Cowboys had allowed 19 sacks in its first six games. Nevada also was held without a tackle for loss on Wyoming’s 51 rushing attempts. The Wolf Pack’s previous low in tackles for loss was three in a win at Buffalo. The Wolf Pack also had zero pass breakups and didn’t force a turnover for the first time since its opener. \n* Nevada fell to 3-3 all-time against Wyoming, including a 1-2 mark in Laramie. The Wolf Pack is 5-3 in its last eight road games and 1-2 on the road this season. \n* The Wolf Pack was outrushed, 272-118, and fell to 2-16 under Polian when being outrushed. \n* Wyoming won the coin toss and elected to defer, giving the ball to Nevada to open the game. 3 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1ROVEWb TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:03:30.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
