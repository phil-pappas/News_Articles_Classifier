Liam Haining, 15, finished first in 20 minutes and 16 seconds, while Robyn Walker-Spencer, 13, was the first female finisher in 24:05. Both are Rockport residents. \nThe event, open to all ages, was part of the school's homecoming festivities. \nThe event raised money to help develop a new 5K course on the school campus. \nFor more information, call coach Helen Bonzi at 207-236-3384 or email her hbonzi@mac.com. \nThe race was held on the current cross-country course. The course circles around playing fields and into the woods between the high school and Ashwood school, finally ending on the track in front of the new bleachers. \n\"The runners enjoyed being able to race on the trails rather than on the roads, giving this race a totally different feel and atmosphere,\" Bonzi said. \nThe individual 5K results were: 1, Liam Haining, 15, Rockport; 2, Nick Denny, 17, Rockport, 23:17; 4, Nick Greer, 17, Camden, 23:54; 4, Kyle Weaver, 26, Camden, 24:00; 5, Robyn Walker-Spencer, 13, Rockport, 24:05; 6, Chris Walker-Spencer, 41, Rockport, 24:05; 7, William Jurek, 12, Camden, 24:11; 8, Jean Pitcairn, 50, Lincolnville, 24:21; 9, Sadie Laughlin, 46, Camden, 24:22; 10, Kate Walker-Spencer, 11, Rockport, 24:58; 11, Tor Denny, 12, Rockport, 26:19; 12, Harold Vanlonkhuyzen, 52, Rockport, 27:01; 13, Lynn Tesseyman, 36, Camden, 28:51; 14, Bridget Mellon, 17, Camden, 29:50; 15, Iris Luce, 13, Camden, 30:22; 16, Greta Bishop, 13, Camden, 30:23; 17, Audrey Bowman, 13, Camden, 30:23; 18, Meredith Luce, 13, Camden, 30:23; 19, Pearl Benjamin, 14, Camden, 30:23; 20, Ellen Spring, 62, Thomaston, 33:46; 21, Matthew Dailey, 46, Camden, 36:16; 22, Maureen Morse, 46, Rockport, 37:44; 23, Jean Payne, 56, Camden, 45:04; 24, Liz Sullivan, 48, Appleton, 45:08; 25, Maureen Haining, 55, Rockport, 45:09.
