The event, which was to have been held on Saturday and Sunday, has now been pushed back to Sunday in order to modify jumps and other parts of the course. Rio organizers said athletes complained about the course and made test runs on Friday before deciding it was unsafe and needed to be changed. The event is expected to feature many of the world's top riders and will be run on a course built in northern Rio designed by Tom Ritzenthaler . He also designed the courses for the last two Olympics in Beijing and London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:13:46.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
