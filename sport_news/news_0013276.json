However, we expect the earnings trajectory to improve going forward and investors should continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of our economy. Below are a few simple rules for investors to follow to avoid getting their fingers burnt in this global turmoil. Firstly, one should not try to time the market as volatile movements in stock prices could result in huge losses if caught on the wrong side of the trade. Instead, we suggest the recent correction in the market should be taken as an opportunity to enter the market on a long-term basis, ideally with a horizon of 2-3 years, which should likely give them favourable returns. Given the current economic scenario, we see equity as the best asset class to create wealth over the coming years. Diversification remains the key to tackle market volatility. The investment portfolio should not be restricted to a limited number of stocks, but should be spread across appropriately, without excessive exposure to small cap stocks as they tend to be more volatile. Holdings should preferably be diversified across large, mid and small-cap companies, as this will help increase the risk adjusted return for the investor. Similarly, sector-wise diversification should also be followed to mitigate risk; adequate exposure to defensive sector stocks like in the pharma and FMCG space, among others, is advisable. Investors can also follow the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) style of investing to accumulate quality stocks from a longer term investment horizon. This will bring down the average cost of purchase and protect against volatility in the stock price. Investors should also avoid leveraged positions as it could magnify losses and wipe out the invested principal. A lot of investors get attracted to the lure of making quick money in the market and end up getting trapped in bad stocks. One should avoid trading on unreliable tips and rather trade on the basis of sound advice based on in-depth research. It would be advisable to exercise caution while investing in stocks and choose sectors that hold promise. Among such sectors, stocks with a reliable business model, better anticipated sales growth, sustainable operating margin and cash flow generation, attractive ROE and ROCE and the ones trading at lower PEs compared to peers, should be preferred, which gives a margin of safety. Lastly, investors should not panic when markets turn volatile and cash-out of quality stocks. They should remain confident and keep the bigger picture in mind. As long as the long-term fundamentals of the investment remain intact, one should not get nervous about a small correction in the short term. Following these basic investment rules, investors can outperform all other asset classes and achieve their financial goals and objectives.
