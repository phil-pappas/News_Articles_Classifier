The ensuing kickoff went for a touchback, so the clock never should have started. Instead, it rolled down, and by the time Pittsburgh lined up for the first play of its crucial drive, only 2:38 remained. \nAs it turns out, the Steelers managed to make it all the way downfield in time to score the go-ahead points on the final play from scrimmage, a 1-yard TD run by Le'Veon Bell. So, not surprisingly, Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin's take, essentially, was: All's well that ends well. Advertisement \n\"It didn't define the outcome of the game,\" Tomlin said Tuesday, \"so I'm moving on with my work week.\" \nThe truth is, of course, there really is no way to know how the outcome of the game could have been different had those extra 18 seconds not been \"lost.\" Perhaps San Diego would have been left with enough time for a play or two -- or a kickoff return for a TD. Or perhaps Pittsburgh would have called things differently on offense with more room on the clock, maybe running time down to nothing, anyway. \nWho knows? \nSignora's statement noted: \"The performance of the clock operator and game officials will be reviewed per the standard procedure for reviewing every play of every game.\" \nEach game-clock operator is hired by the league, not the home team, and lives near the stadium hosting a regular-season game. In the playoffs, the league uses operator who don't live in the area. \n\"We proceed with the assumption,\" Tomlin said, \"the clock is going to be managed properly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:18:10.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
