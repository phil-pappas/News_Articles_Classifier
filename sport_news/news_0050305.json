And he's not.\"\nStoner has never denied the hunt, which sparked debate two years ago when pictures published in a Vancouver newspaper showed him holding a grizzly's severed head.\nStoner, who is from Port McNeill on Vancouver Island, defended his hunting trip with his father, an uncle and a friend after the photos were publicized.\n\"I grew up hunting and fishing in British Columbia and continue to enjoy spending time with my family outdoors,\" he said in a September 2013 written statement, adding he would continue those activities in the province.\nStoner should apologize for hunting bears, said Murray, her voice choked with emotion.\n\"I'm hoping they slap a very big fine, and he could also contribute to conservation in this province, big time.\"\nStoner was not in court Friday. Ricky Bal, a lawyer who appeared on his behalf, said he does not know how the hockey player intends to plead.\nThe case was put over until Nov. 13.\nThe Anaheim Ducks begin their regular season Saturday in San Jose against the Sharks.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:19:26.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
