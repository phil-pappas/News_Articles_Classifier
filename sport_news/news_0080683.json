Mandatory Credit: Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports LeSean McCoy said he plans to be in uniform and on the field for Sunday’s showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, specifically citing that the importance of the game for the Buffalo Bills as the main reason.\nAdChoices “I look forward to playing, ” McCoy said, via the Buffalo News .\nThe Bills listed McCoy as probable on the team’s final injury report, although it’s unclear how much of a role McCoy will play on Sunday.\n“We’ll see what happens,” he said. “But I’m out there. When my number’s called, I’m going to be out there. Looking to make plays.”\n“It’s a big one,” McCoy said, via the Buffalo News . “A lot of guys are banged up. Maybe get a big win here, get one more. Go into the bye week and have some time to get healthy. Full week of no running and just treatments. So that’s the mindset. Hurt or not, we need this win. So I’m out there for my teammates.”\nAfter trying to battle through a lingering hamstring injury during the first three weeks of the season, McCoy indicated he wouldn’t return until he was 100 percent. He acknowledged Friday he’s not yet fully recovered from the injury, meaning he’s obviously reconsidered his stance.\n“I’ve been in the league enough to know when I can go and I can’t go,” he said. “I feel like I’m healthy enough to go out there and perform. This is about being comfortable. I think when you’re not comfortable, and you’re no 100 percent, or not nearly close to 100 percent, you let your team down. I feel like this is a different situation. I feel a lot better. And I’m ready to go out there and play.”\nOn said gimpy hamstring, McCoy carried the ball 43 times for 46 yards, a 3.4 yard average. He also caught seven balls out of the backfield for 83 yards and a touchdown.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/10/16/bills-rb-lesean-mccoy-ready-to-return-on-sunday/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/10/16/lesean-mccoy-on-returning-hurt-or-not-we-need-this-win/"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:46:20.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
