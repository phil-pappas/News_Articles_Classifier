Baylor is the best of the bunch by a large margin, piling up 720 total yards and 64 points a game. \nOnly halfway through the regular season for 6-0 Baylor, Corey Coleman already has a school-record 16 touchdown catches. Seth Russell leads the FBS with his 27 touchdown receptions and Shock Linwood leads the Big 12 with 134 yards rushing per game. \nThe Bears have an FBS-best 19-game home winning streak. They won 62-38 last week over West Virginia, the only team to beat them in the regular season last year. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
