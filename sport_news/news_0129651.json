The Jaguars are a member of the NCAA Division I FCS Southwestern Athletic Conference, which is made up of historically black universities. The school is perhaps most noted for its marching band, widely considered among the best in the nation. Head coach Dawson Odums: Crest High School Class of 1992 Wide receivers coach Chris Coleman: Crest H.S. 1995 Defensive back Rhaheim Ledbetter: Crest H.S. 2012 Defensive back Demerio Houston: Shelby H.S. 2015 Sept. 5 at Louisiana Tech L 15-62 Sept. 10 at Mississippi Valley State* W 50-13 Sept. 19 Jackson State* W 50-31 Sept. 26 at Georgia L 6-48 Oct. 10 at Alabama State* Oct. 17 Prairie View A&M* Oct. 24 at Texas Southern* Oct. 31 Alcorn State* Nov. 7 at Arkansas-Pine Bluff* Nov. 14 Alabama A&M* Nov. 28 Grambling State* *Conference game Although a chance to visit Shelby comes around only about once a year, Dawson Odums still keeps his hometown near and dear to his heart. Head football coach at Southern University in Baton Rouge, La., Odums especially keeps a finger on the pulse of Cleveland County high school football. He tracks the scores. He knows when games are rained out. He knows when the big games are coming up. More importantly, he knows the people. Even as he works 750 miles from the place of his childhood, Odums surrounds himself with Cleveland County people whenever possible. Case in point: three years ago, he hired fellow Crest High graduate Chris Coleman as his wide receivers coach. “I was just raised that when you get an opportunity to help others, you always try to reach back home and make a difference in other people’s lives,” Odums said. “I was blessed to become the head coach, so I wanted to find out who was coaching in my hometown and try to raise somebody up to the next level, so I did that with Chris Coleman.” The Shelby connection at Southern doesn’t end there. Crest product Rhaheim Ledbetter, formerly at Florida, is on the roster as a defensive back, though currently ineligible. And Shelby High School graduate Demerio Houston is starting for the Jaguars at defensive back as a true freshman. That adds up to a remarkable four Shelby products representing this small school that most Cleveland County residents had probably never heard of. The cluster of Shelby-area folks is certainly no coincidence. “I’m going to always recruit that area no matter where I go as a coach,” Odums said. “They play great football there. I know a lot of people there. And I owe it to that community and those folks back home in Cleveland County to try to help make a difference in young men’s lives.” Odums was promoted from defensive coordinator to interim head coach two games into the 2012 season and then had the interim tag removed for the following year. It was in 2013 that Odums became only the second coach in school history to accomplish three things in his first full season as head coach: win the Southwestern Athletic Conference West title, win the SWAC championship and earn SWAC Coach of the Year honors. The Jaguars won another SWAC West title last year and are 2-0 in league action this season. A three-year starter at defensive lineman for N.C. Central, Odums began his coaching career at his alma mater Crest, where he had graduated in 1992. He made stops at Gardner-Webb, Georgia Southern, Clark Atlanta and N.C. A&T before arriving in Baton Rouge. After being elevated to head coach, Odums reached out to Coleman, who came three years behind him at Crest and helped the Chargers win a state title in 1994. Page 2 of 3 - “He kept up with me throughout my playing time and continued to keep up with me as a coach,” said Coleman, who played wide receiver at N.C. State and for the NFL’s Tennessee Titans for two seasons. “When things kind of developed and he had an opportunity to be a head coach, I was one of the first guys he called to come in and coach the receivers.” Coleman previously spent three seasons at Lenoir-Rhyne University in Hickory, helping the Bears win two consecutive South Atlantic Conference championships. Coleman’s ultimate goal is to coach in the NFL one day. For now, he’s helping a potent Southern offense that has scored 50 points in two of its four games. When it comes to the Shelby connection on the Southern roster, Coleman is careful to guard against showing bias toward those players. “It’s a real special bond with those guys, obviously wanting those guys to do well being from our hometown, but we give those guys the same opportunity we give everybody else,” Coleman said. “At the end of it, they have to step up and make plays, and if they make enough plays, then we can use them on Saturdays.” The Jaguars have been getting big plays from Houston, who leads the team with four passes broken up and also has one interception to his name. The 5-foot-11, 150-pound Houston is starting at cornerback in his first collegiate season after helping Shelby High to back-to-back state championships. Houston led Shelby in interceptions each of his final two seasons (13 in 2014 and seven in 2013). “Demerio is a great athlete,” cornerbacks coach Chris Scott said. “He came in early this summer and he’s been working hard this whole summer. … He wants to come here and be great and I’m going to make sure I coach him up to be great.” Odums uses the word “special” to describe Houston, the nephew of the Harbison brothers David, Charlie, Herbert and James. “That family is some of the greatest athletes to ever come through Cleveland County, so these genes are passed on to him and I’m excited to be his coach,” Odums said. “I think he’s going to be a fantastic football player.” Houston wasn’t available to interview for this story because the Southern coaching staff doesn’t permit freshmen to speak with the media. The Cleveland County guys are hoping to continue a strong run for a Southern program looking for its third consecutive SWAC championship berth. The Jaguars are 2-0 in the conference (2-2 overall with non-conference losses to Louisiana Tech and Georgia), and the schedule is nothing but league games the rest of the way. Page 3 of 3 - “We’ve got to stay healthy, we’ve got to get lucky, but we’ve got to prepare the right way to win,” Odums said. “It’s about mindset. I think if we get the right mindset, this football team is as good as anybody in our conference. They’re a joy to coach.” By Phil Gardner", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:13:00.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
