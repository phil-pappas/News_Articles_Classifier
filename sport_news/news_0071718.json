Unfortunately for the Badgers , they didn't score again and gave up four unanswered goals, losing 4-1 to No. 6 Boston University on Saturday night. \nOn Friday night, Wisconsin (0-2-2) allowed a goal 12 seconds into the game in its loss to Boston College, but Adam Rockwood made sure the Badgers jumped out ahead against BU. His tally 1:22 into the first period was his first goal in 12 games, giving Wisconsin the 1-0 lead. \nBut the Terriers (1-1-0) scored twice in the second period, including a power-play goal by Brandon Fortunato at the 9:04 mark that gave them the lead for good. Boston University added two more goals in the third period, both coming with less than 10 minutes left to play. \nWisconsin freshman goalie Matt Jurusik, after a rough night against Boston College, made a career-high 40 saves in the second start of his career. The 40 saves were a career high and the most by a freshman since Joel Rumpel's 39 in 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:53:04.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
