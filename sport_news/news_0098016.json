Certainly, it was one of the most important because it helped the New York Giants win Game 1 of the 1954 World Series against the Cleveland Indians.\nThe Giants went on to a stunning sweep of a Cleveland team that had gone 111-43 in the regular season.\n\"The Catch\" of Vic Wertz's long line drive to center field is one of the many great, important plays made by the other team in Cleveland's championship drought that now has reached 67 years for the Indians (and 51 years for the city overall).\nThe late Indians pitching legend Bob Feller never disputed Mays made a sensational play, but disagreed with historians about where the catch ranked in Mays' Hall of Fame career.\n\"They say that was the best catch in baseball history. It was a great catch, but I saw Willie make even better ones in spring training,'' Feller told Plain Dealer columnist Terry Pluto.\nNew York Giants centerfielder Willie Mays makes a spectacular over-the-shoulder catch of a long ball hit by Cleveland Indians batter Vic Wertz at the base of the outfield wall, then spins and relays the ball to the infield in the first game of the 1954 World Series in New York, Sept. 29, 1954. (AP Photo/file) Tim Warsinskey, The Plain Dealer The score was tied, 2-2, in the top of the eighth when Mays made the play, sprinting with his back to the plate toward the wall at the Polo Grounds, which had one of the largest outfields in the country. Wertz's blast, which traveled nearly 450 feet, would have been a home run or off the wall in just about any other park.\nHad Mays not made the play, at least one run would have scored. The Giants won, 5-2, in 10 innings.\nIn a 2010 biography, \"Willie Mays: The Life, The Legend,\" author James S. Hirsch set up the play thusly:\n\"Two on, nobody out, and Vic Wertz was the batter.\n\"Mays was cheating in. Hitters tended to pound (relief pitcher) Don Liddle's curveball into the ground, and Mays wanted to cut down the runner at the plate on a single. He was shading him to right and assumed that Wertz, like most hitters, would be swinging at the reliever's first pitch. Wertz indeed swung but missed, and Liddle was soon ahead in the count: one ball, two strikes. Wertz guessed he would see a high, tight fastball,\n\"Liddle threw his fastball but aimed it poorly. The ball stayed over the plate, almost at the shoulders. Wertz extended his thick arms, rotated his wrists, and hit the ball squarely. Ball game, thought Roger Kahn, who was standing in the lower deck between third and home.\nWertz thought so too as he watched his blazing line drive sail just to the right of second base. He put his head down and began pumping his stubby legs, confident he would end up on second or third or, if the center fielder misplayed it, all the way back at home.\nIn his 1999 baseball memoir \"Our Tribe,'' Pluto wrote of the play:\n\"It seemed like Mays ran about 400 miles to track it down. He just turned his back to the plate and was gone, not even looking at the ball. To most fans, there was no reason to expect Mays to even make that catch.''\nThe Catch was just part of the play.\nWith Al Rosen on first and Larry Doby on second and no outs, Mays made a stunning throw to keep Doby from scoring from second after tagging and reaching third.\nMays whirled and threw \"like some olden statue of a Greek javelin hurler, his head twisted away to the left as his right arm swept out and around. His hat flew off in perfect sync with the corkscrew motion, and it was the throw of a giant, the throw of a howitzer made human, arriving at second base – just as Larry Doby was pulling into third and as Al Rosen was scampering back to first,'' wrote Mays biographer Arnold Hano in his 2004 book \"A Day in the Bleachers\" about the 1954 World Series.\nHistoric date continues: October 2 isn't all bad in Indians playoff history, however.\nThe Indians are 2-2 on Oct. 2.\nThey lost to Baltimore, 7-4, in a 1996 American League Division Series sweep by the Orioles.\nWith Jaret Wright making his postseason debut, Cleveland beat the Yankees, 7-5 in 1997, and went on to win the Division Series. They lost to the Marlins in the World Series that year.\nIn 1998, the Indians hit four solo home runs – two by Manny Ramirez – to beat the Red Sox, 4-3, in Game 3 of a Division Series they would win, 3 games to 1.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7dK6zPbkFnE", "http://www.grayco.com/cleveland/books/2871X/index.shtml", "https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/arnold-hano/a-day-in-the-bleachers/", "http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4939095http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4939095"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:21:21.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
