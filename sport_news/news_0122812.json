The Tigers’ drive stalled and on fourth down, Domingue took a backward pass on the left side and raced untouched to the end zone and the Tigers’ defense held the rest of the way. \nFlorida (6-1, 4-1 SEC) got on the board first after a muffed punt gave the Gators the ball at the LSU 13 yard line. Florida quarterback Treon Harris hit Jake McGee with a four yard pass to give the Gators a 7-0 lead. \nBut LSU (6-0, 4-0) had a big second quarter, scoring 21 unanswered points on touchdown runs of two and four yards by Fournette and a nine yard pass from Brandon Harris to Malachi Dupre. Florida answered back as Harris hit McGee again for a 19 yard strike, but LSU’s Harris found Dupre again for a 50 yard score with just 15 seconds remaining in the half as the Tigers took a 28-14 lead into the locker room. \nKelvin Taylor scored on a two yard run, capping a 66 yard drive in the third quarter as Florida cut the lead to seven, and Callaway tied it with the long punt return. \nFlorida failed to score on its final three possessions. \nBrandon Harris had a solid night for LSU, completing 13-19 passes for 202 yards and the two touchdowns to Dupre. Treon Harris was 17-32 for 271 yards and two scores. \nLSU wound up with 423 yards compared to 326 for Florida. The Tigers’ defense held the Gators to just 55 yards rushing on 31 attempts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:53:19.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
