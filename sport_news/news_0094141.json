Villaruel   18, 2015 - 12:00am \nCARSON CITY, California — Another historic moment unfolds in Philippine sports as two-division world champion Donnie 'Ahas' Nietes and celebrated brothers 'Prince' Albert and Jason 'El Niño' Pagara take centerstage in the ground-breaking Pinoy Pride event in the United States set to take place Saturday night (Sunday morning Philippine time) at the StubHub Center here. \nThe seven-bout show spearheaded by ALA Promotions in association with ABS-CBN Sports and The Filipino Chanel is indeed a feat in itself for the Filipinos being the first ever Philippine-based promotional company to put up a major card in the lucrative US boxing market. \n\"It wasn't easy for us to do this. The process was very painstaking,\" said ALA Promotions President and CEO Michael P. Aldeguer. \"But we made it happen. This is something big for Philippines boxing, something that we should all be proud of.\" \nFighting for the first time on US soil, the 33-year-old Nietes (36-1-4, 21KOs) vows to make an impression as he defends his WBO and The Ring light flyweight belt against Mexican challenger Juan 'Pinkly' Alejo (21-3, 13KOs) in the main attraction of the highly-anticipated \"Pinoy Pride 33: Philippines versus the World.\" \n\"I'm excited and ready to rumble. I will surely give my best to put on a show and give the Filipino fans here and all over the world a very entertaining fight,\" said Nietes. \n\"I've been through a lot of tough battles, but I treat this one as the toughest. Losing is not an option for me that is why I will exhaust all possible means to come victorious. I've long been waiting for this opportunity and now that it comes, I won't let it slip out of my way,\" added the longest reigning Filipino world boxing champion who is unscathed for the past 11 years. Freeman ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: \nDuring Friday's official weigh-in at the Carson Civic Center, both Nietes and Alejo comfortably made weight. The pride of Murcia, Negros Occidental hit the scale at 107.8 pounds, while Alejo came in at 107.4 lbs. \n\"I know he (Nietes) is a great boxer, but I'm prepared for whatever comes. I'm a complete fighter so capable of beating him,\" said Alejo. \nLike Nietes, Albert and Jason Pagara also face acid tests in their US debut against dangerous Nicaraguan foes. \nThe unbeaten Albert Pagara (24-0, 17KOs) will risk his IBF Intercontinental super bantamweight crown against knockout artist William 'Chirizo' Gonzales (27-5, 23KOs) in by far the hardest bout of his career, while his older brother Jason (36-2, 22KOs), the WBO International super lightweight titlist, will take on Santos 'El Toro' Benavides (25-7-2, 19KOs) in what promises a highly engaging non-title match. \n\"I'm up against a dangerous opponent but in boxing, all that matters is who will land the strongest punch first,\" said Albert, who is coming off a spectacular first round stoppage of Mexican Jesus Rios two months ago in Dubai. \nJason Pagara's encounter with Benavides is expected to draw fireworks, with both promising to deliver a knockout victory. \nIn the equally-interesting feature of the slambang spectacle, rising ALA Stable star Mark 'Magnifico' Magsayo (11-0, 9KOs) will put his IBF Youth featherweight throne on the line against Mexico's Yardley Suarez (13-0, 8KOs) in an exciting showdown ot two young unbeaten prospects. \nMeanwhile, \"Pinoy Pride 33\" will be telecast “live” on Sky Cable pay per view on Sunday morning Philippine time) at a price of P299. ABS-CBN Sports + Action will also telecast the event on a slightly delayed basis at 11:00 a.m., with a replay of the fights on “Sunday’s Best” evening of October 18.
