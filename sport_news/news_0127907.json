(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports)\n2 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The thing about handing out massive amounts of money to professional athletes is that there’s always an element of risk.\nHealth, above all else, is the great unknown. But beyond that, work ethic, teammates, chemistry and so many other items on the list of intangibles can come into play when it comes to the question of whether the player was worth it.\nBut even if Kobe Bryant had stayed healthy the past few years rather than taking a tumble at every turn, and even if his Los Angeles Lakers had gone on to great things rather than falling from contention, there would have been people who disagreed with the organization’s decision to give Bryant a two-year, $48.5 million extension in Nov. 2013 — post-Achilles tendon tear, and eight months before he would become a free agent.\nJim Buss, however, will never be one of them. No matter how it plays out.\nUSA TODAY\nBeing Jim Buss\nThe Lakers executive vice president of basketball operations made it clear that he has no regrets about the controversial contract.\n\"You give Kobe Bryant $50 million for two years,\" Buss told USA TODAY Sports. \"Are you kidding me? What did he bring us? In this day and age, what did he bring us, for 20 years? And if that isn’t what you’re supposed to do, then I have no idea what life is all about.\n\"You pay the guy. You believe in the guy. If he ends up (staying healthy), that’s fantastic. Well everybody (in the media) cut me up for that, but I’d say over 200 fans have come up to me and said, ‘Thank you so much for letting my kid see Kobe Bryant for two more years.’ And I’m like, 'You know what? I’m glad I can see him for two more years.' \"\nUSA TODAY\nLakers executive Jim Buss fires back at Magic Johnson's criticism\nThe problem is that Bryant spent the first year of his two-year deal mostly on the sideline. Having recovered from the Achilles injury that forced him out of the 2013 playoffs and a knee injury that limited him to six games in the 2013-14 campaign, Bryant’s ailing right shoulder cut his 2014-15 season short in late January (he played 35 games in all). Even now, as the Lakers approach the start of their latest regular season, Bryant is missing preseason games because of a left leg contusion suffered against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.\nGive Buss credit for this much: He’s transparent about how he sees the Bryant deal. Yes, there was a lifetime achievement factor, with the Buss family deciding not only to pay Bryant in the future but to honor him for his past. And to anyone who dares bring up the piece from a year ago that so strongly suggested Buss was eager for Bryant to head for the exits so the Lakers’ rebuild could begin in earnest, he is quick to condemn the concept.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Will this really be Kobe Bryant's last season?\n\"It’s (BS), that’s exactly what that was,\" he fired back when asked about the ESPN the Magazine article . \"The organization absolutely loves him. You know why? Because he has made a living, as we (have) with the Lakers for the last 20 years, because of this man. Magic Johnson carried us (to) this part (of their history) ... and Kobe Bryant has carried us for 20 years. So every person that works in that organization, why would they hate him? Why would they want him out of there? There’s only a basketball or a Kobe hater that would want that. There’s no other reason.\"\nHe laughs.\n\"You can’t justify (being anti-Bryant),\" Buss continued. \"If you’re a secretary or a mail room executive or whatever, you can’t justify saying you don’t want Kobe there. He gets a thousand pieces of mail a day, so that keeps your job.\"\nFollow Sam Amick on Twitter @sam_amick .\nGALLERY: KOBE BRYANT THROUGH THE YEARS\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Kobe Bryant's career year by year Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
