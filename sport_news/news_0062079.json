With the Hurricanes 0-3 start the conversation gets louder. One of the \"stories\" was Staal asking for $9 million for his contract extension. \nStaal said Wednesday that he never asked for that number. In fact, he stressed that was a number that had not been demanded. As far as his contract situation, he is comfortable where things stand between him and the organization. Practice notes \nJoakim Nordstrom missed practice Wednesday with an undisclosed ailment. Bill Peters said the forward blocked a shot against Detroit and that Nordstrom hasn't felt right since. He tried to practice but decided best if he sat out. \nRookie defenseman Noah Hanifin worked with the second power play unit Wednesday. Peters said it remains to be seen if he will be used on the man-advantage in a game. \nWith a seven-game road trip coming up, the Hurricanes will call up a forward and a defenseman from Charlotte to give the team extra bodies in case something happens on the road. No decision on who those players will be yet. \nCam Ward will get the start in the nets against Detroit on Friday. After that, Peters said, they will figure out the goalie situation.
