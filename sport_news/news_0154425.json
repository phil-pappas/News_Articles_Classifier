He was forced into survival mode, trying to \"just not screw something up.\" \nPugh did not go to bed when the Giants arrived home in the early morning hours, instead choosing to stay awake and watch the game so that he could critique his performance. \n\"The worst game I played at any level,\" Pugh would say afterward. \nAs the Giants prepare to return to the City of Brotherly Love, Pugh has not watched video of that game since and admittedly has no plans to do so. \n\"No reason to watch it, especially not of me,\" Pugh said earlier this week. \"I was the right tackle then. I’m the left guard now. Nothing I can learn from it anymore.\" \nPugh has already learned plenty from that forgettable evening and the Giants’ 2013 first-round pick took the lessons from the outing into the off-season and used them as the motivation behind perfecting his craft. \n\"I was too jacked up for that game, wanting to beat them so bad that I played out of my normal context,\" Pugh added. \"Being able to move past a bad play in the game, it’s something I had to learn instead of letting things snowball, and that’s what happened there last year. That game taught me plenty physically and mentally.\" \nPugh has played three of the five positions up front in the first 36 games of his career. He battled through elbow injuries last season, missing just one game, but his play was obviously affected. With rookie Ereck Flowers at left tackle and second-year pro Weston Richburg at home at center, Pugh has emerged as the stabilizing force between them. \nIn switching positions, Pugh has shown the versatility for which he was praised upon entering the league. He’s also proven his worth as a leader up front. \n\"His game has definitely improved,\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said of Pugh, 25. \"He’s smarter. He’s more physical. He has more confidence. You see him playing at a consistent level. All of the above.\" \nPugh ended up leaving Sunday’s thrilling 30-27 victory over the 49ers on the game’s final drive when an opposing player rolled over his left ankle. He came hobbling off during the possession, but only after the Giants had called their third and final timeout with 30 seconds left. \nIf it were earlier in the game, Pugh said he would have attempted to stay on the field. \nAnd considering the time management issues that plagued the Giants earlier this season, Pugh’s heads-up was certainly welcomed. \n\"Once we called our last timeout, I was thinking, I’d better make sure I [go to the sideline] and check on this ankle, because if I’m out there and the next play I can’t go, and I go down, it’s gonna be a 10-second run off and I didn’t want to waste the clock,\" Pugh said. \"And obviously, we scored two plays later. I didn’t want to hurt the team by staying out there and trying to push through.\" \nA veteran’s move, for sure. \n\"I don’t feel like I’m a young player anymore, but if you would ask Coach Flaherty, he would say you’ve gotta have 4,500 snaps before you’re considered a vet,\" Pugh added, referring to Giants offensive line coach Pat Flaherty. \"So I’m not a vet in his book yet. I’ve still got a ways to go and a lot more to learn to become the best player I can be.\" \nBRIEFS: CB Prince Amukamara injured his pectoral muscle in the third quarter of Sunday’s game and missed five snaps, but returned and finished the game. His status for Monday’s game is uncertain, but the Giants hope to know more when they return to the practice field today after Wednesday’s off-day. … QB Eli Manning was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week.
