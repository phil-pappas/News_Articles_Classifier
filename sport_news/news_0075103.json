It's also something that was roundly ignored this week in the Alabama football complex. Too much has changed since the Aggies took its worst beating in 35 seasons. \nThey'll meet again at 2:30 p.m. CT Saturday in College Station as top-10 teams. The No. 9 Aggies are unbeaten in five games this season with an 8-2 record since the stunning loss in Tuscaloosa. They have a new quarterback (Kyle Allen), defensive coordinator (John Chavis) and playmaking receiver (Christian Kirk). \nAlabama defensive lineman Dalvin Tomlinson didn't have to think long when asked how many times he's heard the 59-0 score mentioned this week. \n\"None,\" he said. \nRunning back Kenya Drake said they just have to black out that memory. \n\"Yes, of course. It's just like last week's game against Georgia, we have to block that out to focus for Arkansas,\" he said. \"Every game is a season within itself. Obviously we're not going to focus on last year. That was a whole different year, a whole different team for both sides, so we're just going to focus on last year.\" \nThat loss had a lasting impact in College Station. Quarterback Kenny Hill didn't play another game for A&M after starting against Alabama. He was pulled in the second half after completing 17 of 26 passes for 138 yards. Then-freshman Kyle Allen replaced him and quickly became the future of Aggie quarterbacks. \n\"I've never lost a game like that before,\" Aggie center Mike Matthews said at SEC Media Days . \"For me, it was kind of a shock. For a lot of these guys have never lost a game like that. We weren't clicking that day. We just needed to get better and we did learn from that game.\" \nThe biggest difference between last October and the rematch is the Aggie defense. It ranked 104th last year by allowing 450.8 yards a game. Alabama went for 602 yards (304 passing and 298 rushing) while building a 45-0 halftime edge. \nThe Aggie defense is currently allowing 374.8 yards a game to rank 58th nationally and 11th in the SEC. Their pass defense is fifth in the league allowing 192.2 yards a game thanks in part to the ability to impact opposing quarterbacks. \nA&M's 3.8 sack-average is No. 2 in the SEC and No. 7 nationally. Defensive end Myles Garrett had just three stops against Alabama as a freshman, but now leads the SEC in sacks (7.5). \nStill, it hasn't completely shut down any of the five offenses faced so far. It allowed 23 points to Ball State and 27 against Nevada while SEC foes Arkansas and Mississippi State went for 21 and 17 points, respectively. \n\"They've got a new defensive coordinator and I'm sure different players playing, stuff like that,\" Alabama left guard Ross Pierschbacher said. \"They're gonna have a chip on their shoulder, I'm sure, from that game last year. We can't really take that into consideration at all.\" \nA&M will also be fresh Saturday afternoon after having a bye last week. It'll have 102,733-plus in Kyle Field with memories of what happened last year in Tuscaloosa. \n\"It motivates us a lot for this year,\" A&M defensive lineman Julien Obioha said at SEC Media Days. \"Nobody wants to look back on that game and have a similar thing happen. So I think it's a lot of motivation.\" Head To Head: Alabama vs. Texas A&M prediction With their season on the line, Alabama will head to College Station for a top-10 matchup against the Aggies of Texas A&M.
