Quarterback Chris Laviano was sacked on third down at the Rutgers' 49-yard line. With no timeouts remaining and the clock winding down, Laviano spiked the ball on fourth down with three seconds left . The play resulted in a turnover on downs, which gave the ball back to the Spartans for a final kneel down to end the game. \nInterim coach Norries Wilson took responsibility for the snafu. Laviano said he looked to the sideline saw both coaches calling for a spike and the markers still signaling third down. Wide receiver Leonte Carroo said he saw offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels calling for the spike. Kyle Flood reviews in-game decisions during his suspension Rutgers football coach Kyle Flood discusses the in-game decision process that took place during his three-game suspension. (John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nFlood said it's a breakdown that everyone will learn from. \n\"I think a teaching moment really for everybody in the program,\" Flood said Wednesday on his weekly radio show. \"It was a call that came off the sideline as Norries said and it was the wrong call. The player executed it, so would you like the player to be more aware? Sure, but ultimately that's not his responsibility. The responsibility is on the coaches on the sideline and I think Norries did a good job of explaining that after the game. It hurts. It's certainly something I think the whole program is going to learn from.\" \nRELATED: What happened on Rutgers' final play against Michigan State? \nThe sack on third down provided another teaching moment. Michigan State was able to generate pressure with a three-man rush and Laviano failed to throw the ball away to stop the clock and avoid an 11-yard loss. \n\"In the two-minute drill, one of the first things you preach to the quarterback is sacks are catastrophic, and sacks are even more catastrophic when you don't have timeouts,\" Flood said. \nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com .
