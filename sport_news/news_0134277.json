They favour public monies, and demand that funds be balanced between mitigation -- cutting carbon emissions -- and adaptation.\nThe draft agreement \"completely ignored the submissions of (the) G77 on finance\", said Gurdial Singh Nijar, a Malaysian negotiator and spokesman for the Like-Minded Developing Countries, a grouping which includes China and India, as well as many African, Asian and Latin American nations.\nThere is nothing, for example, \"on the obligations of developed countries to provide the means of implementation\" for relevant technology, he told AFP. â€”AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:02:23.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
