We played really well,\" freshman Megan Furtney said. \"I think we're just ready to come back next year and play even better.\" \nFurtney finished fifth individually with a 3-over par 147, closing her debut season with a 1-over 73. Her round featured three birdies – including separate ones on the first two holes – as she finished three shots behind champion Madasyn Pettersen, a sophomore from Rockford Guilford. \nNorth's team score of 647 was seven shots behind third-place Wheaton Warrenville South and 30 off the pace of champion Hinsdale Central. \n\"I couldn't be prouder of the girls either way because of what they did and what they accomplished this season,\" North coach Irish Whalen said. \nNorth entered the final leg of the state series on a tear, having earned its first team sectional title on the heels of a repeat regional title performance at Sycamore Golf Club. Junior Kate Lillie (161) followed Furtney, who was flanked all season by fellow freshmen Emma Hayes (172) and Sarah Arnold (174). \nThe North Stars placed 11th at state in 2014, but are optimistic about a continued climb thanks to the infusion of youth to join Lillie and classmate Gianna Furrie. Furtney, the sectional medalist, led the effort down the stretch. \n\"I'm pretty proud of how I played,\" Furtney said. \"Obviously, I would have liked to have won the tournament, but I played my game. I was pretty proud of how I hit the ball and what I scored.\" \nIt was especially gratifying considered what Whalen called a \"two-club wind\" that challenged the field throughout the weekend. \nSt. Charles East placed ninth, shooting a 350 on Saturday to finish with a two-day 697. \nAlthough the Saints hoped to improve upon their seventh-place standing entering the final round, there's a silver lining in that each of the program's state scorers will return next season. \nJunior Rose Bundy paced East with an 84 on Saturday that completed a two-day 167. Riley Sullivan (174), Nicole Jordan (176) and Kacie Gaffney (180) followed. \nSeniors Brooke Brotzman and Karina Shah also were part of East's state team. \nBurlington Central senior Josie Kurosky tied for 51st among individuals, finishing with a two-day 168 after Saturday's round of 83. Batavia sophomore Madi McCoy (88th, 186) and Geneva senior Natalie Saeger (T-99th, 200) also competed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:58:12.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
