Manohar and Khan were to discuss the resumption of the Indo-Pak cricket ties and unofficial talks might be held in Delhi tomorrow.\n\n\"Under the present circumstances, it will be unreasonable to expect from Aleem that he will be able to perform his duties to the best of his abilities. As such, he has been withdraw and his replacement will be announced in due course,\" an ICC spokesman said.\n\nMeanwhile BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur had said that Dar's presence will not be affected by any threat from any group.\n\n\"There was a possibility of a protest in Saurashtra as well. 50,000 people were supposed to turn up in Rajkot. So I am not going into any threat perception. The fact is that India will also host the T20 World Cup in 2016 and it is the responsibility of every Indian to keep our image of sportmanship alive,\" Thakur said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:18:32.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
