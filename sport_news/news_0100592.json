Show Caption Previous Next \nIf Grace Christian Academy's girls soccer team was an underdog on Tuesday, McKenzie Krebs didn't know it. \nThe goalie helped the Lady Rams make quick work of two-time defending state champion Catholic. \nKrebs saved 20 of 22 shots on goal as host Grace Christian rolled past the Lady Irish 5-1 in the elimination Region 2-A/AA semifinals, clinching a region final and state sectional berth for the first time in program history. \n\"My goalkeeper was a beast tonight,\" Grace Christian coach Donnie Green said. \"I told our girls, â€˜You make them shoot past 18 (yards), and McKenzie won't let anything go in.' They got inside 18 one time. That's when they scored. Another one of their shots went off the post, and McKenzie saved one of their (penalty kicks). ... She has 199 saves this season.\" \nGrace (15-4-1) will play host to Christian Academy of Knoxville in Thursday's 4 p.m. region final, which will determine home-field advantage for Saturday's sectionals. \nIt's the first time Catholic hasn't advanced to a state sectional since 2011, and the Lady Irish trailed from the outset on Tuesday. \nGrace Christian's Allie Dunn and Lauren Lewis each scored two goals and posted an assist, and Sara Houff scored the Lady Rams' final goal, and also had an assist. Renee Semaan scored for Catholic in the first half. The Lady Irish trailed 2-1 at the break. \n\"We're doing this with 13 players,\" Green said. \"We're just so depleted. The way these girls have responded in these games, especially these big games, they're just so determined.\" \nCAK 5, Rockwood 0: Emily Threatt, Eva Toler and Addy Cronan each posted a goal and an assist as the Lady Warriors (16-4-0) clinched a sectional berth. \nThreatt and Cronan scored in the first half as CAK, which outshot Rockwood 25-4, surged to a 2-0 lead at the break. \nThreatt then assisted on Toler's goal in the second half before Sarah Collins scored off a corner kick from Cronan. \nHannah Clothier connected on a shot from 30 yards for CAK's final goal. \nEast/Middle Region \nBattle Ground Academy 2, Webb 1: Lexi Reeves scored a goal and Webb outshot BGA 8-5, but it wasn't enough to secure a region title for the Lady Spartans in a non-elimination game at University School of Nashville. Webb will play host to Evangelical Christian School for a spot in the Division II-A state tournament on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. \nRegion 1-AAA \nScience Hill 0, Jefferson County 0: Riley Cox scored the decisive goal as Science Hill edged Jefferson County (13-7-1) 4-3 on penalty kicks, pushing the Lady Hilltoppers into Thursday's region final against Tennessee High.
