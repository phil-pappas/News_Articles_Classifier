Image 60 of 60 Perplexing story of former Texas A&M WR Thomas Johnson turns tragic 1 / 60 Back to Gallery COLLEGE STATION – The strange story of former Texas A&M receiver Thomas Johnson turned tragic on Monday.\nJohnson, 21, was arrested on charges of murder after police say he hacked a random jogger to death along the White Rock Creek Trail in Dallas, according to multiple media outlets in Dallas-Fort Worth.\nRELATED: Ex-A&M football player suspected in Dallas jogger killing\nIn nearly 20 years of covering the Aggies for a handful of newspapers, Johnson’s tale is perhaps the strangest I’ve come across regarding A&M. He had three key catches in the Aggies’ 29-24 toppling of top-ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Nov. 10, 2012, and two days later simply went missing in College Station – one hour before A&M’s practice that Monday.\nTwo days later, his mother pleaded in her front yard to television cameras for the safe return of her son. A&M also listed Johnson as “missing” on the home page of its athletics website, in hopes of locating the receiver.\nPolice found him on a street near his old high school of Dallas Skyline about 3 a.m. that Thursday, and he never publicly gave a reason why he left A&M – and why he never returned. The perplexing story stayed with me, especially as I watched the Aggies move forward in the Southeastern Conference minus the talented receiver.\nIn the spring of 2014 I stopped by Johnson’s home in a Dallas neighborhood, and visited with his mother. I’d tried reaching her by phone to no avail, and so I decided to visit the old-fashioned way. Linda Hanks was working in the front yard, and couldn’t have been nicer during our visit.\nShe said Johnson would not be interested in talking with me, but that he was working out and “he shall return” to college football – albeit not at A&M. She said rumors of Johnson suffering from mental illness were just that – rumors.\nMeanwhile some men who lived in the neighborhood had started gathering a little bit down the street on the weekday afternoon, and looking our way as we talked on the sidewalk.\n“You need to go, for your safety,” an anxious Hanks told me. “They think you’re police.”\nI took her advice. This was the resulting story , and the last I’d heard anything about Johnson until Monday.
