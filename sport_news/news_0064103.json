Stave, with 254 yards in 2012, is one of the nine. \n-- Wisconsin has had 11 100-yard receivers against Illinois, but only three since 2000: Jared Abbrederis (2012), Travis Beckum (2007) and Lee Evas (2001). \n-- Corey Clement needs 198 rushing yards to tie and 199 to pass Dave Mohapp for 20th place and 202 to tie and 203 to pass Larry Canada for 19th place on UW's all-time list. \n-- Joel Stave can be the first Badgers quarterback since Randy Wright in 1983 to have three consecutive 300-yard passing games. Wright's, by the way, all came on the road at Ohio State, Iowa and Purdue. He then finished the season with a 259-yard game vs. Michigan State. \n-- Stave had had 23 games in which he has thrown at least 19 passes. In those 23, he has thrown at least one interception in 17 of them. \n-- Stave will be making his 36th start for Wisconsin, which will tie him for 4th place with John Stocco on UW's all-time starts at QB list. \n-- With his next win, Stave will pass Darrell Bevell for fourth place and tie Mike Samuel for 3rd place on UW's all-time wins as a starting quarterback list (with 27). \n-- Stave needs 2 passing touchdowns to tie and 3 to pass John Stocco for 2nd place on UW's all-time list. \n-- Stave needs 37 pass attempts to tie and 38 to pass John Stocco for 2nd place on UW's all-time list. \n-- Stave needs 27 completions to tie and 28 to pass Randy Wright (1982) for 10th place on UW's all-time single-season list. \n-- Stave's next interception will tie and 2 will pass Tony Lowery and Randy Wright for 2nd place on UW's all-time interceptions list. Eight INTs will tie Darrell Bevell for the most in UW history. (Note: INTs since 1956, although doubtful anyone previous had more.) \n-- Stave needs 49 passing yards to pass Mike Samuel (1996) for 18th place, 54 to pass Tony Lowery (1990) for 17th place, 55 to pass Brooks Bollinger (2002) for 16th place, 189 to pass Mike Samuel (1997) for 15th place and 292 to pass John Stocco (2004) for 14th place on UW's all-time single-season list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:51:53.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
