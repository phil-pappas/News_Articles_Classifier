Teresa McMinn \nThe 71-year-old Kelley, hunting on two replaced knees, was all smiles as a Maryland Wildlife & Heritage Service crew weighed, measured and sampled the bear whose live weight was estimated at 259 pounds. She was hunting near Rock Lodge Road in Garrett County. \nKelley is no stranger to hunting or wildlife management. For 10 years she was a citizen member of the Maryland Wildlife Advisory Commission, the governor-appointed group that provides input to the WHS. \n“I’ve put in every year and this is the first time I’ve drawn a permit,” Kelley said. This bear season is the state’s 11th in modern times. This time around, more than 3,800 hunters applied for the 450 available permits. The hunt takes place in Garrett and Allegany counties for four days. \nKelley was actually a member of the first Maryland Black Bear Task Force in the 1990s that recommended a bear hunt take place. The initial hunt, however, didn’t occur until 2004 and followed a second task force’s approval and challenges in the legislature, legal system and court of public opinion. \nHarry Spiker, bear project leader for the wildlife agency, checked the ear tag numbers on Kelley’s bear and discovered it had been tagged as a cub in 2012 in the Monroe Run drainage of Garrett  County. \n“We usually have a bear checked in earlier on (the) first day,” Spiker said. \nWithin the next 45 minutes, though, three more successful hunters arrived. \nSonny Zigler, Randallstown, harvested a 110-pound female near Finzel, but in Allegany County. \nZigler said the bear he shot was running with five others. It was his first Maryland bear. \nThe next two bears were at the far ends of the hunter-age spectrum. \nRon Twentey, 78, drove from his home in Little Orleans on the far eastern portion of the bear hunting area, to Swallow Falls in Garrett County near the western boundary, where he killed a 286-pound male bear with a large white chest blaze. The animal field dressed at 242 pounds. Ron Twentey, 78, of Little Orleans and a 286-pound male bear he shot on Monday, Oct. 20, 2014. Teresa McMinn \n“I had put in every year and not drawn a permit, but this year I drew and so did my wife and son,” Twentey said. He used a Marlin 30-30 to bag the bear. \nCameron Cline, 10, Red House, has had a few days of good hunting. \nOn Friday, hunting with his muzzleloader, he killed his first deer. \nMonday morning he checked in a 99-pound bear taken in the Table Rock area. \nThe female bear is estimated to have a live weight of 117 pounds. \nHunting with his father, Storm, and brother, Tyler, 12, Cameron used a .243 caliber rifle. He is a 5th grade student at Yough Glades Elementary School. Cameron Cline, 10, Red House, was hunting with his father, Storm, and brother, Tyler, 12, when he got a bear on the season's opening day. \nCameron’s description of the hunt was succint. \n“It came running in and I shot it,” he said. \nAs of 2:30 p.m., two more bears were checked at Mount Nebo and one at Bilmeyer in Allegany County, bringing the total harvest to seven thus far. \n“We keep the check stations open until 8 p.m., but if somebody calls us and says they have a bear down, but need time to get it out of the woods, we’ll wait for them. We’ve been here until midnight before,” Spiker said. \nIn fact, Spiker received a call from two 70-year-old hunters at about noon Monday saying they had a bear down in the Swallow Falls area, but could not get it out of the woods. Agency personnel were dispatched to help. \nThe hunt continues through Thursday. Spiker said he expects the harvest to top the 94 bears taken a year ago, which was a record number. He said he expects a surge of hunters with bears to arrive about dark Monday night. \nThere was no precipitation on Monday, but rain is expected to move into the area on Tuesday. \nMike Sawyers is a staff writer and the outdoor editor at Cumberland Times-News.
