Off the very next play, Hayne was given a second chance to break through the Giants defence and get into the end zone, but he was unable to do so.\nWith one more down left, Hayne was taken from the field. Off the next play, quarterback Colin Kaepernick threw a bullet pass to receiver Anquan Boldin, who scored a touchdown in the corner for the 49ers, and it would be fair to say Hayne's effort with the pigskin contributed to it.\nHalf a chance: Jarryd Hayne tries to get past the New York defence.\nSan Francisco were successful with the kick to lock the scores up at 13-13.\nA short time later, Hayne was again in the thick of the action, catching a punt from fellow Australian Brad Wing, returning the ball 16 yards before he was tackled by the Giants.\nIn a nice gesture of sportsmanship, the Australian pair gave each other a pat on the shoulder when they walked past each other after the play.\nOh so close: Jarryd Hayne is brought down close to the end zone at Giants Stadium.\nWhen 2 Aussies meet half way #SFvsNYG @bwing38 @JarrydHayne üèàüá¶üá∫ pic.twitter.com/06noJWtARZ\n‚Äî Andrew Price (@pricey43) October 12, 2015 Hayne's only other impact in the game was when he marked the ball 13 yards out from his end zone and called a fair catch. Hayne finished the match with two rushes for nine yards and one punt return for 16 yards.\nTrailing 27-23, Giants tight end Larry Donnell scored the winning touchdown with 21 seconds remaining at Met-Life Stadium from an Eli Manning pass to put the 49ers' season win-loss record at one and three.\nSan Francisco coach Jim Tomsula gave his players credit for playing their hardest until the very end.\n\"We've just got to play tighter and tougher,\" Tomsula said in the post-match press conference. \"In a loss, I have a tough time talking about anything good, but there were things we can build on. I felt like there were steps made. There's a group of guys that are made of the right stuff, so let's grab that, hold it tight, and keep going through it.\n\"We've got to get it tightened up and keep moving forward but the effort, how hard the guys played, those things were all evident.\"\nHayne fans expressed their excitement on social media after the former league star's efforts. ‚Äã\n‚Äã\nTOUCHDOWN @Kaepernick7 to @AnquanBoldin !!! pic.twitter.com/G2ireIsML8\n‚Äî San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) October 12, 2015 AUSSIE Brad Wing punts to AUSSIE Jarryd Hayne.
