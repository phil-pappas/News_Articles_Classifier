Photograph by: JASON FRANSON , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nEDMONTON — It says something that, with a season-changing win in their grasp, the B.C. Lions failed to score from the Edmonton Eskimos goal-line three times. \nAnd if you’re wondering, what it says isn’t good. \n“I’ve got to get in the end zone,” said rookie quarterback Greg McGhee, whose fourth-quarter fumble was a crucial play in the Lions 26-23 overtime loss on Saturday. \n“That’s what they bring me in for. I don’t do anything else. I have to get the ball in the end zone. It just didn’t go that way. \n“It was totally my fault. Totally my fault.” \nMaybe, but there was more than enough blame to go around in this Lions’ loss. \nMcGhee’s gaffe ended a nightmarish sequence in which the Lions failed to score three times from in tight. It started five and a half minutes into the fourth quarter when a pass interference call on Lavelle Hawkins set the Lions up on the Esks’ one-yard line. \nOn their first attempt, either quarterback Jonathon Jennings or running back Andrew Harris turned the wrong way, and, in the confusion the Lions lost two yards. Student of foreshadowing should have taken note. \nAnother pass interference call, however, set the Lions up back on the one and this time head coach Jeff Tedford sent in McGhee to punch it over. \nInstead, he fumbled, the Eskimos’ Deon Lacey recovered in the end zone and returned it to the Lions’ 34. While Eskimos quarterback Mike Reilly threw an interception to the T.J. Lee on the next play, the Lions’ offence also dried up like a prune from that point. \nTedford was asked about bringing in McGhee, who hadn’t take a snap the entire game, for the crucial play. \n“He’s been practicing all week,” Tedford said. “You go with what you practice.” \n“First and goal, we have to punch it in,” said McGhee. “It’s that simple. You can’t have turnovers in the red zone that late in the game in a hostile environment. You can’t do it.” \nGAME BALL \nRonnie Yell, B.C. Lions \nThe Lions’ short-side corner returned a Reilly pass 13 yards for a room-service touchdown in the first quarter and tackled like a fiend. The problem was the Lions’ couldn’t clone Yell and have Ronnie 2.0 cover Esks’ slotback Adarius Bowman, who finished with 11 catches for 198 yards. Yell is manning the position Dante Marsh held down for 11 seasons with the Lions. He’s having an All-Star calibre year. \nTHE POINT AFTER \n490: represents the yards in total offence produced by the Eskimos. The Lions’ defence contained Reilly-Bowman and company to some degree, but they couldn’t stop them when it mattered in the fourth quarter. The Esks also produced 158 rushing yards to the Lions’ 25 and the Lions’ inability to convert on short yardage was a key factor in the game. \nGAME SUMMARY \nB.C. 7 6 6 1 3 — 23 \nEdmonton 3 10 3 4 6 — 26 \nFirst Quarter \nEdm — FG Whyte 40 3:38 \nB.C. — TD Yell 13 interception return (Leone convert) 5:32 \nSecond Quarter \nEdm — TD Bowman 69 pass from Reilly (Whyte convert) 0:18 \nB.C. — FG Leone 14 5:44 \nEdm — FG Whyte 22 10:20 \nB.C. — FG Leone 27 12:47 \nThird Quarter \nEdm — FG Whyte 34 2:57 \nB.C. — TD Arceneaux 3 pass from Jennings (convert failed) 11:45 \nFourth Quarter \nEdm — Single Shaw 61 10:20 \nB.C. — Single Leone 50 8:49 \nEdm — FG Whyte 16 14:57 \nOvertime \nEdm — FG Whyte 10 \nB.C. — FG Leone 37 \nEdm — FG Whyte 3 \nAttendance — 28,517 at Edmonton. \nINJURY REPORT \nThe Lions didn’t report any significant injuries, so there’s that. \nNEXT GAME \nThe latest must-win game for B.C. comes next Friday, when they host the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in a 7 p.m. (TSN, TSN1410) meeting at B.C.

Owing to the Blue Jays playoff run, the Lions don’t know if they’ll be playing in Toronto or Hamilton. © Copyright (c) The Province", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:45:00.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
