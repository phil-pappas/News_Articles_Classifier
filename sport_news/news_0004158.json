There were multiple stoppages of play while players were tended to and assisted off the field by trainers. \nFor the Paladins, starting quarterback Reese Hannon, starting running back Triston Luke and starting free safety Richard Hayes all departed the game in the third quarter with injuries and did not return. \nHannon suffered a concussion, Luke was in a walking boot on his left foot after the game, and Hayes had packs of ice on both shoulders. \n\"I think Reese got hit in the head when he released the ball and then I think his head hit the turf, but he's doing okay,\" Furman coach Bruce Fowler said. \n--Before leaving, Hannon threw for 71 yards to eclipse the 5,000-yard passing mark for his career. He also moved past Frankie DeBusk into fifth place on Furman's all-time passing list with 5,033 yards. \n--Citadel entered Saturday with 16 fumbles and eight lost, but those came early on this season. On Saturday, the Bulldogs ran 63 times and didn't put the ball on the ground once. During their current three-game winning streak, they've ran the ball 188 times without losing a fumble. \n\"That's a credit to them, but also you've got to be disruptive and control the line of scrimmage (defensively) and we didn't,\" Fowler said. \"They pitched the ball well today too, so it wasn't just like they were handing off.\" \n--Furman threw a pair of touchdown passes Saturday leaving Citadel with three scoring passes allowed all season. Citadel became the last team in the FCS to allowing a passing touchdown when Samford threw one in the fourth quarter last Saturday. \nThe Bulldogs' defense also entered Saturday with an FCS-best 11 interceptions. They upped that total to 13 with a pair in the fourth quarter Saturday. \n--With the win Saturday, Citadel moved to 4-0 in the Southern Conference for the first time since 1979. \n--Some matchups you remember more than others -- for the effort if not so much for the result. \nFurman quarterback P.J. Blazejowski, who entered the game for the injured Reese Hannon on Saturday, set a Furman record in 2014 for single-game total offense with 382 yards in a loss to The Citadel. \nHannon shattered Blazejowski's record, however, earlier this season with 400 yards in a loss to Coastal Carolina. \n--With the game tied, Furman linebacker Carl Rider intercepted Dominique Allen's pass at the goal line late in the first quarter to prevent a Bulldogs' touchdown that would have given The Citadel the lead for the first time in the game. Rider also returned the ball 14 yards, but Furman couldn't capitalize on the turnover. \nThe Bulldogs went on to score 17 unanswered points in the second quarter. \nRider now has two picks in his career. \n--Instead of his name on the back of his navy blue jersey, each Citadel football player wears a word representing one of the state military college's core values: Duty, honor or respect. \n--In a series that stretches back over 95 games, Furman began playing The Citadel in 1913 and clashed each year from 1919 on except for an interruption during part of World War II. \nThe Paladins were hoping to avenge last year's loss to The Citadel, adding to revenge wins over VMI and South Carolina State so far this season. \n--But with Saturday's result, the Bulldogs have won four of the last six matchups with Furman. Furman still leads the series, 58-34-3. The 58 victories are the most over any of the Paladins' opponents. \n--The Citadel has a number of players from the Upstate on its roster. \nThere are three from Byrnes High: offensive linemen Isaiah Pinson and Sydney Martin and defensive lineman Noah Dawkins. Two are J.L. Mann products: wide receiver Jake Riggs and punter Will Vanvick. \nThere is one each from T.L. Hanna (wide receiver Whit Miller), Eastside (defensive back Seth Greer), Dorman (defensive back Aron Span III) and Ninety Six (Rod Johnson, an A-Back). 3 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1S3imKg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:19:27.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
