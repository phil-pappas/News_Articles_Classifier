((Jim Middlekauff | lehighvalleylive.com contributor)) \nRoselle Park at Belvidere , Friday, 7 p.m. \nGetting the big plays. The County Seaters’ veer, last year more of a power offense behind backs such as Bobby Merle, is more of an explosive offense this season with halfbacks like Tommy Madeo and Bailey Castner . “Bailey’s more of a home-run hitter,” said Belvidere coach Josh Costantino of his senior co-captain. “He’s so elusive, he makes people miss. He makes great cuts and great reads. When he gets I the open field, no one will catch him.” This could be especially significant against a Roselle Park team that likes to stack nine defenders in the box against Belvidere, because if a back like Caster gets through a nine-man box, they have an excellent chance to go all the way. \nContinuing the momentum. The County Seaters have won two in a row after an 0-2 start. “When we lost those first two games we knew had to work 20 times harder,” Castner said. “It was an issue of us getting better and cutting down on our mistakes.” The result has been a whole new feel around the Belvidere team. “Our confidence is really soaring right now and we’re rolling right now,” junior quarterback Jake Thornton said, A fast start will help Friday night. \nExploiting what’s there. David Brearley ran the ball for over 300 yards in a 20-10 defeat of Roselle Park last week but also threw for 123 yards. While Belvidere may not be a passing team, the Seaters have had success throwing (16-of-24, 277 yards, no interceptions) with Madeo, tight end Zach DeLuca and and Jordan Allen all averaging over 10 yards a catch. Keep an eye on Belvidere’s air attack. \nDefensive big plays. Belvidere has these kind of playmakers – Madeo is a returning All-State defensive back, and DeLuca and Nate Baylor draw generous praise from Costantino for their dominance at middle linebacker – and it scored on defensive touchdown in last week’s win over Dayton from Castner at cornerback. “Nobody throws at Tommy,” Costantino said. But Castner’s hardly a soft touch. “I wanted to become a shutdown corner like Tommy,” Castner said. “I worked all summer at it and went to a couple of camps to get better. I want to be the best cornerback I can be. I scored my first touchdown last week; I cut in front of a slant and took it to the house.” Belvidere may well need a repeat this week from any defender. \nLocal pride. The County Seaters are 0-2 at home this year and they’ll surely want to make the home fans happy Friday night. “All the support we get from the community definitely helps,” said Castner, who, like many Belvidere plays, is a football lifer; his brother and father played for the County Seaters. “We know we represent our community every time we walk on the field.” And they’ll want to represent it well Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:11:19.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
