He was always good but now he’s taken it to another level.\" \nPrice’s stellar play has continued into the start of this season as he’s won his first three starts with a 1.67 GAA for the Canadiens, who swept their season-opening, four-game road trip. In 17 career starts against the Rangers, Price is 10-5-1 with a 1.86 GAA. \nLundqvist, 33, who will make his fifth straight start and is 3-1-0 with a 2.26 GAA after Tuesday’s 4-1 loss to the visiting Jets, is 14-13-2 lifetime against the Canadiens with a 2.70 GAA. \nThe Rangers did beat the Canadiens in six games in the 2014 Eastern Conference final, though Price was injured in Game 1 in a collision with Chris Kreider. \nLundqvist knows tonight’s game is not about him versus Price. But that showdown aspect is still there. \n\"You always want to challenge yourself,\" Lundqvist said. \"He’s definitely one to try to make a game with right now.\" \nBRIEFS: Emerson Etem, acquired in the offseason from the Ducks for speedy left wing Carl Hagelin, appears poised to make his Rangers’ debut after being a healthy scratch to start the season, though coach Alain Vigneault would not confirm his fourth-line configuration. It’s likely Etem and right wing Jesper Fast, a healthy scratch the past two games, will dress with Jarret Stoll a healthy scratch. … Defenseman Dan Boyle will re-enter the lineup — and the first power-play unit — after being a healthy scratch for the first time since Nov. 11, 2008. \"I wouldn’t say it was a shock,\" said Boyle, who has one assist in three games, of his benching. \"It’s only been three games but I haven’t played well.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:52:30.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
