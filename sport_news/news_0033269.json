(Photo by Matt Sullivan/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 551761367 (Matt Sullivan / Getty Images) It's go time for Dale Earnhardt Jr. facing must win at Talladega \nDale Earnhardt Jr. cried the last time he rolled into Talladega. \nHe was in Victory Lane, just a few days after his late father would have celebrated another birthday. Bittersweet memories of a place that the Earnhardt family cherishes. \nDale Jr. used to come here years ago with his daddy, and Dale would stick 100 bucks in his son's pocket so he could go race go-karts with his friends. He now races in a stock car for much higher stakes. \nA NASCAR Cup title. \nEarnhardt will go to Talladega this weekend facing a win-or-go-home scenario in the postseason Chase. His 21st-place finish at Kansas last weekend did him no favors. \nHe is now 31 points behind Martin Truex Jr. for the final transfer spot heading into the last phase of the Contender round of NASCAR's playoffs. The lowest four-ranked drivers without a victory will be eliminated from the Chase after Talladega. \nSee photos of weekly NASCAR Sprint Cup winners beginning with Joey Logano at the Daytona 500. Winners were virtually assured a spot in the season-ending Chase for the Championship. Kevin Harvick is defending champion and Jimmie Johnson is a 6-time winner. \nGo time. \n\"If I had to go to Talladega next week with one car, one driver and one shot, I'd want it to be with Dale Jr.,\" said Darrell Waltrip, a three-time Cup champion and now an analyst with Fox Sports. \nIt's not just a hopeful sentimental twist on Sunday's plot line. Dale Earnhardt won 10 times here. Dale Jr. has won six times, including a dominant performance in the May race when he led a race-high 67 laps. \n\"I wouldn't rather be going anywhere else than Talladega for the next race if we need a win,\" Earnhardt Jr. said.\"That is a good opportunity for us. Even over Daytona, I think we can go to Talladega and do the job.\" George Diaz on NASCAR chase standings \nGeorge Diaz on NASCAR chase standings \nGeorge Diaz on NASCAR chase standings See more videos \nTag, he's it. There are others in a pinch as well. Matt Kenseth is 35 points behind the final transfer spot and needs a win as well. Ryan Newman is eight points back. Kyle Busch is six points behind Truex Jr. \nBut all eyes will be on Earnhardt, NASCAR's favorite son. \n\"Dale Earnhardt's biggest goal in his career has been to add to the Earnhardt legacy,\" Waltrip said. \"The Earnhardt legacy at Talladega and Daytona is unmatched. And he likes adding numbers to that legacy.\" \nAs always, this is a man-and-machine deal. The odds are stacked in his favor as well if you consider those variables. \n\"I know that one race, one opportunity, one chance makes the odds feel bad, but we won there this year. And we went to and ran third in the [Daytona] 500 and we won our 125 [qualifying race],\" said Earnhardt Jr., who also won Daytona's rain-delayed late-night summer race. \nTalladega will always involve random chaos. A driver could be coasting with a fast car and a smooth ride when the pack makes a run for the front, somebody gets discombobulated and, next thing you know, you're flying upside down at 200 mph. \nBut there are good variables, too. Talladega. Earnhardt. Look it up. \n\"If you lived around Dale Earnhardt Sr., you heard him talk about Talladega,\" Waltrip said. \"You were there with him, you watched him, you observed. I think you can learn a lot that way. All these guys whose fathers were racers, you take things that you can absorb and apply once you get behind the wheel of a car.\" \nIt's time for Dale Jr. to use that applied science big-time on Sunday. \nGo time. \ngdiaz@tribune.com Read George Diaz's blog at OrlandoSentinel.com/enfuego \nGreen-white-checkered change \nNASCAR will try to make the chaos in Talladega more manageable this weekend. \nSteve O'Donnell , NASCAR's executive vice president and chief racing development officer, told \"The Morning Drive\" on Monday that they were \"leaning\" toward limiting the number of attempts at a green-white-checkered finish. \nOn Tuesday, NASCAR made it official. There will be just one attempt to finish races under the green flag this weekend. NASCAR traditionally allows three attempts at finishing a race under green-white-checkered conditions. But Talladega and the odds of \"The Big One\" at a restrictor-plate track always add a dramatic element to those circumstances. \nWitness Daytona in July when Austin Dillon 's car flew into the catch fence at the end of the first green-white-checkered attempt. His car shattered into pieces. Some drivers thought he was dead. Fortunately for Dillon, he was fine but five fans were injured. \n\"That scared the hell out of me, I will be honest with you,\" winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. said. \"I saw the whole thing happen. … That was terrifying to watch.\" \nO'Donnell says the change is an effort to balance \"exciting finishes and safety.\" \nBusch contract update \nKurt Busch , currently one of the Chase contenders, is expected to announce on Wednesday that he has resigned with Stewart-Haas Racing. The team has called a media conference with Busch and team co-owner Tony Stewart at the team's race shop in Kannapolis, N.C. There will also be a car unveiling, likely tied into a sponsorship. \nBusch and team co-owner Gene Haas have said they have a \"handshake deal\" to keep Busch on board. \nBusch, a former Cup champion, is vying for another title this season. He is third in the standings and likely to advance to the next round of the playoffs barring unforeseen circumstances at Talladega. \nBusch, who joined SHR for the 2014 season, has three wins for the team, including two this season. \nWaltrip fund-raiser \nThe 2015 Waltrip Brothers' Charity Championship will bring fancy vittles and A-list entertainment to Franklin, Tenn. \nTerry Bradshaw will be the host and Travis Tritt is going to perform on Wednesday during the gala dinner, followed by golf the next day. \n\"We have an incredible program this year,\" Darrell Waltrip said. \"It's become a destination.\" \nThe pot of fund-raising money — which should push close to $500,000 — goes to three charities: Motor Racing Outreach (MRO), Feed the Children and the Steve Byrnes Fund, which will go toward his son Bryson Byrnes ' college fund. \nByrnes, a popular and respected NASCAR analyst for Fox Sports, died April 21 following a lengthy battle with cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:54:06.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
