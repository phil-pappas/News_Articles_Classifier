The doubles specialist, who lost the US Open final to compatriot Flavia Pennetta, failed to convert a match point and was broken as Williams forced a tiebreak. \nWilliams secured an early mini-break as she wrapped up the match in just under three hours to reach her 77th career final and first at the fledgling tournament staged in the home town of China’s first grand slam singles champion Li Na. \n“Definitely watching the match at the US Open, I learned a lot from Serena,” Williams, who with 46 career titles has more wins to her name than the other semifinalists combined, said after her win. “If I could, I’d give my win to Serena at the US Open — unfortunately it doesn’t work like that.” \nMuguruza suffered an ankle injury but kept up her bid to qualify for the eight-woman end-of-year WTA Tour Finals in Singapore by coming through a hard-fought clash against sixth seed Kerber. \nThe Venezuelan-born 21-year-old called the trainer at 3-3 in the second set tiebreaker but recovered to claim the win. \n“It was a really tough match and I had to struggle today,” Muguruza said. “Venus is a legend. I’ll have to go out there and do my best to win against her and I think it’s going to be a great final.” \nThe world No. 8 entered the semifinals as the highest ranked player. And she will rise to a career-high of No. 5 having made the semifinals, and would reach No. 4 if she takes the title today. \nIn Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Donna Vekic of Croatia beat Evgenia Rodina or Russia 7-5, 6-1 yesterday to set up a Tashkent Open final against Nao Hibino of Japan. \nVekic, 19, is 1-2 in career tour finals, including a loss in the final of the 2012 Tashkent Open to Irina-Camelia Begu. \nHibino beat Bojana Jovanovic of Serbia 6-3, 6-4, staving off a late comeback after her opponent bounced back from 1-4 down to level the second set at 4-4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:01:05.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
