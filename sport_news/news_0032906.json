(AP) - Vikings star Adrian Peterson offered encouragement to Jamaal Charles on Wednesday, three days after his Chiefs counterpart sustained a torn ACL in his right knee against Chicago.\nIt was Charles who, after tearing his left ACL four years ago, reached out to Peterson later in the season. Minnesota's running back had just torn the same ligament in his knee that December.\nBoth players returned from their injuries the following season.\nPeterson said he can't imagine having to go through the painful hours of rehabilitation for a second torn ACL, which Charles is facing. But he also said that his fellow Texan has the \"God-given ability\" to come back from such a devastating injury.\nThe Chiefs visit the Vikings on Sunday.\n\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
