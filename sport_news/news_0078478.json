Travin Dural reached that moment and turned it into one for Brandon Harris and the LSU offense as well.\nWith the Tigers facing a 3 rd -and-24 situation in the third quarter and in danger of turning loose of momentum ever so slightly, Harris dropped back and heaved a pass to the right side as a South Carolina defender crashed into him.\nThe ball sailed downfield, ricocheted off tight end DeSean Smith's hands and right into Dural's waiting arms. The LSU receiver never broke stride on the way to the end zone to complete a 62-yard touchdown pass that expanded the Tigers' lead to 31-10 in a game they won 45-24.\n\"We ran a long two-man route and Brandon was getting hit as he threw the ball, so he kind of threw it a little high over DeSean's head,\" Dural said.\n\"I was in the right place at the right time.\"\nPass wasn't intended for him, but LSU's Travin Dural made the big play | Video He hauled in a 62-yard TD pass on a deflected pass\n\"I saw it go to DeSean, but Brandon put enough on it that when DeSean tipped it, that didn't affect it that much. I really didn't have to slow down at all and caught it in stride. It paid it off for Brandon to have a strong arm.\"\nThe urban-legend type description was ironcladly confirmed by Harris after the longest TD of his career.\n\"The guy drilled me in the face when I was throwing that ball,\" Harris said. \"So I couldn't put anything on the ball. It was a hell of a play, a heads-up play by him (Dural.)\"\nThat play was the longest through the air on a day when Harris turned in the best performance of the season: 18-for-28 for a career-high 228 yards and a pair of touchdown passes. Paired with a 396-yard rushing performance, the LSU offense gashed the Gamecocks (2-4, 0-4 SEC) for 624 yards on 83 plays -- 7.5 per snap.\nLSU quarterback Brandon Harris passed for a season-best 228 yards and a pair of TDs against South Carolina. Brett Duke, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune Harris threw the ball 23 times in the first half (completing 13) when South Carolina bottled up Leonard Fournette and engineered a 10-play, 54-yard drive that yielded a field goal to close out the first half and give the Tigers (5-0, 3-0) a 17-10 lead.\n\"He was making his throws real well and showed a lot of composure,\" LSU right guard Will Clapp said. \"On that 2-minute drive, he led us down the field and we got the field goal and that was key. He was a great leader (Saturday) on the field and we all appreciate that.\"\nThe Tigers' receiver corps also drew some appreciation a week after they were less-than-stellar the week before in a 44-22 victory against Eastern Michigan with a number of drops and mis-run routes.\nAgainst South Carolina, the receivers ran crisp routes, got open downfield -- facing mostly man coverage because the Gamecocks were loading the box to try and slow down Fournette -- and did the most basic thing: Made plays.\nLSU QB Brandon Harris on TD pass: 'Guy drilled me in the face' | Video LSU quarterback talks about his 62-yard TD pass to Travin Dural vs. South Carolina.\n\"I wasn't down but I knew we had to get back to work,\" said Malachi Dupre , who led LSU with 6 receptions and hauled in a pretty 10-yard TD throw on a fade. \"Moving forward, we have to keep on building off this and not let this be our best performance of the year.\"\nAdded Dural, \"We fixed it this week. We came out and converted on 3 rd downs and took advantage of everything that was given to us. I would say we took a step this week. We knew we were given plenty of opportunities the last few weeks and we didn't take advantage of it. We were just anxious to come out and show what we could do.\"\nLSU receiver Malachi Dupre hauls in this beautiful 10-yard TD pass on a fade pattern against South Carolina. Michael DeMocker, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune Indeed, as the competition heads into tougher territory and LSU takes on defenses with more talent and depth, the Tigers' ability to be more balanced and diverse will be magnified.\nSome of that was on display Saturday, with Derrius Guice actually out-rushing Fournette (161 yards to 157) and the uptick in the passing game.\nCan't fault the Tigers for getting greedy, though.\n\"Teams will have to play us honest,\" Dupre said. \"The more plays we make through the air, the more teams will have to respect us for the balance we can have in our offense.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:08:20.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
