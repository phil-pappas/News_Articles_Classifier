His only trouble occurred when he walked the first two batters in the sixth, but he wiggled out of it without any damage.\nKansas City Royals catcher Salvador Perez, right, celebrates with teammates after their 5-0 win against the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of their ALCS Series in Kansas City, Mo. (AP)\n“Tonight was the Volquez show. He was tremendous,” Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. “He shut down a good-hitting team, I know that. His ball was ducking and darting everywhere.”\nThe Royals’ bullpen finished off the club’s eighth consecutive ALCS victory.\nSalvador Perez – with a towering homer – Alcides Escobar and Lorenzo Cain drove in runs off Toronto starter Marco Estrada, while Eric Hosmer and Kendrys Morales tacked on two more off LaTroy Hawkins to put the game away.\nThe Blue Jays’ three hits were their fewest ever in a playoff game.\nAs if the outcome wasn’t bad enough for them, designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion left in the eighth inning to get X-rays on the middle finger of his left hand. The initial report was a strain of the ligament and Encarnacion was listed as day-to-day.\nThe Royals will try to take a 2-0 series lead when they send Yordano Ventura to the mound on Saturday. Toronto will counter with former Cy Young Award winner David Price.\nThe teams entered the best-of-seven series with plenty of history.\nTo start with, the defending AL champion Royals beat Toronto in the 1985 league championship series. But far more recently was the tense, benches-clearing game that the teams played at Rogers Centre in August.\nVolquez was right in the thick of things then.\nThe veteran starter kept pitching the Blue Jays inside, finally hitting Josh Donaldson with a fastball in the first inning. Tensions escalated as the game went on, with Toronto reliever Aaron Sanchez returning the favor by hitting Escobar to trigger a benches-clearing scuffle.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:02:56.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
