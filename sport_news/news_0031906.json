He was here as part of his 20-day ‘Gaon Bachao yatra’. The yatra today reached Almora town from Ranikhet after passing through Ghingarikhal, Kalika, Mazkhali, Dwarso, Kathapuria, Katarmal and Koshi. It gathered at the Bhagwali palace and a seminar on the issue of Gaon Bachao was held there. “We want the government to hold a referendum on adopting the development model advocated by pro-people organizations for the benefit of the state,” said Joshi. The environmental activist said had successive governments after the creation of state taken up the sensitive issue of development with statehood agitators and pro-people activists even on an experimental basis, the scene of development in the state would have been different today. “Even bureaucrats sitting at the NITI Aayog like institutions have no priority for village development. They are only focusing on the development of big cities,” said Joshi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:26:15.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
