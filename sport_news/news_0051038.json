Jones had allowed just two goals in the Sharks' season-opening winning streak and came in leading the NHL in goals-against average (0.49), save percentage (.982) and shutouts (two).\nStaal scored his first of the season 10:36 into the game.\nRaanta's toughest stop occurred early in the second period as New York was killing a 5-on-3 Sharks power play. San Jose center Joe Thornton attempted a quick shot from along the goal line as Patrick Marleau drove to the net, but Raanta kicked the puck away.\nThe save was significant when Zuccarello scored his fourth of the season later in the period. With Rick Nash screening Jones, Zuccarello whipped a shot from the right side into the net.\nFast had a breakaway goal 3:47 into the third period.\nRaanta made a left pad save on Thomas Hertl as the Sharks came in on a 2-on-1.\nStalberg scored with 3:16 left.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/70/8818215/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/70/8818215/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:47:11.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
