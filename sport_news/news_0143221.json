It's the same response.\n\"We evaluate all the time, so we look at every single thing — every avenue — trying to get better. Particularly where we are, right? We better look at everything.\"\nTo be frank, the Lions are awful at playing football this season. They can't block for their quarterback. When they can, the quarterback can't consistently create big plays. Defensively, the team simply allows too many big plays, and there's a head-scratching play on special teams every week.\nDETROIT NEWS\nStafford X-rays negative; no concussion for Mathis\nFor some of his answers Monday, Caldwell shouldered the blame. But when asked if he would assign blame to the coaches on his staff — offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi among them — he simply wouldn't.\n\"What I believe is we've won before, and that leads me to believe we can do it again,\" Caldwell said. \"We did it last year. That leads me to believe we can do it again. This year's not over yet. We usually only focus on one game, one game at a time.\"\nThis week, the focus is on the Kansas City Chiefs, whom the Lions will play in London on Sunday.\nHowever, the evaluation of the coaching staff and possibly front-office members will continue through the week. The Miami Dolphins fired head coach Joe Philbin after they lost in London to the New York Jets, a defeat that dropped them to 1-3.\nIf the Lions lose in London, they'll be 1-7, and even if that doesn't eliminate them mathematically from the postseason, they have two of the following four games against the Green Bay Packers. And no math would favor the Lions in those games.\nAs he said last week, Caldwell said the pressure he feels never changes.\n\"It's always been a day-to-day business, and it's no different today,\" he said Monday.\nWhether the duties will be different for Caldwell or his coaches in the near future, though, is unclear, as more losses could eventually force management or ownership to make difficult decisions.\n\"I can't foretell the future,\" Caldwell said. \"I know one thing, we're focused in on one game, one game at a time. What happens down the line, who knows?\"\nAnd as he walked away from the podium, Caldwell reminded reporters that no changes are imminent.\n\"We're evaluating, and that continues to be the case,\" he said. \"So, we make adjustments where we think they're necessary, and that deals with everything that we do.\"\nLions running back Theo Riddick and quarterback Matthew Stafford are both sacked, Stafford for a loss by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr, in the third quarter of the 28-19 loss to the Vikings on Sunday, Oct. 25, 2015, at Ford Field in Detroit.
