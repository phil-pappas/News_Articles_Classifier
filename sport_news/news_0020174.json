Maybe by writing and prematurely posting a \"season over\" obituary for the 2015 Texas Rangers, it could be possible to reverse-jinx them into winning Game Five and advancing to the ALCS. Here goes. \nYou knew it was going to end this way. 2014's M*A*S*H unit season aside, the Rangers have built neither a dynasty of Championships, nor a perpetually awful band of lovable losers, but rather some Rocky-esque story; overachieving against all odds to even be in the ring, getting in an early first knock-down against a superior opponent, refusing to succumb to injury, #NeverEverQuit-ing until we had no choice but to believe again, only to lose in the end (all the while yelling for Adrian in a tear-jerking fashion). \nThis team overcame a lot in the regular season ( outlined here ) and we meant it when we said things like \"house money\" and \"just happy we made it\" and \"I meanâ€¦ Toronto is really good.\" \nThen Adrian Beltre injured his back and all the big offensive threats injured their bats, and it was house money, right? But the meltdown was duct-taped and spray-painted over and mostly ignored because Robinson Chirinos and Rougned Odor and Yovani Gallardo and Hanser Alberto and Sam Dyson and Jake Diekman (Jake Diekman, you guys) all threw haymakers for two games in Toronto (Keone Kela nearly taking this comparison to the next level), and the team came home needing just one win to knock the Blue Jays out. \nIt's amazing how quickly \"House Money\" becomes \"My Money\" when someone tries to take it away. And Toronto did take most of it back; defeating the Rangers twice within 24 hours in Arlington. The 97,000-plus people who went to the ballpark hoping to see an ALDS clinch, only to find that the Rangers might just be out of spray paint and duct-tape may have felt a little robbed. \nBut there was still hope. Cole Hamels, former World Series MVP, was on the mound for Game Five. The Rangers had won against Marcus Stroman before; in Toronto in Game Two. Adrian Beltre was back in the lineup, Shin-Soo Choo found his mojo again in the Game Four loss, and Josh had gone two-for-three in Game Three. \nMaybe the Rangers would go on to upset the team picked by exactly all of the ESPN and Sports Illustrated experts to win the series. \nAlas, sometimes the storybook ending is just out of reach. Sometimes the movie ending will have to do. So: congrats to the @BlueJays on advancing to the ALCS! Hoping for a partially-Texas #ALCS. Looking at you, @Astros. \nTweet at Levi @ThreeTwoEephus with your best anti-jinx.
