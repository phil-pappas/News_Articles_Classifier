They’re playing from behind before they know what has hit them. \nOn the other side of the field, an early lead can serve to stoke the fire, providing a confidence boost that leads to bigger and better things. \nBut perhaps more importantly, it gets a home crowd fired up. \n“We want to get our crowd going early,” Swinney said. “The crowd’s great, but if you don’t give them something to cheer about, that doesn’t go well. That’s critical. \n“They become a factor because we’re making plays on the field.” \nLeggett, who has a team-best four touchdown receptions this season, says he and his teammate are inspired to keep the early mojo going. \n“They always say that we want to start fast and finish strong,” Leggett said. “And that’s what we’ve been doing.” Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1LvZvXc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:07:51.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
