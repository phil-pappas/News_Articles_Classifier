(AP) - An exhibit about New Hampshire's tradition of social dancing is coming to the State Library.\nThe exhibit, \"Traditional Dance and Music in New Hampshire: 1750-today\" traces the long history of contra and social dance music throughout the region, especially in the southwestern part of the state.\nIrish, Scottish, English and French Canadian traditions all contribute to New Hampshire's dance traditions.\nDances are similar to square dancing, but are generally performed in lines to live music played by fiddles and piano. Banjos, mandolins and guitars may also be heard.\nThe exhibit will be on display from Oct. 14-Nov. 25.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
