Smith, 24, was working traffic enforcement on I-75 when he pulled Brannon over after being alerted of a tag violation, Dutton said. A driver’s license check alerted Smith that Brannon should be considered armed and dangerous and was an escape risk, Dutton said.\nAuthorities were on the scene of a fatal shooting on northbound I-75 in Bartow County on Wednesday. Channel 2 Action News Dutton said Brannon also was wanted on outstanding warrants for trafficking in heroin, possession of a sawed off rifle, sale of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia from the Columbus Police Department.\nSmith requested backup, but before it arrived, Brannon “became non-compliant and Officer Smith deployed his Taser at him, Dutton said. He added the Taser “was ineffective and Brannon pointed a handgun at Officer Smith.” Smith fired at Brannon striking and killing him, Dutton said.\nThe incident was captured on the officer’s dash cam video, Dutton added.\nBrannon’s body will be transported to the GBI Medical Examiner’s Office in Decatur for an autopsy scheduled for Friday, Dutton said.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/14/d9/e9/CRShpgWXAAAH_-m.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:48:10.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
