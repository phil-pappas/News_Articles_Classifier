We'd still win close games because our pitching kept us in it. Our starters, our bullpen -- they're young, yeah, they're inexperienced. But they've got quality stuff, and that still pays off.\n\"That's why we've said all along -- no matter what the outcome of the season is, the light at the end of the tunnel is here, and this is going to be a bright future for this organization.\"\nMets second baseman Daniel Murphy had a three-hit game in Game 5, including a home run off Greinke. He also homered off Kershaw in both Game 1 and Game 4.\nOnly one player all regular season managed to hit a home run off both Greinke and Kershaw (Los Angeles Angels outfielder Kole Calhoun). Even so, Murphy credited his team's pitchers for giving the Mets a chance to win.\n\"What it says is how good our pitching staff is,\" Murphy said.\n  MLB: New York Mets 7, Colorado 3 MLB: Atlanta 6, N.Y.
