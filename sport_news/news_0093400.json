The Chairperson of Msheireb Properties Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser graced the opening ceremony.\nThe new cultural destination in the country marks the completion of the first phase of the project's Heritage Quarter. The Heritage Houses - commonly known as the Bin Jelmood House, Company House, Mohamed Bin Jassim House and Radwani House - have been restored and converted into four culturally significant museums using carefully sourced materials that retain the spirit and building techniques of the original structures.\nIn her official statement on the occasion, HH Sheikha Moza stressed the significance of the opening of the museums as a new chapter in the history of Msheireb Downtown Doha.\n \"Today Msheireb Downtown Doha enters a new chapter in its history, through which it will inspire young minds of the future with the wisdom and beauty of our past. With the opening of these museums, Msheireb reaches a milestone in fulfilling its vision of maintaining our unique architectural identity in Qatar, in a location that is set to be the vibrant heart of our capital,\" she remarked.\nAddressing the guests during the launch ceremony, Msheireb Properties CEO Engineer Abdulla Hassan al Mehshadi said the museums would reinforce Doha's position as a leading cultural destination in the Gulf region, and one that is highly significant on the international stage.\n\"After 6 years of construction, the physical manifestations of our vision are becoming tangible and real, and are increasingly visible as a major landmark on the Doha skyline. These museums are a testament to the exceptional quality of our work as world-class developers.\n\"Our intention is for Msheireb Museums to become centres of research, welcoming local, regional and international exhibitions and public educational and outreach programmes - with the broader objective of becoming a learning tool for future generations,\" he added.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:08:02.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
