This resulted in a fine of E40,000 and the confiscation of the vehicle in question. \n''Having considered detailed legal advice and the court's reasoned judgement, as supplied by Mr Cellino, the board determined that the decision of the Italian court constitutes a disqualifying condition under the Owners' and Directors' test. \n''Mr Cellino has until October 28 to appeal against the board's decision. Any such appeal would be heard by an independent panel.'' \nThe League has yet to confirm the length of Cellino's ban, but it is understood it will end in June next year - 12 months from the date of his conviction. Cellino is to appeal the decision. \nCellino served his previous Football League ban from December last year until May, having been found guilty in the same Italian court of failing to pay VAT on a yacht. \nCellino has three further criminal cases against him still outstanding in Italy. He has been charged with failing to pay tax on another yacht, with embezzlement in relation to the development of Cagliari's IS Arenas stadium and a tax case relating to former Cagliari players. \nPress Association Sport understands Cellino was informed by the League of his latest disqualification last Wednesday (October 14). In the days that followed he decided to cut the club's away ticket allocations and sacked Rosler. \nThe German departed Leeds after only 12 games in charge. He signed a two-year deal in May to replace the sacked Neil Redfearn, himself installed earlier this month as Evans' replacement at Rotherham. \nPrevious Leeds managers Brian McDermott, David Hockaday and Darko Milanic have all been sacked by Cellino. \nEvans said he had to pinch himself when contacted by Leeds and at first thought somebody was playing a joke. \nEvans, who steered Rotherham to back-to-back promotions, has been handed an initial contract until the end of the season. \n''There's very few times I'm lost for words. I'm very humble,'' Evans said. \n''Where it goes, we'll see. I need to win some football matches. \n''It's a massive task. There's some great men there, great managers, with great football knowledge, who have not been able to get this club winning football matches.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:09.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
