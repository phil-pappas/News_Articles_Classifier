After less than two years as athletic director and a number of controversial decisions, Patterson is out of a job.\nNew Texas President Greg Fenves announced the decision on a conference call Tuesday in what he called a resignation after a \"mutually-agreed upon decision.\" The school had used similar terminology to describe the firings of football coach Mack Brown and men's basketball coach Rick Barnes.\nFenves said it wasn't one or two particular concerns that led to this decision.\n\"This has been a decision that has been building over recent weeks, not a very long time,\" Fenves said. \"And I felt the risks of not accepting his resignation at this time and try to have him stay outweighed the benefits.\"\nPatterson's predecessor, DeLoss Dodds, spent 32 years in Austin building the most financially successful athletic department in the country. Patterson lasted 22 month.\nA \"PATTERSON MUST GO\" banner flew over Royal-Memorial Stadium for the home football opener Saturday, a week after Texas lost on the road to Notre Dame, 38-3. It was the second-most- lopsided loss in Texas history.\n\"It just reached critical mass,\" said one source familiar with the process, when asked was the determining factor in Patterson's dismissal.\nIn a statement released through the university, Patterson said that after considerable discussion with Fenves, the two \"agreed that our great university will be best served by a new athletic director. ... Change is never easy, but I have every confidence that UT Athletics will continue to thrive as it embraces the future.\"\nPatterson's legacy includes hiring the first black head coaches for men's sports in school history: Charlie Strong in football and Shaka Smart in basketball.\nIn a letter to Texas alums and students Tuesday night Fenves strongly backed the two, writing: \"I want you to know that I have full confidence in Coach Charlie Strong, Coach Shaka Smart, and all our other coaches.\"\nWhen Patterson was brought on board in November 2013, he received a five-year deal worth $1.4 million. Fenves said the university and Patterson have agreed to a separation agreement but declined to release terms pending approval by the UT board of regents.\nMike Perrin, a linebacker for legendary Darrell Royal in the 1960s and a high-profile Houston trial lawyer, was named the new interim AD. The move comes just two games into football season and with Texas in the midst of negotiating a new equipment and apparel deal with current provider Nike.\nAn industry source indicated that Fenves \"had a great deal of trust\" in Perrin and that a search for a permanent athletic director may not begin until after the new year or even the end of basketball season. Fenves did not give a timetable for a search.\nPerrin has been given the authority to evaluate high-level athletic department staff and make changes, a source said.\n\"I'm looking to working with Mike in developing and improving relationships with Longhorn Nation including our fans, season-ticket holders and alumni, many of whom consider athletics the front door to the university,\" Fenves said.\nFenves met multiple times with Patterson about his personal approach and management style, seen by many as brusque, impersonal and even arrogant. The original timetable called for Fenves to evaluate Patterson at the end of the calendar year. As the situation worsened, Fenves made the move after consulting with the UT board of regents Monday.\n\"The nature of the job is, with our fan base, people want to have kind of a warm and fuzzy feeling from people,\" said former Texas regent Tom Hicks of Dallas. \"Steve just didn't provide that.\"\nAbout 10,000 football season-ticket holders failed to renew this season after price increases and changes in policy. Even the AT&T Red River Showdown hasn't been immune, with more than 7,000 tickets remaining on the Texas side of Cotton Bowl stadium.\nIn many ways, Patterson operated as the NBA executive he had been for large stretches of his professional life. The bottom line was the bottom line.\nEven Texas' deep-pocketed money base was put off by what seemed Patterson's fixation with cash above else.\nHe cut back budgets for sports, including air travel. His foray into international branding, including a men's basketball opener in China and talk of a football game in Mexico, failed to generate much enthusiasm.\nHe distanced himself from a lawsuit involving current football assistant Joe Wickline and fellow Big 12 member Oklahoma State that has led to coaches being deposed under oath. Longtime athletic department employees started to exit, some by choice, some not.\nDespite having an undergraduate and law degree from Texas, Patterson was a surprise choice to replace Dodds.\nOliver Luck, then the AD at West Virginia and now a top executive at the NCAA, was viewed as the front-runner. But Patterson, then the athletic director at Arizona State University, impressed the Texas search committee with his business knowledge during an interview. He also showed an apparent willingness to make hard choices, including on the embattled Brown.\nThe year before, Hicks and current Texas regent Wallace Hall had spoken with Jimmy Sexton, the agent for Alabama coach Nick Saban about his interest in Texas. But Patterson and then UT president Bill Powers opted not to pursue Saban, the winner of four national championships.\nAfter Patterson fired Brown under pressure from donors and regents, he hired Strong from Louisville following flirtations with Baylor's Art Briles and UCLA's Jim Mora. Strong went 6-7 in his first year and dismissed nine players from the roster for violations of his \"core values.\"\nThis spring, Patterson fired Barnes, who accused the AD of leaking requests to shake up the coaching staff. Still, Patterson was able to land a hot coaching property in Virginia Commonwealth's Smart where schools like Maryland and UCLA had failed.\nDespite the two high-profile hires, Patterson never managed to win over the fan base. Fenves said he heard from \"hundreds, if not thousands of fans\" about the athletic department.\n\"I think Steve was hearing the same thing that I was,\" Fenves said. \"We discussed a number of these issues during our regular meetings.\"\nStaff Writer Brad Townsend contributed to this report\nInterim AD A look at Mike Perrin, named interim athletic director at Texas:\nName: Mike Perrin\nHometown: Cameron\nCurrently lives: Houston\nProfession: Attorney\nTexas connection: Played linebacker and defensive end for Darrell Royal from 1966-68, earning all-Southwest Conference honors. ...
