To make matters worse, Chicago already has used its two best starting pitchers, Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta.\nAdChoices All is not lost for the North Siders, though. Thirteen times in baseball history, a team losing the first two games of a best-of-seven series has come back to win, 10 of those times when the team lost the first two games on the road. That’s out of 76 and 50 opportunities, respectively, so the challenge is daunting, but it’s hardly impossible.\nMORE: Key moments from Game 2 | Syndergaard dazzles | Maddon's 'psychobabble' not likely to help sinking Cubs\n“We’re all about one-game winning streaks, very seriously,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said after Chicago’s 4-1 loss in Game 2 on Sunday night. “I really preach daily the one-day-at-a-time approach. I know it’s Psychobabble 101, but it actually works. So all I’m concerned about is the next game.”\nThe next game features Jacob deGrom on the mound for the Mets, with the right-hander already having outdueled Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke in this year’s playoffs. Opposing him will be Kyle Hendricks, who was 8-7 with a 3.95 ERA this year and only lasted 4 2/3 innings in his playoff debut last Saturday against the Cardinals.\nHow can the Cubs come back? They can start by building on the two losses they dealt deGrom earlier this year. Chicago scored four runs in five innings against the right-hander in May at Wrigley, and four more (three earned) in 5 1/3 innings in July in New York.\nHere are five Cubs who must deliver in Game 3 to start a rally and make this NLCS interesting.\n1 Anthony Rizzo © Provided by Sporting News The Cubs’ first baseman, who hit 31 home runs during the regular season, is 1-for-6 in the NLCS, having reached only on a hit-by-pitch, a walk and an infield hit when he won a footrace with Lucas Duda.\nRizzo actually has been a better hitter on the road (.929 OPS, 20 home runs) than at home (.861 OPS, 11 home runs) this year, but he touched up Jacob deGrom for a home run at Wrigley on May 11. Rizzo is 4-for-24 for the playoffs as a whole, so he may be due to get back in a groove. As it is, he’s hit two home runs, so even when not going well, his bat remains a big threat.\n2. Kyle Schwarber © Provided by Sporting News After launching another moonshot in Game 1 of the NLCS, a 459-foot rocket off Matt Harvey for his fourth homer of the playoffs, the rookie struck out three times against Noah Syndergaard in Game 2, then was fooled badly by Tyler Clippard as he hit a lazy fly ball to end the eighth inning.\n“We’re going to stick with our game plan,” Schwarber said. “We’re confident in ourselves. That’s the big part of it. We’re not going to lose confidence in ourselves and we’re not going to panic. It’s hard to look at it that we’re down two games. We need to go out and focus on winning the next game. That’s our mindset.”\n3. Starlin Castro © Provided by Sporting News Castro had been 0-for-6 in his career against Jacob deGrom until the third inning on July 2, when he singled to left field. Another single in his next at-bat put Castro at 2-for-8. In this series, the second baseman is 1-for-8 after going 0-for-4 in Game 2.\nBatting behind Rizzo in the No. 5 spot in the order, at least if Joe Maddon sticks with something resembling the same lineup, there is an onus on Castro to provide a bridge to the bottom of the order and get on base so that those at-bats are stressful for deGrom. Not that deGrom has trouble with runners on base, as he showed in Game 5 against the Dodgers, but the more pressure the Cubs can apply, the sooner Chicago can get him out of the game and try to work on the soft underbelly of the Mets’ middle relief.\n4. Kris Bryant © Provided by Sporting News When the Cubs came to New York in July, Bryant got the day off against Jacob deGrom and his replacement in the lineup, Jonathan Herrera, homered. Bryant hit his own two-run homer off deGrom at Wrigley in May, also drawing a walk and striking out on a Three True Outcomes day.\nBryant drove in the Cubs’ only run in Game 2 with an RBI double off Noah Syndergaard, after having gone 0-for-3 with a walk in Game 1. That brought the rookie third baseman to 5-for-27 in the playoffs. He has loved hitting at Wrigley Field, though, with a 1.037 OPS and 21 homers there during the regular season, compared with a .693 OPS and five homers on the road.\n5. Kyle Hendricks © Provided by Sporting News The best way to compete against Jacob deGrom is to match him with excellence on the mound, and that task falls to Hendricks, who pitched six scoreless innings, allowing only three hits and one walk with six strikeouts, in New York on June 30. That was a very different Mets lineup, but it should inspire confidence.\nOne of the three hits Hendricks allowed in that June start was a double to Daniel Murphy, currently the hottest hitter on Earth, who enters Game 3 needing a home run to tie Carlos Beltran’s major league record five-game postseason homer streak.\n“He’s good, man,” Hendricks said. “Pitching around him might be the best way right now. You’ve really got to be careful. He’s swinging really well right now. … I’m a little more calm than I have been in the past. I’ve been pitching pretty well, keeping the ball down, and I’ve been comfortable with my mechanics.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-19/nlcs-2015-cubs-mets-in-control-game-2-loss-noah-syndergaard-joe-maddon-psycho-babble-mlb-playoffs", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-19/nlcs-2015-mets-cubs-noah-syndergaard-thor-hairjake-arrieta-curtis-granderson-kyle-schwarber-strikeouts", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:01:47.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
