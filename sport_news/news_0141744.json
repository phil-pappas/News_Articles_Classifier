DOWLING CATHOLIC (5-0, 2-0) \nLast week: 1 \nJust as it looked like ranked and rolling Sioux City East would put up a fight on Friday night, Dowling took over like it has so many times over the last three season. Four different players rushed for touchdowns, Michael Zachary added two more scores receiving and one on a punt return, and a 14-14 game finished 59-21. Another ranked challenge awaits against Johnston this week. \n2. BETTENDORF (6-0, 1-0) \nLast week: 2 \nSenior Dax Emerson got his breakout game on Friday against Iowa City West, rushing for five touchdowns and 200 yards in a 48-20 win . The game was in hand early for Bettendorf, the runaway favorite in a middling Class 4A District 8, and the defense should be aggressive again in Week 7 against a North Scott team that managed just 10 points in two meetings last season. \n3. W.D.M. VALLEY (5-1, 2-0) \nLast week: 3 \nThe statistics look great in 4A-3 play, even if they don't mean much. Rocky Lombardi, Peyton Long and Will Rodruck all threw touchdown passes in a 69-0 win over Council Bluffs Abraham Lincoln, going 12-of-15 for 273 yards as a unit. Jevon Mason topped 100 yards on just seven carries and the defense forced four turnovers. The routs roll on.
