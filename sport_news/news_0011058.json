It looks like Dottie Sandusky is standing by her monster.\nSpeaking for the first time since her husband of 45 years, was charged with 51 counts of sexually abusing 10 boys, she took the stand Tuesday, where she staunchly defended the former Penn State assistant coach and refused to corroborate any of the horrific accusations made by her husband's eight alleged victims.\nThe petite, white-haired woman with a lime green blouse and sweater had attended the first day of Jerry Sandusky 's child molestation trial 10 days ago, but then disappeared from view until Tuesday morning, when she was photographed outside the Centre County district courthouse, setting the stage for her much-anticipated testimony in this case.\nShe was poised on the stand, pausing after questions and then offering testimony in a grandmotherly tone. She painted her husband as a good father and grandfather.\nJerry Sandusky, 68, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecutors alleged Sandusky used his connection to one of the nation's premier college football programs to groom the boys, whom he met through a charity he founded, for sexual relationships.\nAlthough speculation has swirled for months about whether Dottie Sandusky knew of her husband's alleged abuse, she testified that she had never seen or heard her husband engaging in anything inappropriate.\nOnce or twice a month, she testified, children - including some of the men who testified against Jerry Sandusky - would stay overnight with the Sanduskys. She said the couple's basement was not soundproof, called one accuser \"conniving\" and said many of the accusers were \"clingy\" around her husband.\nSome of the alleged victims testified that Jerry Sandusky would take them to the basement of his State College home, and abuse them. Last week, Victim No. 9 testified that he cried out for help as Sandusky raped him but that no one came to his aid.\nBut Dottie Sandusky testified that when children stayed over, they were given a choice of where to sleep: in the basement or on the first or second floors. She testified, in contrast to Victim 9's testimony, that she was able to hear sound coming from the basement while upstairs and that she never heard anyone calling out for help.\n\"My hearing is good,\" she said.\nShe testified that her husband would go downstairs to say good night to the children and admitted she didn't go down with him to tuck them in.\nBut she said she would go down to the basement \"at least once a day during football season\" and told the jury she has always shared a bed with Jerry Sandusky, claiming her husband went to bed before her \"90 to 95 percent of the time.\"\nShe characterized some of her husband's accusers, using terms like \"nice,\" but also offering criticism. She called Victim No. 4 - who testified Sandusky wrote him \"creepy love letters\" - as \"conniving,\" \"demanding,\" and a boy who was \"a troublemaker who didn't listen a whole lot.\"\n\"He had his problems,\" Dottie Sandusky continued.\nShe bluntly denied the accusation by Victim No. 4 that during the Alamo Bowl, Jerry Sandusky forced the boy to perform oral sex on him. Victim No. 4 testified that the only reason the incident didn't escalate was because Dottie Sandusky entered the hotel room.\nDottie Sandusky's testimony presented a different account.\n\"I came in one day. It was like a bathroom and dressing area. They were standing there. I said 'What's going on?' because Jerry was very upset and we had asked (Victim 4) if he wanted to go to a luncheon, which was $50, and he said he'd really like to go,\" she testified. \"And Jerry said 'OK,' and it was the day of the luncheon and (Victim 4) wouldn't go and Jerry knew I'd be very upset about spending the money.\"\nDottie Sandusky told the jury that nothing seemed inappropriate about the exchange.\n\"They were just standing in a little hallway, they were fully clothed,\" she said.\nAsked why so many witnesses, including key prosecution witness Mike McQueary, would tell the same lies about her husband, she said after long pause, \"I don't know what it would be for.\"\nPsychologist Elliot Atkins was called by the defense and told jurors that he interviewd Sandusky and diagnosed the disgraced coach with histrionic personality disorder - a condition described by medical experts as someone who craves attention and who acts inappropriately to gain it.\n\"Often these are people who did not have as much success in relationships - emotional or romantic - (and) relationships in life,\" Atkins testified, when questioned by defense lawyer Joe Amendola. The defense contends that the disorder explains some of his behavior among boys and the letters Sandusky sent to alleged victims.\nThere is still no official word on whether Sandusky will testify.\n“Stay tuned,” Amendola told reporters outside the courthouse Tuesday when asked if his client would take the stand. In a bizarre follow-up comment, Amendola compared the trial to a soap opera - first, \"General Hospital,\" before changing to, \"All My Children.\"\nBoth sides are scheduled to present closing arguments Wednesday.\nPresiding Judge John Cleland said he expected jury deliberations to begin Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:21:23.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
