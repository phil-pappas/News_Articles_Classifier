Of course, USC did them zero favors by embarrassing themselves on Thursday night. The Fighting Irish will need Clemson and Stanford to win out, in addition to finishing 11-1 themselves, in order to have any kind of chance of reaching the playoff. \nOf course, the big picture begins and ends with ND taking care of business themselves, and that’s exactly what they did versus a very game Naval Academy squad. You may associate the Navy with a prolific aerial assault ( Top Gun is timeless classic film), and this Notre Dame football game began with a flyover by four U.S. Navy F/A-18 Hornets. \nThe Navy football team however, doesn’t rely on the aerial attack. The Midshipmen attempted just five passes through the first three quarters. Navy instead relied on a ground-oriented approach that rolled up over 300 yards rushing. \nThe Irish got it down on the ground too, as C.J. Prosise has recorded 100 yards rushing in four of the last five games. He had three rushing touchdowns and 115 yards on his first 17 carries. According to Notre Dame football sports information department: \n“Prosise also ran for three TDs against Georgia Tech on Sept. 19. He joins Frank Lonergan (1902) and Reggie Brooks (1992) as the only running backs to have two three-rushing TD games for the Irish in the same season. Lonergan had four rushing TDs against both DePauw and Chicago Physicians and Surgeons. Brooks had three against both Purdue and USC. \nYes, Chicago Physicians and Surgeons, what a mighty college football powerhouse they once were. \nThe Irish went on to win quite handily 41-24; in full view of six scouts from the Orange Bowl. Here are a few more news, notes, nuggets and tidbits courtesy of the good folks and research teams at Notre Dame football media relations: \nJustin Yoon’s 52-yard field goal just before halftime ties for the third-longest in school history. Dave Reeve (1976 vs. Pittsburgh) and Kyle Brindza (2013 vs. Arizona State in Arlington, Texas) both have 53-yard field goals for the Irish. \nWill Fuller’s second quarter TD was the 23rd of his career, moving him into sole possession of fourth place in school history, passing the 22 by both Rhema McKnight (2002-06) and Derrick Mayes (1992-95). \nWe’ll be back shortly with more reaction from Notre Dame football players, and Notre Dame football Coach Brian Kelly. \n  sometimes   partnered with FOX   The website is also featured on News Now.
