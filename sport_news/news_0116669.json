Ex-Jets coach Rex Ryan liked to say that in his mind, games against divisional rivals counted as 1 1/2 games in the standings.\nFirst-year Jets coach Todd Bowles doesn’t believe in that, uh, new math.\n\"It’s one game for us,\" he said of Sunday’s contest at New England.\nTrue, and the Jets still will play at least 10 more games after that one. But it’s hard to overstate the importance of this one, even though Bowles continues to downplay it and most of his players seem to have adopted his \"just another game\" mantra.\n\"I think good teams don’t ride the emotional roller coaster,\" right guard Willie Colon said Monday, championing Bowles’ approach. \"They stay steady, they stay straight ahead, and they stay in their lane. They don’t look left and right, and see what other teams are going through.\"\nHmmmm. And why is this suddenly the Jets’ mind-set, Colon was asked.\n\"You know the answer to that,\" Colon said. \"You know why. New regime.\"\nBowles said, \"This is a division game for us. We want to win division games. It’s still one game at a time. Winning this game is not going to make us, losing this game is not going to break us. We’re going to take the same approach we’ve been taking. You don’t get up or down for one game because it means you haven’t been playing hard in the first place. We’re going to continue to do our job and get better as a team, and we’ll go forward from there.\"\nWell, that quote certainly won’t find its way on to any bulletin boards at One Patriots Place, unlike some of Ryan’s colorful comments about New England, or those of some of his players. And yes, as boring as Bowles’ statements might be, the real statement will be made one way or the other Sunday.\nConsider that although New England is 5-0 and the Jets are 4-1, the host Patriots still are favored by 9 1/2 points. That likely is because, other than a Week 2 victory at Indianapolis, the Jets don’t have any wins that most observers would consider impressive.\nThe Jets’ victories have come against Indianapolis, Cleveland, Miami and Washington, which have a cumulative record of 9-14. Not one of those teams is above .500.\nGranted, New England hasn’t exactly run an early-season gauntlet, either. Their victims — Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Jacksonville, Dallas and Indianapolis — have a cumulative record of 13-16, although the Steelers at least have a winning record and the Patriots beat them before Ben Roethlisberger was injured.\nStill, for those outside of the Jets’ locker room, a victory for Gang Green on Sunday would be irrefutable proof that Bowles’ new approach has made them legitimate contenders instead of a bunch of talented and well-schooled opportunists who merely have fattened up on an easy schedule that still has plenty of seemingly tasty morsels left. (The Jets have three games remaining against the woeful AFC South, for instance.)\nNo doubt Bowles is tuning out the critics and all the outside noise, and perhaps that’s the best approach. For all of Ryan’s emotions during Patriots Week, the Jets lost seven of the last eight games against New England during his reign.\nBowles believes this week of practice will be the same as the previous ones in terms of intensity, and that’s his goal.\n\"You want them amped up on Sunday,\" he said, \"but as far as playing the game or playing a specific person, you try to treat everybody the same and we go about our business the same way. We don’t let that [determine] what we do in practice or what we do on Sunday.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:10:41.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
