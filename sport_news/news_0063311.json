The last five were healthy scratches.\nHightower is out for the first time this season, but he was ruled out yesterday. Flowers is out for the fifth consecutive game, and it's the second time the shoulder has played a factor. Wendell is out for the fifth consecutive game, and it's the second time he is a healthy scratch. Though Wendell isn't on the injury report this week, he is still working on his conditioning.\nJohnson is out for the fourth time this season and the third in a row. Dobson is out for the second straight game. Thornton is out for the third time (all three times on the active roster), including two straight. Grissom is the biggest surprise of the bunch, as he is inactive for the first time.\nTavon Wilson is in the lineup for the second time this season. He missed the last two games. Jon Bostic and Rashaan Melvin will make their Patriots debuts.\nDion Lewis (abdomen) is active despite being on the injury report.\nAndrew Luck (shoulder) is also active for the Colts.\nDion Lewis goes through pregame workout\nHarold Nash led Dion Lewis through a pregame workout that would indicate Lewis is a game-time decision. In this case, though, as the Patriots have fully expected Lewis to play for a couple days, they're just making sure the abdomen is still good to go. Lewis did blocking drills and ran some routes before leaving the field.\nBrandon LaFell working out before the game\nBrandon LaFell has made the trip for the second week in a row, and he is working out on the field at the moment. LaFell is eligible to come off the PUP list this week, and it looks like the Patriots are trying to get him used to the pregame routine, which is interesting, especially because Bill Belichick rarely brings injured players on the road.\nRyan Wendell is running through another intense pregame routine under Moses Cabrera's watch. It looks like they're trying to improve his conditioning after missing the first four games of the season and a number of practices in August due to his recovery from surgery and in September due to the illness, so Wendell might not be ready tonight.\nGood evening from Lucas Oil Stadium\nHello from Lucas Oil Stadium, where the Patriots (4-0) and Colts (3-2) are less than three hours shy of kicking off their Week 6 showdown.\nIt's a beautiful day here in Indianapolis, but the roof will be closed for the game, which makes that since-nixed blimp stunt even more confusing.\nJimmy Garoppolo, Julian Edelman, Ryan Wendell and David Andrews are warming up on the field, but it's otherwise quiet at the moment. It's kind of a weird sight here, as the lights are still off in the building.\nDont'a Hightower and Trey Flowers have already been ruled out. The rest of the inactives are expected to be announced at 7 p.m. Dion Lewis, as we reported earlier, is good to go despite suffering an abdomen injury during practice this week.\nKeep it here, and we'll have you up to speed with everything happening from the stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:42:48.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
