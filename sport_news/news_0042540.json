For six years, he was a Blue Bomber -- a former CFL Most Outstanding Defensive Player -- but he's still angry and disappointed at the way it ended and he's got a bit of extra jump in his step heading into Friday's showdown at TD Place.\n\"Whenever they get the opportunity to play against me, I want to make their lives a living hell -- just because of how everything happened,\" said Johnson. \"I hope and pray if the game is on the line, I'll be the guy who'll make the play for us to win the game.\"\nJohnson was an integral part of Swaggerville, as much a state of mind as a nickname for the Blue Bombers defence. He signed with the RedBlacks before the 2014 season after not being offered a contract by Winnipeg.\n\"I already had kind of figured they had no interest in offering me a new contract,\" said Johnson. \"They called and left me a voicemail. They've never spoken to me since that day about not offering me a contract. They left me a voicemail and left it at that. That was after six years there.\n\"It's a love-hate relationship. I appreciate them for allowing me to play for six years and being able to accomplish the things I accomplished there. But I don't respect the way they went about telling me they weren't going to bring me back. I understand it's a business, but it'll always be a grudge for the way they went about it.\"\nIt still bothers Johnson when he thinks about what might have been in Winnipeg. He's puzzled that management, in 2012, ripped apart what he thought was a great nucleus.\n\"We had the team to get to where we wanted to be,\" said Johnson. \"We went through the growing pains -- the seasons of 4-14 and all that -- and we got to 2011 with the same group of guys and started the season off great (winning seven of their first eight games). Coming off a year where we went 4-14, we had the fans behind us, the city behind us -- we had everything going for us -- we made it to the Grey Cup.\n\"For whatever reason, in 2012 they started to dismantle the defence that was No. 1 in the league in every single category -- they took it apart piece by piece, player by player. That's why they are where they are now.\"\nWhat happened in Winnipeg as they were building their way into a spot in the Grey Cup -- a game they lost 34-23 to the B.C. Lions -- is similar to what's happened in Ottawa, says Johnson.\n\"Being in this situation, it reminds me a lot of what we went through in Winnipeg,\" he said. \"We went 4-14 in 2010, but we lost nine games by three or four points or less. The same happened here last year; we lost a lot of close games. Now we're arguably one of the best teams in the East.\"\nThe RedBlacks will clinch a playoff spot with a win, while the Bombers are fighting for their playoff lives. With five wins, they're in a dogfight with the B.C. Lions and are getting into must-win territory.\n\"You never take a team like that for granted, especially when they're the underdog, they're hungry and they're trying to make things happen,\" said RedBlacks receiver Ernest Jackson. \"They're coming in here ready to play and we have to come in the same way.\"\n\"They have a good football team, but we feel if we play well, they can't beat us,\" said Johnson. \"It's a matter of us going out and taking care of business and not putting ourselves in a position to fail.\"\nTwitter: @ TimCBaines\nBURRIS FEELIN' GOOD AT 40\n With four games left in a regular-season that has placed Ottawa RedBlacks quarterback Henry Burris in the conversation to be the CFL's Most Outstanding Player, he says he doesn't feel 40.\n“I don't have to take Viagra or Cialis or nothing like that,” said Burris on Thursday, a day before the RedBlacks face the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. “I still have energy in me. I still feel good.”\nWith 4,365 yards in passing for the 8-6 RedBlacks, Burris still has a year left on his contract. And maybe he will play even beyond that.\n“(I'll play) as long as the body tells me I can,” he said. “As long as I can still buy time with my feet and get away from those big, ugly, mean guys like (Bombers defensive lineman) Bryant Turner trying to kill me back there.\n“Why not? I still feel healthy, I still have the arm to get it there and I still have the passion to play this game. If you have that, there's no need to let go. If you let go too early, you're kicking yourself 10 years down the road.”\nRedBlacks' Jovon Johnson wants to make Bombers' lives 'a living hell'\nBy Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 03:59 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 15, 2015 06:35 PM EDT\nJovon Johnson says if the Ottawa RedBlacks play well Friday night, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers \"can't beat us.\"\nFor Johnson, who is having a very good season as a RedBlacks defensive back, there are emotions at play.
