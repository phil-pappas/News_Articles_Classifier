Senior BJP leader and BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur made it clear that a bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan was not possible till the relations improved between the two nations, something which has already been conveyed to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman. He clarified that the final call on the issue would be taken by the two governments. “I think the BCCI president is competent enough to discuss the matter with the PCB chairman. However, the final call is always taken after discussing it with the Union Government… when the two governments start talking to each other, only then the BCCI and the PCB can think of having a bilateral series. As of now, I don’t see it (cricket series) happening,” he said, dismissing reports of an informal meeting between BCCI and PCB officials in Delhi tomorrow. However, sources said, Manohar had a quiet meeting with Khan at Hotel Trident in Mumbai in the evening where they discussed the possibility of renewing the cricketing relations. Also, Khan is likely to hold talks with some of the top Union Ministers, including Finance Minister Arun Jaitely, on Tuesday. There is also a possibility that Khan might meet Thakur and IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla. India and Pakistan cricket boards had signed a pact for six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023 in April last year on the sidelines of an International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting in Melbourne. The first series under the proposed agreement was to be played in December in the UAE. Condemning the attack, BJP leaders, including union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said in democracy everyone should practice restraint and tolerance. “The way there is a rise in the cases of intolerance, the Shiv Sena must avoid doing this. They should show some tolerance,” said Rajiv Pratap Rudy. “Despite the right to protest as mentioned in the Constitution, it should be done in a peaceful manner,” said Minister of State for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:24:40.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
