We know all about Dan Campbell's energy infused into this team. But But here are five statistical and tactical changes that supported how they played Sunday and will have to against Houston again:\n1. First downs. Bill Walsh said the simple way most quarterbacks fail is they don’t get enough first downs. Look at the previous game against the Jets. The Dolphins were 0-for-12 on third downs. Against the Titans? They were five-for-9. Now, the Jets have a great defense compared to the Titans good one (it entered first against the pass and 23 rd against the run). But as Lazor said about the third-down effectiveness:, “Number one we didn’t have many third downs; which is the best third downs, none. I think we only had nine for the game and some of them were short ones. The way we played first and second downs in the game lent itself to having success and moving the ball.” Let’s look at the first down in the first half. The Dolphins ran nine times for 49 yards. That’s a 5.5-yard average. Ryan Tannehill also completed nine of 11 on first down in the first half for 112 yards a touchdown and an interception. That’s a 10-yard average per attempt. Those first-down running and passing stats are telling numbers for why the offense did so well.\n2. Taking advantage of opponent’s weaknesses. This is how good teams win. They find the weakness and expose it. No one did a better job Sunday than Cam Wake. He went against 21-year-old rookie Jeremiah Poutasi, a third-round pick. He might develop into a good player. But Wake did what he should when now healthy against a rookie. OK, he did more than anyone should expect him to do. He had four, second-quarter sacks in a dominant performance. Tennessee benched Poutasi at halftime and brought in veteran James Meredith. Wake didn’t have any more sacks because Meredith tackled him twice for holding penalties. Wake would have had six sacks in the game without the penalties. Your greatness beating opposing weakness is a simple way to win and one the Dolphins hadn’t done much this year.\n3. The occasional use of a fullback. For the last year, defensive tackle Earl Mitchell has joked with offensive coordinator Bill Lazor to put him in at fullback. He played there in high school and college. Well, one day Lazor said he had a play in for him. On Sunday, Mitchell was used five times as a blocking fullback. “I did OK,’’ he said, making a few blocks and missing a couple. It wasn’t just Mitchell, though. With tight end Dion Sims back, he was put at fullback on occasion to provide another blocker in running and passing situations. This isn’t a headline move. It’s just another indication of a team attempting to be more physical.\n4. The emergence of Rishard Matthews. And not just as a receiver, though holding onto his first-down catch on the opening drive while being flattened over the middle was as big a play as the team had all day considering their awful starts this year. There was also this: Before the game, Lazor went to Matthews. “I asked him personally when he had opportunities to block, I wanted it to show up because the guy is a physical presence … and he rose to the challenge at the end of the game, we asked him to crack block; he did and he was proud to tell me he got it done so, when you challenge him with something he’s taking pride in getting it done.”\n5. The use of two tight ends. This was in good part because Dion Sims was healthy again. Campbell, a former tight end, said, \"I'm trying to get four tight ends in the game.\" Two allows you to have versatility and find mismatches with the defense. Jordan Cameron is a fine receiving tight end who's trying to become a blocking one, too. Sims is better at that. So this allowed the offense to change by some degree and use those aspects of each to their best talent.\n Miami Dolphins Bill Lazor Rishard Matthews Tennessee Titans Earl Mitchell Jordan Cameron", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a2e50/turbine/sfl-hyde5-five-tactical-changes-that-helped-dolphins-play-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:07:55.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
