Cory Joseph added 14 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 13 points and Luis Scola 12. \nAndrew Wiggins, the reigning NBA rookie of the year led the Wolves (0-3) with 21 points in 18 minutes. His older brother Nick, who was signed by Minnesota last month, scored four points in the final five minutes. He almost had six, but his final shot at the buzzer was waived off after originally being declared good. \nThe Raptors and Wolves meet again in Ottawa on Wednesday as part of the NBA's Canada Series, which featured soldout games in Winnipeg and Vancouver, and then Ottawa and Montreal. The Raptors play the Washington Wizards in Montreal to cap the series on Oct. 23. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:20:58.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
