Instead, he plans to use his retirement years to do all the things that his hectic schedule now prevents or limits him from doing.\n\"It's time to be able to not be focused 100 percent seven days a week on the NASCAR side,\" Stewart said. \"There's other things that I want to do the rest of my life.\"\nSo what are those things? What are his goals for his final season? And what will he do once he officially hangs up his racing helmet at the end of 2016?\nHere's a look.\n1. Tony the team owner\n© Provided by Sporting News Stewart has always had a bit of a rocky relationship with NASCAR officials. Throughout his 17-year driving career, he has never hesitated to speak his mind and call out officials when he disagrees with a rule or call. He has probably been on probation more than any other driver throughout his career.\nHe warned NASCAR Wednesday that that wouldn't change.\n\"NASCAR is probably going to be the most disappointed of everybody today because they aren't getting rid of me. They have to deal with me as an owner,\" Stewart said. \"There's still the opportunity to get fined and there's still the opportunity to be put on probation, just like always.\"\nAs the co-owner of Stewart-Haas Racing, one of the sport's elite teams, Stewart will be more involved in the day-to-day operations and heavily involved in key decisions surrounding four Sprint Cup teams.\nAnd he proved over the years that he's pretty good at building and running winning teams. In addition to SHR's two Cup championships, Tony Stewart Racing has won more than 20 national championships. He also owns to racetracks and an open-wheel series.\n\"I'm definitely as competitive as an owner as I am as a driver,\" Stewart said. \"It's hard to take somebody that's competitive and take them out of a competitive environment. That's the great thing is, I'm not having to do that.\n\"I'm still going to be competitive with the Cup team as an owner. I'm still going to be competitive as a track owner, as a series owner and as a dirt-track owner as well. That fire is still there, and that's what makes this transition much easier for me is I'm not sitting here trying to figure out what I'm going to do and I'm not trying to find something to be competitive with. It's already there, we've already been doing it, it's just a change in direction on the Cup side.\"\n2. Formula One\n© Provided by Sporting News Gene Haas, Stewart's partner at Stewart-Haas, is building the first U.S.-based F1 team since 1986. Haas introduced his first driver — Romain Grosjean — on Tuesday. Haas still has one more driver to hire.\nStewart joked about who that might be.\n\"The one variable he left out, I know it was just probably a miscue, but he announced his full‑time driver next year in the F1 car,\" Stewart said. \"He didn't announce his second driver for the F1 team, and you're looking at him.\"\nStewart was kidding, but he does plan to travel the world attending F1 events with Haas and his new American team.\n\"I really am looking forward to the Haas F1 program and being able to go and hang around with Gene,\" he said. \"Those cars absolutely fascinate me.\"\n3. Racing, racing and more racing\n© Provided by Sporting News Just because he is retiring from Sprint Cup racing doesn't mean Stewart will stop driving racecars. Far from it.\n\"I'm still going to race,\" he said. \"I'm not retiring from racing, I'm just retiring from the Cup Series.\"\nWhat kind of car will Stewart race? Modifieds? Dirt-track cars? Sports cars?\n\"All of the above,\" he said. \"… There's great racing across the country and there's neat marquee events that you look at in the paper, and you're like, 'Man, it would be really cool to try that.' We're now going to have that opportunity in a couple years to do that.\"\nOne thing Stewart won't do is run the Indy 500 again. He's done the Indy/Charlotte double twice — in 1999 and 2001 — and hinted at possibly running the 500 again. Asked if he might attempt the Indy 500 again once he retires from NASCAR, Stewart responded with an emphatic \"No.\"\n4. Sprint cars\n© Provided by Sporting News A key question is whether Stewart will return to sprint-car racing. It's where he got his start and has won dozens of championships. But it's also the source of much pain and suffering.\nStewart was racing a sprint car at Southern Iowa Speedway in August 2013 when he severely broke his right leg in an accident. The injury led to four surgeries and caused him to miss the final 15 races of the 2013 season.\nWhen he returned to sprint-car racing in 2014, tragedy struck. Stewart was racing at Canadaigua Motorsports Park in upstate New York when the car he was driving struck and killed 20-year-old driver Kevin Ward Jr., who had walked out onto the track. Stewart was cleared of any criminal charges, but missed three races while dealing with grief over the accident. He still faces a wrongful death suit from Ward's family.\nStewart has not raced a sprint car since. Would he consider returning to his first love?\n\"Maybe. Probably,\" he said.\n\"If there's opportunities to go race somewhere in the area, then we'll look at that, and if there's big marquee events that we want to single out and want to go to, we'll juggle that as well. We really haven't set an agenda or a schedule of what we want to do. We'll figure it out as we go.\"\n5. Truckin'\n© Provided by Sporting News Stewart also hasn't ruled out running races in the Xfinity Series, where he has 11 career victories, seven at Daytona.\nHe also has two Camping World Truck Series win and wouldn't mind running some of those events, particularly the annual dirt-track showdown at his own Eldora Speedway.\n\"I don't know how I'm going to pull that off because I lose my mind every day that we're there for that race as it is, being a track owner,\" he said. \"But that's something that I would like to do, and that may be something we get to do as well.\"\n6. TV?\n© Provided by Sporting News Jeff Burton headed to the TV booth when his career ended. Jeff Gordon will make the same move next year, following in the footsteps of Darrell Waltrip, Rusty Wallace and Dale Jarrett.\nStewart won't be making the same move. While he did 15 Xfinity races for TNT years ago, he says he doesn't want to work that hard.\n\"For anybody that doesn't understand what kind of concentration and focus you have to have driving a race car, it's exactly the same when you're trying to call a race,\" he said. \"I don't know that I'm going to dedicate that much time to it. I still have a big to‑do list of things that I want to do outside of Cup racing. Going to the TV booth wouldn't allow for me to do that.\"\n7. No rocking chairs\n© Provided by Sporting News One things Stewart won't do is sit on the porch relaxing. And he doesn't want any kind of official retirement tour.\nAs Jeff Gordon put the finishing touches on his career this season, he was lavished with gifts and tributes at nearly every stop. Stewart doesn't want that kind of treatment.\n\"You can save your gifts,\" he said. \"I've got enough rocking chairs at home as it is.\"\nStewart likes what tracks and fans have done for Gordon this season, but says he doesn't deserve the same attention and recognition. And he doesn't want to receive gifts and praise every week.\n\"I'm not really that kind of guy,\" he said. \"I'm content to go race and be around the racing community and the racing family and be around our fans. They can just send me a note from the track president and say, 'Hey, thank you,' and that'll be sufficient for me.\"\n8. Annoying the media\n© Provided by Sporting News Stewart has a love-hate relationship with media members. He likes to pick at reporters and joke around, but he hates standing behind his hauler or sitting at a table answering question after question. Nothing irritates him more than having to answer the same questions over and over, and he often makes that clear.\nSo, once he retires, he doesn't have to do it anymore. And he made it clear Wednesday he doesn't plan to spend the next few months or all of next year talking about retirement.\n\"Speak now or forever hold your peace,\" he said Wednesday.\nUnlike Gordon, one of the sport's most accessible drivers, Stewart doesn't plan to visit the media center each week — unless he has a good reason.\n\"I mean, I might stroll through there to give you guys a hard time once in a while because I can, but if I come to the media center it better be because I ran in the top three or top five or did something,\" he said. \"I'm not going to go there to talk about what I'm going to do the year after because we already know what I'm going to do the year after. That's why we're talking about it today.\n\"If you guys miss me that bad, you guys can send me text messages and say we really miss you in the media center.\"\n9. Going home\n© Provided by Sporting News With fewer races to run and fewer commitments, Stewart hopes to spend more time in Columbus, Ind. Stewart has won the Brickyard 400 twice at nearby Indianapolis Motor Speedway and calls it two of the biggest victories of his career.\nHe has only spent 21 days there this year, but plans to be home much more often after retiring. Especially this time of year.\n\"I don't want to sound like a softy because I'm not, but I like fall and I like being home when the leaves change,\" he said. \"I don't like long walks on the beach and candlelit dinners and all that, but I do like watching the leaves change at home, so I am looking forward to that.\"\n10. Badgering NASCAR officials\n© Provided by Sporting News As stated earlier, Stewart has a long history of encounters with NASCAR officials.\nBut he also has a good relationship with most of them and has the ear of the sport's top executives. Expect him to use that to his advantage, especially when it comes to being heard on rules changes, competition issues and the future of the sport.\nHe expects to spend a lot of time in the NASCAR hauler — for reasons both good and bad.\n\"I think there's a really good possibility I'll get invited to the trailer like I used to years ago. I see that being very realistic,\" he said. \"If you go in the trailer and you see my name embroidered on a chair you'll know I'm thinking the same way.\"\nStewart sent texts to NASCAR president Mike Helton and vice president Steve O'Donnell before his announcement Wednesday warning them, \"I'm still going to be at the track harassing everybody, so nobody is getting a free pass now.\"\n11. Just hanging around the track\n© Provided by Sporting News Asked where he will spend race day, Stewart joked, \"I'll probably be on some fan's motorhome on the backstretch promoting our sponsors.\" And he likely didn't mean Mobil 1 and Bass Pro Shops. (Teammate Kevin Harvick is sponsored by Budweiser.)\nAs a team owner, Stewart has no idea yet where he will be stationed on race day. It could be in the pits, on a pit box, on the spotter's stand or in the team hauler. Or he might just be roaming around the garage or infield.\n\"I got a taste of it when I got hurt and when we finally got to go back to the track,\" he said. \"I got a taste of what it was like (and) … I'm glad I sit behind the steering wheel still because sitting on the pit box is nerve‑racking.\n\"You don't want to try to talk to anybody because they're all working, and if I make them that on edge I'm hoping that they'll be a little calmer when I'm not there.\"\nStewart likely will be in contact with his drivers but doesn't know from where.\n\"I'm used to having a radio where I can talk to those guys and hear what's going on,\" he said. \"I'll be wherever they want me. Wherever I'm going to be the biggest asset, that's where I'll be. If I'm not going to be an asset, I'll hang around the backstretch and have fun and go sightseeing.\"\n12. Do some stuff\n© Provided by Sporting News As he continued to recover mentally and physically during the past offseason, Stewart decided to have a little fun. So he hopped on a tractor and became the guy who prepares the dirt track for the annual Chili Bowl sprint-car race. He's also been known to drive the tractor at his own Eldora Speedway.\nWhen Stewart broke in his leg 2013, missing 15 races, he had a custom-made scooter built, complete with sponsor logos, and motored around the track.\nStewart always loves doing cool things like that, and he plans to do more.\n\"Yeah, yeah, the cool factor is always fun. That's why Clint (Bowyer) and I may be the only two drivers that own flamethrowers in the series,\" he said. \"There's definitely some cool stuff we want to do, and not all of it is revolving around driving a racecar, either. There's other things.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656646-tony-stewart-retiring-most-memorable-moments-2011-chase-championship-danica-patrick-kevin-harvick", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-09-30/tony-stewart-retirement-decision-at-peace-injury-kevin-ward-accident-tragedy-performance", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-09-30/clint-bowyer-replacing-tony-stewart-2017-retirement-stewart-haas-racing-michael-waltrip"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:47:57.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
