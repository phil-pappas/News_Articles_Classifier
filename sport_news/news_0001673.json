He was 12-7 with a 3.51 ERA in 24 starts this year and lost to Houston in the AL wild-card game.\nTanaka was on the disabled list from April 23 to June 3 with right wrist tendinitis and a forearm strain, then missed a September start because of a strained right hamstring.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/334784981/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:49:52.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
