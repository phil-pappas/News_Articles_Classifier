Bruce Rauner and the Democratic-controlled legislature continue the stalemate over the budget, one effect has been that the state has stopped sending out its portion of the motor fuel tax to individual communities.\nFor Glencoe, that means the village did not receive its August payment. In July, the amount was $12,364, according to village documents. Those same documents indicate the village does not expect to receive motor fuel taxes from the state for the rest of the year.\nVillage Finance Director Dave Clark said that if there is no resolution to the budget issue any time soon, other tax revenues that come from the state to municipalities such as the 911 tax on cell phones could also be delayed.\nThese examples, along with the governor advocating the state cut the portion of the local government distributive fund which sends state income tax dollars to individual communities, has led to a collective feeling among Glencoe officials that less revenue might be coming from Springfield for quite some time.\nClark said 21 percent of the general fund budget comes from programs administered by the state, which translates into $3.4 million.\n\"If the state decides to be cute and hold those dollars, those are going to be major impacts that we are going to feel,\" said Village Manager Phil Kiraly. \"We need to be thoughtful about those kinds of things.\"\nGov. Rauner, set a deadline Editorial Board \"If you want me to raise taxes, I'll do it. But I'm going to do it with reforms. If you don't want any reforms with it, you do the tax hike. You've got a super-majority. You've proven that you can do things without my support. You've overridden my veto on a number of items. Please go ahead. But...\n\"If you want me to raise taxes, I'll do it. But I'm going to do it with reforms. If you don't want any reforms with it, you do the tax hike. You've got a super-majority. You've proven that you can do things without my support. You've overridden my veto on a number of items. Please go ahead. But...\n(Editorial Board) A change in state funding might be only one aspect of a cloudy financial picture for the village. Kiraly conceded in two different meetings last week that village revenues are not growing at the same pace as expenses. Plus, Clark added property tax revenue is expected to remain pretty much stagnant over the next couple of years.\nAmid the uncertainty, dealing with financial issues both near and far is one item on the table for the board of trustees, which engaged in a workshop Sept. 15, looking to establish a series of long-range strategic financial goals to help weather the statewide financial storm..\nThe nature of these goals remains vague, but it does send a signal the responsibilities of the board may be changing.\n\"This is a seismic shift in the level of engagement by the board. It is a change in the role,\" said Trustee Scott Pearce. \"We are trying to bring to the surface complexity in a simple way and openly trying to discuss tradeoffs trying to arrive at better results.\"\nOne of the options on the table to change the financial picture could be a shift to a home rule type of government. At the Sept. 17 Committee of the Whole board meeting, village attorney Steve Elrod gave a presentation on the intricacies of municipal law, including home rule government.\nIllinois communities with a population of higher than 25,000 or more automatically have home rule authority, but that does not apply to Glencoe, which had a population of approximately 8,854, according to the latest estimate provided by the U.S. Census.\nHowever, Glencoe could obtain home rule status if voters were to sign off in a referendum. In 1988, Glencoe voters decisively rejected such a measure. The matter was explored again in 2005 by a task force, but never went in front of the voters.\nOn the other hand, allowing greater ability to generate income is why home rule can also be a controversial matter, as has been the case in Winnetka. Home rule went into effect there in 2005. In 2013, the Winnetka Village Council issued $16.5 million worth of bonds in 2013 for stormwater improvements which did not have to go through the voters.\n\"Everyone is going to have concern over the bond issue,\" acknowledged Trustee Trent Cornell. \"There has to be a counterbalance of what the potential revenue benefits will be. There has to be meat on the bones.\"\nElrod said home rule government is not necessarily a preference for everyone, as voters in some communities, such as Barrington in 2014, have defeated measures to use it.\nThe village board is expected to continue to look at home rule and whether it could be appropriate for Glencoe.\n\"At some future meeting date, we will probably decide whether we are interested in looking at this issue,\" Levin said.\nDaniel I.
