He was 79. A statement on behalf of Jones says Ingels died Wednesday in the Tarzana neighborhood following complications from a stroke. Beginning in the 1960s Ingels appeared in episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and \"Bewitched\" and co-starred in the 1962 series \"I'm Dickens, He's Fenster.\" He also had small movie roles. The raspy-voiced actor later did voice work for hundreds of cartoons, commercials and video games. He voiced Pac-Man in the 1982 animated series. Ingels also ran a talent agency that booked movie stars such as John Wayne and Cary Grant for TV commercials. He married Jones in 1977.
