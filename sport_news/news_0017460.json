Their only previous meeting was a 2012 scrimmage the Falcons won by 30 points. But both teams compete in the Division 6 South region. Mashpee currently ranks second in the South Shore League Small, while SJP II is in a three-way tie for first in the Catholic Conference Small. Both teams have key divisional losses that could make a conference championship unlikely. The Falcons and Lions are both still on track to make the playoffs by finishing second in their conferences. Failing that, they’ll have to battle for at-large playoff spots. St. John Paul II is sixth and Mashpee eighth in the latest Division 6 South standings. The two teams square off at 7 tonight at Massachusetts Maritime Academy in Buzzards Bay. While a loss might not impact making the playoffs, a win could decide playing at home or away for the first round of the tournament. “They have a great football program,” St. John Paul II coach John Muldoon said of Mashpee. “Coach (Matt) Triveri does a great job over there. They’re big, they’re physical, they’re fast.” Mashpee (3-2, 2-1 SSL-Small) senior running back Deshaun Dias has been phenomenal this season, putting up over 1,000 combined passing and receiving yards with 15 touchdowns in five games. His four rushing touchdowns against Hull in Week 5 upped his career total to 43, the most in school history. “He has a perfect build, I think, for a back,” Triveri said of Dias. “He’s become a better cutter. The kid runs hard, and he wants the ball in his hands. He gets better as the game goes on.” Muldoon called Dias “probably the best back on the Cape right now.” Mashpee quarterback Nick Carpenter and running back Jason Andrade also scored in Mashpee’s 42-20 win against Hull. Carpenter also had an interception and forced a fumble recovered by Jack Rodriguez. Meanwhile, the Lions (3-2, 3-1 Catholic Small) are coming off a shutout loss to Cohasset, the defending Division 6 champion which beat Mashpee in Week 4. SJP II held the Skippers to just a field goal in the first half but couldn’t get its offense going. By comparison, Mashpee trailed Cohasset 7-0 at halftime but managed a touchdown in the third quarter. SJP II has spread its offense around this season, particularly since sophomore Devan Harrison returned to quarterback in Week 3 after suffering an undisclosed injury late in preseason. Harrison has targeted both Keith and Cole Campbell, who’ve combined for five touchdowns this year. “They have a really talented group of receivers,” Triveri said of the Lions. “That Cole Campbell kid is fast, aggressive.” Senior Johnny Warden might be the most versatile player on the Lions’ roster. He opened the season at quarterback before Harrison reclaimed the spot, and this season he’s produced touchdowns via the rush, the pass and the catch. Warden, the Campbells and Timmy Jordan comprise a four-player attack at the heart of the Lions’ offense. “He gives us another weapon on the outside by having Warden on the outside,” Muldoon said of Harrison. “Our belief is Johnny Warden is going to play wide receiver in college.” This will be the Lions’ second of three regular-season games at Mass. Maritime, their home field since the team’s inception. The field is actually about five miles closer to Mashpee than the SJP II campus in Hyannis, hopefully producing a strong turnout for two teams with identical records battling to change their ranks in the Division 6 South standings.
