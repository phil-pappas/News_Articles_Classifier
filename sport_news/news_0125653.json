David Pershing Monday requesting that graduate assistant and former NFL player Sione Pouha and Utah safeties coach Morgan Scalley stop teaching an LDS Institute class meant for players on the football team. \n\"The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution bars public-university employees from teaching religious classes to university students,\" the letter states. \"The Establishment Clause prohibits governmental bodies from taking any action that communicates 'endorsement of religion.' \" \nThe letter cites case law to back up its claims that teachers should not engage in religious education in a public institution, no matter the institution's access to religious classes. \n\"The University of Utah is bound fully by these decision even though it is a public university rather than a public elementary or secondary school,\" the letter states. \"The Establishment Clause's prohibitions against advancing or endorsing religion apply as much to public colleges and universities as to grade schools and high schools. \n\"The need for religious neutrality is, moreover, especially strong when it comes to the coaches and staff of the college football team: student athletes rely on their coaches for playing time, scholarships, and the potential opportunity to become a professional athlete, making them particularly susceptible to pressure from their coaches to participate in religious activities,\" the letter continues. \nPouha and Scalley are both members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and started the classes in an effort to help some of the football players get a religious education as part of their university experience. LDS players as well as those from other faiths and denominations voluntarily attend on a regular basis, but are not mandated to attend.

When you hear it in kind of a football term and then applying it to life, it's good to keep perspective,\" backup quarterback Chase Hansen said earlier this year. \"You can lose it fast on a football field, you can lose it fast in a locker room. But when you come together as teammates and as brothers, you realize this is what matters. \n\"It's just an awesome way to stay motivated,\" Hansen added. \"Sometimes it's hard when it's hot and you're out here in a helmet.\" \nJunior offensive lineman Isaac Asiata, too, participates in the class and said he loves having the opportunity to attend religion classes. \n\"I've been going since I got back from my mission after practices. It's good and it's nice to get that message for the week and I'm grateful that we have an institute program over there because of coach Scalley,\" Asiata said earlier this year. \"It's great to have the guys on the team that we have who share the same religion as I do and are able to share that experience at institute.\" \nAsiata added that many players on the team who are not affiliated with the LDS Church like participating in the course. \n\"We have people come and go. I know over the years we've had a lot of players who aren't of the LDS faith who are just curious and they like coming in,\" he said. \"Even though they're not investigating the church, they like the message and they like to get that spirit throughout the day.\" Photos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:51:04.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
