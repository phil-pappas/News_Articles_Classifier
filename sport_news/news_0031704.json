South Carolina was struggling and the gregarious and once innovative coach was a big reason why. Always one to do things his way, Spurrier believed he needed to step aside, and no one was going to change his mind.\nSpurrier resigned as Gamecocks coach Tuesday, resisting pleas from the University of South Carolina president and athletic director to stay through the season — accepting the harsh reality that the team’s 2-4 record (0-4 SEC) was on him. \"I’m responsible,\" Spurrier said. \"I’m the head coach.\"\nShawn Elliott, who was the offensive line coach, took over as interim head coach.\nAUTOPSY REVEALS SASH OVERDOSE: Former Giants and Iowa safety Tyler Sash died Sept. 8 from an accidental overdose after mixing two powerful pain medications, and a history of painful injuries was a contributing factor, a medical examiner said.\nAdditional studies will look at whether Sash, 27, suffered from a brain disease caused by repetitive trauma that has been found in several former NFL players.\nUSC AD DEFENDS FIRING SARKISIAN: USC athletic director Pat Haden defended both his hiring and firing of Steve Sarkisian, saying the troubled football coach passed a thorough background check and had no behavioral missteps until the last two months. Haden said he sent a letter of termination to Sarkisian when he was unable to contact the coach personally, one day after Sarkisian showed up to work \"unwell.\" Interim coach Clay Helton will lead the Trojans against No. 14 Notre Dame on Saturday.\nPOLICE: EX-AGGIE KILLS JOGGER: Investigators say former Texas A&M receiver Thomas L. Johnson, 21, had recently lost his housing and was angry with his lot in life when he struck a runner Monday using a \"large-bladed knife\" on a popular trail in Dallas. The jogger, David Stevens, 53, died at a hospital. Johnson played only as a freshman for Texas A&M three years ago, appearing in 10 games.\nHARRIS TAKES FLORIDA REIGNS: Starting Treon Harris at quarterback against No. 6 LSU won’t be a total shock to No. 8 Florida, who will be without suspended QB Will Grier for the rest of the season. It might even back up coach Jim McElwain’s insistence he had two QBs capable of winning in the SEC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:17:29.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
