(Abby Drey / TNS) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Carroll County Times The Maryland defense will have its hands full containing Penn State's Christian Hackenberg and Saquon Barkley. \nPenn State’s offense has scuffled through its first six games of the season. In the Big Ten Conference, the Nittany Lions rank 12th in scoring offense, 13th in total offense, ninth in rushing offense and 12th in passing offense. It hasn’t been pretty in State College, Pa., and in the games in which Penn State has been able to pull away from its opponent, the defense has deserved a decent portion of the credit. \nBut that’s not to say there aren’t any talented pieces in Penn State’s offense. Most of that focus falls on quarterback Christian Hackenberg and running back Saquon Barkley, two important playmakers in the Nittany Lions offense. \nHackenberg has gone from possible top-five pick in next April’s NFL draft to an enigmatic and inconsistent presence in the Penn State backfield. In last week’s loss at No. 1 Ohio State, Hackenberg attempted a career-low 13 passes. On the season, he has completed 94 of 177 passes (53.1 percent) for 1,206 yards, eight touchdowns and two interceptions. \n“He's very talented, has a strong arm, can make all the throws,” Terps defensive coordinator Keith Dudzinski said. “The thing you've got to do is you've got to get him out of his comfort zone a little bit. You can't let him just sit there in the pocket and read the defense and let him have his way with you.” \nHackenberg has been sacked 24 times this season, good for the second-most in the Football Bowl Subdivision and the most among Power Five quarterbacks. So the Terps know that generating a pass rush from defensive ends Yannick Ngakoue (seven sacks) and Jesse Aniebonam (two sacks) and defensive tackle Quinton Jefferson (4 1/2 sacks) will be important to the defense’s locking down the passing game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:22:15.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
