The season could be completely out of hand by then. “We are getting backed into a corner right now, and I hope our guys come out swinging,” Gruden said. “I know they will. I know I will.” Defensive tackle Terrance Knighton’s take? “To me, ‘code red’ means: ‘If we lose this, the season’s over.’” \nKey quarters \nEach of these clubs has a quarter that has been problematic. The Bucs have not scored a touchdown in the first quarter, settling for three field goals while being outscored 38-9. The Redskins are getting outscored 46-3 in the third quarter, raising questions about what is happening — or not happening — during halftime. “We’re working on it,” Gruden said. \nStep by step \nTampa Bay snapped an 11-game home losing streak two weeks ago. A win over Washington would raise the Bucs’ record to at least .500 for just the second time in nearly three years (1-1 earlier this season). They have not had a winning record at any point since November 2012, when they were 6-4 before dropping five in a row. “It’s not necessarily being 3-3 or where we stand in the division, things like that,” cornerback Alterraun Verner said. “I think when you start worrying about those things, you’re over-thinking and adding additional stress.” \nRedskins running game \nGruden and new GM Scot McCloughan have made a point of saying they want running backs Alfred Morris and Matt Jones to drive their offense. And early in the season, Washington led the NFL in rushing. But it now stands 17th in the league at 107.2 yards per game, averaging only 3.9 per carry. In a loss to the Jets last week, the Redskins were outgained 221-34 on the ground. “It’s a combination of securing blocks, combination of maybe making guys miss, making something out of nothing,” Cousins said. “It could be play calls.” \nTop 5, really? \nThe Bucs rank fifth in the NFL in total defense, allowing 322.8 yards per game. They’re fourth against the pass at 202.4. The rankings are deceiving, though, because Tampa Bay has not been good at stopping opponents on third down or in the red zone. As a result, it’s next-to-last in average points allowed at 29.6. Twice, Tampa Bay yielded four TDs in a game.
