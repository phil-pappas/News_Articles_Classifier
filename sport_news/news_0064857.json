Finals, the eight-woman event reserved for the sport’s elite.\n Related Coverage Flavia Pennetta Defeats Roberta Vinci for U.S. Open Title SEPT. 12, 2015 On Tennis: In Painful News for Tour, Serena Williams Ends Her Season OCT. 1, 2015 “I think it’s nice after so many years, after so many matches, after so many tournaments and fights on court, that I get this good reward for all my career,” she said.\nHer parents could not make it to the U.S. Open, but they are coming to Singapore. And win or lose, Pennetta confirmed that she will call it a career after the Finals. She first announced her impending retirement minutes after her victory in New York.\nShe will be one of the few in tennis history to go out at some place resembling the top.\nPete Sampras, for example, won the U.S. Open in 2002 and never played another tour match but waited nearly a year before announcing his retirement. The best modern comparison to Pennetta is Marion Bartoli, the strong-minded Frenchwoman who won her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon at age 28 in 2013 and retired several weeks later .\nBut there was a bittersweet taste to that announcement, which Bartoli made in tears after an opening-round loss to Simona Halep in Cincinnati as she cited constant pain and recurring injuries.\nBartoli sounded burned out, even if she has stuck by her retirement after plenty of rest. Pennetta, who is engaged to her fellow Italian player Fabio Fognini, sounds simply fulfilled, exquisitely aware that there will be no topping this scenario. She is ready to start a family and see how her heart and mind respond to staying in one place.\nAdvertisement\n On Tennis An occasional column looking at the news, issues and personalities in the world of tennis.
