(AP Photo/Luca Bruno) \nSOCHI, Russia â€” A heavy crash for Carlos Sainz Jr. ended the final practice session at the Russian Grand Prix on Saturday with the Toro Rosso driver hospitalized. \nSainz lost control of his car on a high-speed stretch heading into a steep right-hand corner, before scraping along the wall and crashing head on into the barriers. \nThe Spanish driver remained in the car, with part of the barriers covering the cockpit as the medical car quickly attended. Cranes were used to lift the barrier sections off the car before Sainz was placed into an ambulance on a stretcher. He was conscious and moved his arms. \nThe session was red-flagged immediately after the crash with more than 20 minutes remaining and canceled shortly afterward. \nSainz's teammate Max Verstappen expressed concern over the radio to his team, asking \"Is he OK? It looked like a big one.\" The garage replied that \"We lost the power on the car, we don't know.\" \nMercedes' Nico Rosberg set the fastest time of the session, ahead of Williams driver Valtteri Bottas and championship leader Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:46:12.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
