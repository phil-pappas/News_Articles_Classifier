Week 5 prep football recaps, scores, photos, videos \nJabir Frye took the pitch and sprinted to his left before lobbing a pass to Seth Richardson for a 30-yard touchdown. \nPine Forest responded quickly in the first quarter as Jaden Gardner exploded for two TDs (79-yard reception, 60-yard rush). \n“We got great effort from our players tonight, and I thought Escambia played real well,” Pollard said. “We can match Escambia’s speed. I think that was the difference tonight. They really have a good team. They are well coached, and Jabir Frye is an outstanding player.” \nFrye made his mark on the game again when he cut through Pine Forest’s punt team for an 80-yard TD return early in the second quarter. \nEmilio Maldonado hit a 26-yard field goal on Escambia’s next drive to give the Gators a lead heading into halftime. \nBut Pine Forest quarterback Xavier Saulsberry and the Eagles knew they were still in the game. \n“We talked about coming out and scoring,” Saulsberry said. “We said we gotta put up points on them. We gotta hit them ... they’ll stop eventually. \n“It felt good to get this win. We’ve worked hard all year for this moment. Escambia beat us last year, but this year we came harder, stronger and faster.” \nSaulsberry found Jacob Copeland for an 81-yard TD pass less than two minutes into the second half. \nFrom there, it was stingy defense from both squads but it was Pine Forest that forced three turnovers in the fourth quarter. \nKaray Ellis and Martel Emerson snagged interceptions, and the Eagles defensive line caused pressure and recovered a fumble to seal the deal. \nPine Forest will seek its next district win Friday at Washington while the Gators will aim to even their district record when they face Tate on Oct. 16.
