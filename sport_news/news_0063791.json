For decades, plans for expansion of the route infamous for its vehicle crashes have been thwarted. Will the expansion ever happen? \nSTATE 23 (between Fond du Lac and Plymouth) – A mist of dust rose from an 18-wheeler sprawled on its side, its load of cheese splattered across the pavement. A flipped-over Volkswagen wobbled on its top on a homeowner’s green lawn. \nThose are just a couple of the State 23 accident aftermaths Nancy Johnson has seen from her trailer home near Wade House in Greenbush, where she's lived for 38 years. \nDrivers on the road play a risky game, Johnson said of vehicles passing each other on the skinny, undulating road. \n\"It's like Russian roulette,” Johnson said. “Everybody's darting out, taking a chance.” \nDented mailboxes lean precariously from impacts from autos and trucks. Scraps of blown tires and twisted metal are strewn on the shoulders. Skid marks are whipped into the pavement. \nVehicle accidents are regular occurrences on this curving 19-mile stretch of State 23 between Fond du Lac and Plymouth. This year has seen two fatal crashes. According to one study, a crash happens every eight days on the route. State 23 has a reputation for danger and engenders fear in its share of travelers. \nFor decades, Wisconsin leaders have pushed to expand the stretch to four lanes, arguing that the move would save lives and, by accommodating more traffic, promote economic development in the region. But funding and policy issues have thwarted the efforts. \nThe most recent construction delay is the result of state budget cuts and a federal lawsuit by the environmental group 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin. Residents along Highway 23 between Fond du Lac and Sheboygan voice frustration over dangerous driving conditions on the two-lane road. Doug Raflik/Action Reporter Media \nSome lawmakers, environmentalists and landowners say the number of accidents on State 23 aren’t any higher than many other two-lane routes in Wisconsin. A review of crash data provided by the Department of Transportation appears to bolster that argument. \nYet another study commissioned by the DOT found that on 12 Wisconsin highways that were expanded from two to four lanes, crashes were reduced, according to Andrea Bill, a research program manager for the Transportation Operations and Safety Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \nTurn the stretch into four full lanes, or leave it alone? \nAdvocates and detractors have data to support their position. \nOn a recent day on the route, people’s views were one-sided. They spoke of accidents and close calls on State 23, and a few had strong opinions on the continuous starts and stops of road expansion. \nFor 42 years, Bill Schmitz has lived in a white house on Log Tavern Road in Mt. Calvary near State 23. He supports expansion and wants 1000 Friends, a Madison organization vocal statewide about land-use planning, to stop meddling in local affairs. \n\"They're just sticking their nose in and they don't know what they're doing,\" Schmitz said.

Drivers don't respect the speed limit of 55 mph, Mueller said. \n\"It's a raceway,\" Mueller said between puffs on a cigarette. \"We've got too much traffic for this volume of road.\" \nHeavy traffic makes for lost time. It's not uncommon for Mueller to wait 10 minutes at the end of his U-shaped driveway to turn onto the route. \nOne day, Mueller was driving home in his pickup with a trailer attached. While signaling a left turn and slowing down, a car passed him — on the left side. \n\"It's just a dangerous highway,\" Mueller said. \nNancy Johnson said that when people are coming to visit her at her trailer home in Greenbush, she often gives them an alternative route so they don’t have to make a left from 23. \n\"Do not stay stopped there,\" Johnson said she tells them, \"especially in winter when it's icy because somebody is going to rear-end you. You wouldn't believe the accidents I've seen on this corner since I've been here.\" \nFor some State 23 travelers, the luck runs out. \nAngela Koran was involved in a three-vehicle accident July 24 on State 23 east of Seven Hills Road. A driver tried to pass a tractor trailer in heavy traffic and slammed head-on into Koran’s Saturn. The impact spun Koran’s car 180 degrees, causing the car behind Koran to hit the Saturn — head-on. \n“I just praise God that my 18-month-old daughter was not with me in the vehicle that day,” Koran said in an email. “It absolutely infuriates me that our state has money for a sports arena but cannot possibly maintain our roadways where human lives are at stake. \n“This accident has impacted my health, my time, my finances and my everyday way of life.” \nNext installment: Read about the delays since the 1970s in widening State 23. 38 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 10 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1LSPy6c TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:11:00.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
