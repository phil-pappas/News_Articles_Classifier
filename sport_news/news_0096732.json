That would be bad. \nIf the Can­ucks, who have scored either one goal or none in five of their six ex­hib­ition starts, con­tinue to aver­age 1.1 goals per 60 min­utes of hock­ey from now until mid-April, hel­lo 30th place. \nOn the bright side, they might then get the No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft, though there are no guarantees, and any­way, the Oil­ers would prob­ably win it from them in a game of chance, be­cause that’s just how lucky they are. \nOn the even brighter side, rook­ie Jared Mc­Cann is on pace for 41 goals and 41 as­sists, and defenceman Ben Hut­ton for 82 as­sists, which prob­ably means they’ll be bat­tling it out for the Cal­der Trophy. Two Can­ucks, im­agine that. \nThe point is — yes, there is one — the pre-sea­son is what­ever the ad­jec­tive is that’s one step be­yond mean­ing­less. \nThe vet­er­ans just want to sur­vive it with­out get­ting hurt, which Chris Higgins, alas, did not. The rook­ies want to show so much po­ten­tial that the coach and GM will think twice before send­ing them back to the min­ors, or jun­ior, be­cause of all the one-way con­tracts on the depth chart ahead of them. \n“Un­fortu­nate­ly with these young guys, they’ve got to keep do­ing it and do­ing it and do­ing it, be­cause the older guys have done it,” said as­sist­ant coach Glen Gulutzan, who drew the short straw and had to stand in for the still-hob­bling Wil­lie Des­jar­dins in Wed­nes­day’s media scrum. \n“You know, we ha­ven’t got re­sults. But I thought last night (Tues­day’s 2-1 loss in San Jose) was our best game. Some of the stuff we’ve been preachin’ through camp, it’s there in the game, and these last two games are real­ly go­ing to dic­tate what goes on. \n“You know, I can just go back to other pre-sea­sons when teams have won all their games, or been 6-1 in pre-sea­son or what­ever, but when the real bul­lets start fly­ing it’s a dif­fer­ent game. These last couple of games, when you get full ros­ters in games, it ramps up. And we all know that.” \nThe Can­ucks have won two of six, both of them 1-0, the first one in 3-on-3 over­time. Pretty tooth­less, so far. \n“I think we’re looking for in­di­vid­ual per­form­ances,” GM Jim Ben­ning ad­mit­ted. “You know, San Jose had a pretty vet­er­an line­up (Tues­day) and our guys held their own. \n“They stuck up for one an­other and bat­tled back and got the mo­men­tum back in the game. And those are the things we’re looking at, es­pe­cial­ly from our young play­ers, try­ing to show what they can do.” \nSo, throw out the re­sults? \n“Well, no, I’d like to win every game. I know we ha­ven’t scored a lot in the pre-sea­son, but I think we were the se­cond highest-scor­ing team in the West last year, and we have 10 of our top 12 scor­ers back — losing (Nick) Bo­ni­no but adding (Bran­don) Sutter — so once we get our full line­up to­geth­er, I feel con­fi­dent we’ll be able to score.” \nWhat they sus­pect up to now is that defenceman Ben Hut­ton and for­wards Mc­Cann and Jake Vir­ta­nen and Bren­dan Gaunce may have what it takes. What they can take to the bank is less cer­tain. \n“Any time, even back when I was in Dal­las, you go to train­ing camp and you al­ways think, ‘Is there one (rook­ie) here who’s go­ing to make it?’ You don’t know who it is, but real­ly you’re hoping for it,” Gulutzan said. \n“We’re down to the nitty-grit­ty now, be­cause we’re bal­an­cing the fact that we need to get our line­up in for the last, es­pe­cial­ly the last game. There’s lot of guys that have played them­selves into a pos­ition to play an­other game, so now de­ci­sions get real tough. There’s lots of dis­cus­sion go­ing on right now in our coach­es’ of­fice with the GM.” \nAs for the fans ... well, they just have to cov­er their eyes for now, and trust that the plot­ters and de­sign­ers in charge of their team aren’t mis­tak­en. \nAt the end of Tues­day’s 2-1 loss, the Sportsnet TV crew was left to mop up with words like “moral vic­tory,” which per­haps it was, given the vet­er­an-laden line­up the Sharks played. \nBut until the NHL gov­ern­ors ap­prove adding the sin­gle MV point to go along with the OTL point, those moral vic­tor­ies aren’t go­ing to cut much ice. \nSome­how — and Sat­ur­day against the Oil­ers here would be in­dic­a­tive, but next Wed­nes­day in Cal­gary, when the sea­son starts for real, would be more con­vin­cing — the grand de­sign that is currently only in the coach­es’ minds needs to go from con­cept to exe­cu­tion. \nIdeal­ly not their own. \nccole@vancouversun.com \nTwitter.com/rcamcole © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:23:00.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
