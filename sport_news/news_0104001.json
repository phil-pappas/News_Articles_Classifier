But the kick was low, and Patrick Gamble managed to get a hand on it.\nWhile most of the Georgia Tech players celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, rolling along inside the 25-yard line.\nMike Stewart/AP Lance Austin makes a heads up play by retrieving the blocked field goal and returning it for a 78-yard touchdown and improbable win.\nAt first, he seemed hesitant to pick it up.\nBut then he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench.\nHe avoided Aguayo’s diving attempt, then cut back on the final guy who had a shot at him to win the game for Georgia Tech (3-5, 1-4).\nON MOBILE?
