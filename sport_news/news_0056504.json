Posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 8:59 am It's East in rout By MATTHEW SPARKS CNHI News Service \nEast Carter used teamwork to earn another 62nd District title on Thursday night. \nSeven different Lady Raiders found the back of the net to secure a 10-0 victory over rival West Carter at the East Carter Soccer Complex for the program’s fifth straight district championship. \nThe Lady Raiders won the 22nd District in 2011. \n“It really is rare that we have a girl score more than two (goals),” East Carter Coach Jessica Proudfoot said. “Multiple games it’s been more than one person. I think that is better than having one girl scoring that can score three or four goals because the other team can’t mark up on just one person. I think that is a great thing for us that we have that people that are able to score.” \nSeniors Mandy Langstaff and Madison Dyer each supplied two goals. Proudfoot said the two midfielders, along with the other seniors, bring leadership on and off the field. \n“It’s their ability to see and pass,” Proudfoot said. “We use Mandy and Maddy both in the middle. The middle is kind of the core of things. They can distribute the ball out wide and up top. Those two work really well together. The other seniors, they all provide a great asset to the team.” \nLangstaff believes her team’s district success is a direct result of their work ethic. \n“It just shows our hard work,” Langstaff said. “We have worked hard for four years and we have deserved it every time.” \nDyer scored her first goal when she tapped in a bouncing ball deep in the box in the 47th minute. She tallied again shortly after with a header off a perfectly placed corner kick from Taylor Hall. \n“That does not happen often,” Dyer said with a smile. “It wasn’t planned but it was the perfect ball.” \nLangstaff directed a Emilee McDowell cross into the net for her first goal just before halftime. She connected again 15 minutes into the second half to end the match. \nHall had a goal and two assists for East Carter (9-7-4). McDowell added a goal and an assist. Rebecca Hall scored twice in a span of two minutes in the first half. Emily Hicks and Gracie Robinson shot their way into the scoring column. \nEast Carter’s district success hasn’t translated into many region tournament wins the following week. Dyer feels her team can change that trend and make some noise in Owingsville. \n“We shouldn’t underestimate ourselves,” Dyer said. “We should just go out there and play like we can. We have a lot of potential but we have to go meet it and give it our heart.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:05:06.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
