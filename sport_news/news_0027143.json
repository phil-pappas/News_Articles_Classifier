We're rolling. We're clicking.\" \nThis is just the latest headache for the Mets this year from Harvey. \nHe returned from Tommy John surgery this season and pitched well, posting a 2.71 ERA. But the team had to juggle his innings in September after Harvey and his agent said that doctors told them he should only pitch 180 innings in his first season back. \nAfter the Mets set a conservative plan for Harvey, he eventually went to Collins to change it so he could pitch a normal slate. He ended up throwing 189 1/3 innings this season. \nCollins admitted in late September, after the Mets clinched, that Harvey had rankled the clubhouse. \n\"I don't think they were mad at him,\" Collins said. \"Nobody was mad at Matt. It was just the whole situation guys were mad at, but we're fighting for the pennant here. Nobody was mad at Matt, like me, I wasn't mad at Matt, it was the situation. It came down to the fact we had to take him out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:00:49.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
