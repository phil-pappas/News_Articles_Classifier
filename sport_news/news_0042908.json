All but one of the people who he talked to have been dismissed.\nA female potential juror also spoke about the case, which led to the dismissal of one member of the jury pool.\nA hearing on what, if any, damage that caused the jury pool is set for this morning. The defense has asked the judge to dismiss all of the jury pool.\nChism’s lawyer, Denise Regan, said a juror recounted what she heard:\n“There was a person speaking in the jury room . ... Something like, that he had already been to trial ... something like, he pleaded insanity.”\nRegan said five other potential jurors heard the comments and should be dismissed.\n“This is erroneous and prejudicial information that has no place in the jury room,” Regan said.\nJudge David Lowy said “it wouldn’t be prudent” to dismiss those jurors.\n“The commonwealth is entitled to a fair trial, just as the defendant is entitled to a fair trial,” he said.\nChism’s mother was hospitalized last night, defense lawyer Susan Oker said. Lowy appointed a guardian ad litem for Chism until his mother is medically able to be available.\nChism is facing charges for first degree murder, two counts of aggravated rape, and armed robbery in Essex County Superior Court in Salem. The victim, Colleen Ritzer, was Chism’s algebra teacher at Danvers High School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:43:12.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
