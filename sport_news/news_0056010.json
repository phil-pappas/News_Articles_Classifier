UNC freshman midfielder/forward Mariel Gutierrez scored the only goal of the game just before the end of the first half on an assist from junior midfielder Kassy Castillo. The goal is Gutierrez’s fourth of the season. Portland State players racked up five yellow cards in the matchup, with Gutierrez receiving one for the Bears in the middle of the second half. The Vikings were in full attack mode in the second half to make up the deficit, but UNC redshirt junior goalkeeper Kaitlin Ruff kept the Vikings scoreless with five saves. The Bears (6-1 Big Sky, 11-6 overall) will next take on Big Sky opponent Eastern Washington University (5-2, 11-3-1) at 7 p.m. Friday at Jackson Stadium on the UNC campus in Greeley. Eastern Washington is No. 3 in the Big Sky standings. The Bears’ final regular-season home matchup will be at 1 p.m. Sunday at Jackson Stadium against Idaho. The Vandals (7-0, 11-4-1) haven’t dropped a Big Sky game, and are ranked just above the Bears at No. 1 in the conference standings. UNC 1 0 1 Scoring — UNC, Mariel Gutierrez (Kassy Castillo) 44:50.
