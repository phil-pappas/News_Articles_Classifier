It wasn't clear whether those involved were fans of rival teams. \nDetectives with the robbery-homicide division were interviewing witnesses and reviewing stadium surveillance footage, Hernandez said. \nThe Dodgers declined comment on Monday. \nSecurity at Dodger Stadium came under national scrutiny after a 2011 attack in the parking lot on opening day left San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow with brain damage. Two men — Marvin Norwood and Louie Sanchez — later were imprisoned after pleading guilty. \nStow sued the Dodgers and their former owner Frank McCourt, saying they were to blame for the attack because of insufficient security and lighting. A jury faulted the team, along with Sanchez and Norwood, and awarded Stow nearly $18 million after a six-week trial in 2014.
