But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s ‘untrustable.’ But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought and made that happen.”\nMcCarthy has since disavowed those remarks.\nThe resolution to shutter the committee said, in part, it is “an outrage that more than $4.5 million in taxpayer funds have been used by Republicans in the House of Representatives, not to run the government, but to interfere inappropriately with an election for president of the United States …”\nWhen the select committee was created in May 2014, its stated purpose was to investigate U.S. government actions before, during and after an attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012, that resulted in the deaths of Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, and three other Americans.\nComprised of seven Republican and five Democratic seats, and with no fixed ending date, the panel was charged with developing new information while consolidating the work of several other congressional investigations that found mistakes but no shirking of duty or malfeasance by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in the Benghazi tragedy.\nA yes vote was to keep the Benghazi committee in operation.\nYES: PEARCE NO: LUJAN GRISHAM, LUJÃN\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD INVESTIGATION: By a vote of 242 for and 184 against, the House on Oct. 7 approved a GOP measure (H Res 461) to establish a select House committee to pursue allegations that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America has engaged in misconduct if not illegality with its abortion practices and supply of aborted fetal tissue to medical researchers.\nRepublicans said secretly recorded discussions by Planned Parenthood officials demonstrate the need for a special congressional probe, while Democratic critics said several state and congressional inquiries into the nonprofit health-care organization have found no evidence of wrongdoing.\nAbortion is legal in the U.S. with certain restrictions and federal funds, by law, cannot be used to pay for it.\nA yes vote was to establish a committee to investigate Planned Parenthood.\nYES: PEARCE NO: LUJAN GRISHAM, LUJÃN\nGRACE PERIOD FOR MORTGAGE LENDERS: Voting 303 for and 121 against, the House on Oct. 7 passed a bill (HR 3192) granting a four-month grace period in which home-mortgage lenders acting in good faith could not be prosecuted for violating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule intended to streamline and add transparency to home-buying in the U.S.\nThis bill was disputed over its shifting the burden of proof in lawsuits brought under the Truth in Lending Act during the four months from plaintiffs (home-buyers) to defendants (lenders).\nThe grace period would start retroactively on Oct. 3.\nA yes vote was to send the bill to the Senate.\nYES: LUJAN GRISHAM, PEARCE, LUJÃN\nEXEMPTIONS FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL: Voting 185 for and 240 against, the House on Oct. 7 defeated a Democratic bid to exempt active-duty military personnel, veterans, seniors and students from provisions in HR 3192 (above) that would limit the ability of plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits against mortgage lenders under the Truth in Lending Act.\nIn part, those provisions shift the burden of proof to the plaintiff (consumer) in disputes over whether the defendant (lender) acted in good faith during the four-month grace period.\nA yes vote backed the Democratic motion, which, had it prevailed, would have immediately amended the bill.\nYES: LUJAN GRISHAM, LUJÃN NO: PEARCE\nSENATE\nMartin Heinrich (D) Tom Udall (D) 2016 ENERGY, WATER BUDGET: Voting 49 for and 47 against, the Senate failed to reach 60 votes needed to advance a House-passed bill (HR 2028) that would appropriate $35.4 billion for energy, water and nuclear-safety programs in fiscal 2016.\nDemocrats objected to the bill in an effort to force removal the sequester’s spending caps from domestic programs, just as the GOP majority has lifted caps from 2016 defense spending.\nIn part, the bill provides $12.3 billion for securing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, $5.6 billion for Army Corps of Engineers public-works projects and $5.1 billion for cleaning up former Department of Defense nuclear-weapons production sites.\nA yes vote was to advance the bill.\nNO: UDALL, HEINRICH\nFISCAL 2016 MILITARY BUDGET: Voting 70 for and 27 against, the Senate on Oct. 7 approved the conference report on a bill (HR 1735) authorizing a $604.2 billion military budget for fiscal 2016, including $50.9 billion in emergency spending for U.S. combat operations abroad.\nThe GOP-drafted bill faces a likely presidential veto over its shifting of $38 billion in routine military spending to an emergency war account in order to evade Pentagon spending caps imposed by the sequester.\nDemocrats said they want sequester caps repealed for both domestic and military programs.\nThe bill authorizes more than $50 billion for active-duty and retiree healthcare; $3.8 billion for Afghan security forces; $715 million to help the Iraqi military fight Islamic State forces; $600 million to boost Syrian opposition forces; $350 million in military aid to Ukraine (including $50 million for arms) and $120 million for securing the U.S. southern border.\nThe bill sets a 1.3 percent pay raise for uniformed personnel and begins a 401(k)-style retirement plan for active and retired service members as an alternative to the military’s defined-benefit retirement plan.\nIn addition, the bill requires military personnel to obey the Army Field Manual’s ban on torture of prisoners.\nA yes vote was to send the conference report to President Obama.\nYES: UDALL, HEINRICH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:15:36.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
