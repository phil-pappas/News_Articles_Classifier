We had the Jazz squeak out an overtime victory. We had Trevor Booker earn a one-game suspension due to a slap he gave Roy Hibbert . And apparently we had Kobe Bryant trying to connect with Rodney Hood on LinkedIn during the exhibition game.\nOn a night in which Bryant looked more like his old self than his older self with 13 points on 5-of-9 shooting in 21 minutes, Hood also had a nice game. He scored 21 points on 7-of-16 from the field in 37 minutes. At one point during some trash talking, Hood says Kobe \"just about\" gave him his résumé and reminded him that Bryant is allowed to shoot 30 times if he wants and Hood doesn't have that freedom or luxury. Jazz coach Quin Snyder kind of agrees.\nFrom Jody Genessy of the Desert News :\nWhat did Kobe say to Rodney Hood in Tuesday's game? Hood: \"He gave me his resume.\"\n— Jody Genessy (@DJJazzyJody) October 9, 2015 Re-listened to the Rodney Hood interview. Slight quote correction: \"We had a little talk. He was just about (giving me) his resume.\"\n— Jody Genessy (@DJJazzyJody) October 9, 2015 Kobe to Hood: \"I can shoot it 30 times—you can shoot it 10 times. Don't try to go there with me.\" Hood smiled: \"To some point he was right.\"\n— Jody Genessy (@DJJazzyJody) October 9, 2015 I get the feeling Rodney Hood would hire Kobe Bryant based on hearing about his resume. Hood: \"Very impressive. Very impressive.\"\n— Jody Genessy (@DJJazzyJody) October 9, 2015 Quin Snyder's response to Kobe's message to Rodney Hood: \"Kobe's right probably. If he isn't, then Rodney should just tell him he's right.\"\n— Jody Genessy (@DJJazzyJody) October 10, 2015 Considering Hood is entering his second season after playing 50 games as a rookie and Bryant is entering his 20th year in his historic NBA career, Kobe was probably right about the difference between the two. Hood had just turned three years old when Kobe began his career and he's probably enjoyed it as much as any NBA fan over the last two decades. Bryant has been one of the most accomplished players and prolific scorers in NBA history.\nThe Jazz wing took 374 shots during his rookie season. Kobe took 336 shots just in the month of November in an injury-truncated season.\n\nSwaggy is tired and Kobe is focused.
