The game came down to the wire, with Spellman scoring with 1:27 to play for the win. Cardinal Spellman quarterback Mike Reale scored the game-winning touchdown, breaking a 28-28 tie on a third-down run from the 1-yard line. Spellman started the scoring on its first drive of the game. A 38-yard run by Ralph Grilone put the Cardinals in Spartan territory. Cameron Sass capped off the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run to put the Cardinals up, 7-0. St. Mary’s answered on the ensuing drive with a 66-yard touchdown run by Calvin Johnson. On a first down from the Spartans 33-yard line, Reale heaved a 31-yard pass that was hauled in by Andrew Dudley, who caught the ball one-handed while diving to the ground. Sass then scored from the 2. The Spartans closed out the first half scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Antonio Felix to Abraham Toe. A blocked punt by Spellman’s Andrew Force set the Cardinals up at St. Mary’s 17-yard line. A few plays later, Reale kept the ball for a touchdown to put Spellman up, 21-12. The Spartans answered on their next drive with a touchdown run by Toe. The play was set up by an excellent leaping catch by Marcus Atkins on a 4th and eight. The two-point conversion was good and the score was 21-20 heading into the fourth quarter. On Spellman’s second possession of the fourth, Reale executed a great play fake and scampered for a 50-yard touchdown run to put the Cardinals up, 28-20. Johnson broke free down the sideline on the Spartans’ next drive and hauled in a 38-yard touchdown pass. The two-point conversion was good and the score was tied up at 28-28 with 5:44 to go. Spellman got the ball back and began marching down the field as time ticked down. Reale again hit Dudley on a long pass play, this time for 30 yards to the Spartans’ 6-yard line to set up the game-winning score. Saint Mary’s had one final chance but turned the ball over on downs at the Spellman 43 to end the game.
