He cracked the 900-point barrier against the Calgary Flames on Tuesday, and he needs only four more goals to achieve his next mark: becoming the leader in goals among Russian N.H.L. players. But for that record, he will have to surpass his former teammate and longtime friend Sergei Fedorov. “For Ovie to break his record, I’m sure if they could, they’d want to share it, but that’s not how it works,” said Nicklas Backstrom, who has often centered Ovechkin in Washington. Ovechkin, a five-time winner of the Maurice Richard Trophy as the league’s top goal-scorer with the Capitals, has 480 career goals in 766 games. Fedorov left the N.H.L. in 2009 at age 39 with 483 goals in 1,248 games. He will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto on Nov. 9. “He was my best teammate I’ve played with, obviously, with his skill and personality,” Ovechkin, 30, said. “I learned a lot from him. I was lucky to play with him. It’s going to be an honor to beat his record.” No other active Russian player is even close to Ovechkin. Entering Saturday’s games, Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins had 271 goals, followed by Alexander Semin of the Montreal Canadiens with 239 goals. Fedorov, 45, ended his professional career in 2012 after three seasons with Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the Kontinental Hockey League, and he serves as the general manager of CSKA Moscow. “I’m glad that it is Alexander Ovechkin who will break my N.H.L. record among Russian players,” Fedorov said in an email. “We are friends for a long time, played shoulder to shoulder in Washington and Team Russia. We discussed playing the game a lot, and I’d like to believe that my advice helped him somewhere.” Ovechkin and Fedorov played together with the Capitals during Fedorov’s final two N.H.L. seasons, 2007-8 and 2008-9. With the Russian national team, they won the gold medal at the 2008 world championships and silver at the 2010 tournament. They also teamed up at the 2010 Olympics. So there is a certain symmetry in seeing Ovechkin supplant his mentor. \nAdvertisement   “He always did good things for the team,” Ovechkin said. “He was the best on the ice, I think. He was an all-around player. He could play defense, center, wing. And his experience — how many games he played, how many Stanley Cup rings he had. You just watched how he prepared for the games and his routines. It was unbelievable.” Both men earned rock-star-like reputations in the N.H.L. In the 1990s, Fedorov was a spokesman for Nike, popularizing white skates, and Ovechkin has been known for his yellow skate laces and flamboyant goal celebrations. Both were linked romantically to Russian tennis stars. Fedorov was once married to Anna Kournikova, and Ovechkin split with his then-fiancée, Maria Kirilenko, in 2014.

He makes the crowd stand up with some of the stuff he does. He makes the boards bang because he’s running over someone. He’s a louder, much heavier player. He can be very physical and ruthless at times, because he’s 230 pounds.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:21:56.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
