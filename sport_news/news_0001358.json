After being off last week, Fisher and the Seminoles prepare to face Wake Forest on Saturday. \nTALLAHASSEE | Florida State’s offensive line is still a work in progress. \nThe Seminoles have mixed and matched different players at various positions throughout preseason camp and the regular season, toying with different combinations to find the ideal starting lineup. \nThe starting five is still unsettled, but Seminoles coach Jimbo Fisher believes his offensive line is beginning to take shape after a rough outing against Boston College. \n“We are not where we want to be, but we’ve done a nice job of running the football in the first two games,” Fisher said. \n“We’re still cross-training guys, seeing who fits where and stuff like that,” starting left tackle Rod Johnson said. “But as of right now, I’m seeing some progress as the weeks have come.” \nFisher announced Tuesday that redshirt freshman Derrick Kelly will likely start at right tackle against Wake Forest. It will be Kelly’s first start, but he appeared comfortable when thrust into action against Boston College after starter Brock Ruble struggled. \nMore change could be imminent. Sophomore Ryan Hoefeld has worked at center with the first-team offense at times in practice this week, although Fisher has not indicated whether he will replace incumbent starter Corey Martinez in the lineup. \nMartinez started all three games this season, but Fisher said the team was forced to throw him “in the fire” before he was ready. Hoefeld, who is recovering from a knee injury, was in the same position last year when he replaced injured starter Austin Barron midway through the season. He had difficulties dealing with both the physical and mental rigors that come with playing center, although Fisher hinted Hoefeld is now ready to contribute. \n“You’re starting to see some experience in him now, playing really good football. He’s healthy, making the calls and has the experience,” Fisher said. “ … You say they aren’t ready, but you want those guys to [get in-game experience.]” \nFSU also got Chad Mavety and Cole Minshew back practicing this week after they were both hindered by nagging injuries. The Seminoles are easing both players into practice, but there’s an expectation that they can help sooner rather than later. Fisher likes the idea of rotating players into the lineup during games, given that Johnson and Hoefeld are FSU’s only returning linemen with in-game experience from 2014. \n“Sometimes, with young players, you saw the [New England] Patriots do that the other day, they played their young guys on the offensive line two series then pull them,” Fisher said. “Let them get their bearings on the sidelines and go back in and you’re building depth. There are some guys now that we keep building depth, and we can give guys breaks periodically. Not just physically, mentally. Kind of just take a deep breath, and we’ve got guys that can go in there and execute also.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:31:04.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
