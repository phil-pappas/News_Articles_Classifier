As they arrived, they heard a single shot and found a man in his early 40s with a gunshot wound, according to multiple local reports. \nWitness Lester Peters told the Star-Telegram the suspect first held a gun to the victim’s head, adding, “I didn’t think he was going to pull the trigger.’’\nGreg Miller told the paper the security “definitely needs to be stepped up,’’ and the suspect had held a gun to his friend’s head.\n“Fight broke out, a couple of guys. All their friends jumped in. It was a big brawl. Next thing you know, I looked up, one of my buddies was trying to get a girl off the bottom of the pile,’’ Miller said.\n“One guy walks up to him and put a gun to up his head, you know, about to shoot him. The guy ended up letting my friend go. I go to grab my friend so we can leave, I had my back turned, all I heard was a gunshot. Turn around, he shot somebody else while they were fighting.’’\nThe victim was transported in critical, life-threatening condition to Medical Center Arlington, and was subsequently flown to another hospital because of the seriousness of his injuries, according to police spokesman Lt. Chris Cook.\nThe suspect was taken to another local hospital with a leg injury sustained when he tripped over a retaining wall trying to flee the scene. He’s been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and will be booked into jail after he is released from the hospital, where he is under guard.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under crazed fans ,  dallas cowboys ,  nfl ,  shootings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:32:32.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
