The new website is just beginning to develop a data package, but it shows promise for being a big help in the future.\nUse is free, for listing and browsing, though that could change in the future due to the cost of maintaining the website. Just remember your Facebook password when you go to sign in.\nThe site encourages users to post tours, events, experts' advice, education opportunities, meals/food/drink, stays, vacation rentals, arts/crafts and more.\nIn the case of the Sage Center, the facility is a Port of Morrow County project dedicated to teaching visitors about the local agricultural economy, everything from growing to processing and transporting.\nBoardman is a small town and it's hard to get the word out, even though the Sage Center catches the eye of travelers on Interstate 84. Trouble is, eastbound travelers have already missed the best exit by a mile when they notice the impressive complex just north of the freeway.\nTo plan to visit the Sage Center, take exit 164 at Boardman and drive one mile east on Front Street just north of the freeways. Holidays excepting, the center is open this time of year from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Adult admission is $5, or $3 for students and seniors.\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": ["http://www.visitsage.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:28:05.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
