Fellow HMS driver Jimmie Johnson was third, followed by Matt Kenseth. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. was fifth to put all four Hendrick cars in the top five. \nSaturday’s pole was Gordon’s fourth at Talladega – including his front row start last May where he finished 31. Gordon is currently sixth in the Chase for the Sprint Cup standings, having yet to win a race this season. \n“I did know we had a fast car, but I wasn’t sure,” said Gordon. “This is a different car than what we had here earlier this year. We really feel like we were dominant here in May. I made a mistake getting too aggressive to pit road. Hopefully we will learn from our mistakes and we can take advantage of that No. 1 pit stall or selection anyway, as well as, a very fast racecar and try to keep it up front.” \nMatt Kenseth’s third-place starting spot was a welcome relief for the driver with the biggest deficient to overcome on Sunday, coming into this weekend’s race dead-last among the 12 drivers vying to be one of the eight drivers who survive to advance to the next round of the Chase. \n“One thing about Talladega is you always have to expect the unexpected so who knows what’s going to happen,” said Kenseth. “Everybody wants to qualify well and try to get an early pick on your pit stall if you can and do all those kinds of things. \n“With this kind of racing you make one wrong move or pick a line to stop moving then you could be 30th before you even know it within a lap. Starting position not super, super important here, but yet I’d rather be toward the front than in the back.” \nChase contender Martin Truex, Jr. will also have a hill to climb to get to the front of the pack after his qualifying time was disallowed after he dropped below the double yellow lines during the opening round, sending him to the rear of the field for the start of the Sunday’s race. \nTruex, Jr. was nonplussed by NASCAR’s ruling, saying he was unaware of the rule, but at the same time was not concerned about starting in the rear. \n“Yeah, I didn’t know you couldn’t do that here in qualifying,” said Truex, Jr. “We have done it the last few times. I didn’t get the memo that you couldn’t do that this time around. Just done what we have done here the last few times and didn’t realize there was a rule change. \n“It won’t change (our race strategy) at all. We started in the back last time too. We will be fine.” \nOther starting positions for the Chase contenders are Kevin Harvick (seventh), Denny Hamlin (eighth), Joey Logano (tenth), Brad Keselowski (11th), Kurt Busch (14th), Carl Edwards (15th), Kyle Busch (16th) and Ryan Newman (18th). \nJeb Burton and Michael Annett failed to qualify for the race. \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Sunday’s NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race from Talladega Superspeedway beginning at 1 pm on 102.9 FM. \nNASCAR Sprint Cup Series CampingWorld.com 500 – October 24, 2015 \nSaturday’s Qualifying Results \n1.
