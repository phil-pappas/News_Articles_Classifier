The department's elite Robbery Homicide Division is investigating the fight, which broke out in Parking Lot L after the Dodgers-Mets game. Police said surveillance videos might provide a better description of the attackers, but Chief Charlie Beck confirmed Tuesday that police are looking for a mother and son in connection with the attack.

Bryan Stow, who suffered severe injuries after the Opening Day game, won an $18 million judgment against former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt last year over security issues in the parking lot after games. Since Stow's attack, the LAPD and the Dodgers organization have worked to increase patrols, both with officers and private security.

The Mets won the opening game of the National League Division Series to the New York Mets, 3-1 The series would return to Dodger Stadium Thursday for Game 5, if the Dodgers win Tuesday night's game in New York.
