Many students and others wore the shirts at Roseburg's first home football game since the tragedy.\nTo the people who live here, this town has changed in the past week. Oh, things look the same – traffic still snarls on Garden Valley Boulevard and Loggers still serves the best pizza – but it's the sounds that get them. Ever since that awful morning, when shots rang out at Umpqua Community College, their ears tell them something is off.\nPeople don't speak as much. Or as loudly. Music hasn't played as much, or as loudly. And nobody feels much like laughing.\n\"It's a lot quieter,'' Roseburg High junior Austin Harris said. \"The whole town is just ... different. You can feel it.''\nSo they returned Friday to watch one of the hallmarks of this tight knit logging community: Roseburg High football.\nA community 'still hurting' says its goodbyes by Ian K.

Nine days since media from all over the world descended on this sleepy timber town, clamoring for interviews, invading church services and shoving microphones in people's faces. Nine days since their home took center stage in the divisive national debate over gun control.\nRoseburg's Tapestry Tattoo holds fundraiser for shooting victims, families by Beth Nakamura\nCustomers began lining up in front of Tapestry Tattoo a little after 8 a.m. Sunday, even though the shop wouldn't begin tattooing until noon. The line quickly swelled to more than 100 people, so owner Chere Hall, 41, started tattooing a little earlier than anticipated, at 11 a.m.\nPeople flocked to the tattoo parlor on Southeast Stephens Street in Roseburg as it held a fundraiser Sunday for victims' families and those who were injured in last week's shooting at Umpqua Community College.

They'll join more than 40 volunteers working around the clock to ensure every Umpqua student and professor has support. Tissues will be in every classroom.
