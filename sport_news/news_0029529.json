Jones told 103.5 KRLD The Fan that Bryant has had “no setbacks” and has a “real shot” to play against the Giants, according to The Dallas Morning News . \nThe timetable for Romo’s return remains unclear, though the quarterback has already confirmed that he will not undergo surgery . Assuming there are no major changes, it’s a virtual certainty that Bryant will be back before Romo. \nBryant broke a bone in his foot in the Cowboys’ season-opening win over the G-Men on Sept. 13. The the initial timetable for his recovery was 4-6 weeks. NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport later reported that Bryant is expected to miss 10-12 weeks after undergoing a bone graft , while ESPN’s Ed Werder said the bone graft performed should help and result in a 6-8 week recovery period. \nJerry Jones recently revealed that Bryant told him the pain in his foot is going away . \nIf you saw the video of Bryant jumping around like a madman on his broken foot , you know how badly he wants to return to action. While the Cowboys have lost their last two games, they would be wise not to rush him back.
