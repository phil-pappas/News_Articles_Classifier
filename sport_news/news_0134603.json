And it follows this month's \"housing emergency\" declaration and a $20 million pledge to combat homelessness.\nMeeting the nearly $67 million obligation will come at a cost, however, leaving less money available for redevelopment projects and public improvements such as streets and parks.\nHousing advocates hoped the City Council would dedicate 50 percent of urban renewal funds toward affordable housing, a pledge that would have increased funding by about $90 million.\nBut Mayor Charlie Hales believes the new spending commitment \"strikes the right balance,\" aide Jillian Detweiler said Friday.\n\"If we weren't in a housing crisis, we might be more comfortable with having the luxury to see things unfold and see if economic development projects materialize,\" she said. \"But right not it just seems irresponsible to let that money sit idle and unplanned when we know there's a need for it.\"\nThe plan follows negotiations involving Commissioners Dan Saltzman and Nick Fish, who support the increase.\nCommissioners Amanda Fritz and Steve Novick have expressed reservations, worried that increased housing spending would leave less for parks and street projects.\nBefore the proposed change, officials planned to dedicate about $202 million in urban renewal funds toward affordable housing over the next 10 years.\nHere's a list of urban renewal districts where the additional $67 million would be spent:\n$32 million -- Interstate Corridor, which includes parts of North and Northeast Portland $20 million -- River District, which includes the Pearl District and Old Town Chinatown $7.5 million -- Lents, which stretches along Southeast Foster Road to 122nd Avenue in east Portland $5 million -- North Macadam, which features the South Waterfront District just south of downtown. $2 million -- Gateway, envisioned as Portland's second downtown in east Portland.
