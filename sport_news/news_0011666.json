(AP) â€” Thomas Sirk threw four touchdown passes and ran for a 2-point conversion in the fourth overtime to lift No. 23 Duke to a 45-43 win over Virginia Tech on Saturday night.\nSirk hit Erich Schneider with a 25-yard TD pass on the first play of the fourth overtime, after the Hokies had scored and missed the mandatory 2-point attempt. Sirk then rolled right and cut upfield, giving the Blue Devils (6-1, 3-0) the victory in the longest game in Atlantic Coast Conference history.\nVirginia Tech (3-5, 1-3) lost for the fourth time in five games, and for the third time this season at home. The Hokies, getting the ball first in the fourth extra period, seemed in good shape to either win or extend it, but after Travon McMillians's 1-yard touchdown run, Michael Brewer's 2-point conversion pass to Isaiah Ford was broken up by Deondre Singleton just inside the goal line.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:35:17.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
