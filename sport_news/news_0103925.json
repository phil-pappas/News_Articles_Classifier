Now, the Wolverines are learning how to extend an impressive winning streak. After Bayfield High School made short work of Centauri on Friday, the team’s winning streak was stretched to five matches. The dominant 3-0 – 25-14, 25-12, 25-11 – win and the current streak is representative of how far the young team has come this season. Taylor Morris led the way for Bayfield with six kills, and Maddi Foutz had five aces for the Wolverines. “We’re really starting to come into our own this season, and it’s a lot of fun,” Bayfield head coach Terene Foutz said. “Everyone participated in (Friday night’s) win, and all of the girls are playing at a high level. It’s not just one or two girls, it’s been a total team contribution and that’s why we’re playing the way we’re playing.” The Wolverines were coming off a huge win at Pagosa Springs, who they beat twice this year. After starting the season 2-5, Bayfield (10-8, 6-1 Intermountain League) has a chance to tie for the league title if it can stretch the winning streak to six. If the Wolverines are to do that, they’ll have to beat a very good No. 6 Alamosa team (18-2, 7-0 IML) at 6 p.m. Tuesday in Bayfield. The rowdy Wolverine crowd is sure to be rocking the gym as it’s Bayfield’s last home match of the season and, more importantly, senior night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:38:22.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
