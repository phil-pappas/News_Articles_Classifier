Unfortunately, Manning hasn’t looked like Manning.\nYes, the Broncos are 4-0 heading into this Sunday’s meeting with the Oakland Raiders. But for the first time in Manning’s career, his team is winning games despite his quarterbacking. Through the season’s first four weeks, the Broncos’ defense leads the NFL in fewest yards allowed per game, per play, per pass play and is second in points allowed.\nImagine what the record-setting Manning of just two years ago, when he threw 55 touchdowns, would have done with such a unit. But that season may as well have been a lifetime ago given Manning’s recent performances. The Broncos’ offense ranks in the bottom six in the NFL in each of the categories cited that the defense is dominating in, plus, amazingly, interception rate. And if it wasn’t for the defense actually scoring touchdowns, the Broncos would be below average in putting the ball into the end zone, too.\nENLARGE Before this year, Manning’s offenses on average finished top five in all of those statistics except interception rate, where he was still usually in the top 10. Meanwhile, he was paired with defenses that tended to be mediocre or worse. That’s a big reason why his teams have won just one Super Bowl and are 11-13 in the postseason.\nManning and the Broncos must hope that the zip can somehow return to Manning’s 39-year-old arm, noticeably weak on deep passes that once were a trademark.\nA decent running game would also help. Denver’s backs have so far only been effective in setting up third-and-longs, ranking 29th in gaining just 3.5 yards per carry.\n—Michael Salfino", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AF868_COUNT1_G_20151007175958.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:26:08.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
