The four-time major champion is playing only as part of an agreement when he took part in an exhibition in Turkey three years ago. Tiger Woods also was supposed to play until he had a second back surgery. \nBut McIlroy's appearance is an example of how hectic a global golf schedule can be. \nMcIlroy will head over to Asia to wrap up the Race to Dubai on the European Tour. \nAnd in his view, his \"new\" season really began in August when he returned from an ankle injury. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:26:32.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
