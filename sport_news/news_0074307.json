They’re a competitive team.” \nKienzle had similar words of praise for Rowley. \n\"Fran is a great coach and she runs a great program,” Kienzle said. “We look out for each other.” \nRELATED : Rapid recap: Pen Argyl field hockey team edges Bangor \nPen Argyl goalkeeper Kasey Hanlon stopped four shots on Wednesday to preserve the victory. She feels the intensity level is raised a few notches whenever Pen Argyl and Bangor meet. \n“Whenever we play Bangor it’s always a big game,” Hanlon said. “We try to hold up our end by winning for everybody including ourselves.” \nHempeler emphasized how disappointed her team felt when Pen Argyl lost to Bangor 2-0 on Sept. 12. \n“The rivalry between us and Bangor is big,” Hempeler said. “When they beat us the first time it killed us. We just wanted to come out here today and play with great intensity and beat them.” \nThe intensity of the rivalry tends to get passed on from one generation to the next. \n“Most of the girls on the team have older siblings that went to Pen Argyl,” Hempeler said. “You know it’s a big thing at a young age. It keeps the rivalry pretty strong.” \nKienzle, then known as Lisa Kelton, played under former coach Carol Alfred at Bangor before graduating in 2001. Kienzle remembers the days of playing against the rival Green Knights. \n“Anytime the teams play they both come in super hungry,” Kienzle said. “It doesn’t matter what the teams’ abilities are. It’s always going to be a tough game. From the kids perspective, they tend to get so hyped up about the rivalry that sometimes they lose focus on what’s important – that there’s a game we have to play now.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
