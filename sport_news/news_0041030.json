Spoiling the Richwood Rams' homecoming, the Bastrop Rams jumped out to a 29-0 halftime lead and coasted to their fourth victory in five starts. Powell hooked up with wide receivers Al “Fig” Dowles Jr., Alontae Alford, Isaiah Graham, Ka'Juan Madison and tight end Travez Moore in the visiting Rams' final pre-district tuneup. Besides catching his first career touchdown pass, Moore logged three sacks. Middle linebacker Travion Caldwell tallied eight tackles, six behind the line of scrimmage, to highlight Bastrop's defensive effort. James Hill forced a fumble inside the Bastrop 5 to help preserve the Rams' first shutout since a 44-10, 2010 homecoming victory over West St. Mary. Factoring in a 35-7 Week 4 victory over Mansfield, Bastrop has allowed only seven points over the past two games. The defense was suspect in the early going as the Rams lost their season opener to Parkway 57-65, followed by back-to-back wins over Shiloh Christian, Arkansas (42-22) and Rayville (67-34). Bastrop's win over Richwood capped a 4-0 road swings. Returning home Friday night, Bastrop is matched against top-ranked and defending state champion Neville in the District 2-4A opener for both teams.
