Two of his teammates also posted centuries (Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis), but de Villiers’ ton was the most significant because it earned him a place in the record books.\nTHE ACHIEVEMENT\nThe 31-year-old’s knock saw him become the only player in the world (among those who have scored at least 500 ODI runs) to average more than 50 at a strike rate of more than 100 in one day internationals. At the end of the Indian bilateral series, de Villiers’ record makes for incredible reading — he averages 54.21 at a strike rate of 100.28.\nIf he maintains this record for the rest of his career he will become the only player in history to have managed such a feat, as no other player has ever finished with such stats to their name.\nA strike rate refers to the number of runs a batsman scores per 100 balls faced, while an average refers to the average amount of runs a batsman scores per innings.\nHIS CAREER\nHaving debuted in 2005, de Villiers has accumulated more than 8400 ODI runs in 187 innings, with 23 centuries and 47 half-centuries. What makes his achievement all the more remarkable is that he has had the added responsibility of skippering the national side in the 50-over format since Graeme Smith resigned after the 2011 World Cup.\nThere isn’t a shot de Villiers can’t play. Source: Reuters\nHOW DO THE REST STACK UP?\nTo put de Villiers’ record into perspective, of the 17 players with higher strike rates in ODI history, only two have managed to average in the 40s. One is Bangladesh’s Soumya Sarkar, who averages 49.42 at a strike rate of 102.51, but he has only played 16 internationals. The other is Aussie all-rounder James Faulkner, who has an average of 42.84 and a strike rate of 113.37. But again, he has sustained that form for the relatively short period of 44 games compared to de Villiers’ 195 appearances.\nThe rest of the list sees averages ranging from the teens to the mid-30s, showing just how difficult it is to combine a high strike rate with a high average. Often the search for quick runs results in more frequent dismissals for low scores, but de Villiers has bucked that trend by finding the perfect balance between aggression and longevity at the crease.\nDe Villiers sits second on the list of batsmen with the highest averages in ODI history, with only the Netherlands’ Ryan ten Doeschate boasting a better one (67 from 32 innings). The South African is the only member of that list’s top 10 to have a strike rate above 90.\nIn short, AB de Villiers is one of a kind.\nHis arm must get sore from constantly raising his bat. Source: AFP\nARE YOU SERIOUS?\nThe middle order batsman’s form in the coloured clothing in 2015 has been nothing short of ridiculous. In January he smashed the fastest ODI century in history when he reached triple figures off just 31 balls against the West Indies in Johannesburg. He haunted the same opposition for a second time when he notched the fastest 150 ever at the SCG during the World Cup, taking 64 deliveries to reach the milestone.\nHis personal performances at cricket’s showpiece tournament earlier this year were instrumental in helping him achieve his freakish record. He scored 482 runs in seven innings at an average of 96.4 and a strike rate of 144.31.\nTHE CONTEXT\nSome will argue the conditions of modern day cricket have made it easier for batsmen to dominate in the one day arena. The bats are thicker, grounds are smaller, pitches are flatter and fielding restrictions have given players more confidence to clear the infield without fear of finding a fielder.\nWhile all this is relevant, the reality remains that de Villiers has still managed to accomplish a feat unmatched by any of his peers, and it doesn’t look like any other player is about to catch him anytime soon.\nOriginally published as De Villiers sets insane record", "external_links": ["http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282919.html", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/26/1227582/968873-a3fa08d2-7b9c-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/ab-de-villiers-earns-a-place-in-the-record-books-with-this-remarkable-achievement/story-fndpt0dy-1227582968929", "http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282911.html", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/26/1227582/968900-b0e8e3d8-7b9c-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-27T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:11:36.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
