Guertin (4-2) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Bishop Guertin 22, Nashua North 0 \nLAST WEEK: Bishop Guertin 50, Manchester Memorial 14; Nashua North 28, Concord 21 \nFYI: Locally, it's the Game of the Year, as the winner has the inside track on the West Conference title. North will use the rushing strength of back Devin Leonard, a steady 100-yard rusher (179 yards, four TDs vs. Concord). BG will use its Jordan Hiscoe passing attack and fast-paced offense. North has the edge in size, Guertin may have a little more speed. Should be a dandy. \nNashua South (2-4) at Keene (2-4) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Nashua South 52, Keene 27 \nLAST WEEK: Nashua South 53, Alvirne 22; Manchester Central 45, Keene 27 \nFYI: The Panthers will score plen­ty of points - Sean Holland had four TD passes last week. The question is, how many will they give up? Defensively, they played better last week, shutting out Alvirne over the final two periods. Keene, led by senior QB Hunter Massucco, is otherwise young throughout its lineup. \nMerrimack (4-2) at Salem (4-2) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \nWHERE: Salem High School's Grant Field. \n2014 RESULT: Salem 28, Mer­rimack 0 \nLAST WEEK: Merrimack 41, Londonderry 7; Salem 27, Spauld­ing 20. \nFYI: Watch out for the Toma­hawks, who are playing some of their best football in years, thanks in part to the combo of junior QB Justin Grassini (284 yards passing last week) and junior receiver Tyler DeNeill (10 catches, 125 yards, a TD). Salem surprisingly played a much closer game with Spaulding last week, but the 'Hawks will have to defend against a super rushing attack led by Doug Maroun (three TDs at Rochester) and Charles Sibanda (185 yards). A big game and a big challenge. \nMan. Memorial (0-6) at Alvirne (0-6) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Did not play. \nLAST WEEK: Nashua South 53, Alvirne 22; Bishop Guertin 50, Manchester Memorial 14. \nFYI: One of these winless teams will go home happy for the first timethis season, and for the Bron­cos, with Bedford and Concord left on the schedule, this is probably their last shot. Same for the Cru­saders (North, Goffstown left). If Alvirne's Brad Kamal can duplicate his fine game vs. South (203 yards rushing), then the Broncos could do it. Watch for Memorial's Cam Hall (two TDs last week). \nDIVISION II \nTrinity (3-2) at Souhegan (4-1) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Trinity 28 Souhe­gan 24 \nLAST WEEK: Souhegan 26, San­born 7; Milford 46 Trinity 12. \nFYI: With winless Pelham and one-win Con-Val on remaining on the schedule, this is likely Souhe­gan's last major regular season challenge. Of course, judging from last week's Pioneer debacle vs. Mil­ford, one wonders just how much of a challenge it will be. Souhegan's running game is top-notch as Jonathan Nogueria and Cam Kinney combined for 286 rushing yards behind a line led by, among others, tackle Aaron Stonebraker, guard Blake Karavas and center Evan Dodge. Trinity is led by quarterback Pat Mackey and backs Saikou Bau and Nick Perdue. \nHollis Brookline (2-4) at ConVal (1-4) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \nWHERE: Con-Val Regional in Peterborugh \n2014 RESULT: Con-Val 35, Hollis Brookline 21 \nLAST WEEK: Kingwood 41, Con- Val 35; Hollis Brookline 16, Pelham 6. \nFYI: Looks like a pretty even matchup, as Con-Val can score points, eclipsing the 30-point mark twice this season. The Cavs will have to see what their QB situa­tion will be (both Joey Delaney and Tyler Bergerson have been hurt) and perhaps rely on the rushing of backs Wyatt Farwell and Brian Delaney, plus the defense of Kanye Robert (two sacks last week). Con-Val is led offensively by junior running back Danny Parker and defensively by senior linebacker Dillon Obuchowski. \nDIVISION III \nFarmington (1-4) at Campbell (1-4) \nWHEN: Saturday, 1:30 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Campbell 21, Farmington-Nute 0 \nLAST WEEK: Neither team played. \nFYI: It looks like a pretty even matchup on paper; the Cougars have allowed 176 points and F-N has given up 178. Let's see how the week off impacts both teams; QB Hunter Hannon and receiver Mi­chael Gray will want to resume the work they did in the Cougars' 19-14 loss two weeks ago vs. Epping- Newmarket. F-N has its own combo of QB Connor Major and receiver D.J. Herson.
