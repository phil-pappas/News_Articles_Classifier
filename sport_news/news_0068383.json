One of those came true as the Raider freshman claimed 12th to help CMB finish sixth in the team standings. \n“He was at about 16th a mile into the race,” CMB coach Jerry Meinerts said of Thomson. “He kept working his way up. He was 13th with 400 meters to go and caught another guy and was close to two more. He had a great race, and it was good to see him run well.” \nPrairie City-Monroe also ran on Iowa State’s Cross Country course and finished eighth. Class 3A No. 10 Gilbert won the meet with 30 points, while North Polk was second with 83 and Nevada was third with 91. \nClass 1A No. 7 South Hamilton did not have the services of its No. 2 runner and still tied Nevada with 91 points but took fourth overall. \nRoland-Story rounded out the top five with 126 points, while CMB (155), Saydel (185), PCM (187) and Greene County (256) completed the nine-team field. \nThe windy conditions gave the runners some mixed feelings. \nThomson thought the wind affected him during the early stages of the race but not so much after that. Overall, Thomson was happy with his performance. \n“I just wanted to run the best race I could and hopefully make all-conference,” Thomson said. “It’s a tough conference. I was close to the PR that I ran at South Hamilton.” \nPCM junior Chris Ellens had a different opinion. He thought the wind and hills in the middle of the course made things tougher. Ellens was disappointed with his overall performance as he placed two spots shy of an all-conference spot in 16th. \n“I had a couple guys pass me at the end, so it was kind of disappointing,” Ellens said. “The wind wasn’t any fun. Those hills in the back killed me, too. We haven’t run on a hilly course in awhile so that hurt me I think.” \nThomson’s 12th-place finish was clocked at 18 minutes, 9.95 seconds. Sophomore Max Van Maanen was the next Raider to cross as he was 25th with a time of 19:09.90 and sophomore Carter Fricke was 34th in 19:25.37. \n“He’s getting closer to Ian,” Meinerts said of Van Maanen. “He’s getting into shape and he’s getting better and better each time out.” \nCMB’s final two counting places were from freshmen Eric Wagner and Josh Bruntz, who were 62nd and 65th, respectively. Junior Brady Ross (84th) and junior Curtis Jones (110th) also ran on the varsity. \n“We have a pretty solid top three,” Meinerts said. “We need to figure out how to close that gap between three and four. Once we figure that out, it will help us a lot.” \nEllens crossed the finish line in 18:21.66. Sophomore Blake Lee was next in 37th and the other counting runners were Noah Henkenius in 63rd, sophomore Brady North in 69th and Mark Bruxvoort in 79th. \nAndreas Vargas (80th) and Bradley McClellan (111th) also competed on the PCM varsity. \nGilbert sophomore Jason Taylor won the race in 17:44.14. The Tigers won the meet, because they grabbed five of the first 11 spots. \nPCM runs at 5 p.m. Thursday at Saydel and both CMB and PCM compete in a 2A state qualifier on Oct. 22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:50:47.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
