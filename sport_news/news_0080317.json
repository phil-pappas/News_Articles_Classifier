Scottie Upshall also scored for the St. Louis. \nMason Raymond, Jiri Hudler and David Jones scored for Calgary (1-2-0), which fell to 0-2 at Scotiabank Saddledome. \n\"We started how we wanted, got off to a good start, but I think we had three shots in the second so you're not going to get a lot of wins with only three shots, so that was disappointing,\" said Raymond. \nCalgary was held to 10 shots through 40 minutes, but got back to within one early in the third period when Jones took advantage of a bad turnover deep in his own end by Blues captain David Backes. \nThe Flames weren't able to find the equalizer despite a late push in the final couple minutes. \n\"Right now, in some parts of the game, our execution is very good. And in some other parts, our execution is not good at all,\" said Calgary coach Bob Hartley. \"We're making bad puck decisions, we giving easy pucks away and against good teams, against teams that are big, that are physical, you're just giving them the momentum.\" \nHitchcock said the turning point was when his team settled into their own game. \n\"Once we got out of the track meet, we were a lot better,\" said Hitchcock. \"When we play our game, we struggle and when we play their game, we really struggle. We got out of their game halfway through the first period and then really started to settle down.\" \nBrian Elliott had 15 saves to improve to 2-0-0 on the season. Hiller turned aside 24 shot in falling to 1-1-0. \nThe Blues have dominated the Flames in recent years going 7-0-1 in their last eight games. During that span, St. Louis hadn't trailed in a game to the Flames until Raymond scored 1:14 into the first period on the first shot of the game. \nThe Blues continue their six-game road trip Thursday night in Edmonton against the Oilers. \nNotes: St. Louis lost defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk (lower body) in the second period and Calgary left-winger Lance Bouma (lower body) also hobbled off the ice and never returned in the second. ... Referee Brad Meier worked his 1,000th NHL game. He was honoured in a pre-game ceremony. ... Scratches for the Flames were RW Josh Jooris and G Joni Ortio. ... Rookie Robby Fabbri (concussion) did not dress for St. Louis. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:17:59.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
