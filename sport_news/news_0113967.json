The part about that running game that impresses the most isn't just how good it is, but how explosive it is. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nThe thing that stands out about the Tigers is this: with 338 points scored, they've averaged about 48 points per game this year. Not only is that the best in Class D around here, but it's the second most in all of Section IV. Only Elmira has scored more than Tioga. \nIf the Blackhawks want to pull the upset, they may need to make it a defensive battle. They're capable of doing that -- they've allowed just under 18 points per game, good for third-best in Class D. \nTioga and Oxford played each other in Week 7, with the Tigers winning 43-26. \nThe rematch is set for Friday, Oct. 23 at 7 p.m. at Tioga.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:30:13.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
