Their poor form continued as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of West Ham United on 24 October. \nThe west London side won the league comfortably last season. However, things have not gone as planned for them, as they have managed just three wins from 10 matches and have already conceded 19 goals. \nChelsea are 15 th in the table with 11 points, five points above the relegation zone. According to the Daily Mail , the Portuguese tactician's job at Stamford Bridge is under threat and the club's board will review his position after publicly backing him earlier in October. \nMourinho's side will face Stoke City in the Capital One Cup clash, before hosting Liverpool in the league tie. The next two games in the span of a week will be crucial for the former Real Madrid manager and that could decide his future at the Bridge. \nA defeat to Liverpool - who have a new manager Jurgen Klopp – will put an end to his second spell with the English outfit. Former Inter Milan defender Lucio, who played under Mourinho, told IBTimes UK that the 52-year-old will get Chelsea back on top soon . \nIn addition to this, the Chelsea manager had earlier admitted that he cannot be sacked. However, the club's board have already been contacted by several intermediaries on behalf of managers looking to replace Mourinho. \nCarlo Ancelotti was shown the exit door by Real Madrid at the end of the 2014/15 season. He has managed Chelsea before and the Italian, who is on a sabbatical, is open to the idea of returning to the London club. Guus Hiddink is considered to be another short-term option to replace the current manager. \nMourinho signed a new four-year deal in August which is worth around £30m ($46m), according to the Daily Mail. Chelsea are not willing to pay that amount if he is sacked and the club's chiefs have already discussed a severance package.
