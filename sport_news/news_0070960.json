(AP) - A 2009 lawsuit that alleged hazing within the Southern University marching band has been settled, but no details have been released.\nThe Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1Nlw2yy ) the suit was set for trial Monday, but court records indicate the case was \"compromised and settled\" earlier this month. The trial date was canceled.\nSouthern University System officials said there is an agreement in principle, not a final agreement, so no settlement details are being released at this time.\nMarcus Heath and Cameron Taylor sued the school and Jeremy Dixon, a former student band leader, after an off-campus hazing incident in 2008 that involved band members being struck by boards as part of an unsanctioned initiation into the band's unofficial French horn fraternity called Mellow Phi Fellow.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
