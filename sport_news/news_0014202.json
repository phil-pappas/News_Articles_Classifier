(USATSI) \n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays went to Texas facing an 0-2 deficit in the ALDS round against the Rangers . They'll come back home all tied up, 2-2, thanks to an 8-4 victory in Arlington on Monday in Game 4.\nHere are six things to know.\n1. The Blue Jays' offense has its mojo back \nThe Blue Jays had the best offense in baseball during the regular season and it wasn't close. They only managed three runs on six hits in Game 1 while scoring just four runs in 14 innings in Game 2. There were plenty of chances to break through and they just couldn't get it done.\nFast-forward to Game 3 and though they had a lead, the Blue Jays still only had two runs on the board heading into the sixth. They had the bases loaded and no outs before a double play left them in danger of blowing another opportunity to break the game wide open.\nThen Troy Tulowitzki hit a three-run homer and since then things have fallen into place.\nIn Game 4, Josh Donaldson and Chris Colabello both homered in the first inning. Kevin Pillar homered in the second. Colabello and Pillar had big hits in a three-run third and the lead was 7-0 by the middle of the third inning.\nIn all, the Blue Jays got eight runs on 12 hits, including four doubles and three homers. They also took five walks, so they were all over the basepaths in this one. I said before the series that their offense was relentless and this was the first game where we truly saw as much from the get-go.\n2. Derek Holland has a dubious distinction \nHolland was bad down the stretch, but you always think there's a chance he'll get things figured out because of his track record. Instead, he was torched for six runs on five hits in just two-plus innings. He allowed three homers, which leads us to ...\nRangers pitchers with 3 HR allowed in a playoff game: C.J.

Wilson 2011 ALCS gm 5 Derek Holland 2011 ALCS gm 6\nâ€” Kazuto Yamazaki (@Kazuto_Yamazaki) October 12, 2015 Yeah, that's not a good outing, especially when all of this happened while only recording six outs. Yes, the Blue Jays' offense is relentless, but should the Rangers advance to the ALCS, it's hard to have much confidence in him moving forward.\n3. The Blue Jays' use of David Price shows confidence in Marcus Stroman \nDavid Price warmed up several times in Game 3 and did so again in Game 4. This time, he actually entered the game, working three-plus innings in relief.\nThus, Price can't come back and start Game 5 on Wednesday. The Jays brought Price in with a six-run lead, too, so it's not like they were in desperation mode. No, using him like this shows that manager John Gibbons has to have confidence in Stroman coming back in Game 5. He'll be on normal rest.\nStroman allowed three earned runs on five hits in seven-plus innings in Game 2, but he really got things locked down after the second inning. He also had a 1.67 ERA in four regular-season starts. The stuff is there, we'll see if he can dominate.\nAs for Price, it'll be interesting to see if he's available in Game 5 out of the bullpen. He threw 50 pitches and there's only one day off in between games. This is a real curious decision by manager John Gibbons. Apparently he really wanted to protect the lead, but Price gave up three runs in three innings.\n4. Rangers offense might be turning the corner\n\nThough he can barely move, Adrian Beltre managed to hammer out two hits with a serious back injury. What a trooper. As for the rest of the Rangers? They might be getting on track.\nThe Rangers entered Game 4 with a .186/.244/.265 line in the series. Though much of the damage came late and when the Blue Jays safely had the game in hand, the Rangers did manage 11 hits in this one.\nOf course, the bad news is that 10 of those 11 hits were singles and they didn't draw a single walk.\nStill, Shin-Soo Choo had three hits, Elvis Andrus had two and Prince Fielder had one. That's at least some reason for optimism heading into Game 5 for the meat of the order.\n5. The Blue Jays are on the verge of history \nOnly the 2001 Yankees and 2012 Giants have ever come back to win divisional series since losing the first two games at home. The Blue Jays have now evened things up at 2-2 in the series. A Game 5 victory puts them in pretty good company, given that the Yankees got to Game 7 of the World Series and the Giants won it all.\n6. Are the Rangers replicating 2010? \nBack in the 2010 ALDS against the Rays , the Rangers won the first two games on the the road. Then they lost two games at home. Then they went into The Trop and used a lefty starter they had acquired via trade that summer ( Cliff Lee ).\nIn this series, the Rangers won their two road games, lost both of their home games and are now likely to use Cole Hamels , a lefty they acquired via trade in July.\nHmmm ...\nTopics: Adrian Beltre , C.J.
