New England has won six straight in the series, including two straight in the playoffs to end Indianapolis' postseason runs in the past two years. \nThe most recent of those contests was a 45-7 decision in the AFC title tilt that sent the Patriots on their way to a victory against the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX. That game also launched the never-ending Deflategate saga. \nColts general manager Ryan Grigson sent an email to the NFL prior to the championship game to warn of New England's possible use of underinflated footballs. The league mounted a controversial investigation in the months following the season that resulted in the Patriots being fined $1 million and being docked a first-round draft pick in 2016 and a fourth-rounder in 2017. \nQuarterback Tom Brady also initially was handed a four-game suspension as part of the punishment, but he won an August appeal in federal court and has been torching on-field opponents ever since. \nThrough four weeks, Brady has completed 72.5 percent of his passes for 1,387 yards with 11 touchdowns and no interceptions. And now he's facing the team that put the ball in motion for a trying offseason. \nBut he won't admit to any additional personal motivation this week. \n\"I'm always pretty motivated,\" Brady said. \"It'll be an exciting game. I know they've got a good team. They've won three straight. They made some changes this offseason. So they're a very confident team. So it's going to take a great effort to beat them.\" \nHad the suspension stood, this would have been Brady's first game back. \nInstead, it's the Colts who could be dealing with a quarterback shaking off some rust. \nAndrew Luck struggled through the first three weeks, completing just 56 percent of his passes with more interceptions (7) than touchdowns (5). And he sat out the past two weeks with soreness in his right shoulder. \nThe fourth-year passer officially is listed as questionable this week, but he is expected to play. \nDon't expect the Patriots to roll out the welcome mat. Luck has turned   games against New England and said there's no secret to the defending Super Bowl champs' success. \n\"They do a good job of sort of taking your strengths away and forcing you to play left-handed in a sense,\" Luck said. \"They do it with very good football players.\" \nLast season, New England used   top receiver T.Y. Hilton, and the Colts had no response. \nThis time around, Indianapolis feels it has a deeper stable of weapons and can find ways to spring Hilton for a big play or two. \n\"We just find ways to position T.Y. so that he can win his matchup,\" offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton said. \"Without giving you too much information, I think we have a good plan going into this game on Sunday night.\" \nDefensively, the Colts must find a way to stop the Patriots' running game. New England has rushed for 657 yards in the past three meetings, and that has paved the way for blowout victories. \nRookies Henry Anderson and David Parry have teamed with veteran Kendall Langford on a new-look defensive line that has played solidly for Indianapolis all season. But the Pats will provide the stiffest test they've seen to date. \n\"I've been watching a lot of film, and also I've been working out there in practice,\" Parry said. \"We've been pretty purposeful about making sure substitutions are right. Everybody is communicating. So, as long as we get on the same page, we should be alright.\" \nBoth teams said they're not looking at the past. \nThis game could have implications for the postseason, and the football nation will be watching in prime time. \nThe Colts were embarrassed by their performance   but they're letting that go. In their minds, this Indianapolis team has never played this New England squad. \nIt's a chance to host the hottest team in the league and an opportunity to find out how the Colts stack up. \nNothing less. Nothing more. \n\"It's important to us because we're starting to build momentum,\" reigning AFC Defensive Player of the Week Mike Adams said. \"We're getting our guys back. Young guys stepped up, and we still won three games in a row. We're starting to get healthy and get guys back. It should be a great test for us.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:39:26.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
