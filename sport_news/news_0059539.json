It remains uncommon for women to coach either men or boys, at least in team sports. \nJen Welter’s appointment as an Arizona Cardinals “assistant coaching intern” was news last summer. \nWelter has a masters in sports psychology and a PhD in psychology. She played professionally for 14 years, including briefly in the Indoor Football League, which, otherwise, was for men only. \nBut despite garnering praise for her work with Arizona’s linebacker corps, Welter wasn’t offered a job by the Cardinals or any other team once the preseason ended. \nWhere professional sports is concerned, it’s easy and probably correct to mention closed doors and minds. \nBut what about the high school level? Why are so few women hired to coach boys? \nSusan Dullea is one of eight female athletic directors in Section 1. She said females may have a tough time being considered for posts with boys teams in some locations, remarking, “I’m not naïve enough to think that doesn’t happen. There may be pockets.” \nBut Dullea, who previously served as athletic director at Croton and Haldane, thinks bigger reasons are at play than isolated bias. \nWhile attending Ithaca College, she took courses in coaching football and baseball but did so because she wanted to learn from top coaches, not because she wanted to coach those sports. \n“I wanted to be a role model for young women. I wanted to coach the sports I played,” she said. \nOf bias keeping women from coaching boys teams, Meg Kaplan, longtime Horace Greeley boys swimming coach, said, “I don’t see that at all.” \n“Some places felt a man was a better coach,” she said, but that was decades ago. \nBoys swimming, like running, has multiple female coaches. But, as Kaplan noted, those are “individual sports with a team element,” rather than traditional team sports. \nWhile unsure why the numbers are low, she said high schools lose female coaches in general because home roles have remained much the same, while coaching demands have increased. Preseason practices begin earlier, seasons are long and games and meets now stretch into weekends. \n“It’s the total hours taken away from family. I think there are different commitments,\" she said, indicating she has been lucky because her husband has always been willing to handle child-related chores like dinner and homework while she’s at meets and practices. \nBronxville’s 18-year athletic director, Karen Peterson, has never had a woman apply to coach a boys team. She attributes this partly to lingering perceptions. \n“I would think they don’t see it as an open market for them,” she said. “I think it’s what people think is accessible. … I think part of it is how you grow up and what you see around you.” \nIn other words, if a female coach hasn’t seen another female coaching boys, she may not even think to apply for that job. \nThere are exceptions. \nKeren Larkin took over as Carmel High varsity boys soccer coach last season. \nThis year, Siobhan McDermott will be head boys junior varsity basketball coach at Woodlands and will be a bench coach for the varsity team for the second straight year. \nMcDermott, who previously coached the girls varsity, was the boys modified (middle school) coach the past two years. She enjoys coaching boys, has gotten positive feedback from them, she said, and doesn’t know why there aren’t more women like her. \nBut Larkin suggests young female coaches who aren’t teachers may think it difficult to gain the respect of boys. \nLarkin thinks she has been accepted in part because she plays co-ed soccer, including against some coaches of teams Carmel plays. “If I were not a good soccer player myself, it might be more difficult,” she said. \nTess Brogan, Clarkstown North’s athletic director, said her school has had women coach boys cross-country, track and volleyball. \n“I think it ultimately comes down to who’s the best person for the job and who’s applying. I’ve certainly seen great success from the women coaching boys at the high school level,” Brogan said. \nAnd maybe with role models like Hammon, Lieberman and Welter, more women will apply to coach boys teams. \nCarmel currently has two openings for winter, including modified wrestling. Dullea noted she’d written a letter asking people to send potential candidates her way. She noted the letter says, “send him or her my way.” \n“It doesn’t matter what gender they are. It’s what they bring to the table,\" she said. \"Do they know the sport?” \nTwitter: @HaggertyNancy 6 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RUokNm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:12:09.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
