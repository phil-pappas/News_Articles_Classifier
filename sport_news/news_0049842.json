A three-member Bench headed by Justice TS Thakur pointed out that under the Army Rules 1953 soldiers enjoyed certain “inbuilt safeguards” against discharge from service based on four red ink entries. “The first and foremost (safeguard) is an unequivocal declaration that mere award of four red ink entries to an individual does not make his discharge mandatory. This implies that four red ink entries is not some kind of laxman rekha which if crossed would by itself render the individual concerned undesirable or unworthy of retention in the force,” it ruled. The Bench delivered the verdict after a detailed analysis of Section 22 of the Army Act 1950 and the 1953 rules, instructions and procedures. The other members of the Bench were Justices V Gopala Gowda and R Banumathi. Acknowledging that Rule 13 did not in specific terms envisage an inquiry or provide for consideration of various factors, the apex court pointed out that at the same time this rule did not make it mandatory for the competent authority to discharge an individual just because he had been awarded four red ink entries. “The threshold of four red ink entries as a ground for discharge has no statutory sanction. Its genesis lies in administrative instructions issued on the subject,” the Bench ruled while rejecting government’s contention that the instructions and procedure were in excess of what was mandated under the rules and as such did not confer any right to inquiry on personnel who had four red marks. “The instructions cannot be faulted on the ground that the instructions concede to the individual more than what is provided for by the rule. The instructions are aimed at ensuring a non-discriminatory, fair and non-arbitrary application of the statutory rule,” the Bench said. Explaining its logic, the SC said red ink entries suffered by two soldiers for overstaying leave for one week and six months could not be treated on the same footing. “If two persons who suffer such entries are treated similarly notwithstanding the gravity of the offence being different, it would be unfair and unjust, for unequals cannot be treated as equals.” The Bench made the clarifications while allowing an appeal by Veerendra Kumar Dubey who had been discharged on December 14, 1992, from the corps of Artillery as he got four red ink entries in 12 years since his enrolment as an Operator in September 1980. Army had given him a show cause notice to which he said he overstayed his leave for the first time due to his wife’s illness and the second time because of his own health problem. The Bench said an inquiry should have been held instead of discharging him after merely rejecting his reply to the notice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:05:25.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
