Dakota 37-31 By   \nGRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) - Idaho State scored the last 22 points of the game to rally past North Dakota 37-31 Saturday in the Big Sky Conference. \nTrailing 31-15 late in the third quarter, the Bengals (2-5, 1-2) got two touchdowns from Jakori Ford and another from KW Williams. \nIdaho State quarterback Michael Sanders completed 32 of 49 pass attempts for 427 yards and four touchdowns. His 27-yard pass to Jakori Ford with 6:15 to play was the game-winner. \n“No question we got outplayed down the stretch,” North Dakota coach Bubba Schweigert said. \nUND led 31-15 after John Santiago’s 27-yard TD run with 1:21 left in the third. Santiago ran for 155 of UND’s 270 rushing yards. \nBut Idaho State rallied late behind Sanders’ second TD pass to Williams a minute later, and Ford’s 1-yard run with 10:30 to play, to make it 31-29. \nWilliams caught 12 passes for 204 yards and two scores and Madison Mangum caught 10 passes for 142 yards and a TD. \nThe Bengals were forced to the air by a UND defense gave up just 53 yards on the ground. \n“They always get the ball out quick so it’s hard to get pressure on a team like that,” UND linebacker Will Ratelle said. “Their offensive line protected well, too.” \nUND took a 21-15 lead into halftime despite three turnovers. \nMistakes played a role in Idaho State’s early lead. UND’s Keaton Studsrud threw an interception, Josh Seibel muffed a punt return and Santiago lost a fumble. \nStudsrud was injured in the third quarter and replaced by Ryan Bartels, who was 3 of 8 for 47 yards. \nIdaho State cashed in on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Sanders to a wide-open Williams. But the PAT failed, leaving the Bengals up 6-0. \nSeibel atoned for the mistake on UND’s ensuing possession when he caught a 13-yard TD pass from Studsrud. Reid Taubenheim’s PAT made it 7-6 with 3:21 left in the first quarter. \nIdaho State answered with a 35-yard Zak Johnson field goal and a 34-yard TD pass from Sanders to Mangum that gave the Bengals a 15-14 lead with 7:55 left in the half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:07:39.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
