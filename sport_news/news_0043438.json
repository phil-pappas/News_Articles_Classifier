Come Thursday, the ahead-of-schedule Astros will open play in the American League division series against the defending AL-champion Kansas City Royals.\nBaseball's surprise team advanced from the one-and-done AL wild-card game behind another dominant outing from ace Dallas Keuchel and a few timely hits. The Astros' 3-0 win against the Yankees was their first postseason win since 2005, the year they made the franchise's only World Series appearance. Now they'll head to Kansas City, which will host Games 1 and 2 of the division series.\nKeuchel, the front-runner to win this year's AL Cy Young Award, was magnificent even though he was pitching on three day of rest for the first time as a professional. The precise 27-year-old left-hander allowed only three singles over six scoreless innings. He struck out seven and issued just one walk.\nBetween the regular and postseasons, Keuchel, a driving force behind Houston's earlier-than-expected success, did not allow a run in 22 innings against the Yankees this year. The bearded Oklahoman exemplifies the notion that a pitcher doesn't need overpowering velocity to be an ace. His fastball and sinker each averaged only a shade more than 90 mph in the regular season.\nKeuchel's counterpart, the $175 million Japanese right-hander Masahiro Tanaka, was far from his best on Tuesday but limited the damage against him to two solo home runs. Each came off the first pitch of an inning, Colby Rasmus on a fastball in the second and Carlos Gomez on a slider in the fourth. Jose Altuve's run-scoring single off Dellin Betances in the seventh served as an insurance run for Houston.\nFor Gomez, the home run had to have been especially gratifying given his struggles at the plate since the July 30 trade that sent him to Houston from the Milwaukee Brewers. The energetic 29-year-old outfielder wasn't even a sure-thing to play Tuesday because of a strained rib muscle that cost him the season's final series.\nEven before the game, first-year Astros manager A.J. Hinch noted that Gomez was not 100 percent but that he was \"bouncing around the clubhouse ready to play.\" It had been six days since his last game. After Gomez grounded out to end the top of the sixth inning Tuesday, Hinch and a team trainer came onto the field to check on him. Gomez appeared to show discomfort during a swing but stayed in the game, celebrating on the field with his teammates after the final out.\nThe Yankees managed only three hits for the game, failing to have any more luck against Houston's bullpen than they did Keuchel. The sixth was the only inning in which two of their batters reached base against Keuchel. Didi Gregorius' single to lead off that frame snapped a streak of 10 consecutive batters the pitcher had set down. Carlos Beltran's base hit put two runners on with two outs as Alex Rodriguez stepped to the plate.\nHinch emerged from the dugout but opted against pulling Keuchel, instead returning to the bench after a meeting with his pitcher and infielders. One pitch later, Rodriguez flew out on a first-pitch cutter to end the Yankees' threat.\nThe manager's faith in his ace once again paid off.\n(c)2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733646&h=Keuchel+leads+Astros+past+Yankees+in+wild%2Dcard+game%2C+3%2D0", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733646", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733646&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:15:29.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
