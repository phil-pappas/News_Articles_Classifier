In the case of Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. it appears to be an understatement. \nBeckham is expected to play despite a hamstring injury that kept him out of practice. He did the same last week, when he didn't participate in practice until the day before the game. \nThe Giants have their regular short, high-intensity practice planned for Saturday. Beckham is expected to participate and be ready for Sunday's vital NFC East matchup with the Dallas Cowboys. \n\"I'm counting on that, yes,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \nBeckham has been nursing a tender hamstring for the past two weeks now. He was originally injured late in the team's victory over the San Francisco 49ers. \nHe doesn't appear too concerned about the problem, even if he's been hampered by previous hamstring injuries. Odell Beckham teaching Rueben Randle to do Odell Beckham things Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham appears to be teaching fellow Giants WR Rueben Randle how to do Odell Beckham things during practice Thursday. \n\"It feels good, it feels great. I'm just focused on Sunday,\" Beckham said on Thursday. \nRELATED : Giants should get defensive reinforcement vs. Cowboys \n\"We're going to be all right.\" \nBeckham had seven catches for 61 yards and a touchdown Monday night against the Eagles. All of the damage came in the first half, which opened the conversation to whether he was slowed by the injury or lack of targets in the second half. \nBeckham was targeted just once in the final two quarters when quarterback Eli Manning overthrew him on a deep pass down the left sideline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:28:59.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
