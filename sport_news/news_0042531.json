Rivals zigged and zagged; the Cardinal’s course has maintained a straight line.\nThis has often been for better — Stanford is 47-13 since Shaw’s ascension to head coach in 2011 — and, occasionally, for worse. September’s loss at Northwestern triggered memories of recent regular-season missteps against perceived underdogs. It’s easy to recall the Cardinal’s doomed-to-fail fourth-down dive in a Rose Bowl loss to Michigan State in early 2013, a decision Shaw explained with frustratingly rational logic: We’re Stanford.\nMore so than any other championship-contending program in the country, Stanford doesn’t deviate from a script. Stanford will win, Stanford will lose — the former far more than the latter — yet Stanford will be Stanford, offensively and defensively, as college football’s version of a platinum-album rock band that never strays from its set list of greatest hits.\n“People panic all the time,” Shaw said Thursday, after Stanford’s 56-35 win against UCLA. “Whenever something doesn't happen, people panic. Coaches and players can't panic. We have won a lot of football games here playing the right way, playing smart football, playing good football, and it's hard for the outside world to understand it.”\nYet subtle change is afoot at Stanford, growth seen most clearly in the figure most crucial to the Cardinal’s quest for the College Football Playoff: Shaw, who has evolved — partially at his players’ request — into a coach more willing to display his emotions rather than rest behind his stoicism.\n“Last year I used to say to guys all the time, don't keep your passion for the team a secret and don't keep your passion for your teammates a secret,” Shaw said. “That's probably the biggest area of growth for me, is to let the guys know that I'm into it, too, that I'm enjoying it too, that I can celebrate when they win or when they make a play as well.”\nFittingly, given how Thursday night’s win against UCLA should vault Stanford back into the national conversation, this change has roots in last season’s victory against the Bruins. Despite the Cardinal’s three-possession lead, Shaw spent much of the second half pacing the sidelines, bothered, “antsy,” senior defensive back Ronnie Harris said.\nHarris, a team captain and leader in an inexperienced secondary, approached Shaw. Just let it out, he said. “If you have just an outburst of passion, you don't know how much energy that gives to us,” Harris said. “And he’s answered the bell.”\nShaw has “more pep in his step,” Harris added. “He’s emotional,” said running back Christian McCaffrey. Shaw is “bringing the juice,” said cornerback Alijah Holder. “We feed off the energy,” wide receiver Francis Owusu said. The players have seen a different coach at practice, at film study, during pregame speeches and halftime adjustments, even as the message — We are Stanford — has remained constant.\nShaw hasn’t necessarily changed his personality, nor have the Cardinal changed as a team, exactly; Shaw has merely tweaked his approach to suit the need, with the end result that Stanford’s playing with a higher energy level — and playing at a higher level, period.\n“Really, football is an emotional game, and it's a shame to let the emotion out of it,” McCaffrey said. “This year we definitely focused on playing our game and having fun with our brothers. I love coming to practice every day and just feel blessed that we get to show our emotion.”\nThe Cardinal have won four in a row to open Pac-12 Conference play for the first time since 2011. The offense has scored 40 or more points in each of the last four games, rolling at a clip unseen in the post-Andrew Luck era; Stanford is one of just 10 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision to score 40 or more points four times. Stanford has topped 50 points in each of the past two games, a first since 2011. Each of its five wins have come by a double-digit margin.\nThe scheme hasn’t changed on offense, but the production has. Last year’s team was woefully inconsistent through much of the regular season, only finding a rhythm upon installing pieces of an up-tempo formula in November. After struggling against Northwestern — scoring just six points, placing Shaw’s play-calling under increased scrutiny — the offense has taken shape behind McCaffrey, a do-everything sophomore who has rushed headlong into the Heisman Trophy conversation.\nMcCaffrey broke the program’s single-game rushing mark with 243 yards against the Bruins, highlighted by a 70-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, and accounted for 369 all-purpose yards, just shy of school record. There are many great running backs in college football, with two in particular — LSU’s Leonard Fournette and Ohio State’s Ezekiel Elliott — at the forefront of the Heisman race. No back, and perhaps no player in the country, can match McCaffrey’s three-phase impact, whether as a runner, receiver or returner.\n“They heard all the things that were said on the offensive side, that we couldn't be a Stanford offense because we didn't have a big back,” Shaw said. “We’ve got a big back in a little body. He's just an outstanding football player — and he's just a sophomore.”\nSaid quarterback Kevin Hogan, “I wouldn’t even call him a running back. He’s just an incredible football player. He does everything; he does it well.”\nBut McCaffrey’s surge fits into the greater message. The offense hasn’t changed, but the production has: Stanford is more explosive using the same playbook, more consistent and more dangerous within the existing scheme. Shaw is still even-keeled, merely more willing to show his passion and energy — pumping his fist on a fourth-down stop, shaking his head, smiling in disbelief after Owusu’s over-the-back touchdown grab in the second half.\nAnd Stanford is still Stanford, only energized by the evolution of a coach confident enough in his message to alter his approach.\n“He's getting us way more ready for these games just by his passion,” Harris said. “He's just being himself out there, he's having fun, he's backing up his boys now. We just see him more relaxed. You see him happier. And our team is feeding off that.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:47:28.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
