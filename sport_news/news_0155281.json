It’s typically good for a player to spend a little time in the AHL.\n“Look at a guy like Klef (Oscar Klefbom), who benefitted, I think, a lot from it,” said Andrew Ference, adding the emergence of Klefbom and the arrival of Griffin Reinhart, not to mention Andrej Sekera and Eric Gryba, have made it tougher to get a spot here.\n“We have a lot of guys here this year, obviously. A lot of young guys pushing to come into the league. It’s a dog fight to earn your job and earn your ice.”\nBut Ference believes Nurse has the skills and heart to stay in the NHL for a very long time once he gets here.\n“He’s a tremendous player, there’s no doubt about that,” said Ference. “He’s obviously just physically a great athlete. His movement and his aggressiveness and his willingness to do whatever it takes in a game makes for a tremendous teammate.\n“And it doesn’t take very long to season. It’s not like when I came in and young guys took a few years. Young guys coming in now are coming in so prepared and so ready for the NHL game now it doesn’t take the good ones too long to be ready for it.”\nMcLellan says Nurse is not far off right now, and expects him in the NHL very soon.\n“Nobody wants to be cut,” he said. “Whether you’re 18 or 39 you don’t want to be released. You take it on the chin and it hurts a little bit.\n“Darnell is a very proud man and it hurt a little bit but I’ll see a smile again, it won’t be long.”\nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski\nrobert.tychkowski@sunmedia.ca\nOilers prospect defenceman Darnell Nurse going to Bakersfield Condors\nBy Robert Tychkowski , Edmonton Sun First posted: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 08:45 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 09:27 PM EDT\nFor most of his life Darnell Nurse has been on the other side of the numbers game, one of the reasons coaches give when they explain to a bubble player why he just got cut.\nBut when it comes to the NHL, he’s been the one having to put on the brave face as he packs his bags and heads out the door.\nThe 20-year-old defenceman was among the Edmonton Oilers cuts on Tuesday (along with Mitch Moroz, Iiro Pakarinen and Martin Gernat) and won’t be with the team on opening night.\nIt’s his third camp and second year in a row when he thought he had a shot, but with the Oilers a little deeper and a little smarter than they’ve been in the past, he’s going to Bakersfield.\n“He just needs to mature and season,” said head coach Todd McLellan, adding there are simply too many in defenceman in town right now to find a roster spot for him.\n“Sometimes you play really well but the environment and the numbers we have here … sometimes we have to do housecleaning, too, and figur\nAbout the author Robert Tychkowski Other Stories Edmonton Oilers' Eberle 'frustrated' by shoulder injury\nWhat started out as a beautiful sunny day in Edmonton dropped to Minus 14 in an instant Wednesday when the Oilers learned they’ll be without Jordan Eberle to start the season.\n0\nOilers forward Anton Lander scores hat-trick in win over Arizona\nIn less than one year, Anton Lander has gone from a disposable piece on a loser to an increasingly important part of a franchise on the rise.\n0\nSee more from Robert Tychkowski »\nTop ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-01T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:04:20.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
