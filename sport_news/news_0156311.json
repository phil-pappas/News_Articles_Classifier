(but) for the most part, you know his style and how he sees the game and how he sees good plays.\" \nSome things to know about the 2015-16 Carolina Hurricanes: \nNO SEMIN: The biggest move of the offseason was buying out the final three years of enigmatic forward Alexander Semin's contract. Semin quickly fell out of Peters' favor last year, finishing with a career-worst six goals with 13 assists while occasionally being a healthy scratch. He has since signed with Montreal. \nGOALIE BATTLE: The Hurricanes have swapped out goalies, trading Anton Khudobin to Anaheim and acquiring Eddie Lack from Vancouver. The 27-year-old Lack and Ward, 31, have spent preseason camp competing for the starting job, and Lack signed a two-year contract extension over the weekend. \nYOUNG D-MEN: Four of the top six defensemen could be 23 years old or younger. In addition to Hanifin, 22-year-old Ryan Murphy was a first-rounder in 2011 and All-Star Justin Faulk — a second-rounder in 2010 — has emerged as a leader of that group at age 23. \nNO CONTRACT TALK: Both Staal and Ward insist their uncertain status for next year will affect them this season. Staal will make $9.5 million in the last year of a seven-year deal he signed in September 2008. Ward signed a six-year deal a year later and will make $6.8 million this season. Said Staal: \"I feel like I have a lot of great hockey left, a lot of good years left and I want to help this team get back to the playoffs.\" \nMOVING ON FROM 2014-15: The Hurricanes' 30 wins last season marked their fewest in a full season since the 2003-04 team had 28. They lost 40 games in regulation for the first time since 2002-03. \nFollow Joedy McCreary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joedyap \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:59:04.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
