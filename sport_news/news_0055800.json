Dickey was standing the clubhouse talking to reporters, taking his medicine like a man after a disastrous start in Game 4 of the ALCS. \nHe drawled on about what went wrong in his second start of the post-season — an outing that lasted all of 1.2 innings as he gave up four hits and five runs, four earned, two walks and two home runs in picking up the loss in a 14-2 Toronto loss to the Kansas City Royals. \nBut it was after someone asked him how anxious he would be to get another chance to pitch in these playoffs when the Blue Jays knuckleballer really perked up. \n“Oh, I’m begging,” he said. “I hope I get a chance. I hope I get another chance. I’ll be available to do whatever we need done, if that means being in the bullpen (Wednesday), if that means being in the bullpen in Kansas City, of course I’ll be ready to do that.” \nHow long would it take him to recover from Tuesday’s game, he was asked. \n”After an outing like that? Probably about 12 hours,” he said. “I’ll be ready (Wednesday) to pitch. I don’t know how many pitches I threw, but it couldn’t have been more than 60 (it was 48) and that’s a layup for me.” \nOf course what Dickey — who collected more innings this season than any other Toronto pitcher — would really like is a chance to start again, which would only happen, of course, if the Jays won the next three against the Royals and qualified for the World Series. \nDickey has been in the Major Leagues since 2001, but only this year did he finally taste some post-season action and he desperately wants a chance to redeem himself after Tuesday’s outing. He pitched well enough in Game 4 of the ALDS against the Texas Rangers, but was removed with two out in the fifth, holding on to a 7-1 lead and didn’t get a chance to pick up a win. So, yeah, the Nashville native is champing at the bit to pitch again and try to help the Jays move forward in the post-season. \n“If I start again, that means we’re in the World Series,” he said. “(So) we’re willing to do what it takes to get to that next stage of that process here. I’m sure David (Price) ... we’ll all be available. It’s do or die, just like it was in Texas, so we’ve had some practice in being in elimination games.” \nIn one of the oddities of Major League playoff baseball, knuckleball pitchers have never had great success. The most success any knuckleball specialist has enjoyed in the post-season is former Boston Red Sox standout Tim Wakefield, who appeared in 18 games and recorded a 5-7 record with a 6.75 ERA. \nOther than Wakefield, no knuckballer — not Phil nor Joe Niekro, not Tom Candiotti, not Charle Hough — has ever picked up a win in a playoff game — despite their success in the regular season. And now Dickey is danger of joining that list. \nThe most frustrating part of Tuesday’s outing for Dickey is the fact that he felt great going into Game 4 and there were no indications that he was going to have his shortest outing of the year (His previous shortest outing this season was four innings). Of his 33 starts this year, he lasted six innings or more in 25. \n“I felt great,” he said. “Talk to (pitching coach) Pete (Walker). I had a great knuckleball. (Catcher) Russell (Martin) was having trouble handling them, it was so good in the bullpen. And when I got in there, I was throwing some great knuckleballs. (Eric) Hosmer hit a line drive up the middle that was great and a lead-off bunt (by Alcides Escobar) kind of took us by surprise after a swing over. And then the two home runs. \n“But at this stage of this game it can happen very quickly. And a team like that is really good at hitting, putting the ball in play and spoiling pitcher counts, which is what they do well. You get 0-2 on them and then foul off a really good one and then they foul off another really good one, you make a mistake and they get it. They have a knack for doing that. They had the best record in the American League, it’s not a fluke.” \n“I had a hard time catching it, so it was down,” Martin confirmed when asked about Dickey’s knuckleball before and during the game. “But the thing with the knuckleball, you throw one that doesn’t do enough and it can be a home run. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary, they just put some good swings on it.” \n“This is my 103rd start for the Blue Jays, it was the first time I’ve gone that short, so it was the anomaly for sure but it was a poor time to have the anomaly,” Dickey said. \nWHO’S STEALING SIGNS NOW? \nStanding in front of the Blue Jays’ dugout prior to Game 4 of the ALCS on Tuesday, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons rolled his eyes when asked about the latest sign-stealing controversy at the Rogers Centre. \n“Come on,” Gibbons told the Toronto Sun, shaking his head. “Really?” \nGibbons echoed what Royals manager Ned Yost said on Monday about the performance of Kansas City starter Johnny Cueto — that the main reason the Jays laid 11 runs on Kansas City was that Cueto didn’t pitch very well, not because anyone was stealing signs. \nThe Jays have been accused of stealing signs for years and, on Tuesday, Royals pitcher Edinson Volquez told Jordan Bastian of MLB.com that Cueto suspects Toronto were stealing signs again. \n“He said ... they got a guy in centrefield,” Volquez said. “You see how hard it is, he look to centrefield and he see somebody do this or do that, it’s really hard to do that. I don’t know, he said that. But when the guy gets on second base, he said something about that, too, they were giving signs to the hitter. But I don’t know.” \nGibbons suggested that perhaps the Royals were stealing signs in the seventh inning in Game 2 in K.C. Through six innings, Toronto starter David Price kept the Royals at bay, but then the home side erupted for five runs in the seventh. \nGibbons, who denied that his team steals signs, basically said that if the Royals stole signs in the seventh inning in Game 2, then shame on the Jays for letting them do that. \nGibbons naturally wasn’t thrilled when reporters asked him about the so-called sign stealing controversy after Toronto’s 14-2 loss. \n“We’ve heard that before,” he said. “Really, we’ve got a good-hitting team. They don’t need that. That’s kind of going around the league. \n“Really, any team you come up against, there’s questions whether guys are tipping signs,” he continued. “That’s been in the game forever. I don’t think it’s just exclusive to one ball club. Anytime you score a lot of runs they look for that. But we have some really good hitters.” \nR.A. Dickey got rocked for five runs in 1.2 innings on Tuesday, but he didn’t offer up an excuses about having signs stolen after the game. He said he just got rocked. Period.
