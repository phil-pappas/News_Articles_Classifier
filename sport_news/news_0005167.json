Loe displayed some of the best footwork of any of the defensive backs at the camp and was voted as one of the top performers.Season Report: The Pitt commit has not seen much action from his cornerback position due to teams not wanting to take a chance at going at him. Loe has been very effective for Johnstown as a wide receiver, catching 31 passes for 649 yards (20.9 yards per catch) and seven touchdowns through the first six weeks of the season. Last week, he caught a season high eight passes for 222 yards and one touchdown against Richland. If he doesn't get you defensively, Loe will definitely get you offensively.
