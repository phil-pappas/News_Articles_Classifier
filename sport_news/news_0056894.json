A lot of people will only see them play this one time per year, so they need to leave the best impression they can. It’s something we embrace and we get excited about.”The Wildcats (4-0, 2-0 2A-4 Conference) have not lost a conference game since 2012 — a 41-19 rout by the Mountainburg Dragons. Taylor said protecting the streak gets more difficult every week.“Teams will come out and play with nothing to lose against us,” he said. “They will play with everything they’ve got, so we can never lose focus. We’ve been able to do that so far. Hackett came out with nothing to lose. I’m sure Magazine will, too.”Magazine (0-4, 2-0) has only scored 36 games in four games — 30 of which came in a 34-30 loss to Union Christian.Meanwhile, Hector has put up lopsided scoreboards since Week 1, the closest game a 22-16 victory over the Hackett Hornets.Taylor said he would like to take the credit for the Wildcats’ success, but he can’t.“We’ve had a lot of great players,” he said. “I mean, I think that’s what it really comes down to. I would love to say coaching has a lot to do with it, but at most our coaching staff has been able to keep talented kids focused over the past three years.”Hector quarterback Tanner Gaines has thrown for 714 yards in four games, 10 touchdowns and only one interception. Gaines has rushed for an additional 258 yards and six touchdowns.“Gaines gives us great options under center,” Taylor said. “Jacob Billingsley has also really stepped up for us. We are really proud of him.”Billingsley has rushed for 342 yards on 60 carries and four touchdowns so far.Colton Garrison leads the Wildcats in tackles with 17. Taylor said he has been a key cog on the defensive side of the ball.“I feel like up front we are better than they are on the offensive and defensive line,” Taylor said. “I feel like that’s going to be a huge advantage for us.”Homecoming festivities begin at 6:35 p.m. at Linton Field.
