Williams, who had 38 sacks in his three seasons in Buffalo prior to Ryan's arrival, wants to be more aggressive. He has just two sacks this season. \nWhile he denied being unhappy with his role in the defense, Williams mentioned the \"plays that are called\" more than a dozen times in a four-minute session with the media. \n\"I think I probably set a record on dropping today, but that's part of the scheme for us to go out and be put in a position to win,\" Williams said. \"Whatever's called you have to go out and do it.\" \n» Observations | Recap \nAt times Sunday when the Bills were sending only three players after the quarterback. Dalton was not sacked and was hit only once. That hit came on a safety blitz from Duke Williams. \nIt was the third time in the last 49 games the Bills didn't record a sack. A year ago, the Bills led the league with 54 sacks. This season, they have just nine sacks in six games. \n\"When we got four guys rushing, we can do some things,\" Williams said. \"Some of the calls we had today, we just didn't have four guys out there rushing in certain situations, things like that. You just play the call. \n\"We don't make the calls as players. We've got to go out and execute whatever's called by any means. If it's three guys going, then it's three guys going, and we have to figure out a different way to get there faster on our part.\" \nTo make matters worse for Buffalo, veteran defensive tackle Kyle Williams was carted off with a knee injury. Ryan admitted he's going to have to take a long look at what the scheme is calling for his defensive linemen to do. He blamed himself for the lack of pressure on Dalton. \nWhen told about those comments, defensive end Jerry Hughes said, \"I'll let the coach coach and we'll play. So whatever he calls, we'll run it.\" \nWhen asked whether he is unhappy with the scheme, Williams didn't want to outright say he was upset. \n\"No, I'm not gonna say that,\" Williams said. \"It's just, if that's what we as a team believe will win games, then I'm all for it.\" \nThroughout the season, Hughes and defensive tackles Kyle Williams and Marcell Dareus have expressed some level of concern over what they're being asked to do in this scheme. \n\"The three guys you said, including myself, a lot is put on our shoulders as far as the amount given out to players on this team as far as income,\" Mario Williams said. \"I would assume, those four guys, a lot is on their shoulders to go after the quarterback or stop the run, be disruptive. Like I say, if the call is three-man this or that, dropping, things like that, that's the call, so ... \n\"I'm used to knowing what my guy's doing beside me in a passing situation, being able to cause havoc in different angles as far as getting after the quarterback or setting up the tackle or tight end, whoever is blocking you. Like I said, whatever's called is called and we have to play it and find a way to accommodate that call.\" \nThe question now becomes at what point do the Bills start worry about those calls Williams continually reference. They are on pace for 30 fewer sacks than they had a year ago and have allowed 98 points in their last three home games.
