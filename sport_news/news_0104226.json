The Liberators have knocked off the Wolves every year since the conference was created, but Haddock belives they could have the perfect mix to pull it off this season. Sampson: How do you think this conversation about you playing quarterback qould go if I were to talk to you Week 1? Haddock: It changes a lot. I played junior varsity quarterback, but getting varsity experience is completely different. Week 1, you're nervous and don't have the feel for it. By Week 9, you know your pre-snap reads so it's a lot easier. Sampson: Is the triple option better suited for you? You've proven that you can sling the ball down the field. Haddock: It gives me a chance to pass and run the ball. I get it more, so of course I'm going to like it. (laughs) You also never know who is going to get the ball. I like the unpredictability, but when coach calls a pass play it's always exciting. Sampson: This is the same spot you were last year leading up to this game. Do you think you've been a low-key 8-0 team? Haddock: We expected to be 8-0 but we knew we'd have to fight to get here. We lost a lot of good athletes, a couple all-state players, but we were the underdogs and we've come out and earned it. Sampson: I hate to bring this up, but Reeds Spring hasn't beaten Bolivar since the COC-Small was created. In a 10-year stretch leading up to last season, the Wolves were outscore 519-73. But that doesn't matter to the current group, does it? Haddock: No, we don't focus on that stuff. If we come in, do us, play our game, I think we're capable of beating any opponent. Sampson: It was 33-28 last year, so does that give you the sense that you're right on the cusp of knocking them off? Haddock: Last year showed that we are capable of beating them. Last year, we came out on our heels, they rattled off a bunch of touchdowns in the first half and hit us before we knew what happened. This year, we're not going to let that happen. We're going to come out ready to play. Sampson: I love talking to hungry teams. What is the emotion like knowing this is Bolivar week? Haddock: It's the game we look forward to all year. It's the one week all season that we are the underdog. We have to come out and play with that passion and fire to get the win. Sampson: What looks different about this year's matchup with them? Haddock: We know what to expect. We've played their athletes and we've installed coverages to stop them. Sampson: Your counterpart on Bolivar, Connor Sechler, was the first guy I sat down with this season. You being a defender as well, what challenges does he provide? Haddock: He's a great quarterback. He's going to make good throws so we have to be in coverage and not let him have anything. Sampson: Give me the pulse of the town: what it would mean for this to finally be the year to knock them off? Haddock: It'd be phenominal. The whole town loves watching football, so if Reeds Spring would bring the title back this year, it'd be a big thing.
