And when we don't, I think there's some frustration that sets in and it kind of gets us off what our normal pace is. I think that's really what it was.\" \nCU (10-8, 2-4) held a slim lead through much of the first set but received an unfortunate break late on an official's decision. The Buffs had seemingly taken a 19-15 lead when a UCLA spike failed to clear the net. However, the official on the opposite side of the play ruled that CU senior Nicole Edelman had grazed the ball at the net, turning that 19-15 edge back into a far more precarious 18-16 lead. Advertisement \nFrom there, the Buffs failed to push the Bruins to a set-point opportunity, with UCLA eventually claiming a 26-24 decision. CU never regained the momentum, falling behind 9-1 in the second set as the Bruins cruised to a 22-15 win and leading only at 2-1 in the third set before UCLA steadily pulled away. \n\"The spark that we had on Friday night wasn't really there,\" CU junior Cierra Simpson said. \"There were traces of it in the first set, but it felt like we fell flat after the first set. Just maybe we got a little discouraged a little bit after losing. We've got to learn from that and correct it for next weekend.\" \nAlexis Austin finished with a team-leading 12 kills for the Buffs while Simpson added 16 digs. UCLA's Jordan Anderson proved tough to stop throughout the match for CU, finishing with a game-high 20 kills. The Bruins' Claire Felix, a Colorado Springs native and a former club teammate of Simpson, recorded six kills and three blocks. \nOne week after posting a much-needed comeback win on the road against then-No. 22 Oregon, the Buffs will be desperate for positive results during another demanding home set next weekend against Cal on Friday and No. 7 Stanford on Sunday. \n\"It's a tough loss, but quite honestly I have more confidence in my players than ever,\" Kritza said. \"They have it in themselves. We will be absolutely fine. We have to re-tool a few things, we've got to let some people recover and stave off some injuries ... and then we make sure that we regroup and we have two more tough teams coming in here. Our focus has to be making sure we take care of business and protect our home floor better than we did this weekend.\" \nPat Rooney: rooneyp@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/prooney07 \nUCLA 3, CU 0 UCLA (13-3, 4-2) 26 25 25 CU (10-8, 2-4) 24 15 19 \nKills — UCLA : Anderson 20, Buechler 11, Lawless 8; CU : Austin 12, G.
