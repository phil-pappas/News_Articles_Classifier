I hope this would be a new start and new chapter in his career,\" said Saied, a former controversial player who is also Goldi's recently-appointed coach.\nSaied, a versatile defender, was one of Egypt's most promising footballers in the early 2000s but he eventually failed to live up to his potential due to numerous off-field disciplinary problems.\nHe played for Egypt's so-called big three - Ahly, Zamalek and Ismaily. He also had a brief stint with English Premier League side Everton but failed to play a single match with the first team.\nEl-Merghany is best known for his spell as one of the regular midfielders of Cairo club Zamalek from 2008 to 2013.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:53:33.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
