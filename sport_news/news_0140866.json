He was asked Monday during his weekly news conference advancing the Wolverines' game at Minnesota on Saturday if Peppers will get more snaps on offense going forward.\n\"Yes, possibly,\" Harbaugh said. \"As always, you would like your opponent to understand all the possibilities and let them think about that. But very much a possibility.\"\nTailback Drake Johnson, who missed the Michigan State game and played sparingly against Northwestern with an undisclosed injury, is healthy and expected to play at Minnesota.\n\"Do expect him to be ready to go,\" Harbaugh said.\nDETROIT NEWS\nUM's Lewis a semifinalist for Thorpe Award\nFreshman receiver Brian Cole, however, is still not healthy enough to return, he said.\nHarbaugh took a question regarding linebacker Joe Bolden and the targeting call that ejected him from the MSU game, and the answer evolved into how the team would move forward from the loss to Michigan State.\n\"Just as a point of reference, not into the 'if this, if that' type of scenarios,\" Harbaugh said. \"If worms had machine guns, then birds would be scared of them. We're looking to (define) our season over the next number of games that we play.\"\nHarbaugh was referencing a book titled \"If Worms Had Machine Guns\" published in 2008. It is about a father and three sons, and according to the book synopsis is \"a story of life's lessons passed down from one generation to the next. You take the cards you are dealt and you play your best hand. ... Wise words from a father to a son.\"\nDrake Johnson   (Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:35:07.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
