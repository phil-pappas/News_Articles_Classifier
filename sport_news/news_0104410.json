Catholic senior defensive end Rashan Gary , the top player in the country, turned heads just over a week ago when he made an impromptu visit to Rutgers for the Michigan State game . \nThe Scarlet Knights were the first program to offer Gary as an eighth grader, and up until the past few months, appeared in as good a position as any other team in the country to land his services, as he was most familiar with the school. \nHowever, since the beginning of Summer, teams like LSU, Michigan, Auburn, Ohio State, Clemson, Ole' Miss and USC have consumed a majority of the Gary headlines, with national signing day, less that four months away. MORE RECRUITING: Kareem Walker, the country's top RB, talks Michigan, Ohio State, future official visits and more \nSo what was Gary's reasoning behind his most recent trek to the banks? \n\"(Rutgers director of recruiting) E.J. (Barthel), he was like, 'If you want to come to the game, you can come.' And then, a lot of my teammates were going like Cory (Bolds), Donald (Stewart), Allan (Walters). So I was like, 'Oh yeah, I'll take that trip with y'all.'\" said Gary. \nThe 6-4, 295-pounder walked NJ.com through his latest Rutgers experience, which ended at 4 a.m. (ET) in the morning, after an extended stay with a close friend and former teammate. \n\"I think I got there around 6:30,\" he said. \"The coaches were excited to see me. They were like, 'Welcome back.' And it was good to know that Rutgers still had love for me. So I walked into the building. I got a chance to meet with coach (Jim) Panagos before the game and he was saying how he was happy to have me there. And after the game, I was just hanging with Najee (Clayton) all night.\" \nOf the members of the Rutgers staff, Gary bonded most with Barthel and wide receivers coach Anthony Campanile, who he has a high comfort level with. \nAnd there were fatheads of Gary in the High Point Solutions Stadium crowd throughout the Spartans contest, which he acknowledged as nice to see. \nBut Gary revealed LSU, Michigan, Auburn, USC and Clemson are a few of the teams positioned best heading down the stretch of his recruitment , while Alabama, Ohio State and Ole' Miss, also have a shot. \nHowever, Gary says he'll always have \"love\" for Rutgers and multiple members of the staff and maintain the relationship, keeping the option open. \n\"Of course, you are seeing a good game between Michigan State and Rutgers, and just how they competed was great,\" said Gary. \"The in-state school is always gonna get love. They were the first team that offered me.\" \nTodderick Hunt may be reached at thunt@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @TodderickHunt .
