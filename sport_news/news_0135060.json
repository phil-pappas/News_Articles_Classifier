We are a football club. That is why we never even considered selling Thomas Müller,\" Rummenigge said recently as quoted as saying by ESPN . \"I told my colleagues at Manchester United: 'I cannot close down my email account, but you no longer need to send me anything. It is useless.' He's under contract for another four years. He'll stay – no matter what is offered. There is no price I would even start considering it.\" \nUnited eventually turned their attention to Anthony Martial on deadline day, due to the Bundesliga giant's refusal to negotiate his departure. But Müller has now reopened the speculations over a future move to the Premier League after admitting it would be 'hypocrisy' to say that the wages paid in England do not tempt him. \n\"In the end, we should not forget that playing football is our job,\" he said during an interview with Die Welt . \"So people should accept that wages will always play a role in a player's decision-making. Of course, the wages that are being paid in the Premier League are very tempting. It would be hypocrisy to deny that. \n\"You have to look at the complete package to determine whether something is right for you. What's good for you one day will not necessarily still be good for you the day after. \n\"I know that a lot of German clubs are unhappy with the Premier League clubs' spending, but I think it is something good for all clubs in the end. It can only be a good thing for football when clubs invest so much money.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:15:47.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
