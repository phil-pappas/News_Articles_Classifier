Wiggins is set to be arraigned Dec. 1.\nAccording to an arrest affidavit, Wiggins was the driver of a Pontiac Firebird that crashed near mile marker 31 of Boulder Canyon Drive on Aug. 4 after he failed to negotiate a left-hand curve and wrapped the car around a tree.\nA female passenger — Alexus Valentin, 21, of Boulder — was pronounced dead at the scene after she was ejected from the car and into a creek, and four other people, including Wiggins, were hospitalized.\nAdvertisement Following Wednesday's hearing, Boulder County Coroner Emma Hall ruled Valentin's death accidental, concluding she died from drowning with \"other significant conditions of multiple blunt-force injuries.\"\nBoulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said his office will continue to press the murder charge, despite the fact that Valentin's death has now been ruled accidental.\n\"They're issuing a report,\" Garnett said of the coroner's findings. \"We're making a legal determination of whether charges are appropriate based on the evidence.\"\nDA: Driver displayed 'extreme recklessness'\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Boulder police Detective Kristin Weisenbach said Ashlund Ellis, Wiggins' girlfriend at the time and a passenger in the car, told police that she talked to Wiggins on Aug. 17 at the hospital.\nWhen Wiggins found out that Valentin had not survived the crash, he said \"good,\" Weisenbach testified, and added that Valentin \"needed to be eliminated\" and to \"be shut up.\"\nWeisenbach also testified that Ellis told police that when Wiggins found out that the front-seat passenger, Ryan Hohlt, of Boulder, survived, he sounded surprised, and said Hohlt \"needed to be dead.\"\nWeisenbach said Wiggins previously had told Ellis that he did not like Hohlt \"flirting\" with her.\nWeisenbach testified that Wiggins also told Ellis not to talk to anyone about what he had said, or he would kill her and her family.\nEarlier in the hearing, Colorado State Patrol investigators testified that evidence and witness testimony suggested Wiggins was driving at 80 mph to 90 mph around the curve, which has a posted speed limit of 40 mph.\nA woman driving up the canyon told troopers that the driver must have either been drunk or had \"a (expletive) death wish,\" and said she slowed down because she did not want to be anywhere near the car.\nBoulder Deputy District Attorney Tim Johnson said Wiggins displayed \"extreme recklessness\" while driving, which \"ultimately ended the life of Ms. Valentin.\"\n'Something terrible was going to happen'\nBut Amanda Bailache, Wiggins' attorney, said that the murder charge was not warranted, as there was no evidence of intent.\n\"The prosecutors have overcharged this case,\" she said. \"Was his driving reckless? Yes. Was it to the point he was showing a willingness to take another human being's life? I would argue to the court, no.\"\nBailache also argued that, at the time of the hearing, there was no conclusive evidence to prove the crash killed Valentin saying witnesses told police that Valentin was \"passed out\" prior to the crash.\n\"We don't know if she was passed out from drug or alcohol use, we don't know if she suffered from a stroke or a heart attack prior to being ejected from the vehicle,\" Bailache said. \"We don't dispute the fact that Ms. Valentin was dead, but we don't know what the cause of that death was.\"\nThe coroner's finding that Valentin died after being thrown from the car was released several hours after Wednesday's hearing.\nBakke said that, based on the Wiggins' high rate of speed, the statements Wiggins reportedly made to Ellis, and the testimony of the eyewitness in the canyon, there was probable cause for the charges.\n\"Those three things taken together clearly afford the court the ability to find that probable cause has been established,\" Bakke said, adding that the statements of the eyewitness were particularly convincing.\n\"Clearly she could foresee that something terrible was going to happen, and something did happen,\" Bakke said.\nWiggins remains in custody on $250,000 bond.\nMitchell Byars: 303-473-1329, byarsm@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/mitchellbyars", "external_links": ["http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_28584614/rollover-crash-closes-boulder-canyon?source=pkg", "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_28710201/driver-fatal-boulder-canyon-rollover-charged-first-degree?source=pkg", "http://twitter.com/mitchellbyars"], "published": "2015-10-21T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:05:57.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
