In addition to playing together at BU from 1967 to 1970, both went on to coach high school football teams in Winnipeg, one of Sitter’s former players is a neighbour and friend of Kunyckyj’s and on Saturday they were both inducted into the Brandon University Bobcats Wall of Fame as part of the 2015 class. \nThe 1969-70 football team, which both played on, also entered the Wall. Fifteen members of the squad, including the duo, and two others representing late members came to the brunch banquet for the celebration. \nIt made for quite the weekend for both Sitter and Kunyckyj. \n“The big bonus was having the team here because I was able to reconnect with a lot of guys I haven’t seen in up to 45 years, so that was really special,” said Kunyckyj, who set school records for most completions in a game (10) and season (59) as well as passing yards in a game (236) and season (939). “You lose touch, but we immediately reconnected, which was a nice thing. It brings back the whole business of you go to war together on a football field and nothing has changed.” \nKunyckyj, who was selected in the sixth round by the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the 1970 Canadian Football League draft, is still involved in the game as an announcer for high school football contests in Winnipeg. \nSitter, an eighth-round pick of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 1970 CFL draft, is forever grateful to Brandon University. It dropped a second language requirement when it became a university, which allowed him to get his education. He learned lessons at BU and with the Bobcats football team, which was coached by Doug Steeves, that he never forgot as he went on to teach and coach at St. Paul’s High School in Winnipeg. He also served as vice-principal and athletic director there. \n“Because it is a team, you play with people you may not necessarily like or agree with, but you respect them. That respect has to be applied no matter what walk of life you go into,” he said. \n“And giving a second chance to those who fouled up the first time. That’s an important consideration to give to anyone. Really, it’s a respect of other people that you appreciate and to be focused. You have to be focused. I’ve kept those attributes all my professional career and still do today.” \nThe 2015 induction class also included Tracy Johnson (nee MacLeod), a basketball player who broke her leg in a game and had it amputated. The Bobcats’ and CIS women’s basketball inspiration awards are named after her. \nAshley Creighton and Joel Small became the first volleyball players to join the Wall, while Murray Zuk went in for his community involvement. Former Brandon Sun sports writers Jack Gibson and Brian Marshall were also enshrined. \nEvery person in the 2015 class spoke of how special the induction was and Kunyckyj loved every moment of BU’s homecoming weekend. \n“Awesome. Very enjoyable,” he said. “I can’t count the number of lies I’ve heard, but I’ve told a few myself. It’s been very good.” \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:00:38.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
