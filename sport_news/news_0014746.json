On Thursday, her dream was realized. Rainey passed the ball into the circle 10 minutes into the game with Norwich Free Academy. The ball reached a teammate’s stick and was shot at NFA keeper Helen Heyse. Heyse made the kick save, but it came back toward Rainey’s stick. “I swung, but I had to dive at the same time, and as I landed on my back, the ball hit the back of the goal. I just kind of rolled over, put my arms out and laid there for a little while,” Rainey said. A moment to savor for sure, but just one of the few that Rainey has experienced recently. The goal helped Killingly to a 3-1 win over NFA. It was Rainey’s only goal of the afternoon, but it was her 27th of the season. That’s two goals shy of the single-season scoring record held by Gina Allen, who graduated in 1981. The previous Thursday against Windham, Rainey passed another of Allen’s all-time marks. She scored her 47th career goal (she now has 51), breaking Allen’s mark of 46. Killingly assistant coach Erika Malito told Rainey she could break the record against the Whippets at about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday before the game. The morning announcements the next day did the rest. “I felt like I was in a dream, I couldn’t play, I couldn’t do anything,” Rainey said with a laugh. “I felt like I was focusing too much on it and so many people were here because of the announcements. All of the (Killingly) administration was here rooting me on. There was so much pressure. I felt like I had to score two goals because all these people are relying on you. It gets inside your head.” There was no such issue resting on the outcome of the game with NFA, but there was pressure. Killingly (10-1-2, 9-0-2 ECC) needed the win to keep its hopes alive to play Stonington for the ECC championship at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday. The Wildcats (4-5-2, 4-5-2) scored first. Joyce Yuen found the ball in a scrum in front of the Redgals’ net and poked it past Katelyn Bennett just a minute and a half into the game. “They were here to play and weren’t afraid of any team,” Killingly coach Souki Syharat said of NFA. “I wasn’t surprised, but when we came in, we were a little flat for the first five minutes. That goal woke us up a bit.” Page 2 of 2 - Rainey tied the contest with her goal just eight minutes later. The Redgals put in what proved to be the game-winner with 7:02 left in the first half on a goal by Alexis Smith off an assist by Madison Weaver. But NFA almost countered early in the second half when Hailey Conley’s shot was knocked away at the last moment by Killingly defender Bernice Boateng. “I think that (goal) would have been great for our morale,” NFA coach Ellen Cavanaugh said. It was the only real opportunity of the second half for the Wildcats, who sometimes could only watch helplessly as Rainey navigated her way through their defense. “She’s absolutely fantastic, the ball is glued to her stick,” Cavanaugh said. “To be able to dribble the ball and maneuver it like that on a (natural grass) surface like this is not easy. You know you have a very skilled player when she is able to do that, take it 50 yards, weaving in and out of defenders.” Rainey’s stickwork eventually paid dividends as she assisted on the insurance goal, passing to Teagan Waggoner with 5:05 left to play. Not bad for a player who began her field hockey career as a goalie and has just about trained herself to handle the ball. “It’s just kind of instinct,” Rainey said. “I just go through all these people and I don’t even realize it. I get lost in the game. I just kind of know where to go.” “I haven’t seen anyone in the ECC, ever, with her (stick) abilities,” Syharat said. “She’s a phenom to me. A lot of (college) coaches have been looking at her. Her game IQ is another story. She watches videos and college games and has really picked up the game quickly.” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 10:28 PM Updated at 10:35 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:29:34.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
