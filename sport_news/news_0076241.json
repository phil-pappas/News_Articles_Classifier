The 29-year-old is wanted for a federal fugitive warrant. \nThat's when LaDeaux allegedly took chase, weaving police through the south west part of the city. At one point, the car slowed down and a 19-year-old got out, but police say LaDeaux refused to stop. \nOn Highway 385, the car traveled two miles with spiked tires before LaDeaux was captured. Police say he was wearing a law-enforcement style bullet-proof vest. Police say they didn't find a gun on LaDeaux but think he may have hid it before the arrest. \nHe faces eluding and drug charges in addition to two warrants. \n\nBulletproof vest found on suspect Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
