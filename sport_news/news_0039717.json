That fan support came after an earlier dispute between the team and Harvey's doctor and agent about a work limit in his comeback from Tommy John surgery this year.\n\"After everything that has happened, the biggest thing was staying focused on what I had to do tonight,\" Harvey said. \"Regardless of what has happened, my job was to give us quality innings, keep the damage down and get us started off right. I wanted to go out there. I wanted this game bad.\"\nHarvey started the game with four perfect innings, not allowing a baserunner until he hit Anthony Rizzo in the arm with a pitch. Starlin Castro's double over the head of center fielder Juan Lagares provided the Cubs' first run, but Harvey received some help from left fielder Yoenis Cespedes, who threw out Castro at home for the second out of the inning.\nCubs manager Joe Maddon called Harvey's command \"outrageous\" from the start.\n\"The biggest thing was right off the bat, (pitching coach Dan Warthen) said, 'Find your secondary stuff and kind of work off of that,'\" Harvey said. \"Luckily I was able to throw for a strike when I needed to and kind of keep them off balance. They hit a couple of balls hard, but luckily they were right at guys.\"\nHarvey was hit by a Dexter Fowler comebacker in the sixth inning, which Harvey said \"dented\" his triceps. He said it was a little swollen after the game but didn't hamper his pitching.\nCubs' Dexter Fowler on tough luck vs. Matt Harvey Cubs' Dexter Fowler on tough luck vs. Matt Harvey.\nCubs' Dexter Fowler on tough luck vs. Matt Harvey.\nSee more videos One of Harvey's biggest moments came in the seventh inning after he walked Rizzo and gave up a one-out single to Jorge Soler. He struck out Javier Baez and pinch hitter Tommy La Stella to strand the runners and preserve the Mets' lead.\nHarvey's ending didn't quite do the outing justice. Kyle Schwarber's solo shot into center field sent him to the dugout, but it was to chants of \"Harvey! Harvey!\" from the crowd of 44,287.\nMets manager Terry Collins said Friday that the innings issue — in which Harvey was given a limit of 180 innings by his doctor and agent — was hard on the pitcher. But at 202 innings, Harvey continues to pitch, just as he wants to do.\n\"I talk to this guy every day,\" Collins said. \"I know exactly what he's made of. I know exactly what he's about, and he wants the baseball. He wants it. He wants to be out there.\"\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Baseball Chicago Cubs", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56233745/turbine/ct-cubs-fowler-video-spt-20151017", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56233634/turbine/ct-matt-harvey-live-cubs-sider-spt-1018-20151017"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:25:38.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
