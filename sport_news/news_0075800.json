(Albert Gea/Reuters) \nWorld soccer’s governing body released its 23-man short list for the FIFA Ballon d’Or award on Tuesday, and six of the players come from a single team. Barcelona’s striking trio of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez all were obvious choices, and defender Javier Mascherano and midfielders Andres Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic joined them on the list. Messi is a four time winner of the Ballon d’Or — given annually to the world’s best player — and is the front runner of those six. He will once again likely go head-to-head with his Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo, who has been named best player three times, including last year. Barça candidates for Ballon d'Or https://t.co/6aeEpvMpdE RT to support them! #ballondor pic.twitter.com/JCyO2roffM \n— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) October 20, 2015 \nAlong with Ronaldo, four other Real players found their way onto the short list, including fellow strikers Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez, as well as World Cup-winning midfielder Toni Kroos. \nBayern Munich also boasts five players on the list in Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Müller, Arjen Robben, Arturo Vidal and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. \nOther players on the list include Sergio Agüero (Manchester City), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Eden Hazard (Chelsea), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Paris Saint-Germain), Paul Pogba (Juventus), Alexis Sánchez (Arsenal) and Yaya Touré (Manchester City), the only player who isn’t from Europe or South America on the list. Toure is from the Ivory Coast. \nFIFA will announce the winner in Zurich on Jan. 11. \nThe organization will also hand out awards for best coach and best women’s player and coach. \nBarcelona’s Luis Enrique is considered the front runner for best men’s coach, having won the coveted treble last season by taking home trophies in La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the competitive Champions League tournaments. He’ll be up against Juventus’s Massimiliano Allegri, Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti, Paris Saint-Germain’s Laurent Blanc, Sevilla’s Unai Emery, Bayern Munich’s Pep Guardiola, Chelsea’s José Mourinho, Atletico Madrid’s Diego Simeone, Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger and the Chilean national team’s Jorge Sampaoli. \nFIFA’s list of 10 female players for the women’s award includes three Americans, all standouts in this summer’s World Cup. They are Carli Lloyd, who had a memorable hat trick to lead Team USA to victory over Japan; Megan Rapinoe, who was involved in several clutch plays; and Hope Solo, who was named the best goalkeeper in the tournament. They’re joined on the list by Germans Nadine Angerer and Celia Sasic, French players Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, Ramona Bachmann of Switzerland, Kadeisha Buchanan of Canada and Aya Miyama of Japan. \nFIFA also gave Team USA Coach Jill Ellis a nod for women’s coach of the year. She’s joined by nine others: Calle Barrling (Sweden/Swedish U-19 national team), Colin Bell (England/1. FFC Frankfurt), Farid Benstiti (France/Paris Saint-Germain), Laura Harvey (England/Seattle Reign), John Herdman (England/Canadian national team), Gerard Precheur (France/Olympique Lyonnais), Mark Sampson (Wales/English national team), Norio Sasaki (Japan/Japanese national team) and Thomas Worle (Germany/FC Bayern Munich).
