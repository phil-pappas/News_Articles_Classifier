As Ian [Ritchie] said I have just been in front of the management team in the hotel and said 'we've got a game to play on Saturday',\" he said. \n\"It is not the time to make a decision like that. Like I said, I need to get the team ready for the game with Uruguay on Saturday and that's my priority.\" \nLancaster also denied that he had come under pressure from members of his own management team to play prop Sam Burgess and drop fly-half George Ford. \n\"No, I can put that one to bed. The decisions that we make on selection are collective and are ultimately my responsibility,\" he added. \n\"I think Owen [Farrell] played really well in the first half in this game and George is a great player as well. \n\"There is no division in the coaching team and there's nothing that needs to be looked into in that regard. It is my decision on selection finally.\" \nWhen asked to explain why he felt England had fallen at the first hurdle, Lancaster was reluctant to lay any blame with his side. \n\"We played some good rugby leading up to it. It was always going to be a tough pool. When you saw the draw, you thought there's going to be a good team going out here,\" he said. \n\"I thought it was two good teams playing yesterday. I don't think we've become a bad team, I think we've got a lot of good young players in the team, the foundations are strong. \n\"But clearly we were not ready to win and get out of this pool. I am not going to hide behind anything, credit to Wales and Australia and apologies to everyone else as I am absolutely gutted.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T14:05:16.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
