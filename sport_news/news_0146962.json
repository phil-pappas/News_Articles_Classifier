By TIM BOOTHAP Sports Writer \nSEATTLE (AP) - Kam Chancellor punched the ball free from Detroit wide receiver Calvin Johnson at the 1-yard line when it appeared the Lions were going to take the lead, and the Seattle Seahawks held on for a 13-10 win on Monday night. \nWith Detroit on the verge of capping a 91-yard drive with the go-ahead touchdown with less than 2 minutes remaining, Chancellor came from the side and punched the ball from Johnson's arm as he was being tackled by Earl Thomas. The ball bounded into the end zone and went over the back line for a touchback and Seattle's ball at the 20. \nRussell Wilson was sacked six times and pulled numerous escape acts, but threw a TD pass to Doug Baldwin in the first half and Steven Hauschka hit a pair of field goals from 50-plus yards as Seattle evened its record at 2-2. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
