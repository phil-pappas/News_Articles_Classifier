On the first scoring series, former quarterback Braxton Miller made a diving third-down catch to convert a first down. Though the ball appeared to hit the ground, replayed upheld the catch ruling, a critical play in the game. \nFor some Penn State fans, the play recalled the interception in last year's game that touched the ground but was upheld upon review. Replay officials in that game, however, did not have full access to footage of the play because of technical issues. \nOhio State turned that play into a touchdown but needed no help on its next two series. Barrett and Elliott, who has rushed for 100 yards or more in 12 straight games, gashed the Lions for two quick series. In fact, the Buckeyes scored their three touchdowns on 21 plays. \nPenn State's first-half offense, meanwhile, struggled to generate much outside of Barkley. The freshman had 86 of the team's 148 total first-half yards. \nLate in the half, quarterback Christian Hackenberg limped off the field after being hit on a passing attempt. He played through pain for the the remainder of the half, then returned to lead a surprising touchdown drive. \nPenn State opened the second half with a three-play, 78-yard drive that featured two exceptional after-the-catch efforts by receivers. On the first, Chris Godwin made a great catch in blanketed single coverage, then dragged a defender nearly 15 yards. \nAfter a 14-yard edge gain by Barkley, receiver DaeSean Hamilton scored on a bubble screen that he second-efforted into the end zone. \nThe Lions' defense was sharper in the second half, holding Ohio State to a field goal until late in the fourth quarter. That gave the Lions a chance at a comeback similar to last year's, when they rallied from a 17-point halftime deficit to tie the game before losing in overtime. \nBarkley gave Penn State a golden scoring opportunity with his 56-yard run that took the ball to the Ohio State 21-yard line. Bosa stuffed Barkley on third-and-short, however, and Hackenberg was sacked on fourth down to end the series. \nField position was an issue all night for Penn State. The Lions started nine of their first 10 drives inside their own 25-yard line, and four of those began inside the 10-yard line. \nOhio State punter Cameron Johnston was responsible for much of that, averaging 41.6 yards per attempt. Penn State's punters, meanwhile, averaged 34.2 yards per attempt. \nLate in the game, Ohio State linebacker Cam Williams was called for targeting on a hit against Penn State running back Akeel Lynch, playing for the first time in four weeks. Because of the penalty, Williams will be suspended for the first half of the Buckeyes' game next week against Rutgers. \nPenn State tight end Adam Breneman, who has struggled with injuries in his career, returned to the lineup for the first time in nearly two years. Breneman last played against Wisconsin in the 2013 season finale.Penn State defensive end Carl Nassib played another terrific game, making 3 1/2 tackles for loss, including 11/2 sacks. \nMiller scored for Ohio State in the fourth quarter, giving him a hand in 11 touchdowns in his career against Penn State. Miller threw for five and ran for five playing as Ohio State's quarterback from 2011-13. He has scored in all four games he has played against the Lions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:12:32.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
