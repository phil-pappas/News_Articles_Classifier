But will the offensive game plan steer him in that direction? Indiana v Penn State Justin K.

Aller / Getty Images) \nCircumstances (good weather, Indiana's soft pass defense, Saquon Barkley's injury) led Penn State to lean on Hackenberg arm's, and take more deep shots, last week. Similar circumstances won't be in play Saturday, considering the Buckeyes' pass-rush skills and aggressive cornerback play. \nThat's why Hackenberg needs to be his best, and he has some history of playing well in the spotlight. Hackenberg has led five tying or winning fourth-quarter drives in his career, including one last year against the Buckeyes. In fact, he led two late scoring drives in that game, throwing a 24-yard touchdown pass to Saeed Blacknall with 2 minutes left. \nHackenberg was terrific against Wisconsin as a freshman and played perhaps his best career game against Boston College in the Pinstripe Bowl. He can handle pressure, which the Horseshoe certainly provides. \nHe'll need to, since Penn State's quarterback play against Ohio State has been a problem for years. Since 2002, Ohio State has returned eight interceptions for touchdowns against the Lions. Matt McGloin had two in 2010. Hackenberg has avoided the \"pick-six,\" however, for the past two seasons. \nBeyond continuing that streak, Hackenberg has to be sharp at the Horseshoe. That means being acutely accurate, converting third downs, extending drives to protect his defense and exploiting deep chances when they're open. It's a handful, but Hackenberg does seem to favor these moments. \nKEYS TO VICTORY \nPENN STATE NITTANY LIONS \n1. Left tackle. Paris Palmer has improved since the Temple game, but can he handle the Buckeyes' rush? If not, does Penn State shift its line and move Andrew Nelson (who isn't 100 percent) to the left side? J.T. Barrett Quarterback J.T. Barrett has become a red-zone scoring option for Ohio State. Quarterback J.T. Barrett has become a red-zone scoring option for Ohio State. (Jay LaPrete / AP) \n2. Shut down Ezekiel Elliott. Yes, Braxton Miller, J.T. Barrett and Cardale Jones all have game-changing skills. But Elliott, the running back, moves OSU's offense more than anyone. Big challenge for the linebackers. \n3. Splash plays. Last year's overtime game in State College turned on Anthony Zettel's fumble return for a touchdown. Something similar (interception return, punt return, 65-yard TD pass) is needed to shock the system. \nOHIO STATE BUCKEYES \n1. Get the offense together. Despite a talent-rich lineup, the Buckeyes have been prone to turnovers, penalties and red-zone inefficiency. Barrett has helped on the third point. \n2. Subdue Penn State's deep threat. A combination of QB pressure (watch for Tyquan Lewis and Joey Bosa) and man coverage from the corners will be difficult for the Lions to handle. \n3. The good Cardale Jones. When he's on, Ohio State's QB is a mega-talent. He's also an occasionally cavalier talent who has thrown 5 interceptions this season. \nFIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW \n1. Ohio State has won 19 consecutive regular-season games, the nation's longest active streak. With a win Saturday, coach Urban Meyer will have his fourth 20-game win streak as a head coach. \n2. The Buckeyes also have won a Big Ten-record 26 consecutive regular-season conference games under Meyer. The coach also is 24-1 at Ohio Stadium. \n3. Penn State has lost nearly 40 player games this season due to injuries. According to the team, 16 different players have missed at least one game. \n4. Another offensive player to watch for Ohio State? Receiver Michael Thomas, who has caught a pass in 22 consecutive games. \n5. Penn State hasn't defeated a No. 1-ranked team since its 1990 victory over Notre Dame. The Lions have lost three straight to top-ranked Ohio State teams (1996, 2006, 2007). \nPREDICTION \nFeels like a breakthrough game for Ohio State, which will wear black uniforms and has dubbed this the 'Dark Night.' \nOHIO STATE 27-10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:32:08.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
