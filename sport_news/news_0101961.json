And all those years, when he wasn't racing off to a Pop Warner football game or baseball practice, he'd tune into the Red River showdowns between Texas and the Sooners.\nIt wasn't until last season, which he was forced to sit out after transferring to OU after one season at Texas Tech, that he got to experience the 50-50 crimson and burnt orange split of the Cotton Bowl in person.\n\"It's pretty special to me,\" Mayfield said. \"I'm a big fan of the Red River game. ...Standing on the sidelines, it was neat. But it will be different playing in it now.\"\nOn Saturday, Mayfield will quarterback the No. 10 Sooners in the 110th edition of the rivalry.\nThe former Tech and OU walk-on enters his name in the series history after his well-documented messy exit from Lubbock and leap of faith that he'd eventually beat out Trevor Knight for the Sooners starting job.\nIn Mayfield's opening four games, he's mostly thrived in the Air Raid offense installed by first-year offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley.\nMayfield (6-1, 209) has passed for 13 touchdowns and run for four. He set the OU single-game record for total offense, with 572 yards in a shootout with Tulsa, and tied the school record by accounting for six touchdowns. His 487 passing yards were the fourth most in OU history.\nWith OU trailing 17-0 at Tennessee, Mayfield overcame two interceptions and helped lead the Sooners to touchdowns on their final four possessions and a double-overtime victory.\nThe lightly recruited, undersized, keepin'-plays-alive QB is even popping up on early lists as a darkhorse Heisman Trophy contender.\n\"He's an incredibly confident person,\" tight end Mark Andrews said. \"He carries that on to the field. He's growing through the games, spreading the ball around to all his playmakers. I think that he's getting better, and we're getting better with him.\"\nReceiver Dede Westbrook said the Sooners practice scramble drills every day --annoying because of the amount of extra running -- but it pays off in games.\n\"When Baker sees something he doesn't like or a play breaks down, he has the ability to leave the pocket with his feet,\" Westbrook said. \"That gives us a better chance as receivers. The DBs can't hold receivers for six seconds.\"\nRiley said Mayfield's field experience has helped. Mayfield started part of the 2013 season at Texas Tech as a non-scholarship true freshman, before a rift with coach Kliff Kingsbury led to his migration to Norman.\n\"You can tell he's done it before,\" Riley said. \"When you've been there, had the ups, had the downs, been in heated environments, it gets easier.\"\nMayfield has played against Texas before. He led Tech against the Longhorns in Austin on Thanksgiving 2013. UT won 41-16. Mayfield (24 of 44 for 237 yards, one interception and no touchdowns) was sacked seven times.\n\"It was two years ago,\" Mayfield said. \"It's a different Texas team, and I'm on a different team, too, so it will be a different experience.\"\nSince Mayfield grew up in UT's backyard, he's used to being wished well by friends, who will still cheer for the Longhorns.\nMayfield said he's looking forward to seeing UT's starting center Taylor Doyle, a fellow Lake Travis High alum. But he acknowledged higher emotions in rivalry games.\nMayfield knows the 1-4 Longhorns aren't used to struggling like they are currently.\n\"It's definitely not the University of Texas I grew up watching,\" he said, \"and it's not the one all those players and coaches are used to. I know they're frustrated. But we can't look at it like they're a bad team. ... It doesn't matter how they've been playing.\"\nWhat matters most to Mayfield is that he's finally playing, for Oklahoma, and in the Red River rivalry he grew up watching.\nTwitter: @khairopoulos\nMayfield stats\nOpponent Cmps Atts Yds Ints TDs % Akron 23 33 383 0 3 .697 Tennessee 19 39 187 2 3 .487 Tulsa 32 38 487 0 4 .842 West Virginia 14 25 320 1 3 .560 On Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:16:15.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
