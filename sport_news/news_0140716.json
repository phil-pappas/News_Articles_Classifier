It’s not that at all …,” said Govs sophomore running back Kendall Morris. “You have to be willing to go out there and fight. … I think we haven’t been in that situation at all this season were you come back in and fight back-and-forth.” \nLast season, Austin Peay pulled off a 20-13 victory to break the nation’s longest losing streak when the Govs hosted Murray. That was the last game the Governors have won. \n“The guys aren’t happy,” said third-year APSU coach Kirby Cannon. “Nobody is happy.” \nMorris pulled off his second straight game with 100-plus rushing yards, finishing with 136 and touchdown. \n“We said Morris was going to be a big guy that could take little ones and turn them into big ones, and the option play he scored on today was pure speed. I don’t know if anyone in the league can catch him,” Cannon said. \nQuarterback KD Humphries ran in from the 1-yard line for Murray State’s first touchdown, and Roman Clay’s short run six minutes later boosted the Racers to a 14-0 lead. \nHumphries had 286 passing yards, completing 32 of 51 attempts. \n“Their quarterback is a lot better this year,” Cannon said. “ … He threw some darts.” \nWith just 20 seconds left in the first quarter, the Governors marched down the field and added six points from freshman running back Taye Davis. \nClay had another touchdown run. A Connor Mitchell 23-yard field goal and another Humphries touchdown gave Murray State a 31-6 lead at halftime. \nIn the second half, the Govs Timarious Mitchell came in at quarterback for Trey Taylor and connected with Jared Beard on a 10-yard pass. \n“He (Timarious) has been one of my favorite quarterbacks since I got here,” Beard said. “I like the touch he puts on the ball. I like the way he throws. His balls are really easy to catch. … I’ve always had confidence in Timarious being on the field.” \nAustin Peay made another march to the end zone, on Morris’ 62-yard dash. \nThe Governors return home to host UT Martin at 4 p.m. on Saturday. \nReach Autumn Allison at aallison@theleafchronicle.com or (931) 245-0258.
