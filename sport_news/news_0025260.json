Our fans and the atmosphere was as good as there is.”\nKyle Whittingham\nSALT LAKE CITY — Since joining the Pac-12 in 2011, the fourth-ranked Utah Utes have beaten all but two teams in the conference. They’ve lost to South Division foe Arizona State four times and Washington twice.\nSaturday at Rice-Eccles Stadium, Utah gets another shot at ASU — a team the Utes have lost to 11 consecutive times overall. The Utes’ last victory in the series was in 1976 when both teams resided in the Western Athletic Conference. Their most recent win over the Sun Devils in Salt Lake City came in 1973.\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham noted that ASU is well-coached, has good teams and good athletes.\nAfter playing the Sun Devils down to the wire the past two seasons, Whittingham is hopeful that the Utes get a boost from the home crowd similar to last week’s 30-24 win over California.\n“That environment, by the way, on Saturday night was great. Our fans and the atmosphere was as good as there is,” Whittingham said. “And so we’re hoping to get a repeat of that this week and really give us another home-field advantage.”\nUtah linebacker Gionni Paul has a personal interest in topping ASU. He was once committed to the Sun Devils when Dennis Erickson was the head coach. However, when Erickson’s future became uncertain, he ultimately de-committed. Both men landed at Utah, where Erickson is now an assistant head coach.\nPaul said nothing against ASU, but he really wants to win this game. Besides his own journey as a transfer from Miami (Florida), the senior knows Utah’s history against the Sun Devils and is eager to be part of an initial Pac-12 victory over them.\n“We just want to be the first team to make it happen,” Paul said.\nQuarterback Travis Wilson, who is also a senior, has a similar determination.\n“Definitely. It’s going to be a big challenge,” said Wilson, who added that ASU has played well as of late — winning two straight, including a 38-23 decision at UCLA on Oct. 3. “We’ve got to make sure we’re executing on our end and just make sure that all phases on the offense are clicking.”\nAfter losing the first two Pac-12 games against ASU by a combined score of 72-21, Utah has closed the gap — falling to the Sun Devils 20-19 in 2013 and dropping a 19-16 overtime decision last season.\n“It’s been grinder games and it’s been a challenge,” Wilson said. “But we’ve just got to make sure we’re prepared and we’re ready to play.”\nNow in the midst of their fifth season in the Pac-12, the Utes are 16-22 overall in conference games. They hold winning records against Colorado (3-1), California (2-1) and Stanford (2-0); even marks against Oregon State (2-2), UCLA (2-2) and Washington State (2-2); and shortcomings against ASU (0-4), Washington (0-2), Arizona (1-3), USC (1-3) and Oregon (1-2).\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:18:55.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
