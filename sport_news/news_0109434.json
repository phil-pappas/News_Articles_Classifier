(Iassonga) apologized to Salvy because he thought that the pitch was a strike,” said Volquez, who met with Perez when the count was 3-2, then delivered a breaking pitch to the outside corner.\n“But he didn’t say that to me. He said that to Salvy. He might know the pitch was a strike. Yeah, it was nice of him but it would have been better if he had given me the pitch (in the first place). But he’s a human being, and we all make mistakes.”\nWith Volquez’s fastball as good as it has been this season, and with the Jays up 1-0 at the time, the game pivoted on the walk to Bautista and another bases-loaded free pass to Edwin Encarnacion that gave Toronto a 2-0 lead.\nThat forced Royals manager Ned Yost to pull Volquez and bring in reliever Kelvin Hernandez, who can reach 100 m.p.h. on the speed gun.\nTroy Tulowitzki rapped him for a three-run double to break open the game. All three runs were charged to Volquez, whose inflated pitching line did not reflect how competitive an outing he put up for his team.\n“I think it was a strike (to Bautista) … I went to the video room and I saw the pitch and I thought it was a strike,” Volquez said.\n“And the umpire apologized to Salvy. He told him he thought it was a strike. You feel bad at the time but you are not going to get that pitch back. You gotta move forward and win the game at home.”\nVolquez did not disagree with Iassonga on the ball four pitch to Encarnacion.\n“No, I saw the video. That one was a little off the plate,” Volquez said.\nALCS Schedule Yost was equally perturbed over the at-bat with Bautista, who has been criticized by fans, announcers and opposing players for his on-field reactions, including his bat toss in the division series against Texas.\n“I thought some of those pitches were close . . . we didn’t get them. I thought the pitch to Bautista was definitely a strike. And I thought we had a chance on him swinging,” Yost said, adding he wanted a video review of Bautista’s check swing.\n“I wanted to get an appeal there, but I couldn’t get anybody’s attention because the crowd was so loud.”\nVolquez was being questioned in some circles on social media, and by some media, for putting himself in an arguable position for mentioning Iassonga’s apology.\nBut there was also a marked contrast between his Game 1 start and his start Wednesday. In both games, he reached a breaking point in the sixth inning. He struggled through a 37-pitch inning in the series opener, but came up with an inning-ending strikeout to keep the Jays at bay.\nYOUR CALL! View on Poll Daddy He didn’t get an out in the sixth Wednesday; he tossed 24 pitches to four batters, the last of which was Encarnacion.\nThe two clubs jetted back to Kansas City for Games 6 and 7, and the anticipation that this heavyweight fight is about to enter the heartbreak rounds.\n“Again, we knew it was going to be a tough series,” Yost said. “But after winning the first two games, your goal is to come to Toronto . . . a kind of foreign environment, a hostile environment, and at least win one.\n“Now we’re going back to a place (Kauffman Stadium) where we’re completely comfortable. That’s why home field was so important to us.”\nMore Blue Jays at thestar.com:\nEstrada, Blue Jays stave off Game 5 elimination\nALCS Game 5, in photos\nJays fans celebrate after dominating win over Royals\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays fans young and old cheer Game 5\nBlue Jays take on the Royals in ALCS Game 5", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/9139115/", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9139115.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:48:33.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
