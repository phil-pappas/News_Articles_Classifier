(Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images) \nThis was supposed to be a celebration for the Chicago Cubs, who were attempting to make their first World Series appearance since 1945 while fulfilling the prophecy of Bob Gale, a co-writer of Back to the Future II. \nInstead, they find themselves in a seemingly insurmountable 3-0 deficit in the best-of-seven NLCS against the New York Mets. \n“ Nine different times this year we’ve won four or more games in a row, so let’s just do it a 10th time ,” Chicago Cubs president Theo Epstein said. “Show up and win tomorrow [Wednesday]. We’re dangerous. It’s been done before, rumor has it. We can do it.” \nThe team Epstein is alluding to is his 2004 Boston Red Sox, who found themselves down 3-0 against the New York Yankees and ended up winning the World Series. It was the first time in MLB history a team had come back from a three-game deficit to win a series. \nBut other than both the Red Sox and Cubs being down three games to none, the two teams don’t have much in common. And a miraculous resurrection of Chicago’s title dream is a much, much longer shot than what the Sox did in ’04. \n[ Can the 2015 Cubs become the 2004 Red Sox? Seems unlikely. ] \nThe first hurdle for the Cubs is solving Daniel Murphy. He has home runs in five straight playoff games, tying him with Carlos Beltran for the longest such streak in postseason history (Beltran homered in five straight postseason games for the Astros in 2004). Per Elias, he is also the first player to record an extra-base hit of any kind in five consecutive postseason games for the Mets. \nAnd if that’s not daunting enough, he is 6 for 11 against Jason Hammel, with just one strikeout. \nEleven at-bats isn’t a large sample size, but there is reason to believe Murphy’s success against Hammel can continue for one more game. \nHammel has five pitches in his repertoire, with a sinker, four-seam fastball and slider the most frequent pitches to left-handed batters like Murphy. \nMurphy is hitting .357 with .541 slugging against the sinker from right-handed pitchers this season , including three home runs and nine doubles over 98 at bats that have ended with that pitch. Against the four-seam fastball he is batting .290 with six home runs, 10 doubles and a triple over 114 at bats. His performance against the slider: .375 with .844 slugging. \nBut Murphy’s just one man, so let’s say the Cubs manage a victory in Game 4. Well, then they won’t be able to look forward to the same flagging starting pitchers the Red Sox faced in 2004. Mike Mussina and Jon Lieber are far from the heavyweights Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard have become. \nIn 2004, Mussina struck out 7.2 batters per nine regular-season innings and had a 3.95 FIP , which measures what a player’s ERA would look like over a given period of time if the pitcher were to have experienced league average results on balls in play and league average timing. Lieber struck out 5.2 batters per nine innings with a 3.71 FIP. Harvey, 8.9 K/9IP and 3.05 FIP, and Syndergaard, 9.9 K/9IP and 3.25 FIP, are significantly better. \nIn terms of wins above replacement, Mussina and Lieber combined for 6.5 fWAR that season, while Harvey and Syndergaard produced 7.5 fWAR, a one-win difference that could be enough to send the Cubs to an early postseason exit. \n“ It comes down to we have to pitch equally well ,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. “But it is not easy.” Neil Greenberg analyzes advanced sports statistics for the Fancy Stats blog and prefers to be called a geek rather than a nerd. sports Success!
