They rank second in total offense, are plus-3 in turnover margin, and only Atlanta and Arizona have scored more than Cincinnati's 121 points. \nWith Baltimore off to a weak start and Pittsburgh missing Ben Roethlisberger, the AFC North could be their domain. \nJust don't bring that up to coach Marvin Lewis. \n\"The players have done what they've been asked to do, and that's all we can be,\" he said. \"They've been down these roads before, and four (wins) doesn't get you anything and they realize that. \n\"So we've just got to keep playing. The other people, I can't talk for. I don't understand what people expect us to be.\" \nFor years, they were expected to be the Bungles. That changed when Lewis came aboard in 2003. They've made the playoffs six times since then, including the past four seasons, albeit exiting each time after one game. \nSeattle's track record is a whole lot better as the Seahawks (2-2) seek a third straight Super Bowl trip. They come off a tight win against Detroit aided by a botched officiating call at the end, and they have severe pass protection issues. \n\"There's a lot of ways for us here to get better obviously,\" said Seahawks coach Pete Carroll, whose team has rallied from an 0-2 start. Advertisement \n\"And that's really what our theme is, to continue to strive to find those ways, adjust things, and fix things so that we can be more efficient and more consistent. It hasn't been like we like it, but we're pleased to be getting on track, and the way the defense is playing gives us a chance every week.\" Patriots-Cowboys: Tom Brady can join Peyton Manning and Fran Tarkenton as the only quarterbacks with four 4-0 starts to a season, and against battered Dallas, it's difficult to see him failing. New England is averaging 37.8 points per game during a six-game winning streak that includes the playoffs last season, and All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski has been unstoppable. Dallas has gone cold after winning its opening two games as key players keep getting injured, quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant foremost among them. The Cowboys do get defensive end Greg Hardy back after his four-game suspension. They'll need a lot more against New England. Steelers: Linebacker Ryan Shazier's injured right shoulder will force him to miss a third straight game. Pittsburgh plays Monday night at San Diego. Shazier injured the shoulder in a Week 2 win against the 49ers, a game in which he had a team-high 15 tackles with a sack and a fumble recovery. \nShazier has now missed 10 of 21 games since the Steelers took him in the first round of the 2014 draft. Packers: Green Bay likely will be without wide receiver Davante Adams (ankle) and safety Morgan Burnett (calf) again for Sunday's game against St. Louis. Both players were downgraded to doubtful after not participating in the team's light Saturday practice. continued perfection?
