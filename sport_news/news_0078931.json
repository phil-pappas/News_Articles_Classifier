The corporation has suffered losses to the tune of over Rs 1.5 crore in less than one week. After adding 250 new ordinary buses to its fleet recently, the daily revenue of the PRTC had touched Rs 1 crore. The agitation has affected the business with the corporation suffering a loss of about Rs 30 lakh every day. The loss was pegged at Rs 50 lakh on October 14 when the Sikh organisations had given a Punjab bandh call. Even though the protests are on in almost all districts of the state, the worst affected parts are Bathinda, Faridkot, Budhlada and Barnala depots. An official said people avoided stepping out of their houses because of the tense situation in the state. “Even though our buses are on roads, the number of passengers has dropped drastically, causing revenue loss,” he said. PRTC chairman Avtar Singh Brar said the corporation was helpless and that the loss was unavoidable. “We are committed to providing services. There is no lapse on our part. Normalcy will return soon,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:10:33.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
