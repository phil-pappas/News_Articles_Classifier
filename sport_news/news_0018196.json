And if they whiff again, it will be the Dodgers celebrating while the Mets contemplate 2016.\n“I think you have to love it, you have to embrace that,” said rookie Michael Conforto, whose Mets will send Jacob deGrom to the mound against Zack Greinke in Game 5 of the NLDS at Dodger Stadium. “We wanted to get it done [Tuesday] for our fans and their support all year — we’re disappointed we couldn’t do that. But you’ve got to love the fact it’s coming down to Game 5 and everything is on the line.”\nGreinke is certainly capable of making life miserable for the Mets, but the same holds true of deGrom and the Dodgers. In a series that has been defined by starting pitching, the 121-pitch masterpiece deGrom fired in Game 1, when he threw seven shutout innings and struck out 13, stands out.\nThe Mets gladly will take something similar Thursday as they attempt to rebound once again to conclude this seesaw series.\n“We want to make it to the World Series and this is one step toward that,” deGrom said. “I just think we never give up and we battle until the end.”\nThe Mets needed deGrom’s brilliance during a showdown with Kershaw in Game 1 that wasn’t close to decided until David Wright delivered a two-run single against Pedro Baez in the seventh to give the Mets a three-run cushion. DeGrom didn’t exactly pitch to contact, tying the franchise record set by Tom Seaver in Game 1 of the 1973 NLCS for most strikeouts in a postseason game.\nManager Terry Collins will have Noah Syndergaard and Matt Harvey as potential options in the bullpen, but the Mets would prefer to ride deGrom as close to Jeurys Familia as possible.\n“If anybody was going to pitch two games in the series for us it would be Jacob deGrom,” Collins said. “So it worked out that way. Fortunately we didn’t have to bring him back on short rest. He hasn’t done it, and he’s uncomfortable doing it. So we’re lucky he’s got an extra day.” \nBut if deGrom makes even a mistake Thursday, the Mets will risk getting swallowed alive by Greinke, who is capable of matching Kershaw’s Tuesday handiwork, when the stud lefty allowed a Daniel Murphy solo homer but didn’t permit another runner to reach second base over seven innings.\n“When you’re facing Kershaw and Greinke in four of five games you know that runs are going to be at a premium and they have definitely been that with those two guys on the mound,” Wright said.\nEven so, the Mets received solo homers from Yoenis Cespedes and Conforto against Greinke in Game 2 and were in position to win until Chase Utley’s controversial takeout slide on Ruben Tejada sparked the Dodgers’ 5-2 victory.\nGreinke may change his approach Thursday.\n“I feel like, in general, lefties hit fastballs from right-handed pitchers better than right-handers hit fastballs from right-handed pitchers,” Greinke said. “So if you look at how I pitched them last time, I threw more fastballs to their righties and less fastballs to their lefties, and they had more lefties. So it ends up being more off-speed to that team because of the amount of lefties they have.”\nThe prize for Thursday’s winner is the NLCS against the Cubs, with home-field advantage, beginning Saturday. \n“Our guys are upbeat,” Collins said. “Nobody wants to fly all the way across the country for one game. But I think we’re as excited as we were [for Game 1].”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under jacob degrom ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  terry collins ,  zack greinke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:31:49.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
