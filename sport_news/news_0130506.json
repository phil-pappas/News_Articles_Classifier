Chris Perkins Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Kevin Coyle fired as Dolphins defensive coordinator \nKevin Coyle, the embattled Dolphins defensive coordinator whose unit underachieved rushing the passer and got trampled defending the run, was fired Thursday. \nLou Anarumo, the Dolphins’ defensive backs coach since 2012, was promoted to defensive coordinator. \nIn other defensive moves announced by interim coach Dan Campbell, defensive assistant Jeff Burris has been promoted to assistant defensive backs coach and will work with cornerbacks, and assistant defensive backs coach Blue Adams will work with safeties. \nCampbell said Thursday’s moves complete his coaching staff, something that should give them a little bit of time working together before their first game. \nThe Dolphins (1-3) have a bye this week and travel to Tennessee to play the Titans on Oct. 18. \nThe coaching staff is inexperienced at the top, considering Campbell is in his first week in his current role, Anarumo is serving as a defensive coordinator for the first time since the early 1990s when he was with U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and offensive coordinator Bill Lazor is in his second year with the Dolphins. \nAnarumo is tasked with breathing life into a defense that ranks 30th in the 32-team NFL in total defense (399.5 yards allowed per game), last in run defense (160.5), and 15th against the pass (239). \n“Every one of those guys up front has demonstrated in their career they can be productive players,” Anarumo said Thursday, “and that’s going to be our charge as coaches to get that out of them going forward.” \nAnarumo, who was Purdue’s defensive backs coach from 2004-11, said improvement will come from scheme change and players performing better. \nThe 13 defensive coordinators in Miami Dolphins history. \n“I think it’s kind of a combination of both,” he said. \nAnarumo, who also worked previously at Marshall (2001-03) and Harvard (1995-2000), said he’ll also look at ways to use All-Pro defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who has 10 tackles and no sacks through four games. \n“The guy goes out there and works hard every day and gives us his all,” Anarumo said. “As we get into this bye week, as we talk about using him and everybody else, Cam Wake and those guys, we’ll look into every avenue to get the most out of these guys.” \nAs for improving the disappointing pass rush, which has an NFL-worst one sack, Anarumo said that will be given a look, too. \n“It’s a little bit early to say exactly what the issues are,” he said, “but we will have a better feel as we get through the rest of the week and into next week.” \nAnarumo admitted to being “surprised” he was named to this job, but he said it’s something he worked toward his entire career. \nCampbell said he sees “eye to eye” with Anarumo “about what we need to do defensively moving forward.” \n“I feel like it’s a move that’s going to help us win games down the stretch here with 12 to go,” Campbell said. “The only hard thing about today, the worst thing about today for me, because this is the first time I’ve had to go thru it with somebody I’ve had a tremendous amount of respect for, was letting go of Kevin Coyle. \n“But we’re going to turn this into a positive experience, and we’re moving forward from here on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:40:03.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
