Blatter announced his resignation plans four days later as the severity of the U.S. criminal investigations into FIFA officials magnified and sponsors stepped up criticism. \nFIFA's executive committee \"should not interfere with an ongoing process that was put in place by the ad hoc electoral committee,\" Prince Ali said. \n\"The election date of 26 February was set three months ago with a clear procedure that meets all of FIFA's statutory requirements,\" the Jordanian Football Association president added. \"Candidates have had plenty of time to declare and still do. The rules should not be changed after the game has started.\" \nEuropean soccer leaders will meet on Thursday at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland to discuss the crisis that has seen their president temporarily banned from any role in football. Platini had initially been the favorite to replace Blatter in February, but UEFA executives will explore whether to endorse a new European candidate for the presidential election.
