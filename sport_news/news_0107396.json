Their goalie didn’t exactly have the height advantage,” Delaware Military’s Aleksander Kostysyn said. “We were trying to get it in.” \nThe Seahawks (8-2) trailed the Highlanders 1-0 in the 33rd minute when they were awarded their second corner kick of the day, and Daniel Rhoades took the kick to the goalkeeper’s right. \nRhoades’s cross curved into the six-yard box, and freshman midfielder Alvin Halley outjumped everyone to head the ball into the net to tie the game at 1-1.

William Hitchens took the kick and crossed into the box, and a few seconds later, Kostyszyn emerged from traffic to kick the ball into the net to give the Seahawks a 2-1 lead. \n“It’s something that we work on in practice normally. Our starting central midfielder was out, so we had to make some adjustments,” Delaware Military Academy head coach Wayne Cox said. “That’s why it took us a while to get going. We tried get people moving and look for back posts, and that’s pretty much what happened.” \nThe second half saw the Seahawks control possession with McKean (4-5) looking to counter to get the equalizer, but neither team could generate dangerous scoring opportunity over the next 30 minutes. \nIn the 72nd minute, however, Luke Perrone passed it to an open Hitchens along the sideline, and he dribbled it down the field before passing it to Justin Carroll, who rocketed a shot into the net to give Delaware Military Academy a 3-1 lead. \nRhoades capped off the victory for the Seahawks, converting a penalty kick in the final minute, and their strong closing stretch was a result of good passing that opened up the field. \n“We had good movement and spacing. Then we had some good touches,” Rhoades said. \nThe Highlanders’ goal came in the 15th minute when Carlos Santana won a 50/50 ball before kicking it into the net.
