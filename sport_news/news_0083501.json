McNeil, which last reached the postseason in 2004, earned its second straight victory on Thursday night, and the Mavericks (3-4) are now 2-2 in district play. \n“Our goal is to gain a little bit of respect, and the way we do that is to go out and play hard every snap,” said McNeil’s head coach, Howard McMahan. “I’m proud of them because these kids deserve it. They’ve been beat down for a while, and they deserve these opportunities.” Stephen Spillman McNeil’s Luis Balderas kicks off to start the Mavericks’ District 13-6A game against Rouse on Thursday night. Balderas later converted a 29-yard field goal with no time to play as McNeil recorded a 45-42 victory. CREDIT: Stephen Spillman/For American-Statesman \nBalderas wasn’t around for McNeil’s seven losses against District 13-6A competition in 2014, but Mavericks assistant coach Kevin McKinley recruited the midfielder off of the school’s soccer team during the off-season. Months after he joined his school’s football team, Balderas was shoved into the spotlight at Reeves Athletic Complex. \nWith the game tied 42-42, McNeil received the football at its 21 with 3:21 to go. Over the team’s next nine plays — one of which was a 33-yard catch by Matt Wright — McNeil drove to the Rouse 12 with four seconds left. \nMcNeil stopped the clock with a timeout to set up Balderas’ kick. After Rouse used two of its timeouts, the senior booted the football through the uprights.

I’ve never been happier.” \nBalderas admitted being “extremely nervous” before he made his eighth field goal of the season. McNeil holder Zach Epstein said the Mavericks left Balderas alone during Rouse’s timeouts, but the team had confidence in its kicker. \n“It was a great snap, and I put it on the tee for him, and it was all him,” Epstein said. “He just kicked it right through the uprights. It was awesome.” Stephen Spillman Rouse quarterback Michael Forster throws a 70-yard touchdown pass over McNeil’s Tyler Mosley on the first play of their District 13-6A contest on Thursday night. Forster finished with five touchdown passes, but Rouse suffered a 45-42 loss. CREDIT: Stephen Spillman/For American-Statesman \nBalderas’ kick capped a high-scoring meeting that featured 908 yards of offense. Rouse quarterback Michael Forster opened the game with a 70-yard touchdown pass to Thomas Glenn, and the teams entered halftime locked in a 21-21 tie. \nCooper, who completed 10 of his 11 passes during a second-quarter stretch that featured three McNeil touchdowns, finished the game with 356 passing yards. The third-year starter threw 14- and 65-yard touchdown passes to Jonathan Boozer, and 11 of his 27 completions were hauled in by senior David Pleites. \nJustin Ward added three rushing touchdowns for McNeil. Rouse at McNeil, 10.15.15 \nRouse (2-5, 1-3) was led by Forster, a junior who entered the week with four touchdown passes this season. He threw five against McNeil on Thursday, when his performance was complemented by Marquis Simmons’ 97 yards rushing and 69 yards receiving. \nLanier 28, Crockett 22: Sometimes all it takes to win a football game is a superhuman performance. \nThat’s what Lanier received from Juanye Johnson in a District 26-5A matchup against Crockett. Displaying a potent combination of speed and brute strength, Johnson amassed 283 yards and three touchdowns on 35 carries. His sensational night came with a Hollywood ending, too: He scored the game-winning touchdown on a 3-yard run with 22 seconds to play. \n“Juayne is a great kid with a lot of character,” said Lanier’s head coach, Jonathan Hayhurst. “He answered the bell every time tonight. I could not be more proud of him.” \nJohnson credited his brother with teaching him the hard-nosed, no-frills running style he showed off against the Cougars. \n“My older brother, Justin Johnson, was a running back, too,” he said. “We worked a lot last summer on my speed and my strength. He’s a big part of my success here tonight.” \nLanier (4-3, 1-3) entered halftime trailing 14-0, but Johnson and his teammates flipped the script over the final two quarters, outscoring the Cougars (1-6, 1-3) by a 28-8 margin. \n— Mike Schoeffel, AA-S correspondent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:51:11.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
