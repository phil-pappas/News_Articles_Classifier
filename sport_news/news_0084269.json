Ken Morgan of the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin Print this article Advertisement Waitsburg’s goal-line stand was the difference here Friday in Southeast 2B League football action, as the Cardinals held on to defeat DeSales, 20-13.

Photo by Greg Lehman Irish defender Max Buckley (right, in center) strips the ball from Cardinals running back Travis Crockett (No. 8) in the first quarter. “It was a fun high school game,” Irish coach Mike Spiess said. “Both teams were competing, both teams were making mistakes. We got it right down there and couldn’t get it in (at the end).” DeSales started its last possession of the game at their own 37 with 4:13 to play. A false start penalty backed the Irish up five, John Crowley got one back, but Waitsburg’s Zach Hubbard then broke through and sacked Irish quarterback Zach Leahy on the Irish 20. Leahy then found Pat Elmenhurst on a quick screen, and Elmenhurst weaved his way down the sideline for 70 yards and a first-and-goal at the Cardinal 10. On first down, Mark Montgomery stopped Crowley for a one-yard gain. Ky Adams rapped Leahy up for a two-yard loss on second down. And Leahy hit Connor Hoeft on a quick out in the end zone, but Hoeft couldn’t hold on as he juggled the ball as he was going out of bounds. “I don’t know what happened on that route,” Spiess said. “I thought we had it. Our kid said he kind of bobbled it and then he slipped and couldn’t get his feet down in bounds.” On fourth-and-11, Leahy rolled right, turned the corner, but Jason Carter rolled Leahy to the ground at the 4, and the Cardinals took over with 38 ticks left. “My stomach hurt so bad I could hardly breathe,” Cardinals coach Troy Larsen said. “That was guts. We told our guys to play assignment football and stay home and not try to be a hero. This is DeSales-Waitsburg. It — end of the game, goal-line — has happened to us many times. I said, ‘Is it our turn to lose one?’ It wasn’t.” The Irish lost a fumble on their first drive of the game as Adams recovered at the Waitsburg 40. The Cardinals returned the favor as Max Buckley fell on a Waitsburg miscue at his own 35 to stop the Cardinal drive, but the scoreless first ended with the Irish on the march. With 10:43 left in the second period, Leahy capped the DeSales’ 78-yard drive with a 12-yard run and DeSales led, 7-0. Crowley recovered a Cardinal fumble on the ensuing Waitsburg possession. Crowley’s 37-yard galloped highlighted an Irish drive that Leahy capped with a three-yard run. After a false start penalty, the Irish sailed the PAT low and DeSales led 13-0 with 4:19 left in the half. The Cardinals answered behind a 27-yard completion from Jacob Dunn to Brandon Penner, and a 19-yard scamper by Travis Crockett, to set up a 3-yard Crockett scoring run and send Waitsburg to intermission down 13-7. Crockett ran for 119 yards in the first half, and Leahy led the Irish with 106 rushing yards. “We were kind of dazed and confused, and that is all a credit to DeSales, who came out and punched us in the face,” Larsen said. “Coach Spiess just picked us apart. We thought we would just walk all over them. I let them (our guys) have it a little bit and challenged them to be better.” Crockett took the second-half kickoff on the dead run to net a 31-yard return to the Irish 41. Dunn hit Nicolas Kitselman for 44 yards to the Cardinal 7, and Dunn then faked to Crockett and went around left end for the score. Jordan Garrity added his second PAT for a 14-13 Cardinal lead with three minutes gone in the second half. On their next possession, the Cardinals marched to the Irish 13, but Crowley picked a Dunn pass off to end the threat. Dunn returned the favor moments later as he picked off a Leahy pass at the 50. “Give them credit, they made the adjustments they needed to stop us in the second half,” Spiess said. “We can’t handle those guys up front.” The Irish drove to a fourth-and-very short at their own 40 in the waning moments of the third quarter, but an unsportsmanlike penalty forced an Irish punt. Waitsburg took its 14-13 lead to the fourth. The Irish opened the fourth on a march to the Cardinal 30 before the ball popped loose and Garrity pounced on it to stop the Irish scoring threat. The Cardinals ended the scoring with a 70-yard march. Crockett ran for 55 yards, including the last 19 for the score. “When you average 285 (pounds) across the front, there is no reason you can’t run,” Larsen said of the Cardinal running game. “Travy (Crockett) is a great asset. Travy left and Travy right on that drive at the end was all guts and glory. Travy just took it on his shoulders and wanted it more.” Crockett finished the night with 206 rushing yards on 24 carries and scored two touchdowns. “I came into this game hoping I could get some yards for my team,” Crockett said. “It all started up front with the linemen. We’ve probably got the best line in the state. “In the first half, we noticed that they couldn’t stop me,” he continued. “In the second half, coach told me, ‘Travis, you’re going to run the ball a lot.’” Following the Crockett TD, Waitsburg mishandled the snap on the PAT to lead 20-13 with 4:20 left. The ensuing Irish drive to tie came up four yards short. For DeSales, Leahy finished with 134 rushing yards and 104 passing yards. Crowley ran for 79. “The effort of our kids was excellent,” Spiess said. “Last week we gave up 52 points and never came close to stopping Davenport. They learned tonight what can happen when they play with great effort. The improvement on defense was phenomenal. With only three league games, our goals are still possible. We proved tonight that we can play with anybody in the league.” DeSales host Tri-Cities Prep in the annual Holy Bowl on Friday. “These guys deserve to get a win,” Spiess said. “We left a lot out there. We’re headed in the right direction.” Waitsburg hosts Asotin Friday. “I was very happy with them,” Larsen said. “We played the best we have in a long time in the second half. We fought and fought. “Asotin has beaten us the last two years,” he said. “They have our number. It’s up to us to change that now.” Waitsburg 20, DeSales 13 Waitsburg 0 7 7 6 — 20 DeSales 0 13 0 0 — 13 DeS — Leahy 12 run (Rodriguez kick). DeS — Crowley 3 run (kick failed).
