And that has paid off for the entire family.\n\"The program has expanded his horizons, given him a new interest. We'd had chances in the past to go riding with the family and cousins, and he didn't want to go. He was just too overwhelmed. Here, within two days he was up on a horse. And because of this, our whole family was able to go on a trail ride this summer,\" she said.\nSpecial Olympics equestrian coaches Marlene Karman and Chloe Willett said many of the students with special needs who signed up for the community equine therapy program had never seen a horse before.\n\"We started in the classroom: Here's your tack, here's your saddle, here's how you get on and get off,\" Karman said. \"In a matter of months, we've taken them from start to equestrians.\"\nWillett said participants include students from the school and members of the community. The group started with 27 riders, and that eventually was pared to 22.\n\"Now we have nine headed to the Special Olympics,\" Willett said.\nMaggie Kendall, a teacher in the school's animal sciences program, said she hopes the school can continue the community program, which was made possible by a grant from Special Children's Charities.\nThe award provided funding for two part-time instructors. But to make the program work, the school also had to recruit and train volunteers to help with grooming and preparing the horses, as well as leading and guiding the riders.\n\"This was an enormous effort,\" said Kathy Sanders, who has been organizing the 50 or so volunteers to ensure there are enough horse leaders and side walkers at each therapeutic session.\nThe Beverly resident, who has a son at Purdue University and a daughter at Marist High School in Chicago, has been helping at the Ag School for years.\n\"I stopped by one day last summer to buy fresh eggs and started talking to Maggie,\" Sanders said. \"She told me, 'I need some help. I really want to start a riding program, but I need some people with some horse sense.' I thought, 'Oh, gee, I could run around a barn a few hours a week. I used to ride in high school and college.' \"\nOther people, some from as far away as the city's North Side, also offered to help. Like the participants, the volunteers cross all age groups, from 14-year-old Keely Reardon, an Ag School freshman, to adults, including Ann Schoenecker, whose son, Thomas, is among the riders. Schoenecker's 14-year-old daughter, Kristine, also helps out.\nVolunteer Emma Bunda, 15, is a student at Marist.\n\"I like horses, and I like helping people,\" she said. \"I've helped with Special Olympics before.\"\nAlthough the culminating event of the students' months of hard work is the chance to participate in the Special Olympics, Kendall said the benefits of the program go well beyond medals. Equine therapy can be empowering for all people, but particularly those with special needs, she said.\nIn addition to gaining physical strength, balance and spatial understanding, she said, students can experience emotional, social and behavioral growth.\n\"This is a chance for the student to be the one in control,\" Kendall said. \"They're so used to following directions, always being helped. When they ride, they're the leader. They're the one in charge of this thousand-pound animal. A lot of pride comes out of it.\"\nThe community program is an offshoot of the academic equine programs at the Ag School.\nIt also further demonstrates the need for a new indoor riding arena, something Kendall and others have been campaigning and fundraising for over the past year.\n\"A year ago, we were awarded a $100,000 grant through Farmers Insurance for an indoor riding arena,\" she said. But after working with Chicago Public Schools architects and additional funding entities, she said, the expected cost of such a facility went from $600,000 to $2.6 million.\n\"We can't afford $2.6 million, so we started taking things off,\" she said. Among the amenities that landed on the cutting room floor: a viewing room, additional stalls and square footage.\n\"We had to get down to a reasonable budget of $800,000, and even that means we will still have to do additional fundraising to get to that,\" she said. Awarding naming rights is a possibility.\n\"Building an agricultural center in an urban setting has been challenging,\" she said. \"We're hoping that we can build what the school and the city needs: an all-season arena for riders of all ages and abilities. We're hoping to be able to heat our facility and have a viewing room where other riders can observe and families can watch. That would make it a real learning space.\"\nNot only does equine training build self-esteem and confidence in students, it provides post-school opportunity, she said.\n\"The equine industry is a $54 billion industry,\" she said. \"A lot of jobs come out of that, for regular and special-needs people.\"\nOutside, under an early-evening sun, Thomas Schoenecker, 17, rides Colonel, a Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse.\nHe leads the animal around the newly built outdoor arena, paid for by donors, through a pattern, around cones and into an area called a box.\n\"Walk on, walk off, whoa,\" he said, explaining the various skills he's learned.\nThomas, who also enjoys yoga, bowling and scuba, said he likes horses because they are gentle and fun to ride.\nAnn Schoenecker said the riding program has given her son more independence, more life skills.\n\"We see a lot of initiative on his part,\" she said. \"He'll say, 'I've got to go do this, I've got to go do that.' He is showing more responsibility. He rides and picks up after the horses. He tells me, 'Mom, it's Wednesday. I have to go horseback riding.' \"\nMichael Rudd watches in awe as his son, Michael, rides around the arena, located on the southwestern edge of the school's property at 3857 W. 111th St.\n\"He sort of fell into the program this summer. He got interested and involved. And he's made a lot of progress,\" Rudd said.\nNot only has the Ag School sophomore, who has autism, become so adept at riding that he \"nailed a recent competition,\" his dad said, \"he is enjoying this immensely.\n\"He is a knight.\"\ndvickroy@tribpub.com\nTwitter @dvickroy\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown High Schools Special Olympics Purdue University", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56192678/turbine/ct-sta-equestrian-therapy-st-1012-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:04:38.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
