One could see the sophomore signal-caller getting a bit rattled in such an environment. \nStaying calm and composed, Harris played terrifically in the 35-28 loss at LSU . \nThe Miami native finished 17-of-32 for 271 yards and two touchdowns. Harris took care of the ball and executed multiple throws down the field. Although he rushed for 20 yards on 13 carries, the paltry numbers came in large part to the pressure LSU's front seven was bringing (especially Lewis Neal ). \nJim McElwain has to be encouraged by the play of Harris. With Will Grier suspended for the foreseeable future, it must be comforting to have a quality option in Harris coming off of the bench. \nWith three winnable conference games remaining, there's a real chance Harris could lead the Gators to an SEC East Division title. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:42:33.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
