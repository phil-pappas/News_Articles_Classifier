No limping. Barely a sweat. GQ stuff.\nBOX SCORE: PATRIOTS 30, COWBOYS 6\nGuess this is the result of in-game adjustments.\nBrady was sacked five times in the first half, and zero times in the second half, as offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels made some quick adjustments along the way and gave left tackle Nate Solder some help in dealing with Greg Hardy, and the Patriots figured out a counter plan to the surprising dime defensive scheme the Dallas Cowboys sprung on them at the start.\nBrady took the Cowboys’ best punch and survived. Since he became a starter in 2001, he’s been sacked five or more times just five times, and Sunday was the fifth occasion as Hardy — the man who caused such a stir in the days before the game with his wisecracks that incorporated Brady’s wife Gisele Bunchden — demonstrated what a lightning rod he can be on the field.\nHardy had two sacks and five hits on Brady.\nThe trash-talking from Hardy last week represented some more new ground — on the heels of Deflategate — for the 16-year veteran to deal with. But he’s been rather cool about it, at least publicly.\nHIGHLIGHTS: Patriots vs. Cowboys\nFor a man who is so adept at compartmentalizing issues while keeping his focus, this too, was seemingly deflected with ease.\n“I’ve seen a lot,” Brady told USA TODAY Sports. “Just like you have. You just try to focus on whatever you can for football.”\nYeah, I’ve seen a lot, and I’ve heard Brady tell me things like that repeatedly over the years, no matter what the buzz or crisis is at the moment.\nBut there’s another twist at work this season, with Brady — who passed for two TDs and posted a 130.9 passer rating at Jerry World — off to one of the best starts of his career.\nThrough four undefeated games, he’s fired 11 TD passes and zero picks, which is new territory, even for him.\nSunday was the type of game that underscored Brady’s resilience, which might be overshadowed by some of the more glamorous aspects of his job.\nWhen I asked Bill Belichick whether the game was an example of his toughness, the Patriots’ lovable coach grumbled at me in his press conference.\n“Overlooked by who?” Belichick protested.\nMaybe the casual fan? Brady doesn’t get enough credit for being maybe the best quarterback in the NFL on those quarterback sneaks — and sure enough, he scored the Patriots’ first touchdown Sunday on a 1-yard sneak — but his image is built on his golden arm and Super Bowl wins.\n“I don’t think anybody questions Tom’s toughness,” Belichick snapped, affectionately. “Tom’s one of the toughest players in the league.”\nAt the end of his work day, he also came off as one of the most understanding players.\nWhen I mentioned to Brady that Belichick grumbled at my question, he laughed.\nHe said. “We all have been there.”\nInterestingly, this comes after an offseason dominated by the NFL’s case against Brady and the Patriots over the matter of deflated footballs.\nSurely, this prideful competitor doesn’t need any extra motivation to get going. But he’s always struck me as the type of guy who will take it when he can get it.\nSo far, he’s having some hellacious revenge on the NFL, critics and naysayers. Playing with fully inflated footballs, he won the NFL’s Offensive Player of the Month award for September, and is undoubtedly on the early short list of MVP frontrunners.\nMaybe he’s not out for revenge and it’s just about winning, as he’d tell you. But if that includes making a particular statement, he’s on his way.\nOn Sunday, he wore a black suit that fit a certain theme.\nBrady just made another stop on his Scorched Earth Tour. Next stop: Indianapolis. The whole Deflategate case was ignited when the Colts complained about the Patriots’ footballs during the AFC title game. And now comes a rematch.\nWhen I mentioned the “Scorched Earth” theory to Brady, he flashed a big smile.\nThen he responded like Brady would.\n“I’d rather be 4-0 than 3-1,” he said.\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell .\nBest of NFL Week 5 PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 5\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Patriots", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfkhSd.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfgmnR.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Of", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Colts", "http://www.twitter.com/JarrettBell", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfl7hI.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Which", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfkSfv.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Will"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:05:38.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
