Last May they got one in San Francisco. In August they got another in Boston. And when Brown signed Assembly Bill 768 on Sunday one was already in the works for Los Angeles. \nMajor League Baseball still needs buy-in from the players, however, because the statewide ban that takes effect before next season has no provision for enforcement.
