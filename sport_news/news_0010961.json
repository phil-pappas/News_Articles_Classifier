They were seeking support for the BFI president Govindraj stating that the \"Institutional situation remains extremely fragile and are subject to unacceptable pressures that hinder the proper development of sport in your country\", secretary general of Fiba Patrick Bauman stated in his letter dated October 6.\nThe world body was particularly worried that players were being forced to involve in the fight. \"While it is not unusual for the officials within the sports political sphere to have disagreements, Fiba cannot accept that players who have nothing to do with political matters and personal argument be held hostage and being prevented from representing their country from major international competitions.\"\nFiba showed their concern for this particular attitude by the rival group headed by Poonam Mahajan and Roopam Sharma who were allegedly issuing threats. In fact, in the absence of sports ministry's recognition players who were picked under the sports quota were not allowed by their employers. In august Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) wrote to the BFI secretary, \"SSCB being a government organization, it is essential to be affiliated to the federation duly recognized by the sports ministry. The services sportspersons also need to participate in tournaments conducted only by federation that is recognized by the MOYAS.\"\nThe world body also issued a diktat stating that all forms of threats need to be weeded out. \"Any State association or public service companies which decide to join the BFI, shall not be prevented and any player should be encouraged to participate in the competition organized by the BFI and the Fiba.\"\nBaumann's letter further added, \"Just a few days ago your national team reached the quarterfinals of Fiba Asia event after a 12-year gap. However, key players were not allowed to take part in this championship due to various threats allegedly motivated by the absence of BFI recognition by your ministry.\"\nSeeking support for the Govindraj group the Fiba wrote, \"Fiba is therefore of the firm opinion that this matter cannot continue any longer and we would respectfully request your ministry to act without delay in the interest of the athletes, coaches, clubs, parents, sponsors and fans who invest considerable time and resources in our sport, by granting, without delay, the necessary recognition to the BFI presided by Mr Govindraj and recognized by Fiba.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:53:23.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
