Clark felt the pressure early in the season. \n“In August, there was a lot of nerves,” Clark said. “I was very nervous for the first few games. But I got settled into the offense, my teammates helped me out and my coaches helped me out. My guys have my back.” \nThe Golden Bears have had Clark’s back and Clark, in turn, has more than held his own. While Tille was asked to run the ball more than Clark has, the 6-foot, 200-pound Clark’s early returns match up favorably with that of his predecessor. \nCompared to Tille’s first six games last season. Clark has thrown for 1,426 yards, just 110 shy of Tille’s 1,536 yards. Clark’s 75 completions have come on 129 attempts, while Tille had 36 more passes and only nine additional completions. Clark has an extra touchdown (21) than Tille had with the same five interceptions. Clark, however, has completed 58 percent of passes compared to Tille’s 51. \n“Matt did great for us the last four years,” Gibsonburg coach Steve Reser said. “I’m sure some of (Clark’s nerves) was living up to others’ expectations, but the biggest thing was how good did Ryan want to be? That’s a lot of it too. Any good athlete puts pressure on himself to perform. Ryan wanted to be the best he could be.” \nClark said one factor for his successful transition from linebacker last season to starting quarterback this year is the rapport between himself and his large crop of receivers. \nWith Kane Gomez (20 catches, 351 yards, five touchdowns), Erik Jahna (13/409/5 TD) and Marcus Tille (9/128/2 TD) leading the way, along with the rushing of running back Madison Jaso, Clark said his wide array of weapons has been vital to the Golden Bears’ fortunes. \n“Phenomenal. We have a lot of chemistry,” Clark said. “Every one of us are friends on the team, we get along, we hang out all the time, on and off the field. We know where we’re all going to be, we know how we need to throw it, we know how we need to catch it, what route we need to run, the timing, it’s all there because we’re all best friends.” \nClark has also led the Golden Bears to wins over Northwood, the only team to beat Gibsonburg last season, and defending league champion Tiffin Calvert. \nEven with all his early success, Clark’s teammates are quick to give him a friendly reminder of whose shadow still looms over his position. \n“I still get a little crap from these guys, they say I’ll always be behind him,” Clark said with a laugh. “No matter what, I’ll always be behind Matt Tille.” Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1Ruof2O TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:30:19.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
