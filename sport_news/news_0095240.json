The CN Tower in Toronto is lit in blue lights, and a famous coffee chain is selling Blue Jays doughnuts.\nSo why couldn’t a little town on Fogo Island change its name to honor the team’s biggest star, Jose Bautista — a.k.a. Joey Bats.\nPerhaps the island residents who watched Game 5 of the American League division series saw the dramatic pose that Bautista struck after hitting a mammoth three-run home run. He chucked his bat defiantly toward the Texas Rangers’ dugout, his left arm remaining shoulder high, parallel to the ground and curved like the cove that defines the shape of this town.\nThe name could also refer to Joey Bats’s cannon of a throwing arm that he unleashes from right field.\nPhoto Lobster traps on Fogo Island.

Draw up the papers, a quick proclamation at Town Hall and voilà: Joe Batt’s Arm.\nWho would notice in a country with towns named Saskatoon, Stoner, Skookumchuk and St. Louis du Ha! Ha!\nThere is only one problem.\n“It’s not named for him,” said Edmund Decker, a 72-year-old retiree and former fisherman who was born on Fogo Island. “The name is over 200 years old. But Bautista is a great player. Wouldn’t it be nice if the boy’s from home.”\n“The boy,” in Newfoundlandese, is pronounced “buy” and is a common refrain used to describe a male of virtually any age.\nSo, no, Joe Batt’s Arm is not named for Joey Bats and his bat-wielding or fireballing arm.\nPhoto Cod left out to dry in Joe Batt's Arm, Newfoundland, Canada. Cod was once so plentiful there that fishermen could stand on shore and scoop the fish up in nets.

Imagine a town in upstate New York called Joltin’ Joe’s Leg, or a Vermont town called Big Papi’s Fist.\nBut if Joe Batt’s Arm it is not named after Bautista and his mighty arm, then where did the name come from? On the eve of Game 6 of the Championship Series, with the Blue Jays on the brink of elimination against the Kansas City Royals, we had to know.\n“You’ll never find out the true story of Joe Batt’s Arm,” claimed Dennis Adams, a 74-year-old retired fisherman. “I’ve been trying for the last 74 years, and I haven’t found out yet.”\nThe most accepted version of the story involves a poor, wretched sailor named Joe Batt, who was said to have served aboard ship for one of the most famous seafarers, Captain James Cook, in the mid-18th century.\nWhen Cook was charting Newfoundland, Batt was somehow jettisoned overboard — whether tossed or jumped as a deserter is in dispute. Batt ended up on Fogo Island and was said to be very popular with the locals.\nPhoto Benedict Adams of Joe Batt's Arm said he was descended from scalawags and thieves on the run from British authorities. Credit Ian Willms for The New York Times But Joe Batt, unlike Joey Bats, was poor and shoeless. He stole some shoes, was arrested and sentenced to 15 lashes. But the townfolk liked him so much they stormed the magistrate’s office and rescued him. They all went off happily together to the nearby cove with a shoreline shaped like the arm of a person drinking a pint of lager, known in these parts as an arm, and they named it after Joe.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story It is unknown how long Batt remained there, or if he ever threw anyone out at third base.\nJoe Batt’s Arm is said to have been settled in 1685. The early settlers were joined by others from the West and North of England and many Irish. Most islanders seem to have inherited distinct characteristics of certain Irish accents, including pronouncing “th” as “t” and pronouncing words like “decided” as “duh-soyded.”\nAnd of course, “The buys.”\nAdams and his brother, Benedict, said they were descendants of scalawags and thieves on the run from British authorities. The brothers discussed many aspects of the history and culture of Joe Batt’s Arm while at their house along the arm (or inlet). A medium-sized fishing vessel, full of holes, sat on stilts nearby.\n“That’s where we caught all our fish over the years,” Dennis Adams said.\nPhoto The baseball diamond on Joe Batt's Arm, not far from Seldom, Little Seldom and Seldom Come By. Credit Ian Willms for The New York Times They offered two passers-by pieces of potent salt cod drying on racks next to the building, just down the road from the Fogo Island fish plant and co-op, and demonstrated how they cure it. Cod was once so plentiful, Benedict Adams said, that they could stand on shore and scoop them up in nets. Today there are restrictions.\n“We’re allowed to catch five pieces a day for five days,” Dennis said. “But we’re not allowed to wait one day and catch 25. You figure it out.”\nBenedict Adams said that today the boats haul a lot of mackerel, shrimp and Atlantic Snow Crab.\nIn addition to the abundant fishing, Joe Batt’s arm is also the home of the recently built Fogo Island Inn, a modern, environmentally friendly luxury hotel with a stunning view of the North Atlantic that is dotted by icebergs in the spring. The hotel and the island are accessible by ferry, like the workhorse, M.V. Capt. Earl W. Winsor, or by helicopter.\nJoe Batt’s Arm is not the only unconventional named town on Fogo. South of Joe Batt’s Arm is Seldom, and next to that is Little Seldom and then Seldom Come By. Next to Fogo Island is Change Island, (no, it was not originally called Changeup Island).\nThere are also many towns in other parts of Newfoundland with similar names: Cobbs Arm, Aaron Arm, Goose Arm and Coney Arm.\nOn New World Island just west of Fogo Island, there is Too Good Arm. It just has to be named after the Mets pitching staff.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-3/25batts-3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-4/25batts-4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-5/25batts-5-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-2/25batts-2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-4/25batts-4-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-2/25batts-2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-3/25batts-3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/25batts-5/25batts-5-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:06:21.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
