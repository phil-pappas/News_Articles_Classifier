The Taxi and Limousine Commission wants to speak with a New Jersey woman who says she had to jump out of a moving taxi she caught in Midtown because she feared she was being abducted.\nIn a Facebook post detailing her harrowing trip early Saturday, 29-year-old Yinan Xia of Jersey City said she bolted from the yellow taxi at an EZ Pass toll near Newark Airport, about 10 miles away from her home south of the Lincoln Tunnel.\nWith the driver ignoring her directions, the woman tracked the car’s progress on her phone’s GPS, tipping her off she was being taken for a ride.\n“I watched in terror as my GPS showed our location from one highway to another highway with hardly any cars on the road and further away from my intended destination,” Xia wrote.\nXia said her training from New York Asian Women’s Center— where she volunteers—kicked in and helped her stay calm.\nNYC TAXI DRIVER MAY LOSE LICENSE OVER CLAIM OF SEXUALLY HARASSING DRUNKEN PASSENGER\n“(It) helped me quickly identify what was actually happening: I was being transported, against my will, to an unknown location,” she said.\nXia said she split a cab with a friend in Midtown after a fundraising event, where she said in a Facebook comment she downed two vodka and orange juice cocktails. Once the friend got out the driver offered to take Xia to Jersey City for a flat $40 fare.\nTired, she agreed and the cabbie shut the meter off, according to her post.\nFacebook A Google map posted shows the route the taxi made. Around 2:30 a.m., when the driver reached the toll on I-78, she opened the door, startling the driver and causing him to slow down, she wrote. She then leapt from the still-moving vehicle.\nXia said she ran to staff and asked for help.\nCABBIE SAID HE BEAT PASSENGER TO DEATH BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T PAY FARE AND 'CURSED' HIS MOTHER, COURT DOCS SHOW\n“Despite what most may think was a dangerous decision, I knew it was even more dangerous to stay quiet inside the car,” she wrote.\nThe taxi driver tried to get her back in but staff at the toll brought her to police, she said.\nPolice got the call for a “patron dispute” from the taxi driver, who told a trooper that Xia argued with him about directions and asked him to pull over so she could bail out of the fare, according to New Jersey State Police Captain Stephen Jones, who said the matter was closed.\nTLC spokesman Allan Fromberg said that staff is trying to reach Xia to get her account and additional details to start its own investigation.\nThe agency has already reached out to police in New Jersey and New York, Fromberg said.\ndrivoli@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Man pummeled by taxi driver dies: police NY cabbie accused of sexually harassing drunken passenger Uber driver strikes woman, 4 kids on Bronx sidewalk TLC overvalued cab medallion as Uber bites into market: suit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:41:59.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
