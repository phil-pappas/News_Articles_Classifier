Flyhalf Theuns Kotze converted his own late try to claim all of Namibia's points. \n\"We were nearly done over, but we won in the end,\" Georgia lock Giorgi Nemsadze said. \n\"It's been four months that we've been working enormously hard for this, and it's finally paid off. We were disorganized and we didn't start the match well. But after the start of the second half we found our feet.\" \nThe bonus point gleaned from the narrow defeat gave Namibia its first ever in World Cup rugby. \n\"I am immensely proud,\" Namibia coach Phil Davies said. \"It was a magnificent performance to win a first point in a World Cup and we couldn't have been closer to a win.\" \nNamibia led at halftime thanks to Kotze's two penalties, but it was also in large part due to Georgian sloppiness. They did most of the early attacking at Exeter's Sandy Park, with left winger Alexandre Todua having a try disallowed for an earlier knock-on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:24:14.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
