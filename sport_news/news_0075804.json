The Bobcats finished \n19-5 in the regular season and third in conference playoffs. \nAlso gone are middles Brendan White and Frank Jones and left side Sam Tuivai. \nCoach Grant Wilson said Wednesday that they will be missed. \n“It’s an adjustment with losing four key guys from our lineup, Sebastian obviously being one of them,” Wilson said. “We have some pretty big shoes to fill.” \nThe Bobcats have their largest incoming class of recruits in Wilson’s four years on the job, with one older college athlete and six high school players who all made their provincial teams this summer rounding out the team’s 14-man roster. \nMatt Powell, a six-foot-seven outside attacker who came from Keyano College in Fort McMurray, Alta., will start at right side. \nHe won’t be the only newcomer in the starting six, with Mason Metcalf of Carman one of two starters in the middle. \n“He kind of came in under the radar,” Wilson said of Metcalf, who came to BU without as much club and provincial-level experience of many of his peers. “He’s come in and won the right to be a starter in the middle for us by working real hard and adjusting to things here with us. We’re real pleased with his progress here to date.” \nSetter Reece Dixon of Edmonton, left side Seth Friesen of Brandon, libero Bryton Such of Calgary and outside hitter Jon Bartel of Winnipeg will also see action. \nChase Warkentin of Gladstone and third-year Liam Matheson of New Zealand will likely redshirt this season. \n“We just feel that there’s a real good core there that we can build on for the next four or five years,” Wilson said. “I’m definitely looking forward to seeing those guys develop.” \nThe team opens its 24-match regular season against perennial Canada West powerhouse Trinity Western University on Friday evening at 7:45 at the Healthy Living Centre, with Saturday’s match scheduled for 6:45 p.m. \nAlong with Powell and Metcalf, the starting six will be comprised of fifth-year setter David Stasica, second-year middle James Weir, fourth-year left side Roy Ching and second-year left side Brady Nault. Fourth-year libero Jeremy Davies is an emotional sparkplug who, along with Ching, will serve as a team captain. \n“I like to think that we’re going to try to be better defensively,” Wilson said. “We’re not going to be able to put up as big of a block so we’re going to have to rely on our backcourt defence digging some balls and being real active.” \nWilson said that third-year left side Joel Makara is among the players who offer flexibility off the bench, while second-year middle Daven Pascal has been injured in the pre-season but can also contribute. \n“We do have some options off the bench, we’re just maybe not as experienced or as deep that way as in the past,” Wilson said. “But we still have guys that I think we can count on to come in and make some good contributions.” \nIt won’t help the young Bobcats that the 13-team Canada West conference annually produces some of the top teams in the country. \nTrinity Western, which made it to the national final last season, comes in ranked third in Canadian Interuniversity Sport. Other favourites include the national champion, Alberta, which returns its entire lineup, and Manitoba, which also brings back its starters. \nWilson admitted that his team will have to battle hard to compete as they gel as a team. \n“It’s been a while since we’ve had to teach systems and go back and break things down,” Wilson said. \n“It’s taking a little bit longer in the pre-season than normal for sure. Hopefully it will be a quick adjustment phase here and guys can get on board right away.” \nNOTES: The Brandon University women, were 15th in voting for the pre-season national rankings, also meet a third-ranked Trinity Western program. Their match times are Friday at 6 p.m., and Saturday at 5 p.m. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com \n» Twitter: @PerryBergson \n@07 4 tab:<*t(61.5,2,\"1 \"81.5,2,\"1 \"97,2,\"1 \"107.5,2,\"1 \"114.663,2,\"1 \"129.744,2,\"1 \")><I>Roster for the 2015-16 Brandon University \nBobcats men’s volleyball team:<BI> \nPosition Ht.
