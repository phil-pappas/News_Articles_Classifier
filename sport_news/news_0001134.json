A shooter unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the North Carolina Central University campus, striking one student from behind as he scrambled for safety, a witness said.\nThe attacked followed what the witness described as an altercation between a group of his friends and the suspect, who briefly left, but returned with a pistol.\n“The guy reached for his pants and started shooting,” Kenneth White, a 19-year-old freshman from Brooklyn who attends NCCU, told the Daily News. “He shot one of my friends in the buttcheek and we went inside to take shelter.”\nThe “free firing” gunshots sparked an active shooter alert, locking down the Durham campus just before 11 p.m. Sunday. Police swarmed an unspecified area of the school, but were unable to apprehend the assailant.\nThe lockdown warning students to “seek shelter away from gunfire” was lifted by midnight.\nDurham police confirmed one person suffered non-life threatening injuries in the shooting, according to WNCN-TV .\nA call by the Daily News to NCCU officials was not immediately returned.\nThe victim’s friends carried him outside to a nearby bench where White helped flagged down the cops. The sight of officers armed with rifles, however, took the student aback.\n“We waved the cops to come to us instead of the shooter because we had someone down,” White said.\nHe claims the officers then detained the shooting victim and pulled his pants down outside a cruiser despite his wound.\n“They just put him in handcuffs without logical reason ... I don’t think a strip search should be done in public,” White added.\nWhite and his peers pleaded with officers to take the victim to a hospital, a confrontation captured in a video White later deleted in the face of negative feedback.\nOne social media user accused White of making NCCU look bad.\n“Many people are mad,” White said. “They don’t understand the struggle we went through to get our friend to that seat to make sure he was okay.”\nAn ambulance eventually took the unidentified victim to a local hospital, White said.\nnhensley@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://up.anv.bz/latest/anvload.html?key=eyJtIjoiTElOIiwicCI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJ2IjoiNjk5Mjk3IiwicGx1Z2lucyI6eyJkZnAiOnsiY2xpZW50U2lkZSI6eyJhZFRhZ1VybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9wdWJhZHMuZy5kb3VibGVjbGljay5uZXQvZ2FtcGFkL2Fkcz9zej0xeDEwMDAmaXU9LzU2NzgvbWcuV05DTi9uZXdzLXJhbGVpZ2gtZHVyaGFtLWZheWV0dGV2aWxsZS1ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS93bmNuLWxvY2FsLW5ld3MvZHVyaGFtLWNvdW50eS9hY3RpdmUtc2hvb3Rlci1hbmQtZ3VuZmlyZS1hdC1uY2N1LWNvbGxlZ2UtcG9saWNlLXNheS9kZXRhaWwmY2l1X3N6cz0zMDB4MjUwJmdkZnBfcmVxPTEmZW52PXZwJm91dHB1dD14bWxfdmFzdDImYWRfcnVsZT0xIn19LCJh", "http://wncn.com/2015/10/25/active-shooter-and-gunfire-at-nccu-college-police-say/"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:57:59.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
