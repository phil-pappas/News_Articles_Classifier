He must also serve three years of supervised release after leaving prison. \nHess had pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Lacey Act. The law criminalizes sales of animals protected under the Endangered Species Act. Black rhinos are classified as critically endangered. It's illegal to traffic their horns across state lines. \nHess has said he bought a pair of horns online from a seller in Oregon. He later shipped them back to Maquoketa and gave them to someone else in Iowa. \nHess owns Wildlife Pride Taxidermy and Decor in Maquoketa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:57:03.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
