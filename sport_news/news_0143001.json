Lots of lead changes, dropped catches (including a couple likely touchdowns) and otherwise big plays that never came to fruition. Both NUs let a TD grab or two slip through their fingers. In the end, it was the visiting Northwestern football team that made less miscues and executed more big plays to get the job done. Unranked Northwestern moves to 6-2 on the season; and in doing so clinched a berth in the 2015 postseason. After back-to-back 5-7 seasons, and therefore winters of discontent, Northwestern football Coach Pat Fitzgerald could certainly use a postseason that includes a nice holiday getaway and the fifteen extra practices. “Six is not destination, we didn’t talk about it camp as let’s get to six,” Fitzgerald said after the game. Obviously, we won’t know until December 7th where they’ll actually be headed, but with a final tally of 7-9 wins likely in the cards, you can put a whole host of destinations on the table (Outback, Holiday, Foster Farms, Heart of Dallas among the many possibilities) At first, Northwestern football again struggled today with the forward pass, as starting QB Clayton Thorson had a Bluto Blutarski like 0.0 passing yards in the first quarter. A lot of it was not his fault though, as again his receivers had cases of the dropsies. Thorson rebounded nicely though to finish with a respectable 13-28 passing for 177 yards, one touchdown, but most importantly, no interceptions. While Thorson was mediocre throwing it, he was truly phenomenal running it today. (Denard Robinson version 2.0 maybe? Possibly?) “He made some huge plays with his legs,” said Pat Fitzgerald. “And then he settled down, and took what the defense gave him. I think he saw things a lot cleaner after the first quarter.” Thorson ran 9 times for 126 yards, including a 68 yard touchdown scramble. “They’ve been through so many hard fought games, gut-wrenchers and they probably feel the same way today afterward,” Fitzgerald said of his now vanquished opponent. Three of Nebraska’s five losses have come in the final ten seconds, or in over times. In the first year under new Coach Mike Riley, Nebraska has lost an FBS leading four games this season in which they led in the fourth quarter. That’s one more than in seven combined seasons under Bo Pelini. Paul M. Banks owns, operates and sometimes writes The Sports Bank.net , which is partnered with FOX Sports Engage Network.
