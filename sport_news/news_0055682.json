He is only their second 30/20 player (Brady Anderson in 1996).\n\"It's something Manny should be very proud of, and we're proud of him,\" manager Buck Showalter said. \"You can see why so few people have been able to do it.\"\nMachado reached the 20-homer mark long ago this season, and figured the time was right for him to fulfill the other part of the 20/20 equation.\n\"I was just trying to get it over with,\" he said. \"Not too worried about it. Basically go out there and put myself in a good scoring position and get it out of the way.\"\nMachado's first homer helped the Orioles take a quick 3-0 lead against Drew Hutchison (13-5), but the second inning didn't start until after a rain delay of 3 hours, 25 minutes.\nThe game was originally slated to begin at 7:05 p.m. but was moved up to 12:05 because of the threat of rain at night. As it turned out, the rain started early in the day and didn't let up until around 4 o'clock.\nAttendance was announced at 18,257, but that was tickets sold. At the outset, there was only a smattering of fans, mostly because of the dismal weather, the switch of the starting time and the Orioles' late-season fade.\nAfter the lengthy delay, only a few hundred fans remained.\nBaltimore's victory came against a collection of backups. After Toronto clinched the AL East crown in the opener of a doubleheader Wednesday, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons fielded a starting unit consisting entirely of reserves in the nightcap.\nHe posted a similar lineup Thursday, in part because the Blue Jays had celebrated their division crown with champagne, beer and cigars late into the night.\nAlthough the Blue Jays are still dueling with Kansas City for the best record in the AL — a distinction that provides home-field advantage through the postseason — Gibbons has to balance that objective with the need to keep his players fresh.\nThe Blue Jays started the day with 92 wins, one more than the Royals.\n\"We want to win home field,\" Gibbons said. \"We had a doubleheader yesterday, and we've been going at it hard all year. It made perfect sense not to play (in the) doubleheader after you clinch. Then, coming back and playing an early game today would be like no day off at all for them.\n\"My job is to take care of these guys. Yes, we'd love to win it but I've got to do what's best for these guys — not what some bozo out there in fantasy land thinks.\"\nToronto ace David Price was scratched from his scheduled start. Slugging stars Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion also sat out.\nIt became apparent early that the Blue Jays were going to experience a figurative hangover from their big day. Hutchison gave up a one-out single in the first inning and Machado followed with a home run to center.\nChris Davis and Steve Pearce then sandwiched doubles around a hit batter for a 3-0 lead.\nNot long after that, the game was halted. Neither starting pitcher returned.\nT.J. McFarland (1-2) took over for Tyler Wright and pitched four innings to earn his first win since July 27, 2014.\nZach Britton worked the ninth for his 35th save.\nEzequiel Carrera drove in two runs and Dalton Pompey had three hits for the Blue Jays, who won the season series 11-8.\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nBlue Jays: SS Troy Tulowitzki (shoulder, back) could return Friday night \"or definitely Saturday,\" Gibbons said.\nOrioles: 2B Jonathan Schoop bruised his right hand after being struck by a pitch from Hutchison.\nON DECK\nBlue Jays: Toronto needs to win two of three in Tampa Bay to finish with a winning record on the road.\nOrioles: The Orioles finish the season with a three-game series at home against the Yankees beginning Friday night, although Hurricane Joaquin could shuffle that schedule.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
