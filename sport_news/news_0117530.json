Ornelas / Express-News Image 11 of 11 Is Kawhi Leonard really the NBA's best defender? 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Kawhi Leonard can do things few on this planet can.\nFor the hoops layman, watching a specific player on defense can be an exercise in tedium, but Leonard is one of the few who can unite statheads and casual observers, who can draw eyes both when he has the ball and when he's guarding it.\nLike a condor at full width, ball handlers are enveloped by his wings. Guards and bigs alike are baited into believing a play is safe, but with Leonard lurking, the only safety is off the court.\nHe doesn't fear Kevin Durant or Carmelo Anthony or anything prolific scorer, regardless of shape or size.\nHe's one of the few that doesn't quake or search for help when he finds himself in isolation with the King.\nLeonard is the reigning Defensive Player of the Year. Twenty-seven percent of NBA general managers named him the league's best defensive player in their annual survey . Forty-four percent named him the best perimeter defender.\nIn both categories, he ranks No. 1.\nAbove Anthony Davis and Draymond Green and LeBron James and hundreds of others.\nBut when someone ascends to the top of the mountain, particularly a mountain of this lofty height, the whispers blow in on the wind: are they worthy?\nTo help bring patently silly basketball conversations into the 21st century, NBA.com provides us with its own mountain of data, which can help us determine if Kawhi belongs atop his.\nLooking strictly at the 2014-2015 season in comparison to his peers, we should be able to tell if his anointment was just or not.\nLeonard led the league with 2.3 steals per game, just the third forward to do so in the past 20 seasons.\nIt's a stat that can be inflated by risk-takers and gamblers, though he's neither of those things. It's also more important than you know, but we'll return to that.\nOpponents averaged 9.2 shots per game on Leonard. He held them to 44.2 percent shooting , 0.4 percent less than their regular season average, which is good, but lags behind Tony Allen, Draymond Green and Anthony Davis, all of whom are under 40 percent.\nLeonard held opponents to 48.9 percent shooting at the rim on 2.8 attempts per game — for comparison, Green held opponents to 46.9 percent on 6.1 attempts, LeBron 49.3 percent on 2.1 attempts.\nAllen rarely finds himself on a bigger forward unless on a switch, and Davis typically sticks to other power forwards and centers, but he is capable of handling guards and wings on a switches, which is a terrifying prospect given his immensity.\nJames, especially on those trap-happy Heat teams, was an elite defender, but no longer. He rarely guards the opposing team's primary option anymore and has proven more lethargic on that end of the court in recent seasons.\nA more apt contemporary is Green, who slides all over the court depending on matchups, but deals with similar challenges to Leonard. Green actually does a much better job of holding his opponents to a lower field goal percentage than Leonard, according to the NBA's tracking data.\nLeonard loses the defensive rating battle, too, though just barely.\nWith Green on the court, the Warriors gave up 96 points per 100 possessions, third in the league behind Allen and his teammate Andrew Bogut.\nLeonard doesn't trail much: the Spurs gave up 97.1 per 100 with the reigning DPOY on the court, the league's ninth-best mark.\nBut there are some things stats simply can't measure, no matter how many advanced cameras encircle a court.\nLeonard's ball-denial is menacing. One of the reasons Green and Davis give up 14 shots per game, opposed to Leonard's 9, is that Kawhi smothers his man, making escape exhausting.\nThere's no reprieve when Leonard is locked on, no plays off and no breathers, unless you decide to take yourself out of the game directly.\nHe deftly navigates screens, avoiding the massive icebergs and sticking to his man's hip at all times; this is critical on player's like Durant, Anthony or Steph Curry, who can hoist shots in a blink.\nHe's also a master of the poke.\nNo, not the creepy Facebook poke — the ball-poke.\nLeonard's hands — seemingly equal in size to an Alaskan King Crab — find a way of reaching any ball, regardless of the handler's position.\nNot every jab turns into a steal, but it disrupts the offensive flow and drains precious seconds off the clock. A loose ball fluttering into the backcourt, killing time, is nearly as critical as a steal, though it sadly has no place on a stat sheet.\nBut when the pokes and prods do turn into steals — here's where Leonard's camp gains a powerful ally.\nLeonard played in 64 regular season games last year. He recorded at least one steal in all but five, and two or more in 37.\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight's Benjamin Morris , a steal is the most valuable play in basketball.\n\"Think about all that occurs in a basketball game — no matter who is playing, there will be plenty of points, rebounds and assists to go around,\" Morris wrote in 2014.\n\"But some things only happen because somebody makes them happen. If you replaced a player with someone less skilled at that particular thing, it wouldn't just go to somebody else. It wouldn't occur at all. Steals are disproportionately those kinds of things.\"\nBy Morris' metric, a steal is equivalent to 9.1 points.\nGoing off that analysis, Leonard's 2.3 steals were worth 20.7 points each night.\nCombine that with his blocks, worth 6.1 points according to Morris' readjusted statistical values, and Leonard's defense is worth 25.81 points per game.\nGreen is nearly his equal at 22.49 points, but they both pale in comparison to Davis, whose 2.9 blocks and 1.5 steals equate to 31.34 points per game.\nThen, does Davis dethrone Leonard atop the mountain?\nIt'd be difficult to argue against it, but the truth is, the argument for best defensive player is a flawed one.\nEven though the stats can fill out their own AP math book, it remains difficult to fairly compare the impact of Leonard vs. DeAndre Jordan, or Allen vs. Davis.\nLast year, the voters told us Leonard was the best defender in the NBA.\nBut Green received the most first-place votes, and Jordan received just four less than Leonard.\nThis statistical discourse could continue indefinitely, but there's a certain point when it seems prudent to close the box scores and open your eyes.\nLeonard is the best wing defender since Ron Artest before the Malace, and he'll spend his career chasing Scottie Pippen for the title of greatest wing defender.\nYour eyes can tell you that Kawhi Leonard can do things few on this planet can — and they can tell you that he's best defender in the NBA.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/70/42/5998781/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/30/61/6392943/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/02/66/7875975/31/920x920.jpg", "http://www.nba.com/news/features/john_schuhmann/nba-com-2015-16-gm-survey/", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/73/22/7320730/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://vine.co/v/OYulXrXgZuM/embed/simple", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/02/66/7875975/31/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/00/33/7866069/19/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ap5wg-jZo00", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870188/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/30/61/6392943/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870184/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870185/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/73/22/7320730/3/920x920.jpg", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870188/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hidden-value-of-the-nba-steal/", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/70/42/5998781/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870186/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/00/33/7866069/19/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870185/3/920x920.jpg", "http://stats.nba.com/league/player/defense/#!/?sort=D_FG_PCT&dir=-1&CF=G*GE*58&Season=2014-15&SeasonType=Regular%20Season", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870189/3/920x920.jpg", "http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&dir=-1&Season=2014-15&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=GP*GE*58%7CMIN*GE*20", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870184/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870189/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/36/01/33/7870186/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:36:53.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
