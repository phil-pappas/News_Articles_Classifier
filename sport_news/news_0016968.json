CANADIENS 3, RANGERS 0\nMONTREAL - The Rangers boasted an otherworldly Henrik Lundqvist on Thursday night, but the Montreal Canadiens had Hart - as in goaltender Carey Price, the reigning Hart Trophy winner and NHL MVP - to thwart a visitors' comeback.\nPrice (25 saves) made five tough saves on a Blueshirts two-man advantage late in the second period, followed by a stretching glove save across crease on Rick Nash shortly after, to send the Bell Centre into bedlam in disappointing but entertaining 3-0 Rangers loss to the undefeated Canadiens.\nHe also dumped Rangers forward Chris Kreider behind Montreal's net in the early third period, as clear payback for Kreider's Game 1 crease-crash that knocked Price out of the 2014 Eastern Conference finals, which the Blueshirts won in six games.\nThursday, the Rangers (3-2-0) were lucky to be down just one goal in their second straight defeat. They only had a chance to tie thanks to Lundqvist (29 saves), who was magnificent for the fourth time in his five starts.\nMontreal forward Tomas Fleischmann beat him short side for the game-winning goal at 8:46 of the second period, after Ryan McDonagh blocked a David Desharnais shot near the low left circle. An Emerson Etem pass into the skates of Jesper Fast - in Etem's season debut replacing a scratched Jarret Stoll - had caused a turnover before the goal.\nEric Bolte/USA Today Sports Henrik Lundqvist puts in a valiant effort in a losing performance for the Rangers. Former Ranger Dale Weise got Montreal's second at 17:55 of the third, walking in alone at the right circle and shooting five-hole. And the Habs added a late empty-netter.\nBut Lundqvist had kept the game scoreless by stopping four Canadiens' odd-man rushes in the first period alone from Max Pacioretty, Lars Eller, Alex Galchenyuk and Brendan Gallagher. Shots on goal were only 9-7 in favor of Montreal after 20 minutes, but the Habs' scoring chances were far and away superior.\nWhile shots remained relatively even, the Habs had the better quality looks most of the game - like Desharnais' point-blank shot in front that Lundqvist somehow gloved at 8:47 of the third, or Devante Smith-Pelly's mid-air deflection off the rush at 16:28 that he caught with the mitt, as well.\nThe Rangers failed to score the equalizer, but they persisted and challenged and charged, and any fan who paid for a ticket to Montreal's home opener got way more than their money's worth of quality and exciting hockey.\nCoach Alain Vigneault, who is searching hard for a consistent lineup, also put veteran defenseman Dan Boyle back in the lineup after his first healthy scratch as a Ranger on Tuesday. Boyle was better about playing the Rangers' system but still had a so-so game, as did Keith Yandle, who must start capitalizing on the large amount of ice time he's seeing for this team.\nMinas Panagiotakis/Getty Images Rick Nash gets sandwiched by Andrei Markov (l.) and goaltender Carey Price. Vigneault switched his lines in the third period, reuniting Rick Nash, Derek Stepan and Chris Kreider, moving J.T. Miller onto Derick Brassard's line, and switching Kevin Hayes off the wing back to the middle, sliding Oscar Lindberg over. But it didn't create more offense. The Rangers also had 16 shots miss Price's net.\nThe penalty kill bounced back to go a perfect 5-for-5 after allowing two goals on five Winnipeg power plays in Tuesday night's 4-1 home loss to the Jets. Dominic Moore was a major reason why, as was the return of forwards Derek Stepan and Rick Nash to the shorthanded rotation and Fast's return after two healthy scratches in place of Tanner Glass.\nThe Blueshirts' power play, however, continued its early slide, going 0-for-5 to fall to 1-for-14 on the season.\nThe Canadiens improved to 5-0-0 for the first time in their 98-season franchise history. The three previous times they opened with four straight wins, Montreal won the Stanley Cup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:08:32.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
