Williams believes it was the best game he has had in his young NFL career, and he credited his performance to a \"small talk\" with coach Todd Bowles leading up to that game.\nBowles \"was just telling me just to play free and let loose and don’t think as much,\" recalled Williams, the sixth overall pick in this year’s NFL Draft. \"He said he felt I was just thinking a lot in the first few games. I took to the coaching and went out there and played like it was fun again and basically I had a great game.\"\nBack to work \nThe Jets practiced for the first time in the United States since Oct. 1, the day they left for London to play the Dolphins. Bowles indicated he chose not to have the team practice at all during the bye week because several players were nursing injuries, and because of the international travel.\nDefensive end Muhammad Wilkerson was limited because of sore ribs, but the injury isn’t believed to be serious. Safety Calvin Pryor, who injured his knee against the Dolphins, practiced in full.\nLinebacker David Harris (quadriceps), right guard Willie Colon (knee) and running back Bilal Powell (quadriceps) all sat out. Cornerback Marcus Williams suffered a knee injury. Tight end Jeff Cumberland, who didn’t play against Miami because of a concussion, wore a red no-contact jersey during practice.\nRoster move \nThe Jets waived undrafted rookie tight end Wes Saxton to make room for reinstated defensive end Sheldon Richardson. Saxton made his NFL debut in the Jets’ win over Miami.\n— J.P.
