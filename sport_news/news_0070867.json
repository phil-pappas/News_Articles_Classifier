This contest could be huge for both schools as playoff implications are looming. \nFor Stone, it’s clear that the Panthers are going to cruise into the playoffs after starting off 8-0 on the season. However, CCHS can easily play the role of spoiler in Friday night’s contest. Stone Memorial are dead set on hosting a state playoff game in 2015, but CCHS can significantly damage the Panthers chance of hosting a game come playoff time with an upset. \nCoach Mark Wattenbarger is going to have to have his team focused on this one. Just like with the homecoming game, emotions can run high in a rivalry game of this caliber, and that can lead to mistakes, miscues and turnovers. CCHS have dropped their last two games but the Panthers do not need to overlook them. Just ask the Ole Miss Rebels how it turned out for them when they overlooked the Memphis Tigers last Saturday. \nFor CCHS, it’s been an up and down year. Coach Ken Johnson has clearly improved this squad, and it shows. However, the passing game just isn’t there at the moment and Tyler Howard and the offense are going to have to find it if they hope to have any chance of dethroning SMHS. That being said, CCHS have a chance to pull off a monumental upset Friday night, but they’ll have to play the best game they’ve played all year. \nThis game should be packed to the gills as far as attendance is concerned. The North v South championship football game earlier in the year had locals turning out in droves. SMHS has an 8-0 record to defend. Couple that along with a chance to host a home game during the playoffs? Attending this game should be a no-brainer for fans along the Cumberland Plateau. The Jets have a ton of support themselves, and their playoff hopes are not completely shot as of this writing. However, they must defeat Stone Memorial if they hope to have any chance at the postseason. The pressure is on. \nPanthers coach Mark Wattenbarger on the matchup: \n“I’m proud for our guys and the position they have put themselves in so far this season. This is a big game for both of us as far as playoffs are concerned. We are in and are trying to improve our seeding. They are more than likely in and for sure will be in with one more win and can improve their seeding as well. If we play like we did a few weeks ago we’ll be in for a long night. If we play like we did against Sequoyah then we will give ourselves a chance. They force teams into a lot of mistakes and have stayed away from making them! That’s a good formula for success. We have to hold onto the ball and hopefully make a few plays, and force them into some mistakes and limit their big plays. I expect a great atmosphere and a great football game.” \nJets coach Ken Johnson on the contest: \n“This is one of those rocking chair games. It’s the one that these kids, especially the seniors, will talk about when they get older and are sitting in there rocking chairs. This game is a rivalry; however, the more important thing is the playoff implications. Our kids as well as theirs are well aware of the importance of this game. We got to have a great week of practice and remain focused.” \nUpdate from Stone Memorial: \nKickoff for Friday night’s rivalry game between CCHS and Stone Memorial is set for 7 p.m. Those that plan on attending are asked to come early due to larger crowd expectations. Tickets will be sold prior to the game for $5 each at the ECO travel plaza. Fans are encouraged to take Cook Rd. to the game as opposed to crossing the interstate at Exit 320 due to construction.
