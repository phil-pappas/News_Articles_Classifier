Lehtonen made his season debut after backing up Antti Niemi in the first two games. \nThe Stars had 52 shots, their most since Feb. 3, 1990, in a 7-6 loss to Philadelphia. Spezza finished off the hat trick with an empty-net goal. \nMcDavid, selected No. 1 overall in the June draft, scored in the second period to pull the Oilers even at 2 after they had fallen behind 2-0. \nAnders Nilsson made 48 saves in his first appearance for Edmonton, but he couldn't stop Spezza when the Dallas forward took a dump-off pass from Antoine Roussel in the slot. \nMcDavid almost scored Edmonton's first goal when he appeared to tip a shot by defenceman Oscar Klefbom, who got credit for the goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:42:42.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
