Eight-player squads don't compete and can't compare with crowds at bigger schools, but six unbeaten teams squared off in Week 7 and played fantastic football. \nAnd Chariton isn't likely to compete for the Class 3A title this season, but every fan in attendance on Friday will remember a certain star receiver setting an Iowa all-time mark against Knoxville. \nThere's too much to talk about from Week 7, so let's Take Five. \nEverybody wants to win \nDes Moines North is a winner. Finally. \n\"These kids have never enjoyed this,\" said North's second-year coach, Sean Quinlan. \"It's been tough.\" \nA 30-game losing streak — dating back to a 22-21 win over Hoover on Sept. 7, 2012 — was snapped on Friday with a 21-17 win over an emotionally crushed Des Moines Roosevelt. \nThe Polar Bears (1-6, 1-2) entered the winless matchup having tremendous strides made from last season, and they were rewarded with a midfield celebration that lasted long after Drake Stadium was empty. Roosevelt (0-7, 0-3) led 17-7 at halftime, but gave up a pair of rushing touchdowns in the third quarter of a penalty- and fumble-riddled game. \n\"Last year, they beat us 51-0. Is that improvement?\" Quinlan said. \n\"These young men have not quit. They started in January. Most importantly, they're going to be better men five, 10, 15 years from now. I'm trying to teach the lessons of life on the football field.\" \nSenior Noah Lane ran in a 65-yard touchdown for North on the first play of the game. Brad Warren, the team's top tackler for the past three seasons, rushed in the second to make the game 17-14. Lane had the go-ahead score, which sent an already struggling Roughrider sideline into a tailspin. \n\"We got down, but we had to keep it going,\" Lane said. \"They beat us 51-0 last year and didn't really even care about it, so we had a lot of motivation.\" \nRoosevelt is left searching for its first win with just two weeks remaining. North won't become a playoff team, but that was never the point. \nThe Polar Bears got a win. Carter Isley helps Albia stay dominant in Class 2A \nDowling's prepped for playoffs \nThe two-time defending champions weren't ranked No. 1 in Class 4A until they beat rival Valley in Week 4. Consider any remaining question marks answered. \nThe Maroons (6-0, 3-0) hammered No. 7 Johnston on Friday night 35-15 , their third straight district win against a ranked, one-loss team. Long road trips to Council Bluffs Lewis Central and Sioux City East were handled swiftly with 24- and 38-point wins. The Dragons (5-2, 2-1) were the most physical of the three challengers and couldn't break through.
