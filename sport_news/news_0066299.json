Reese spent this past season as the Yankees director of pro scouting.\nSteve Martone, the manager of professional scouting, also could be in play. Michael Fishman, who heads the analytical operations, has an assistant GM title.\nWhile Cashman searches for Eppler’s replacement, decisions have to be made on manager Joe Girardi’s coaching staff. The contracts of bench coach Rob Thomson, first base coach Tony Pena, hitting coach Jeff Pentland expire at the end of the month. Pitching coach Larry Rothschild has another year left and bullpen coach Gary Tuck has an option that is his.\n“I haven’t even talked to Joe,’’ Cashman said of Girardi, who Friday said he hadn’t started to think about what the 2016 staff would look like.\nAs for Naehring and Darnell, they are integral parts of the Yankees’ scouting system. Naehring’s reports on Didi Gregorius when he was with the Diamondbacks were strong and encouraged the club to make the deal. Darnell routinely appears at games in which pitchers who might be moved at the July 31 trade deadline are working.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brian cashman ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:11:15.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
