The rugged winger was drafted by Chicago in 2004 and signed a $16 million, four-year deal after he played a crucial role in the Blackhawks' Stanley Cup title in 2013.\nThe 29-year-old Bickell says he wants to be a Blackhawks forever and it's up to him to show the team he can still play at a high level.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
