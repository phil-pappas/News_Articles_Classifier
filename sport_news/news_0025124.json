It was Kirk’s second appearance on the weekly honor roll for the Hornung Award, which is given annually to college football’s most versatile player. \nThe dynamic and versatile Kirk, from Scottsdale, Ariz., gained 212 all-purpose yards against the Crimson Tide. Kirk gave the Aggies their first touchdown of the game on a 68-yard punt return late in the second quarter, which made him the first Texas A&M player with two punt return TDs in a season since Aaron Glenn in 1993. Kirk also had a 79-yard TD return against Arizona State in the season-opener. \nIt was Kirk’s third 200-yard plus effort of the year and it pushed him over the 1,000-yard plateau in season all-purpose yards. Kirk reached the yardage plateau in his sixth game of the season, which matched the school’s fastest to 1,000 record originally set by “Lectric” Leeland McElroy in 1995. His 1,170 all-purpose yards already rank No. 7 on A&M’s freshman list. \nKirk ranks No. 2 in the SEC and No. 4 in the Football Bowl Subdivision with an average of 195.0 all-purpose yards per game. He is one of only two players in the FBS to have more than 200 yards in three of the four statistical categories – 609 receiving, 276 punt return and 252 kickoff return. Among players averaging more than 160 yards per game, Kirk’s 17.2 yards per touch is No. 1 nationally. \nKirk also leads the nation with a 25.1 punt return average and is tied for the national lead with two punt return scores. Kirk is on pace to shatter Glenn’s school record of 19.9 yards per punt return, which led the nation in 1993. \nComplete Hornung Award release: Honor Roll Selections Combine for More than 1,100 Offensive Yards and Nine TDs Three Players from Pac-12, one from ACC and SEC Comprise Week Seven List \nLouisville, Ky. – Monday, October 19, 2015 – Four offensive / special teams standouts and a cornerback who plays both sides of the ball combined for 1,154 all-purpose yards, nine touchdowns and touched the ball seven different ways – passing, rushing, receiving, punt return, kickoff return, tackle and forced fumble to earn the Paul Hornung Award Honor Roll exemplifying their versatility.

With the win, Pittsburgh remains in first place in the ACC Coastal division with a 3-0 conference record and 5-1 overall record. USC cornerback Adoree’ Jackson played on both sides of the ball in the Trojans’ 41-31 loss at Notre Dame. Jackson finished the game with 193 all-purpose yards – nine rush yards, 83 receiving yards and 101 kickoff returns yards. With 3:17 left in the second quarter, USC QB Cody Kessler hit Jackson with an inside screen and he bolted 83 yards to tie the game at 24. On defense, he had three tackles and one forced fumble. Jackson is second on the team averaging 118.0 all-purpose yards per game and has 14 tackles, one pass break-up, one pass deflection and one forced fumble on the season. Texas A&M true freshman wide receiver Christian Kirk amassed 212 all-purpose yards – the third 200-plus yard game of his six-game career – in a 41-23 loss to Alabama. Kirk had 11 rushing yards, caught seven passes for 90 yards, returned a kickoff 25 yards and returned four punts for 86 yards, including a dramatic 68-yard punt return for a touchdown in the second quarter. Kirk is currently ranked fourth in the FBS with 195.0 all-purpose yards per game, and his 1,170 all-purpose yards this season ranks seventh on the Aggies’ freshman single-season chart. Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey led the Cardinal to a 56-35 win over UCLA with 369 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns. McCaffrey set Stanford’s single-game rushing record with 243 yards on 25 carries and four touchdowns.
