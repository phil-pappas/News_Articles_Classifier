McCown will need to be as close to 100 percent as possible against the Broncos (5-0), who lead the league with 22 sacks and have forced 17 turnovers. \nMcCown shook his head and took a long pause when he was asked what makes Denver’s defense so dangerous. \n“We’re going to be here a while,” he said. “They’re really good.” \nNo NFL quarterback was as good this past week as McCown, who passed for 457 yards and two touchdowns in the Browns’ 33-30 win over the Ravens. The 36-year-old completed 36 of 51 passes, didn’t throw an interception and scored on a 10-yard run. It was his third straight game over 300 yards passing, a first for any Cleveland quarterback. \nHis solid play has given the Browns confidence and some rare momentum that they hope to keep rolling. \nWide receiver Brian Hartline said McCown is making things easier and everyone around him better. That’s what elite quarterbacks do, and that’s what McCown has been lately. \n“The biggest thing is that you’re not stressing,” Hartline said. “You just worry about doing your job and you’re just a piece of the puzzle. A lot of times you start pressing and trying to make plays because you haven’t yet or you’re picking up for somebody or whatever the case may be. You know that guy is going to do his job and I’m going to do mine.” \nMcCown has done his job at an unexpected level the past three weeks, passing for 1,154 yards with six TDs and just one interception. It’s more than the Browns (2-3) could have hoped for and McCown’s performance has quieted the drumbeat for backup Johnny Manziel. \nNOTES \nCB Joe Haden (concussion), LB Craig Robertson (ankle) and S Tashaun Gipson (ankle) did not practice. Gipson missed last week’s game, but is no longer wearing a protective boot. ... LB Scott Solomon (knee) was placed on injured reserve and the Browns claimed DB Don Jones from New Orleans.
