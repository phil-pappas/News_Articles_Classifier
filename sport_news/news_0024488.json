The 36-year-old Arnold most recently served as Tampa’s director of player personnel. \nStearns says Arnold has been involved in nearly every area of baseball operations during his career, including contract negotiation and farm system evaluation. Arnold’s resume also includes stops with the worked the Dodgers, Rangers and Reds. \nThe addition of Arnold is the latest step in an organization-wide youth movement following Milwaukee’s first 90-loss season since 2004. \nThe Brewers on Tuesday dismissed its farm director and reassigned longtime assistant GM Gord Ash, who both served under Stearns’ predecessor, Doug Melvin. \nArnold joins the Brewers after working with a small-market Rays organization known for developing young talent. His duties also covered the integration of science and biometrics into all levels of baseball operations. \n“Through hard work, curiosity, and creativity, I intend to work tirelessly with our talented group to bring a championship to Milwaukee,” Arnold said Wednesday.
