(AP) - The Astros have left veteran reliever Chad Qualls, part of their last playoff team in 2005, off their roster for their AL Division Series against the Kansas City Royals.\nQualls was on the 25-man roster for the Astros' wild-card game against the Yankees but did not pitch. The 36-year-old right-hander had a 4.38 ERA this season.\nThe only other noteworthy move made by manager A.J. Hinch was to include outfielder Preston Tucker, a left-handed bat who can handle the Royals' trio of right-handed starters. He replaced the more versatile Jonathan Villar, who would have given Houston an added element of speed.\nThe series begins Thursday night in Kansas City.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
