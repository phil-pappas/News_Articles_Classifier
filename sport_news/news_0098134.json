They’ve won that title every year since Lance Roweton has been the head coach. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS “The score ended up lopsided but really could have gone either way,” Roweton said of his team’s late surge. And it was a back-and-forth game until the fourth quarter for 7-1 Bolivar, ranked 10 th in the state in Class 4, and Reeds Spring, 8-0 and tied with Mtn. Grove for fourth in the state in Class 3. Bolivar moved 89 yards on its opening drive with Aaron Samek covering the final 32 for the first-of-four touchdowns he’d score on the night. He had 135 yards total rushing. But Bolivar also had a pair of first half turnovers including a pass intercepted by the Wolves Kelly Newton and returned to the Liberator 28 that set up Reeds Spring’s tying touchdown. Bolivar immediately responded with another TD drive with Case Jones taking it in from the five-yard-line to go ahead 14-7. But just 21-seconds before intermission, Reeds Spring tied it on a two-yard-pass from quarterback Nick Haddock to Shaun Baker and after the Liberators fumbled the second half kick-off, the Wolves cashed-in to go ahead 21-14. “We were struggling to hang on to the ball,” Roweton explained. “And you have to give credit to Reed because they hit us and caused some of those fumbles. We felt like if we held on to the ball we were a little more athletic and we’d be O.K. We didn’t take care of the ball for three-quarters of the game and almost got beat.” The Liberators pulled within 21-20 midway in the third quarter on a 10-yard run by Samek and an unsuccessful extra point. Reeds Spring responded with a five-yard TD pass from back-up quarterback J.P. Gardner to Baker after Haddock left the game briefly after being shaken-up. And after their extra-point was blocked, the Wolves led 27-20 early in the fourth quarter. Little did they know how the momentum was about to change in a big way as Bolivar was about to go on a 30-0 run. “It started with our defense making the big plays,” Bolivar quarterback Connor Sechler, who was 15-18 for 289 yards, said. “Then our offense put some drives together. We just kept on going at them and didn’t give up the entire time.” The changing of the guard began when Bolivar moved 75 yards with Case Jones going the final 10. But the extra-point was blocked, and the Liberators still trailed 27-26. After Reeds Spring had a three-and-out, it took just three plays for Bolivar to move 81-yards for the go-ahead touchdown with Samek weaving his way the final 32 to put the Liberators up 34-27 with 5:17 remaining. Just seven seconds after that score, on the first play from scrimmage following the kick-off from their own 24, the Wolves fumbled with the ball squirting 10-yards backwards and Bolivar’s Camden Burns scooping it up and taking it home for a 42-27 lead (the Liberators added a two-point conversion). And after yet another Reeds Spring turnover (an interception), Bolivar added its final touchdown on a 21-yard run by Samek (and another two-point conversion) for the 50-27 victory that really was not a true indication of how close the game was. “We knew coming into the game that it was going to be a real grind,” Roweton said. “Reeds Spring does a great job with their triple-option and they swarm on defense. Reed is not enamored of Bolivar. I thought they played up. Once we took the lead in the fourth quarter the wheels kinda fell off but it was a good game.” “Football is an emotional game,” Sechler added. “And when you get the momentum that’s a big part of it.” Despite their first loss, Reeds Spring will go into their Class 3 district as the top-seed. And despite their one-loss season, Bolivar will be the number three seed in their Class 4 district behind five-time defending state champion Webb City and West Plains. Another major power, Carl Junction, is the fourth seed. It’s the only district in Class 4 with four ranked teams. “It’s our state championship,” Sechler said of the district play-offs. “We feel great going in because we have so many returning guys and that makes it a lot easier. Last year were were really young.” “We do have the toughest district in the state, Roweton added. “Tonight was fun and our district games are gonna be a lot of fun. I’m really looking forward to it and our kids like to compete. We’ve had several blow-out games leading up to this one and I think that hurt us a little bit. We got a taste of what it takes to play four quarters tonight and however far we can go from here on out we’re gonna have a good time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:30:30.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
