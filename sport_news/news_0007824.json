It was nothing serious, but I had to take three weeks off. I think that’s the reason I was sent down, but it’s good to be back here and it’s time to show what I can do.”\n‘Lot of good games’\n“There were a lot of good games and some bad games,” Pakarinen said. “I have to find the level that I can play every night. If you’re having a bad game, then you have to try and play a simple game. I feel I’m ready to play.”\nPakarinen hopes he can take on a similar role with the Oilers this season, developing into the player the team would feel comfortable inserting into any slot in the lineup.\n“I’m an all-around player, I think I can play on all four lines,” Pakarinen said. “If they need me on the first or second line, I think I can be there. If they want me to play on the fourth line, then I can play simple and harder and grind it a little bit more. That’s what I think is good about my game.”\nFirst things first, though, Pakarinen has to make a good impression on new Oilers head coach Todd McLellan and his staff.\nNot having been able to evaluate Pakarinen in training camp, the Oilers staff is relying on scouting reports on the 6-foot-one, 215-pound winger until he establishes himself in Edmonton.\n“I liked his practice Saturday, it was the first time I’ve really experience Iiro in practice,” McLellan said. “I thought he looked strong, he competed hard in practice, showing us he wants to play. There’s a good chance he’ll be in the lineup (Sunday) night.”\nMcLellan is hoping Pakarinen brings grit and size to his lineup, going up against a big and heavy Kings team.\nIn for Hendricks\nPakarinen is filling Matt Hendricks spot on the roster, who is out with a foot injury after blocking a shot in a 5-2 win against the Calgary Flames last Saturday.\nThe Oilers initially called up Andrew Miller to fill the spot, but replaced him with Pakarinen on Thursday.\n“I’ve heard those words about him from our management team, our scouts and our coaches down there (Bakersfield) — hard, heavier game, in the right position,” McLellan said. “The team we’re going to play (Sunday) does that consistently for 60 minutes when we’re playing them, so we’re going to need that.”\nFor Pakarinen, the call-up represents another chance to make a good first impression. He had made it to Edmonton in time to play against the Washington Capitals on Friday, but believes he’ll be better prepared against the Kings.\n“I think that was maybe better for me,” he said. “I was at the hotel at 2:30 a.m.,the night before the (Washington) game. That was better for me not to play (Friday) that way I can get a better nights sleep before I can play.”\nIn four games with the Condors this season, Pakarinen had a goal and three assists.\n“It was good for me there,” Pakarinen said.\nMCLELLAN MEETS UNDERPERFORMERS\nTodd McLellan stated there were a number of players he was not pleased with after Friday’s 7-4 loss to the Washington Capitals.\nThe Oilers head coach blamed the performance of individual players in the loss, believing they weren’t adhering to the game plan.\n“We were weak in a lot of areas, I wasn’t far off when it came to individuals, so I met with some of them,” McLellan said Saturday. “After watching the game again, I felt our trust level was not very high because of individual errors. So when we should have been strong in certain areas, we didn’t trust anybody because made mistakes early in the game and it backed us off.\n“But it was back to work again (Saturday) the guys are a good group, they’re receptive, they want to get better and they accepted the direction and they had a good practice.”\nThe Oilers had seven players with a negative rating against the Capitals on Friday. Defencemen Oscar Klefbom and Justin Schultz finished minus-4 and minus-3.\nConnor McDavid, despite a goal and assist finished at minus-2. Nail Yakupov, Rob Klinkhammer, Lauri Korpikoski and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins were all minus-1 on the night.\n“It wasn’t our best effort,” Schultz said. “Some guys played well, but I know Klef and myself need to be better if we want to win. We looked at some video (Saturday) had a good practice and look forward to (Sunday’s) game against LA.”\nClose call\nNugent-Hopkins had trouble sleeping Friday night, careful not to roll over on his left ear.\nThe Oilers winger was clipped by the skate of Capitals defenceman John Carlson late in the first period Friday and needed stiches to repair the gash on his ear.\n“He came to hit me, fell over my stick and his skate came flying up backwards into the air,” Nugent-Hopkins said. “Lucky he just clipped my ear a little bit.”\nIt was the first time Nugent-Hopkins had ever been cut by a skate.\n“It’s something that you don’t want to think about too much,” he said. “It’s one of the most dangerous things in hockey. You’re seeing more dangerous things happen, then what happened last night with the skate to the neck or something like that. I’m just happy that it turned out not to be so bad.”\nderek.vandiest@sunmedia.ca\nOilers Pakarinen gets his look\nBy Derek Van Diest , Edmonton Sun First posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 09:12 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 24, 2015 11:54 PM EDT\nAfter a successful call-up late last season, Iiro Pakarinen was looking forward to having a strong training camp with the Edmonton Oilers and perhaps vie for a roster spot.\nBut things did not go as Pakarinen envisioned.\nThe winger sustained a shoulder injury early into training camp, which derailed his hopes of earning a spot on the opening night roster.\nPakarinen was sent down to the Oilers AHL affiliate in Bakersfield, California, to start the season, but recalled on Thursday and is expected to be in the lineup Sunday when the Oilers host the Los Angeles Kings (7:30 p.m.) at Rexall Place.\n“It was a shoulder injury,” Pakarinen said. “I hit the boards.
