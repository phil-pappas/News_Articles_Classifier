Thomas/Getty Images Daniel Fells is on injured reserve and won’t play for the Giants this season. Going home has never been this sweet for Daniel Fells.\nThe Giants tight end, who contracted MRSA and was hospitalized for most of October, returned home this week and was welcomed by his two young children, Lennon and Layla. Fells shared video of his homecoming Wednesday on Instagram.\nFells can be seen sneaking up the stairs with the use of crutches before his kids spot him. Layla, a toddler, comes over first before big brother Lennon shrieks “Daddy!” and runs over to the gate at the top of the stairs as a wide smile breaks across Fells’ face.\nFells, an eight-year veteran, was having a productive season for the Giants before an ankle injury sidelined him. He developed an infection at some point and doctors feared that the 32-year-old might lose his foot, but he rebounded after having a seventh surgery and was discharged on Monday.\n“Back where I’m supposed to be,” Fells wrote on Instagram. Thanks for all the love and support everyone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:12:53.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
