PETERSBURG - \nPeople outside the Blue Jay ballclub have been obsessing over what they see as the Jays' cavalier attitude toward finishing with the best record overall in the American League. \nThey point to manager John Gibbons’ usage of a spring training-type lineup in the second game of the doubleheader in Baltimore after they had clinched the AL East title in the first game. Those same people were outraged that the Jays’ lineup for a 12 o’clock start the next day in questionable weather was exactly the same as the night before. \nIn both cases, Gibbons was protecting his starters after they had completed their mission of winning the AL East title. The risk-reward for finishing first overall took a back seat to the needed rest for a team that had been pushing hard for the last six weeks. \nBecause of the rainout on Tuesday in Baltimore, both Marcus Stroman and R.A. Dickey had to pitch Wednesday, leaving a hole in the rotation for Sunday’s game. \n“That doesn’t surprise me,” said Gibbons Sunday morning when informed of the general unrest among the fans. \n“But it’s a bullpen day anyway. We couldn’t pitch Stroman or Dickey on three days’ rest so it’s not like we’re bumping one of our five guys. It’s probably the same people who are complaining about the second game of that doubleheader. That’s just the way it goes. I’ll take the heat and we’ll just see how the baseball gods view it themselves. \n“Dickey and Stroman both pitched Wednesday. Why do you want to bring those guys back on short rest, especially Dickey? He needs a break, too. He’s got over 200 innings.” \nThe value of having home field advantage pertained to only one matchup. The only team the Jays might face where they won’t have the home field advantage is the Kansas City Royals. The extra game only comes into play if the Royals advance to the AL Championship Series and then only if the series extends to seven games. \n“Nobody knows what’s going to happen,” said Gibbons. “People try to map it out but nobody knows who they are going to play. I’m just looking out for our own players and that’s what I’m supposed to do.” \nRELATED:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:35:16.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
