Over that four game stretch, Paramus has outscored its opponents, 10-0. \nParamus spent the majority of the game in complete control of the action on the field. Tenafly was rarely able to get any sustained offensive possession and ended up taking only a handful of shots all game. \nThe Spartans earned the first shot on goal about eight minutes in, when junior Shannon O'Brien zipped a cross to Francesca Lama. Lama booted the ball on the fly, hitting a shot directly to the Tenafly keeper, Maia Katz, who made the save. \nSpartans senior Julia Koenemund took a long shot that was saved by Katz, forcing a corner kick. Koenemund received the corner in the box and headed it to the upper right corner of the net, where it was saved by a leaping header by Tigers defender Laura Roland. \nParamus forced Katz to make a few more saves in the first half, with shots coming from Koenemund, O'Brien and Antonina Vainieri. \n\"It was unfortunate that we couldn't get one across in the first period,\" said Paramus head coach Glenn Haug. \"We thought we had a few chances off our corner kicks.\" \nPITURAS BURIES ONE \nThe Spartans opened the second half with a pair of scoring chances. The first was a corner taken by senior Lorraine Moffitt. Moffitt's corner found Koenemund, whose shot missed wide left. Shortly after that opportunity, a long shot by junior Kaitlyn Scrivanich was saved by Katz. \nHalfway through the final period, the Spartans finally found the back of the net. \nFreshman Anabell Olmo made a run down the field and kicked the ball right at the Tenafly goal. After a few missed shots in quick succession, the ball bounced up high in the air and found senior Kayla Pituras right in front of the goal. \nPituras buried it to give Paramus a 1-0 lead. \n\"Luckily for us the ball popped right up and we were in the right position at the right time,\" said Haug. \nAfter the goal Paramus had a few more scoring opportunities but the remainder of the game was mostly played in the midfield. The two sides jostled for control for the final 20 minutes but were unable to get any golden opportunities to score. \nIn the final minutes Tenafly threatened with a run down the left side, but ultimately the ball was given up without a shot being taken. The final play before the end of the second half was a free kick by Tenafly that was blocked by the Paramus defense and cleared as the final whistle blew. \nDespite being shut out and unable to sustain much offense, the Tenafly side played solid defense for the entirety of the game, making most of Paramus' shots into pretty easy saves for Katz. \nKatz finished the game with eight saves. Nicole DiPasquale finished with two saves in the shutout win for Paramus. \nAll eight of Paramus' wins this season have come by way of a shutout, with the Spartans scoring 21 goals in those eight contests. The Spartans improve to 8-3 overall, while the Tigers fall to 2-5-2. \nEmail: baumuller@northjersey.com Â© 2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:15:02.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
