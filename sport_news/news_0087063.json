(Image Source: USA TODAY Sports) \nHere are this week’s picks ranked in order of confidence: \n(13) Kansas City Chiefs vs. Chicago Bears: Having played the Broncos, followed by road trips to the Packers and the Bengals in the past three weeks, the Chiefs are coming home ready to take out their frustration and the NFL schedule makers are handing them the Bears, who will play more like sacrificial lambs. \n(12) New England Patriots @ Dallas Cowboys: So, Bill Belichick has had an extra week to prepare for Brandon Weeden ? This one could get ugly. \n(11) New York Giants vs. San Francisco 49ers: Until further notice, just pick against San Francisco. Just do it. I…said…do it! \n(10) Green Bay Packers vs. St. Louis Rams: The Rams are a dangerous underdog but I can’t pick them for two reasons. 1) Their MO is to letdown after an impressive upset win. 2) Aaron Rodgers is too damn dominant at home. St. Louis may keep it close, especially if Nick Foles can protect the football, but Green Bay improves to 5-0. \n(10) Atlanta Falcons vs. Washington Redskins: OK, I’m starting to believe in these Falcons. It’s not just QB Matt Ryan and talented receivers anymore, as the offensive line is playing better than it has in years. \n(8) Buffalo Bills @ Tennessee Titans: That was an ugly flag-filled performance by the Bills last week. Nothing some pushups couldn’t fix! Look for Rex Ryan’s team to come out motivated this week and his blitz schemes to give rookie QB Marcus Mariota some trouble. Even without LeSean McCoy Buffalo scores more than enough to win on the road. \n(7) San Diego Chargers vs. Pittsburgh Steelers: The Steelers are just a different team without Ben Roethlisberger . Simply put they’re not a playoff caliber team and the Bolts have proven one thing this season, they can handle non-playoff teams at home. \n(6) Denver Broncos @ Oakland Raiders: You know by now I’m not the biggest Broncos backer, while I see the Raiders as a team on the rise. Oakland plays Denver tough but in the end we can file this under “not there yet.” \n(5) Jacksonville Jaguars @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Yes, they’re on the road, but right now the Jags are playing cleaner football. That is in part a product of having a second-year QB ( Blake Bortles 6 TDs/3 INTs) vs. a rookie ( Jameis Winston 6 TDs/7 INTs). \n(4) Cincinnati Bengals vs. Seattle Seahawks: Both teams are dominant at home, much more beatable on the road, which is why I’m rolling with the Bengals, who are playing as well as any team in the NFL right now. Meanwhile, Seattle still doesn’t look like the same team. S Kam Chancellor is back making game-saving plays, but the O-line still concerns me. \n(3) Detroit Lions vs. Arizona Cardinals: As bad as they’ve looked at times, the Lions are not the worst team in the NFL and something about the Cardinals being just a 2.5-point favorite smells fishy to me. Vegas wants us to pound Arizona. I already know I’ll be looking in the mirror and asking myself why did you pick Jim Caldwell vs. Bruce Arians, again? \n(2) Philadelphia Eagles vs. New Orleans Saints: I really, really hate picking games involving either one of these teams. I despise it, really. I don’t think either one is good. I picked the Eagles last week and against the Saints, going 0-2, however I’m sticking to the formula, as the ‘Aints help the Iggles get their second win of the season. \n(1) Cleveland Browns @ Baltimore Ravens: The Browns are a very good underdog and the Ravens are very banged up at receiver, which should allow the Cleveland defense to control the game. Don’t be surprised if the Browns move the ball better than the Ravens (have they really played better than the Lions?) on Sunday. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
