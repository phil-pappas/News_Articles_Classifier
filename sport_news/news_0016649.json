The extra preparation, they say, has been valuable, especially amid a time where injuries have delimitated a defense that was once easily thought to be the team’s strength.\n“We had to rearrange the puzzle a little bit, with some guys going down and some guys switching positions,” UCLA coach Jim Mora said.\nMost of the retooling in recent practices has come at linebacker, as sophomore Kenny Young moved to the weakside linebacker, known as the “Will” linebacker, following the departure of Myles Jack.\nJunior Isaako Savaiinaea has stepped in his place at middle linebacker, the “Mike” linebacker, where Young had been groomed to replace Butkus Award winner Eric Kendricks this past offseason.\n“It seems like it’s an easy thing to do, to just switch positions, but it’s really not,” Mora said. It changes all your reads, and your alignments.”\nStarting against Arizona State, the physical 6-foot-2, 250-pound Savaiinaea tallied a career-high 15 tackles and has looked strong defending the run.\n“When he gets on the field, he has the ability to make plays,” Mora said of the Hawaiian-born player.\nUCLA has lost three defensive starters for the season, while it is not known if Jaylon Brown, who helped replace Jack at linebacker, will be able to play at Stanford because of a lower-back injury.\nThe 11 days of rest between games should help, though.\n“I think we’re reorganized now,” Mora said. “We’re settled in a little bit better, and we’ll continue to get better.”\nJOHNSON OUT FOR SEASON\nSophomore Mossi Johnson will miss the rest of the season after suffering a severe knee injury last week during a 1-on-1 drill in practice.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-ucla.bruins.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-ucla.bruins.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:58:13.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
