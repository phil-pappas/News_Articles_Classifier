With Montgomery on injured reserve, the only other center on the roster is rookie Hroniss Grasu, and the Bears would prefer not to throw him into the deep end until they're sure he can do more than tread water.\n\"If my number gets called, I feel like I can step right in and help these guys out,\" the third-round pick out of Oregon said. \"But I know mistakes will happen. You just have to get better from it.\"\nGrasu and Slauson both snapped the ball with the first-team offense in Wednesday's practice.\nSlauson did an admirable job on Sunday despite almost no practice time at center and no game experience at the position since he joined the Bears in 2013. He said after that game that he would need to know as soon as possible if he is going to remain at center, in order to get the necessary practice reps.\n\"He'll be prepared wherever it is he starts,\" coach John Fox said after Wednesday's practice.\nThe Bears also had another new starter last week at left tackle, as 2014 seventh-round draft pick Charles Leno filled in for Jermon Bushrod, who isn't expected back this week from a concussion. Injury epidemic:\nThirteen players appeared on the injury report after Wednesday's practice.\nQuarterback Jay Cutler (hamstring), offensive tackle Kyle Long, (back/ankle), wide receiver Alshon Jeffery (hamstring), defensive linemen Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle) and Will Sutton (elbow), Shea McClellin (elbow), cornerback Alan Ball (groin) and punter Pat O'Donnell (knee) were limited.\nWide receiver Eddie Royal (ankle), offensive tackle Jermon Bushrod (concussion), guard Patrick Omameh (ankle), cornerback Sherrick McManis (hamstring) and safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) did not practice.\n\"Kind of a mixed bag,\" coach John Fox said. \"It's a combative, physical game. It's part of the game. Hopefully we're healthier by Sunday.\"\nGood as gold: Robbie Gould was named NFC special teams player of the week after hitting all 3 field goal attempts against the Raiders, including the game-winner from 49 yards with 2 seconds remaining.\nGould also connected from 54 yards early in the fourth quarter and from 19 yards.\nIt was the 12th game-winner of Gould's career and tied for the longest game-winner of his career (vs. Seattle in NFC 2006 divisional playoffs).\nGould is 9-for-9 on field goals this season and is the seventh-most-accurate FG kicker in NFL history at 86.0 percent.\nGood luck charm: Based on his past experiences, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio predicted a World Series victory for the Cubs.\n\"In San Francisco, I was there (as the 49ers' defensive coordinator) for five years, and the Giants won three World Series; they had never won one before,\" Fangio said. \"I was in Houston when they got to their only World Series. I bring good luck to the baseball teams.\"\nMoving up:\nSafety Demontre Hurst was promoted from the practice squad to the active roster and guard/center Ryan Seymour was added to the practice squad.\nHurst has played in 16 games with two starts, since joining the Bears last season and has 36 tackles, 1 interception and 1 forced fumble. He spent the 2013 season on the Bears' practice squad as an undrafted rookie out of Oklahoma.\nThe 6-foot-4, 305-pound Seymour played in 11 games with three starts at center for the Browns last season after being selected by the Seahawks in the seventh round (220th overall) of the 2013 draft out of Vanderbilt.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
