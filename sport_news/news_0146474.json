Courier file photo In this October 2002 image, Dennis Poolheco heads for the finish line in the 50-mile Man Against Horse Race in Dewey, as riders in the 12-mile horse Poker Ride look on. That year, Poolheco won the race in 6 hours, 56 minutes. Man Against Horse Race Advisory The race is a loop course and will start and finish from the base camp windmill, located on Old Fain Road (approximately 7 miles north of Highway 69, 3 miles east on Highway 89A and 1 mile south on Old Fain Road).Runners run concurrently with horses. This is not a ride and tie. The 25- and 50-mile courses are moderately difficult; the 12-mile is a rolling course. The 25- and 50-mile distances should not be undertaken without significant preparation. Runners should be in shape for travel over rough country, including steep and rocky terrain. Most of the course is on mountainous trails and back roads through the tall pines of Mingus Mountain. Elevation at base camp is about 5,000 feet, with the 50-mile course climbing to an elevation of 7,600 feet.Weather conditions are highly unpredictable, with snow and hail as possible as sunshine and clear skies.Base camp can accommodate overnight campers, and RVs. No parking or camping will be allowed outside base camp boundaries. No campfires will be permitted. On the 25- and 50-mile courses, pit crews will have access to aid stations, of which there are only a few.Courtesy: managainsthorse.net Doug Cook The Daily Courier There will be heavy hearts at the 32nd annual Gheral Brownlow Memorial Man Against Horse Race Saturday morning, Oct. 3, on Mingus Mountain, as competitors and their families dedicate the event to its six-time champion runner who died earlier this year.Fifty-three-year-old Dennis Poolheco of Glendale, an ultra-marathon legend who still holds the Man Against Horse course record in 6 hours and 33 minutes (2001), perished in a car accident while returning from work in June.Race director Ron Barrett of Prescott said the 2015 event's T-shirts have the words, \"In Honor of Dennis Poolheco,\" on the back.\"He was a pretty special guy,\" Barrett said of Poolheco, who was a member of the Tewa/Hopi tribe and owns four of the six all-time fastest finishes in the Man Against Horse Race. \"He just loved coming up to this race, just because of the mystique of the person racing against the horse.\"After an unseasonably warm beginning to the fall this week, with temperatures hovering in the upper 80s and low 90s, Saturday's forecast calls for a high of 80 following an overnight low in the upper 40s.Approximately 35 runners and 35 horses and their riders will congregate at the base camp off Highway 89A and Old Fain Road northeast of Prescott Valley to race side-by-side in a 50-mile run and trail ride starting at 6:30 a.m.In addition, a 25-mile run and trail ride, with around 50 horses and 50 runners, will commence at 7:30 a.m., as will a 12-mile run at 7:45 and a 12-mile trail ride at 9 a.m., with check-in prior to the start.The rigorous course, designed only for experienced, well-trained runners, horses and their riders, opens at an elevation of 5,200 feet and climbs to the top of Mingus at 7,700 feet before dropping back down to the finish line.Barrett said he and about 100 volunteers were out on the course recently trimming trees and raking rocks off the trails on U.S. Forest Service property. The Fain family also allows race organizers to use its ranch land for the race.At the end of this unique event, around 1:30 p.m., the fastest runner's time is compared to the fastest horse's time to determine the overall winner.An open-to-the-public barbecue follows at 4:30 p.m., as does an awards dinner/banquet at 6 p.m., and a private company will provide the food. Barrett said he will discuss Poolheco's racing accomplishments at that time.A total of about 300 competitors are expected for Saturday's races, which is about average. They will come from not only Arizona, but states such as California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida and Hawaii, Barrett said.Horses usually win the 50-mile main event, although it's not uncommon for runners to do so, Barrett said, because humans can run downhill faster than horses as long as they're not too far behind the pace at the top.On Oct. 4, 2014, James Bonnett of Phoenix won the 50-mile run in 6 hours and 55 minutes, missing Poolheco's all-time record by 22 minutes. In the company of family at the finish line, James not only beat his fellow runners. He defeated the fastest two horses that day, earning him the race's overall title and its prize, a turquoise-inlaid silver belt buckle.Paul Bonnett, James' father who was the first runner to ever beat a horse in this race in 1995, and James are registered to race again Saturday, Barrett added. Paul, a longtime teacher/cross-country coach at Central High in Phoenix who was close friends with Poolheco, will likely run the 25-miler while James does the 50.The most challenging part of the Man Against Horse Race course occurs at Mile 29 on the backside of Mingus Mountain. That's where a 3-mile climb up steep terrain begins.James said last year that the section forces you to go harder than you're used to leading into it so you can make it the 3 miles without stalling.Once you reach the end of the grueling stretch, you're gassed and fall behind the pace. Nevertheless, James added that you tend to compensate for any time lost once you head downhill in the stretch run.Although Poolheco didn't run last year, he went out on the course toward the top of the climb, cheering on James by walking and running with him to the crest of Mingus.Jeanette Poolheco, Dennis' sister, and other members of his family from Winslow, Phoenix and the Hopi Reservation will attend Saturday's race here, Barrett said. On the horseback side, Troy Eckard and Dayna Weary won the horse race in 2014 and received belt buckle prizes. In a show of solidarity, they came across together in just over 7 hours so their horses wouldn't get injured on the rough and rocky course.Weary, a multiple past champion, will ride in the 50-miler Saturday, but Eckard won't be here, as he's celebrating his father-in-law's birthday in England, Barrett said.As it has in the past, the Yavapai County Jeep Posse will place volunteer crews at each of the race's aid stations, complete with full radio contact on Mingus in case of an emergency.Eleven checkpoints/aid stations dot the 50-mile course for the runners. For the horses, there will be three medical checkpoints where veterinarians evaluate the animals' fitness to continue on in the competition.The Man Against Horse Race is run each year in honor of its main founder, Gheral Brownlow, an avid runner from Prescott who had a strong connection with Poolheco. Brownlow died of cancer several years ago.All proceeds and donations from the event will go to benefit the Yavapai Food Bank and Chino Valley Food Bank to help feed the hungry over the holidays, Barrett added.For more information about the race, call Barrett at 928-925-1930 or log on to managainsthorse.net.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:13:17.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
