(Fox 61) Jeff Jacobs Contact Reporter Jeff Jacobs Plainfield forfeits football game with Waterford, but that's the least of the town's problems \nPLAINFIELD — Plainfield Principal Jim Worth first heard about the disgusting group chat last Thursday. And by the time the news trucks began rolling onto his high school campus Tuesday, Worth had to know any chance for justice, clean, swift and as quietly as possible, was gone. \nRumor and innuendo around town suddenly had become a juicy lead story on state television stations. With the news came the headline that, despite the group chat including one-third of the football players, Worth had decided to suspend the entire team for the game against Waterford on Friday night. \nOn Wednesday, the CIAC made the forfeit official. Waterford 1, Plainfield 0. That's a rare football score. \nWhat isn't nearly as rare is sexting among teenagers. According to a survey by The National Campaign, 40 percent of teenagers have posted or sent sexually suggestive messages. More poignantly to the Plainfield story, 22 percent of girls have sent nude or semi-nude photos. \nAnybody who thinks the genesis of what occurred in Plainfield is a one-town matter is badly mistaken. It's an every-town matter. \nI introduce mitigating factors early on — that the majority of football players weren't involved, that there were a couple of non-football players on the chat, that girls sent nudes in this case — so those mitigating factors aren't used to deflect attention from the most egregious actions. (TOM YANTZ) \nAccording to my sources and reports, as many as 15 players took part in the WhatsApp chat and that photos of multiple girls, at least one possibly as young as a freshman, were shared. \nThe smaller group of players who served as ringleaders in this chat, the ones who posted the photos and video, must be correctly identified and thrown off the football team. As soon as possible. That part is non-negotiable. What happens from there, whether they are ever allowed to play sports at the school, whether they are expelled from the school, whether they are arrested, what the lesser punishment should be for others involved, if the entire season must be called off, is subject to exactly what is discovered. (DAVID OWENS) \nAfter a week of uncertainty, with many in town pointing fingers in all sorts of directions, the Plainfield police announced Thursday it had begun child pornography investigation into a video, which they said might be inappropriate depending on the age and knowledge of those involved. Police said school officials came across a \"separate incident\" while they investigated the \"previous incident.\" \nWhat is certain is playing high school sports is not a right. \nIt is a privilege. \nPlaying on the small-town football or basketball team, two sports that probably get too much glory, is a special privilege. \nA small group of football players have not only abused that special privilege, they have literally exposed some girls to the worst kind of personal torment. They must pay the price. \nI am obliged to point out I live in Plainfield. My son, Liam, is a senior basketball player at the school. While he, too, is dismayed with football players' actions, he doesn't think all the particulars in this case will add anything to a columnist's over-arching sense of purpose. \nMaybe he's right. Maybe he's not. What I do know is an overwhelming sadness. In the past few years, I have loved attending all sorts of Plainfield games, ones my son doesn't play. Football, soccer, girls basketball, track, lots of baseball. Often I sit by myself, not an insider in my own town, cheering on the kids. I can't speak for other parents, but watching my own play is torture. Watching the other kids is joyful. \nOne of my son's friends said he has never seen an adult so enthusiastic about sports. That enthusiasm doesn't come from covering dozens of Super Bowls or World Series or national championships. It comes from watching a young player improve, develop leadership, demonstrate fortitude in a difficult spot. Watching a high school athlete grow, yeah, that's the great regenerative power of sport. I know a handful of the kids on that group chat, cheered for them, so it's painful. \nThat does not dissuade me from writing this: You pass around nude pictures and videos with your football teammates, break those girls' trust, worse maybe break their spirit, you're no young man. You're a cruel little boy. You pass around nudes and videos of your classmates in a small town like ours, your neighbor's daughter, maybe one day the wife of a friend, you have lost more than the special privilege of playing sports. You have lost all respect. \nThe Plainfield players do a lot of bragging about weightlifting in an area they call \"The Jungle.\" Building that kind of strength is great. It pales in comparison to building strength of character. \n\"Our foundation has been cracked,\" Worth said. \"It needs to be repaired.\" \nThis has been a muddled process. And in talking to Worth on Wednesday, it grew no less muddled. He said the investigation started last Friday. He began his process. Coach Pat Smith began his and in doing so sat out a number of players that night for part of a rout of Central Falls, R.I. \nI pressed Worth on why it took four more days to announce a one-game suspension for the entire team. He said, \"There are many, many pieces to this puzzle. We're still in the middle of what's going on.\" \nThis is important because there are some folks in my town who feel the school administration didn't act nearly quickly enough to involve the police. The other side, and it can be found in the words of the police and Worth, is they didn't have enough information before Thursday and not enough people were talking. How much of the chat, the photos, the video were deleted is unclear. One man's lack of fiber and foot-dragging can be seen as another man's due diligence and wisdom. \n\"A number of players were involved in this,\" Worth said. \"Whether they were directly involved, knew a little bit or a lot, no one came forward to say something to a coach, a teacher, an administrator, a parent. It was a team event.\" \nThe decision to suspend the entire team for one game has led to a lot of blowback around town. Why punish the innocent? \nI've been on that boat before and it's not a tack I would support. After a number of other athletes skipped school, the team's trip to the junior high school state track championship was canceled by the administration. Forty-five years later, I'm still not happy about it. \nOf course, if the worst Plainfield offenders were too cowardly to admit guilt and would rather take down the team, Worth can argue he had limited choices with a lack of evidence. \n\"I looked at it like you're a team, you're a unit,\" Worth said. \"The beginning of the year, every athlete was required to take a workshop that had to do with sportsmanship, grades, concussions. Social media guidelines are part of our student code of conduct, our athletic code of conduct. Each student said yes I would abide by that. \n\"We even had a speaker spend an hour with our students talking about their social media footprint, how it would impact their lives, college admissions, employment. Yeah, we talk about social media. It's a big topic. We've tried to impress on students you have to be responsible, respectful. It certainly wasn't adhered to by some.\" \nWaterford's homecoming dance is Saturday, yet it has no homecoming game now, no gate to help fund athletics, no game for a whopping 20 days. There are ripple effects, large and small. All pale to the damage those players potentially could do. By the letter of the law, yes, by sending those photos to boys they probably thought they could trust the girls who sent photos also could be arrested for misdemeanors. Yet those who would point at them and argue this never would have happened if they didn't send the photos don't know the difference between doing something wrong and ruthless exploitation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:00:00.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
