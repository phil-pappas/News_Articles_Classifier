The race is dubbed \"Pre-Nationals\" and hosted by Louisville, since the Cardinals will also host the NCAA National Championship meet, and the 10K national race will take place on the same 8K course utilized for Pre-Nationals. The course is set for Tom Sawyer State Park, and Louisville last hosted the race when Utah Valley attended in 2012. \n\"Our men are going to Pre-Nationals this weekend, which is a premium meet and great for our men to go to. We are seeded with amazing teams, and we are going to do as best as we can and see how we fare against the best runners in the country,\" head coach Scott Houle said. \"There will be over 100 teams racing so the competition will be some of the best we have ever seen and it will be exciting. The men on our team have had their eyes on this meet all season and this is what they have been working towards. Our men are ready for this meet and to continue on into the post season, especially defending their WAC title here at home.\" \nUVU will be racing on back-to-back weekends, after racing at the SUU Color Country Invitational on Oct. 10, where the women's team placed first overall, with sophomore Savannah Berry leading the way. On the men's side, the Wolverines rested their competitive squad and finished second place overall, while junior Logan Petty won the Invitational with an individual first-place finish on the brief 6K course. \nAt the Pre-National meet, Utah Valley will race against No. 3 Oregon, mountain region foes No. 1 Colorado, Wyoming, No. 13 UTEP, No. 23 Colorado St. and in-state rival No. 25 Southern Utah. \n\"This weekend we are splitting up our teams for the first time. We are sending our women to Santa Clara, where they have performed well in the previous years they have attended that meet and we hope they are a top contender there this weekend,\" Houle said. \"The women on our team are so evenly matched that it's always anyone's race and I am excited to see who will be the standout at Santa Clara. This is also our last race before the WAC Championships, so this is our last chance to work out any kinks and see where we stand before competing for a WAC title here at home on Halloween morning.\" \nAt the Bronco Invitational, the women will race their 6K course at Baylands Regional Park in Sunnyvale, California. \nThe Pre-National Invitational is prepped for 8 a.m. MT, while the Bronco Invitational is slated for 10:45 a.m. Results can be found on UVU's website following the completion of the races.
