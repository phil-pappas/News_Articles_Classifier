In voting held in Parliament here, Communist Party of Nepal — Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) — chairman Oli garnered 338 votes, 39 more than the 299 that he needed to be elected as Nepal's 38th prime minister while Nepali Congress president and incumbent Prime Minister Koirala could secure only 249 votes. The contest between Oli and Koirala became necessary after parties failed to forge a consensus. A total of 587 members cast their votes. Lawmakers were not allowed to stay neutral during the voting. While Oli was backed by UCPN-Maoist, Rastriya Prajatantra Party-Nepal, Madhesi Janaadhikar Forum-Democratic and some fringe parties; four Madhes parties in the United Democratic Madhesi Front had supported NC leader Koirala who himself became prime minister with the support from CPN-UML in 2014. Oli was elected chief of the CPN-UML last year. He was chief of party's International Department before being elected to the top position of the party. Oli served as the nation's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Girija Prasad Koirala-led interim government formed immediately after the 2006 People's Movement. Back in 1994, he was the Minister for Home Affairs in the Cabinet led by the then UML Chairman Manmohan Adhikari. He was elected a member of the Parliament thrice from various constituencies of Jhapa district from where he began his political career in 1966. Oli takes over as prime minister at a crucial time as Nepal has been wracked by violent political protests by Madhesi people protesting against the new Constitution. He faces the daunting task of unifying the quake-hit country that has been rocked by deadly protests. The country has also been locked in a diplomatic standoff with India over the supply of essential goods, including petroleum products, which has been hit due to blockade of border trade points with India. At least 40 people have died in over a month of clashes between police and protesters from the Madhesi and Tharu communities and ethnic minorities. — PTI Fuel crisis: Nepal starts free bus service Amid mounting fuel crisis due to a nearly two-week Madhesi-led blockade at border checkpoints with India, Nepal on Sunday started running free bus services in Kathmandu to facilitate the travel of city-dwellers ahead of Vijaya Dashmi and Diwali festivals Nepal is facing an acute shortage of fuel and cooking gas due to the continued blockade by Madhesi-led agitators on the Nepal-India border checkpoints for about two weeks Madhesis and Tharu ethnic groups are protesting for more representation in the newly-promulgated Constitution They also see the Constitutional model to split Nepal into seven provinces as flawed and discriminatory to their rights", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:08:20.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
