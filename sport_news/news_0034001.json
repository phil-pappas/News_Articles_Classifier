He is jailed on attempted homicide and other charges. \nThe victim was another freshman football player, 18-year-old Dhameer Madison, of New Castle, Delaware. He was taken to a hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. \nIt was unclear what led to the fight. \nBut police say Madison punched Stewart, who then grabbed a multi-tool device and used the corkscrew portion to stab Madison three times in the left rib cage. \nA school spokesman says Stewart is suspended. Online court records don't list an attorney for him. \nInformation from: Reading Eagle, http://www.readingeagle.com/ \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:23:02.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
