Slovakia lost 1-0 at home to Belarus, while Ukraine defeated Macedonia 2-0.\n\"It's great to finally advance, but we know it wasn't easy,\" Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque said. \"The loss to Slovakia (last year) made things harder for us.\"\nIn the final round, Ukraine hosts Spain, which will be looking for a third consecutive European title in France next year, and Slovakia plays at Luxembourg.\nSpain came into Friday's home match with a depleted squad because of injuries and suspensions, and it only got worse after David Silva had to be substituted early on with an apparent ankle injury. Also in the first half, Alvaro Morata had to leave on a stretcher because of a right leg injury.\n___\nGROUP E\nSwitzerland will return to the European Championship for the first time since it co-hosted the tournament eight years earlier after thrashing San Marino 7-0 with seven different scorers.\nThree goals came from penalties from Gokhan Inler, Johan Djourou and Breel Embolo, while Michael Lang, Admir Mehmedi, Pajtim Kasami and Eren Derdiyok also netted.\nAs the Swiss secured second place, leader England made it nine wins out of nine in qualifying, with Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling scoring in a 2-0 win over Estonia.\nEngland is the only team with a 100 percent record in qualifying for next year's finals and should be with the top-seeded teams in the draw for the group stage.\n\"That's important because it fluctuates with the FIFA rankings and I'm only hoping I've not been misled that we are now safe to be seeded,\" England coach Roy Hodgson said.\nWith one qualifier remaining, Switzerland has an unassailable five-point advantage over Slovenia, which was held to a 1-1 draw by Lithuania. Slovenia remains in a good position to make the playoffs as one of the third-place finishers.\nSlovenia has a three-point advantage over fourth-place Estonia and goes into the final qualifier at winless San Marino with a plus-nine goal difference.\n___\nGROUP G\nRussia took a big step toward qualifying for Euro 2016 thanks to a 2-1 win at Moldova.\nThe victory strengthened its hold on second place with one round of games yet to be played in the group.\nRussia took the lead through veteran defender Sergei Ignashevich, who blasted the ball into the net in the 58th minute after Artyom Dzyuba knocked on a free kick.\nDzyuba doubled Russia's lead in the 78th with a tap-in, while Eugeniu Cebotaru rekindled Moldovan hopes with a header in the 85th.\nRussia has a two-point lead over second-placed Sweden, which beat Liechtenstein 2-0.\nAustria, which has already qualified as group winner, twice recovered from a goal down to beat Montenegro 3-2.\n___\nAP sports writers Rob Harris in London and James Ellingworth in Sochi, Russia, contributed to this report.\n___\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n1 CONNECT Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
