Researchers compared 86 men with 49 women (mean age: 51 years) who underwent arthroscopic partial medial meniscectomy for complex horn tears with an intact lateral meniscus and intact cruciate ligaments. Mean follow-up was 26 months. For a minimum of 12 months, researchers prospectively observed patient outcomes using the Lysholm score, VAS and questionnaire responses about satisfaction. The investigators discovered a significant improvement in Lysholm scores for both groups. In men, the mean score improved from 69 preoperatively to 82.1 postoperatively. In women, this score improved from 64.2 preoperatively to 73.5 postoperatively. In men, mean VAS scores decreased from 5.9 preoperatively to 3.8 postoperatively. In women, scores decreased from 6.5 preoperatively to 4.6 postoperatively. The severity of chondral lesions was associated with age in both groups and was negatively associated with preoperative scores. Severe chondral lesions were observed more frequently in women compared with men. At final follow-up, 79% of men and 71% of women reported they were satisfied with the procedure. No revision knee arthroscopy was needed during the study period, according to researchers. â€’ by Monica Jaramillo Disclosures: The researchers report no relevant financial disclosures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:55:06.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
