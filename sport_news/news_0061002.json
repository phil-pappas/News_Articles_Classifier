Marty and I have the end and the linebacker, and I get too invested in the defensive end,” he said. “The linebacker sees a free run through.” \nThe linebacker, Josh Bynes, made the play, and Long said he made Bynes “look like an All-Star.” \nNow Long can self-scout, along with the rest of the offense, and try to get the run game back on track. The Bears have averaged 93.5 rushing yards a game over the past four games at a rate of only 3.3 yards a carry. \n“Very close, very close. I know that’s something that fans want to see. I know that’s something we want to see, you guys want to see it,” Long said when asked how close the run game is to returning to form. “It falls on us. It falls squarely on our shoulders as offensive linemen. Examples like the one I gave you earlier where I could have been better. I’m sure if you get any number of the guys from the O-line, they’ll tell you the same thing. Maybe they had a play here or there or play there.” \nSix games into playing right tackle, Long is the first to admit he has much to improve upon, and the bye week will give him and the rest of the offense that opportunity. \n“We need to get better at football,” he said. “There’s nobody that we’re preparing for necessarily. But we can self scout and we can figure out where we’re struggling in terms of technique and assignment. We can really pound on those things. \n“We took an opportunity today in individual as an offensive line to do some thing that maybe we need some shoring up on. I think having those reps is extremely valuable.” \nQuick hits: The Bears don’t have to release an injury report, but Antrel Rolle (ankle), Shea McClellin (knee) and Jeremiah Ratliff (neck) were not spotted participating in practice. The Bears will practice again Wednesday before taking Thursday through Sunday off. … The 27th annual coat drive, headed by equipment manager Tony Medlin, is underway.
