RIDE ‘EM BOYS: The original North Queensland Cowboys mascot Craig Meville. PICTURE: EVAN MORGAN Source: News Corp Australia \nMr Melville was part of the North’s bid to get a team into the NRL 20 years ago, and trained for two years with his noble steed Outlaw and Movie World’s renowned horse master Tony Jablonski on the Gold Coast before making their on-field debut in 1995. \n“The first night was unbelievable,” he said. \n“When I rode out, I didn’t realise what it was like to get conditioned to the crowd. It’s a feeling I’ve never felt before.” \nMr Melville said he and Outlaw were the main mascots, with the now famous cattle dog Bluey their original sidekick. \n“For about eight years we did a comedy skit for every game,” he said. \nMr Melville said he was backing his team to bring home their first NRL title. \n“Being Cowboys, they should be able to tame the Broncos, because it’s in their blood,” he said. “I’ll be watching the game from home, maybe in my costume.” \n“If they win I would love to see the team when they come back for one last ride.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:09:57.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
