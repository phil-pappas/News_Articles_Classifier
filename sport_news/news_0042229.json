He hasn’t played in a game or absorbed many practice hits since but has been cleared medically to return. CROWDED DEFENSIVE BOXES \nAt the time of the injury, Brewer had completed 11 of 15 passes for 156 yards with touchdown passes to Sam Rogers (51 yards) and Ryan Malleck to give the Hokies a 17-14 halftime lead over the heavily favored and defending national champion Buckeyes. \n“We’d put that kid through hell in off-season practice and he played his tail off today,” Hokies offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler said of Brewer. “I told the team we could feel sorry for ourselves or we could rally around Motley.” \nThe rally has been uneven at best. \nMotley, a 6-3, 220-pound junior, played well in ensuing wins over Furman (42-3) and at Purdue (51-24), but stumbled some at ECU in a 35-28 loss to the Pirates and then threw three interceptions last week in Blacksburg in a stinging 17-13 loss to Pitt. \nTech’s ground game, in the process, has slowed to a crawl. A part of that can be attributed to tailback Marshawn Williams’ injury problems. \nWith Williams now out for the season, the running burden has fallen to freshman Travon McMillian, who has a lot of raw talent and should be a future star. But with Motley at the wheel, opposing defenses of late have crowded the box to stop the run and he hasn’t been able to hit the mid-range passes needed to force those defenses into five-man secondaries. \nBrewer is a much better passer and game controller. He was inconsistent a times in 2014 – 18 TD passes, 15 picks – and took more than his fair share of the blame for the Hokies’ 7-6 (3-5) record. But everyone from Beamer to Loeffler to his teammates predicted a breakout season for Brewer. \nIn a few of the preseason NFL prospect outlooks, Brewer was listed along with State’s Jacoby Brissett and Florida State’s Everett Golson as the top ACC quarterback candidates for the 2016 draft. CORNERED IN THE RED ROOM, TOO \nLogically, the Wolfpack has to plan on seeing at least some of Brewer. \nThe loss to Pitt didn’t necessarily end the Hokies’ hopes of winning the murky Coastal but two straight home losses almost certainly would be too much to overcome with road games ahead at Miami, Boston College and Georgia Tech. \nThe fact that the Hokies won’t get a rest until the time between Oct. 31 at BC and Nov. 12 at Georgia Tech only makes it more difficult for Beamer to give Brewer extra mending time. \nRegardless of the suddenly beleaguered Beamer’s quarterback decision, the Wolfpack is every bit as cornered as the Hokies. \nRealistically the loss to Louisville (2-3, 1-1) in Carter-Finley in itself took the Pack out of serious contention to win the Atlantic, where Clemson (4-0, 1-0) and Florida State (4-0, 2-0) aren’t likely to provide much breathing room for the other five teams. \nBut an 0-2 conference start would be enough of a blow to put the Pack in a downward spiral on the league bowl pecking order. \nLast season, State started 0-4 in the conference and then recovered late for a 3-5 finish, a trip to the Bitcoin Bowl in St. Petersburg and an encouraging win over Central Florida. But the last thing anyone in the red room wants to sweat out is second straight string of must-win games in November.
