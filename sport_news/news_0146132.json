After the couple relocated to Bastrop to be closer to their children and grandchildren, they opened their store in the city on Nov. 1, 2005, the owners said.\nSharon and Bill Sharp’s Christian bookstore, Living Room Books & Gifts, is celebrating its 10-year anniversary in Bastrop this month. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Bill Sharp and his daughter, Kim Burns, are known for greeting customers with warm smiles and stepping in to offer help when needed. Sharp has owned and operated the businesses, with the help of his wife Sharon, since its opening; but after Sharon died in 2012, Burns stepped in to help with the family business.\n“Our mission is to help customers find books or gifts to help grow their faith,” the father-daughter team said of their store, located at 301 Texas 71 West, Suite 100.\nThe store was recently recognized by the Christian Booksellers Association, which awarded the 2015 Ministry in Action Award to Sharp and Burns at the group’s annual International Christian Retail Show this summer in Florida. The award was presented to the pair for work done to distribute free Bibles to victims of the 2011 Bastrop County Complex Fire, and they were recognized for their support of the Bastrop Pregnancy Resource Center, as well as for introducing family-based movies to Bastrop, the association said.\n‘Kind of by accident’\nAnother Bastrop staple, Dixie’s Den of Antiquities, also is celebrating an anniversary, as well as the opening of a sister store in the city.\nThe antique store, located on Texas 71 at Alum Creek Road in between Bastrop and Smithville, is celebrating its 5th anniversary on Oct. 1.\nStore owner, Dixie Chatham said she opened the antiquities store “kind of by accident.”\nShe had a health food business across the highway from where her storefront now is located, and to help build up traffic and offset rent, Chatham rented bookshelf space to vendors. Little by little the health food aspect of her business diminished, and she ran with the burgeoning consignment side of her venue.\nChatham relocated to her current location where she now has 55 vendors and consigners. Chatham said business was difficult after the 2011 Complex Fire but remained opened after the disaster to help the community get back on its feet.\nEdward Tindol, joined Dixie as a co-owner of the shop in 2013. Chatham said Tindol has been an invaluable asset to the store, leaving his unique mark on its appearance, as well as expanding by attracting an estate liquidation service.\nTindol said he first dabbled into the antique world in the early 1990s as a hobby that turned full time about 15 years ago. He said he started out collecting glassware and antique chandeliers, and graduated into collecting primitive furniture and décor.\nTindol describes primitive as “way back when you couldn’t afford a kitchen table so you took the door and made into a table, that’s primitive.”\nChatham and Tindol now are expanding their business and opening a storefront, Dixie’s Parlor & Primitives, at 1289 Texas 71 in Bastrop where they’ll offer more upscale, rare finds, high-end china, Hindu Tapestry, art, chandeliers and primitive furniture and décor.\nThe pair has also incorporated John and Eric Alexander, owners of Dapper Deer, into their store, bringing their gentlemen’s vintage items, along with their own fragrances, soaps, candles and coffee bar.\nThe store’s grand opening is slated for this weekend, where there will be daily registrations for door prizes, as well as registrations at both locations all month long for a chance to win a getaway trip.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/02/1e/ad/CBA-Award-photo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:29:04.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
