Three games into the season, Victor was staring at a 0-2-1 record. The Blue Devils didn’t get their first girls soccer win until Sept. 10 and they liked it so much, they’ve kept doing it. Victor is 9-0-2 since, and that includes Monday’s 3-0 win over host Canandaigua Academy. “We’re happy with where we are and we’ve won some big games,” coach Kelly Ahern said of her 9-2-3 team. “We just have to continue to push along.” The winning is a concrete sign of progress, but two of those wins are bigger signs. Victor’s two losses, by an aggregate of 3-1 to Webster Schroeder and Rush-Henrietta have since been avenged by a combined score of 8-3. “Theres’ no night off,” said Ahern of her team’s jockeying for a top Class AA seed. “It’s anybody’s season.” The Blue Devils have two games left in the regular season, both at home against Fairport (Wednesday) and Penfield (Friday). Fairport is 11-2 and Penfield is 5-4-5. The Blue Devils need both wins for any shot at a No. 1 seed in the upcoming Section V Tournament but even if that doesn’t happen, they’re in a good spot to have at least a No. 2 seed. On Monday, Anna Schwarzweller scored a goal, then assisted on both goals by Victoria Montemorano. The Braves are 3-11. Honeoye 5, Romulus 0 Jenna Robinson and Sara Jane Stevens scored in the first half to give Honeoye (5-8) a 2-0 halftime lead. In the second half, Stevens scored two goals in less than a minute, converting a Lauren Jarosinski assist with 31:22 remaining, then getting an assist at 30:33 after her cousin, Katie Stevens, took a direct kick. Katie Stevens capped the scoring for the Bulldogs, who had a 35-6 advantage in shots over Romulus (1-12). MacKenzie Rudolph made two saves for Honeoye. Marcus Whitman 2, Midlakes (OT) Elisabeth Pierce gave Midlakes a 1-0 lead in the third minute before Emily Thompson responded for Marcus Whitman to tie the score 1-1 in the 19th minute of the second half. In overtime, Thompson’s header off of Stape free kick was the winner for the Wildcats (4-10) in the sixth minute. Katrina Meyer made six saves for Whitman and Jen Maslyn made three saves for Midlakes (3-12).
