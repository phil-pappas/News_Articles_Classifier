He saw a vehicle off the road on the other side. It was filled with smoke.\nRivas parked his car, crossed the street and pried open the door.\n\"The accident must have just happened a split second earlier. There was nobody here,\" Rivas told me while standing again on the crash site.\nA truck driver also pulled over and jumped out to help. The two men pulled the woman out of her smoky vehicle and carried her several yards away to safety, Rivas said. Someone else called 911.\nThe woman, 19-year-old Justice Marie Rutherford-Wilson of Hammond, appeared dazed but coherent. Rivas didn't notice any external bleeding or serious injuries.\n\"Look at my leg,\" she told Rivas, pointing to her mangled leg.\nAnother bystander pulled over along U.S. 20, ran to the scene and tapped Rivas on his shoulder.\nJerry Davich / Post-Tribune Tire tracks lead from the fatal crash site where Justice Marie Rutherford-Wilson, 19, of Hammond, was killed on Sept. 16, 2015, on U.S. 20 in Gary. Tire tracks lead from the fatal crash site where Justice Marie Rutherford-Wilson, 19, of Hammond, was killed on Sept. 16, 2015, on U.S. 20 in Gary. (Jerry Davich / Post-Tribune) \"I'm a nurse,\" she told him.\nShe spoke with the woman, asked her name and tried to care for her.\nRutherford-Wilson repeated two questions, Rivas recalled.\n\"Can I call my mom and dad?\" and \"Am I gonna die?\"\nBy this time, roughly eight to 10 minutes later, Gary police arrived at the scene.\n\"The call came in around 9:49 a.m.,\" said Gary police Lt. Dawn Westerfield.\nAn ambulance, however, didn't arrive with police.\n\"Stay with us, Justice,\" Rivas and other bystanders told Rutherford-Wilson.\nAlong with Rivas, the nurse, a trucker and the trucker's girlfriend kept craning their necks to look in both directions along U.S. 20 for an ambulance to arrive. Time seemed to drag as they did their best to comfort Rutherford-Wilson.\n\"At first, she was coming to, but then she started to fade in and out,\" Rivas said. \"We kept telling her to stay with us. She was pretty calm the whole time.\"\nRivas kept checking the time on his cell phone while making calls for outside assistance and piecing together what happened at the crash site. Rutherford-Wilson's vehicle somehow clipped the back of a truck and veered off the road. A set of tire tracks can still be seen where her car veered from eastbound U.S. 20 and came to a stop a few feet off the road.\nAccording to his watch, roughly 25 minutes passed until an ambulance finally arrived, Rivas said.\n\"It seemed a lot longer, believe me,\" he said as vehicles whizzed past us on U.S 20.\nThe ambulance, though, wasn't from the city of Gary. It was from Prompt Ambulance Service.\nWesterfield said five Gary Fire Department ambulances were running service calls that morning. All of them were responding to other active calls in the city.\n\"Dispatch then called Prompt for an ambulance as they are our backup service,\" she said.\nPrompt Ambulance spokesman Ron Donahue confirmed that a company ambulance responded as part of its mutual aid agreement with the city.\n\"When the city's EMS system becomes overloaded, they often reach out to us for mutual aid,\" he said. \"This mutual aid system is not exclusive to Gary. All communities have a backup system in place for when 911 calls outnumber resources.\"\nWhen that call came in, the closest response vehicle was near 41st Avenue and Cleveland Street in Gary.\n\"We did advise them where we would be responding from and they still gave us the call,\" Donahue said.\nTheir response time from that location was 18 minutes.\nRutherford-Wilson was still somewhat conscious, Rivas said, when she was lifted into that ambulance and transported to a hospital.\nShe died less than an hour later, at 11:11 am, while in surgery, according to Lake County Coroner Merrilee Frey. Her office is still investigating the case and a pathologist's report can take several weeks, she said.\nWhen Rivas heard Rutherford-Wilson had died, his mind raced back to her initial question: \"Am I gonna die?\"\nRivas kept track of her funeral arrangements and considered attending her memorial service on Sept. 26. But he didn't know what to say to her family. Or how to say it to them.\n\"I think they should know her last words,\" he said.\nI agreed, so I contacted her family. Rutherford-Wilson's aunt, Angie Wilson, who's been the family spokeswoman throughout this ordeal, referred me to the family attorney.\n\"We are investigating the crash and the delay in paramedic service for the family,\" said Chicago attorney Tim Cavanagh, noting there is no pending litigation at this time.\nSince Rutherford-Wilson's death, fingers have been pointed in every direction about the delay time to respond to her fatal crash. Who dropped the ball? Gary dispatch? Its supervisors? Was protocol properly followed?\n\"This is unacceptable,\" said Rivas, who's a Porter County councilman.\nThe city of Gary's 911 dispatch system is in the process of merging with the county's new integrated 911 system and officials have met to discuss this fatal case, officials said.\n\"They are slowly moving departments in,\" Westerfield said.\nGary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson got involved in the case, expressing her sympathies for the victim and family while engaging in actions to prevent it from happening again.\nOn a personal level, could Rutherford-Wilson's life have been saved if an ambulance arrived sooner?\nUnlike her tragic case, Rutherford-Wilson has been put to rest.\n\"Justice was one of a kind,\" her obituary stated. \"She could light up a room with her feisty little red-headed self.\"\nShe is survived by her parents, John and Crystal Wilson, her brothers, Justin, John Jr., Joshua, Joseph Wilson and Nikolais Bohn, and the love of her life, Tutu Rubio, her obit stated.\n\"Justice is loved SO much and will forever be in our hearts,\" the obit concluded.\nShe also will be forever in the hearts of a handful of bystanders, including Rivas.\nAs vehicles whizzed past us, Rivas stared at the roadside memorial for Rutherford-Wilson, where she may have said her last words.\n\"I can't let it go,\" he said.\njdavich@post-trib.com\nTwitter @jdavich\nCopyright © 2015, Post-Tribune Traffic Accidents Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56216577/turbine/ct-ptb-davich-traffic-fatality-final-minutes-st-1016-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56216578/turbine/ct-ct-ptb-davich-traffic-fatality-f-2-2-jpg-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:13:50.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
