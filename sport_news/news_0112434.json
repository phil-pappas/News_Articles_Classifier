Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City’s 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4. \nAfter the resilient Royals rallied for four runs in the ninth, Roberto Osuna closed it out. \nIn the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993, Tulowitzki connected for a three-run shot off Johnny Cueto, and Donaldson hit a two-run drive off Kris Medlen as the Blue Jays hit their first home runs of the series. \nCueto failed to retire a batter in the third inning, allowing eight runs and six hits in the worst postseason start of his career. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:07:47.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
