Redeker led Olpe with 140 rushing yards on 18 carries, including a 22-yard score in the fourth quarter. \n“He ran the ball very hard,” said Schmidt, who used Redeker more predominantly with Andrew Burenheide dealing with an ankle injury. “Andrew’s ankle was kind of bothering him a little bit so I flipped those guys around and ran Dylan more at the tailback spot, and he ran hard. He did a nice job. \n“I thought our line did a nice job too. They’re gaining some confidence. I thought there in the second half we kind of wore (Lyndon) out a little bit.” \nAfter Redeker’s first score, Lyndon marched the ball to Olpe’s 4-yard line. The Eagles stonewalled each attempt to even the game, however, to turn the Tigers over on downs late in the first half. \n“I thought that was a critical time when we got that stop,” Schmidt said. “They had been moving it on us pretty well, but from that point we did a pretty decent job of containing them.” \nOlpe quarterback Ryker Schmidt, who finished the game 8 of 10 for 166 yards, connected with senior Brady Scheidegger for a short pass in the third quarter. Scheidegger turned the short throw into a 64-yard score en route to a 118-yard receiving night on five catches. \n“The (defender) got him, but he swung him around and he just fell off of him and Brady went down the sideline and outran him,” Schmidt said of Scheidegger’s score. “We did that with Brady quite a bit. We just put him out in the flat and just let him try to make some plays for us. He did a nice job.” \nThe Eagles (5-2, 3-0) host Chase County in a non-district game next week. Olpe will wrap up its district schedule the following Friday at Yates Center. \nLyndon 0 0 0 6 — 6 \nOlpe 0 7 6 15 — 28", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:05:13.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
