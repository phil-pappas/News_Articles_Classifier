They are made of the same lightweight material used in Adidas’ NBA jerseys and the school says the uniforms have “targeted ventilation zones on the chest, back, and side” designed to keep players cool.\nAlong with seeing the new uniforms – which were modeled by basketball players Angel Rodriguez, Tonye Jekiri, Sheldon McClellan, Jessica Thomas, Michelle Woods and Adrienne Motley – the donors also got to watch both teams practice and hear from athletic director Blake James as well as coaches Jim Larrañaga and Katie Meier.\nMiami’s men’s team is coming off a 25-13 season which culminated in a run to the National Invitation Tournament championship game. The women, meanwhile, went 20-13 and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament.\n“It’s a really exciting time,” Meier said. “Both Coach L and I, we’ve got a little bit of a pep in our step when you see us in the halls and you see us at our practices. We’re teaching, but they’re listening and they’re learning. They’re applying the concepts very early. I’ve watched their practices, they’re amazingly sharp right now and they return so much talent. The pace of my practice, I’m about six practices ahead of where I normally am this time of year which excites me.”\nThe two teams will play exhibition games on Nov. 4 at the BankUnited Center with the women facing Nova Southeastern at 4 p.m. and the men taking on Dowling at 7 p.m.\nMotley honored\nMotley, a junior guard, was named a preseason All-ACC pick earlier this week by both the conference’s coaches and Blue Ribbon Panel. Motley, who averaged 16.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.4 steals last season, was the lone player to rank in the top 15 among ACC players in scoring, field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and free throw percentage.\nShe was a first-team All-ACC pick last season and was named the ESPNW National Player of the Week after she had a career-high 32 points in Miami’s win over then fourth-ranked Notre Dame last January.\n College Basketball Basketball College Sports Miami Hurricanes NCAA Notre Dame Fighting Irish National Invitation Tournament", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5629c038/turbine/sfl-hurricanes-basketball-teams-unveil-new-uniforms-motley-honored-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:12:05.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
