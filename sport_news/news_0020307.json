Then Brady, his attorneys and the NFLPA will have until Dec. 7 to respond. After that, the NFL will get a chance to offer a final reply by Dec. 21. \nThe appeal of the court's decision will be scheduled for as early as the week of Feb. 1, 2016. \nThe wild-card playoff games begin Jan. 9, 2016, The AFC and NFC championship games are Jan. 24 and the Super Bowl is Feb. 7. \nU.S. District Court Judge Richard M. Berman reversed the NFL's decision to suspend Brady in early September. Brady was suspended for the first four games of the season and the Super Bowl champion Patriots were penalized $1 million and two draft picks after a league investigation determined footballs were improperly deflated for the AFC championship game in January against the Indianapolis Colts. \nAfter Brady initially appealed to the NFL and the penalties were upheld by commissioner Roger Goodell, Brady took his appeal to federal court and won. \nWith Brady at quarterback, the Patriots have gone 3-0 to start the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:57:00.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
