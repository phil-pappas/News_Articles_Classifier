It scored the fourth-largest audience of this year’s postseason, trailing only Mets/Dodgers Game 5 in the Division Series (7.4M) and the Astros/Yankees (7.6M) and Cubs/Pirates (8.3M) Wild Card games. Keep in mind Kansas City is the nation’s #33 ranked television market and Toronto does not count toward U.S. TV ratings. \nWith that said, ratings and viewership were the third-lowest for an LCS opener on FOX since at least 2001 (19 telecasts) — ahead of only last year and Tigers/Rangers in 2011 (3.5, 5.8M). \nKansas City was the top market with a 41.3 rating, up 30% from Royals/Orioles last year (31.7) and the market’s highest Royals rating on record outside of the World Series. St. Louis (8.1), Hartford (6.3), Boston (5.8) and Ft. Myers (5.6) rounded out the top five. \n(Fri. numbers from Fox Sports) Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:17:57.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
