His determined run carried him out of midfield and into position to curl home a sumptuous winner and erase any lingering doubt about the Impact’s place in the postseason.\n“Piatti is top class in this league,” Revolution defender Chris Tierney said. “If you give him a little bit of space, he’s going to punish you. That’s the way that this season is going. If we want to make the playoffs, we’re going to play teams with players who are capable of doing that. So we have to tighten things up.”\nMore than likely, the Revs (47 points, minus-1 goal differential) will seal their postseason berth next Sunday. Orlando City (44, minus-9) requires a win at Philadelphia, a Revs loss at New York City FC and a massive goal difference swing to cap its expansion season with a playoff berth.\nThose realities did not mask the disappointment of a tepid display in front of the large crowd and the inability to break down an opponent willing to sit deeply, soak up pressure and wait for the opportunity to decide the game.\n“When you have a couple of guys just a little bit off against a team that is back behind the ball, it’s tough to break them down,” Revolution coach Jay Heaps said. “We were just a little bit off.”\nMost of the blame fell squarely on the Revs — now winless in the past four matches (0-3-1) — for failing to take advantage of their superiority in the opening half-hour. Jermaine Jones had an early opener correctly ruled out for offside, while Lee Nguyen squandered the Revs’ best opportunity when he fired straight at Evan Bush after Juan Agudelo prompted him with an intelligent cross.\nMontreal eventually found a foothold in the game with the Revs lacking imagination and impetus in possession. The solid Impact foundation — even in the absence of suspended center back Laurent Ciman — held firm and paved the way for the odd chance on the break. Donny Toia missed an open header at the back post after a wonderful Didier Drogba free kick as the Impact located their footing.\nPiatti provided something tangible to protect with his sumptuous finish early in the second half. The deficit prompted renewed intent from the Revs in the final half-hour, but their efforts petered out without mustering the necessary incisiveness.\nImpact substitute Patrice Bernier screwed a wonderful chance high in second-half stoppage time, but he and his teammates celebrated at the final whistle nevertheless. They accomplished their objective on this night and left the Revs with work to do against NYCFC as the regular season winds to a close next Sunday.\n“We have to go into New York and we have to get a result,” said Revs midfielder Scott Caldwell, who was named team MVP in a fan vote earlier in the evening. “We want to get points there and go into the (playoffs) with a little bit of momentum.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:45:29.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
