Ricky Gonzalez, of Chasing Tides charters in Vero Beach, said the fall mullet run ignited the snook and tarpon. He said the best time for the silver kings is right at first light and right before sundown. They can be caught almost everywhere in the Indian River Lagoon right now with the best places being in the residential canals. Finger mullet and pinfish will work very well. Other catches while targeting tarpon will include snook, jacks and redfish. \nST. LUCIE COUNTY \nCapt. Mark Dravo, of Y-B Normal charters in Fort Pierce, said the fishing in the Indian River Lagoon has been a little tricky. The fish are feeding on the mullet schools, but it is hard to get them to eat anything else. Fishing with three boats Wednesday, Dravo said the group had a tarpon, snook, jacks, redfish and flounder for each boat. Some fished as far north as Round Island. Others fished as far south as Big Mud Creek. \nMARTIN COUNTY \nCapt. Dave Knight, of the Lady Stuart partyboat, sailed Friday out of the Hutchinson Island Marriott Marina in Stuart. His customers caught dolphin, porgies, mangrove snapper, almaco jacks and more. The seas were about flat calm. Fishing will improve as clarity improves along the sea floor around the reefs. Expect grouper, amberjacks, kingfish and cobia to also be included in the reef fishing catches. \nLAKE OKEECHOBEE \nCapt. Mike Shellen, of Okeechobeebassfishing.com, said the shellcracker and bluegill reports have been a little slow since not many anglers are fishing for them. Also, only a few specks (also called speckled perch or crappie) are being caught, mainly because there are few anglers targeting them. The fish that are being caught are coming from the fast-moving water out the canals or other areas where water is flowing into the lake. \nTo file a report: Contact Ed Killer at ed.killer@tcpalm.com, call 772-221-4201, text at 772-285-1666 and follow him on Twitter @TCPalmEKiller.
