Elon, while unranked and residing at the opposite end of the conference standings, holds a removed but unique position in regard to these proceedings. The Phoenix is the lone team, in the league or otherwise, that has played both No. 4 James Madison (7-0 overall, 4-0 CAA) and No. 11 Richmond (5-1, 3-0). And what’s more, each of those games has occurred during the last two weeks — with Elon falling 27-14 at Richmond and then 51-0 against James Madison. Whether Elon coach Rich Skrosky will make a surprise analyst appearance on the College GameDay broadcast from James Madison’s campus seems like a long shot. But for this purpose, his insider’s perspective on the Dukes and Spiders trumps anything that Kirk Herbstreit or Desmond Howard could provide. “It’ll be interesting,” Skrosky said. “A neat game if you’re a fan. They are both very good teams that are the antithesis of one another.” Skrosky’s principal key for Saturday: Richmond’s patient defensive approach, which rarely relies on blitzing, versus James Madison’s fast-breaking, no-huddle system that ranks first in the FCS in total offense (613 yards per game), second in scoring (48.7 points per game) and third in rushing (333 yards per game). “Richmond’s defense directs the ball very well,” Skrosky said. “It’s basically a nine-man front with where they play their safeties. They’re very patient on defense and I think that’s a great formula to have a chance against JMU. “Now, can they slow them down, I don’t know. But I think the way (the Spiders) play, and I think they have good personnel and they tackle pretty well, if there’s a team to do it, it’s them.” Skrosky said he has sensed a palpable confidence from the up-tempo Dukes, led by stud quarterback Vad Lee, who cranks out a combined 369 yards per game as a passer and runner. Skrosky invoked the FCS national championship Appalachian State teams from Elon’s time in the Southern Conference and the hallowed name of former star quarterback Armanti Edwards in drawing a comparison to James Madison. “They’re different than what App was with Armanti, but they’re in that ilk for sure,” Skrosky said. “When I watch JMU that’s who they remind me of. No huddle. Spread you out. Run the quarterback. Can throw it good enough to create big plays. Explosive. Page 2 of 2 - “JMU, they’ve got a lot of swag, but they’re playing hard. Coming into our game, ‘Are they looking ahead? Are they thinking a little too much of themselves?’ Right from the get-go they were locked in and focused. And they played a good football game.” On the flip side, Skrosky said the James Madison defense’s belief in man coverage will present Richmond quarterback Kyle Lauletta (who ranks second behind Lee in the CAA’s passing and total offense numbers) with 1-on-1 matchups for receivers Brian Brown and Reggie Diggs, a tandem that many consider to be the best in the CAA. Richmond’s methodical balance on offense could become paramount by keeping Lee, running backs Khalid Abdullah and Cardon Johnson and the rest of the Dukes offense off the field. The Spiders huddle and operate in a conventional manner, setting up play-action passes with their downhill running game. Two weeks ago, backs Seth Fisher and Jacobi Green both ran for more than 100 yards as Richmond subdued Elon. Then last week, Lauletta threw for 312 yards with nine completions going to Diggs for 142 yards in a rout of Rhode Island. “Will Richmond be able to run the ball effectively knowing there’s an extra guy in the box?” Skrosky said. “Will those running backs be able to step up? Will the quarterback be able to throw it to those wideouts? I think they’re capable of doing it. “I think the formula is there for Richmond, and they’re playing well. It’ll be a good game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:47:35.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
