The Dallas Stars entered camp this fall vowing to be better on offense, but that mission is not going well so far. The Stars lost 4-1 on Tuesday night and have now allowed 20 goals over five preseason games while compiling a 1-4-0 record.\nAdChoices Dallas coach Lindy Ruff is not happy.\n\"It was disappointing,\" Ruff said to reporters after Tuesday's loss . \"We didn't compete hard enough. I thought some guys did, but they won the puck battles, we threw some pucks away and I thought our power play played pond hockey. That was frustrating.\"\nThe Stars are giving goalies Antti Niemi and Kari Lehtonen both a chance to prove themselves in the preseason, but neither is stepping up as a No. 1 goalie. Niemi played in net Tuesday and stopped 24 of 28 shots for a .857 save percentage. He now has a .851 save percentage through two games, while Lehtonen is faring even worse with a .816 save percentage and nine goals against in two games.\nObviously some of those poor statistics fall on the defense, but after making defense a priority this offseason, the Dallas Stars will need to come up with some answers in their own zone quickly.\n(h/t Dallas Morning News )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-stars/headlines/20150929-heika-as-preseason-winds-down-stars-defensive-goaltending-issues-still-persist.ece", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:03:09.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
