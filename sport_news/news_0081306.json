Ketcham . \n(Game show host voice) Tell 'em what they've won! \nFor their efforts, the Admirals are being rewarded an all-expense-paid trip to John Jay High School! The sprawling Wiccopee compound features a regulation football field with standard dimensions and a raucous crowd with which Arlington may already be familiar. \nBut wait, there's more! \nIncluded in that package is heavy underdog status in the Class AA quarterfinals versus a pretty good Patriots team to whom they've lost seven straight. \nOh. Not exactly the prize most had anticipated? Well, them's the breaks. Thanks for playing the Section 1 seeding game! \nAs reported last week, there were several complaints about the seeds for the qualifying round and controversy surrounding the process and its mathematical formula. Was the multiplier altered without everyone's knowledge? Was it simply disregarded? Was the formula faulty to begin with? Those were some of the questions tossed about. \nAdmirals coach Dominick DeMatteo was one of the most ardent supporters of the refined seeding system, but last week he was vocal in criticizing a perceived calculation error. He insisted his team should have been seeded no lower than sixth, given its No. 2 preseason seeding and a 3-3 regular season record against the league's second-most challenging schedule. Instead, they were slotted eighth, which created that matchup with No. 9 Ketcham. Ketcham's Al Dockery, left, looks for an open teammate during Friday's game against Arlington. Alex H.
