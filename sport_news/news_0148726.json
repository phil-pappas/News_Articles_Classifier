John Farrell Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell talks to reporters before an interleague baseball game against the Miami Marlins on Aug. 11 in Miami. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) Comments \nCLEVELAND â€” Nobody should lose his job because he had to take a medical leave of absence to battle Stage 1 lymphoma. \nBut since Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell left the team Aug. 14 to under chemotherapy, ownership has hired a new president of baseball operations, Dave Dombrowski. \nA new head of baseball operations should have the right to hand-pick his own manager, right? \nAfter all, we witnessed the disaster that happened when Ben Cherington took over as GM and wasn't allowed to choose his own manager. Cherington wanted Dale Sveum but then-president/CEO Larry Lucchino intervened and picked Bobby Valentine. \nThe manager and head of baseball operations must be on the same page. They must work as a team. \nThat said, Dombrowski and the Red Sox announced today that Farrell will return to manage the 2016 Red Sox. Meanwhile, acting manager Torey Lovullo signed a two-year extension , waiving his right to interview for any managerial positions this offseason. \n\"I haven't had a chance to evaluate John at all as a manager,\" Dombrowski said. \"He's managed successfully at the big league level and they won a world championship in 2013. And so I think that in reality it's hard to find established major league managers that have won. I've talked to a lot of people that I trust. I look forward to working with him and hopefully with us working together. I think he deserves that opportunity to do so. \n\"But he has won a world championship so I guess time will tell,\" Dombrowski added. \"But I think that he has proven himself that he can win at the major league level. It's hard to find those type of guys. But the reality is I can't tell you I've had the chance to sit and work with him and evaluate. He's a knowledgable baseball person. He's well respected within the baseball community. But I can't say it's based upon anything I've observed because it's not other than really come to the conclusion that I think that it's the right thing to do from an organizational perspective. He's won before, he's deserved it. And we look forward to us bouncing back in 2016 with him as our leader.\" \nThe press release stated Farrell will return to the dugout \"provided a clean bill of health.\" \nHe completed chemotherapy treatments in Boston this past week. \n\"All indications are good,\" Dombrowski said about Farrell's health. \"He'll have some tests again in about three weeks to see where he stands at that point. ... In three weeks he'll have a little bit better feel. But right now he feels as he'll be OK for next year to move forward. The doctors have given that indication.\" \nThe two most important things Dombrowski said here: \n1. \"I can't say it's based on anything I've observed because it's not other than really come to the conclusion that I think it's the right thing to do from an organizational perspective.\" \nThat certainly makes it sound as though this decision was not his alone but one made by ownership. \nDecisions shouldn't be made for what looks best from an organizational perspective. \nWhat is best in terms of an organizational prospective is winning. Is Farrell the best manager for this team to win? \nDombrowski did mention that Farrell's resume includes a World Series title. \n2. \"He has won a world championship so I guess time will tell.\" \nDombrowski sounded somewhat unsure whether Farrell is the best choice to be the manager here. \"Time will tell\" sounds like Dombrowski will take time next year to evaluate Farrell like he took time this year to evaluate the coaching staff and the players. \nMaybe Farrell is Dombrowski's guy. Maybe Dombrowski feels he is the best choice based off what he's seen of him and the way he managed against Dombrowski's Tigers team in the 2013 ALCS. \nBut do we really know? Stealing Dombrowski's line, I guess time will tell. \nFollow Christopher Smith on Twitter @SmittyOnMLB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:01:33.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
