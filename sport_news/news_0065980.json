Stocks in Southeast Asia were also lower.\nCHINA SLOWDOWN: China's September imports fell by an unexpectedly wide margin of 20.4 percent from a year ago in a new sign of weakness in the world's second-largest economy, while exports also contracted even though the decline in exports was smaller than predicted. Customs data Tuesday showed Chinese purchases of foreign goods worsened from August's 5.5 percent decline, evidence of anemic demand despite repeated stimulus efforts aimed at reversing a decline in economic growth. Sales of Chinese goods to foreign markets fell 3.7 percent, an improvement from the previous month's 13.8 percent contraction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:19:39.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
