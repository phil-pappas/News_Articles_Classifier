Colleen Kane Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune What will the White Sox's new center-field video board look like in 2016? \nThe White Sox still are waiting on general manager Rick Hahn to announce any staff changes for next season, but the club did reveal a new addition Thursday that has been on its wish list for “a long time.” \nThree new video boards will be installed at U.S. Cellular Field in time for 2016 opening day, the team confirmed before Thursday night's game against the Royals. \nThe improvements will come one season after the Cubs unveiled their video board upgrades, but it's not about keeping up with the North Siders, according to Brooks Boyer, Sox senior vice president for sales and marketing. The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which owns and develops the ballpark, voted Wednesday to modernize boards that are both faulty and not up to the standards of stadiums throughout Major League Baseball. \n“It's great that the Cubs got their new boards,” Boyer said. “This is more motivated by the fact that the right-field and left-field (boards here) were falling apart and the center-field one was the smallest in baseball.” \nThe center-field video board, installed in 2003, is expected to more than quadruple in size from its current 1,484 square feet. According to an artist's rendering the authority provided, the new board will be shaped as a pentagon with multicolored digital pinwheels at the top. There won't be ads on the sides or bottom as there are on the current board. \nBoyer said the boards in left and right fields will remain about 2,500 square feet but will be much improved from the current ones, which he said can be seen flickering on any given day. He thinks the boards can help U.S. Cellular Field to be a “premier entertainment facility” for other events as well, though he wouldn't specify what those might be. \nISFA spokesman Michael Alvarez said the authority will fund the $7.3 million project through its capital repairs budget. No vendor for the project has been specified. \nThe Sox and the ISFA have an agreement that includes “replacing any obsolete component of the stadium with more modern replacements in use in at least 75 percent of (MLB) stadiums.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:07:24.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
