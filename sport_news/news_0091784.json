Pillar was bunted to second but left there when Ben Revere flew out to center and Josh Donaldson — who had a dustup with Volquez during the regular season — grounded out to shortstop. \n7:10 p.m. \nFlags were at half-staff at Kauffman Stadium to honor fallen Kansas City firefighters when the Royals' Edinson Volquez delivered his first pitch to the Blue Jays' Ben Revere to start Game 1 of their AL Championship Series. \nThe Royals have been memorializing Kansas City firefighters Larry Leggio and John Mesh, who were killed while responding to an apartment building fire this week. \nTwo other firefighters were hurt when the building collapsed late Monday, though both are expected to be fine. There were no serious injuries among the building's residents. \nMembers of the Royals wore T-shirts and hats honoring the Kansas City Fire Department during batting practice before their Game 5 victory over Houston in the divisional round. \n6:05 p.m. \nThe Royals are sticking with the same lineup they used against Houston in the divisional round, which means Alcides Escobar leading off for Game 1 of the ALCS. \nBen Zobrist, Lorenzo Cain, Eric Hosmer and Kendrys Morales are next, with Sal Perez, Alex Gordon and Alex Rios at the bottom of the order. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost put Escobar back in the leadoff spot late in the season, even though his lousy on-base percentage means the move goes against conventional wisdom. \nKansas City has been winning ever since. \nToronto manager John Gibbons also stuck with his typical order with Ben Revere at the top, followed by Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, and Edwin Encarnacion. \nChris Colabello got the nod at first base over Justin Smoak, with Troy Tulowitzki, Dioner Navarro, Kevin Pillar and Ryan Goins at the bottom of the Blue Jays lineup. \n5:20 p.m. \nThere was some thought that David Price would start Game 1 of the ALCS for Toronto, but manager John Gibbons went with Marco Estrada on regular rest instead. \nThat's led to another round of questions about how Price has been used. \nThe former Cy Young winner has a shaky playoff record, and wasn't particularly good in his start against the Rangers. So rather than rest him to start a potential ALCS opener, Gibbons used him in a 50-pitch relief stint that made him unavailable for Friday night. \nPrice is scheduled to pitch Game 2 against Kansas City on Saturday. \nGibbons said it was simply a matter of circumstances, and while he acknowledged Price pitched longer than most people thought he would, \"that was a little bit of strategy, too.\" \nAsked about the way he'd been used, Price replied: \"It doesn't matter. Whatever the team wants me to do to help them win. I'm all about it.\" \n4 p.m. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost wishes he had listened a bit more to John Gibbons when his Toronto counterpart was on his staff a few years ago. \nMaybe he'd have learned something to help the Royals in the ALCS. \nAfter Gibbons was fired by the Blue Jays in 2008 in his first go-around as their manager, he was hired that October by then-Royals manager Trey Hillman as a bench coach. Gibbons stuck around when Hillman was fired in May 2010, working for Yost through the 2011 season. \nAsked about those years together, Yost acknowledged before Game 1 on Friday: \"I didn't take full advantage of Gibby when he was here. At the time I was still a little on the hard-headed side and managed the game all by myself.\" \nGibbons said he harbors no ill will over their time together. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:10:40.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
