I can’t even put it into words.”\nBack to the Future Part II sees Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travel to the year 2015, and the Cubs winning the World Series was considered one of the movies more outlandish predictions.\n“Wait a minute,” McFly says as he reads sports bulletin projected onto the side of a building.\n“Who would have thought? A 100-1 shot,” an old man replies. “I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season and put some money on the Cubbies.”\nFans have been latching onto the Back to the Future link, dressing up as McFly and Doc.\nDoc and Marty are here!! #LetsGo @Cubs pic.twitter.com/AoqyCNMlgN\n— South Bend Cubs (@SBCubs) October 12, 2015 Back to the Future said Cubs would win in 2015! Just sayin. Now if I cud get a hoverboard for getting into my deer stand, that&apos;d be awesome!\n— Chipper Jones (@RealCJ10) October 14, 2015 The movie’s screenwriter, Bob Gales, said the Cubs winning the World Series was meant as a joke.\n“Whether the Cubs make it or the Cubs don’t make it, the joke will still be funny,” Gale said.\n“And if the Cubs do make it, then I’m a visionary.”\nThe Cubs, who had not won a playoff series since beating Atlanta in the 2003 National League first round, next face either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers to determine a berth in the World Series.\nThe Cubs, founded in 1870, have not won a World Series since 1908.\nWrigley Field, built in 1914, is among America’s most iconic sports venues, but the Cubs, who began playing there in 1916, had never before hosted a playoff victory celebration, clinching 1907 and 1908 World Series crowns in Detroit and a 2003 first-round triumph in Atlanta.\nWild celebrations as the Chicago Cubs defeat the Cardinals to win the NLDS at Wrigley Field.

Source: AFP\nHopes are building that this will finally be the season when the jinx ends, although there was late drama to be endured.\nMatt Carpenter hit a two-out single in the ninth for St. Louis to bring rookie Stephen Piscotty, who homered in the first inning, to the plate as the tying run.\nBut Cubs relief pitcher Hector Rondon struck out Piscotty to end the game and ignite a raucous celebration.\n“Hopefully this is just a taste of what’s about to come,” Rizzo said.\n“We just beat the best team in baseball. The whole city is going to celebrate this.”\nThe Cubs have not even reached the World Series since 1945, when Detroit beat them in seven games.\nChicago lost all seven World Series appearances between 1908 and 1945 and failed to reach the championship showdown in six National League playoff trips since the World Series of 70 years ago.\n— with AFP\nJump back to top\nsport breaking news 18:13 PM Live: Victoria closes on second spot 21:14 PM Heartache Hilton: Bulls down dogged CA XI 20:00 PM Giants unapologetic over Treloar, McCarthy 14:28 PM Fanning ‘upset’ by KFC’s shark attack ad 11:07 AM Proteas keeper equals Sachin Tendulkar", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a636c82be429857153e41eb7572fc4ea", "https://twitter.com/SBCubs/status/653695702472724480", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F14%2FFSD_141015_MLB_CARDINALS_CUBS_GM04.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/LetsGo?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Cubs", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADXs2C4Vmho", "http://t.co/AoqyCNMlgN", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b8e08b2bb1f88f0222590e3a6cb4d289", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2d3e073e17cbc1dc9f22c82889812a0f", "https://twitter.com/RealCJ10/status/654086317727346688"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:48:35.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
