Anderson heading into this season, but not enough to scare off fantasy owners — hence him sneaking into the first round of drafts just before the season started.\nMostly he inspired confidence, based on how he finished 2014. Through injury or poor performance or both, Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman couldn’t lock down the bellcow role. When it finally fell in Anderson’s lap, he took full advantage — he tallied 648 yards and eight touchdowns rushing, and another 131 yards and a score receiving over the final six games.\nThere was some worry Peyton Manning’s slump at the finish of last season would carry over into this season, allowing defenses to focus more on the running game. But that also meant Anderson likely was to get more chances, something likely to happen anyway in new coach Gary Kubiak’s offense.\nThe biggest worry was the offensive line, which underwent a massive overhaul. And the results thus far couldn’t be much worse.\nAnderson has yet to find the end zone through three games. But it gets worse: He hasn’t even topped 30 yards rushing in a game. But it gets worse: His per-carry average is a disgusting 2.3. But it gets worse: His offensive line isn’t magically going to become more talented.\nSo what’s the good news? Talent alone doesn’t make an strong O-line. You need continuity, and that comes with time spent playing together. So there is reason to believe we are seeing the worst of Anderson.\nBased on his phenomenal production at the end of last season, and the presumption the line will improve, the Madman is willing to buy low on Anderson, if the right deal can be found. Be before you do, realize there is a risk. There are no guarantees the line will get markedly better, but I am willing to gamble it will provided I don’t have to bet too much.\nIn the meantime, if you have a fantasy juggernaut and can afford to sit him, do so. But chances are his upside is better than what you have on the bench, in which case you play him. But steer clear in daily formats, where his price still is too high (DraftKings $5,900, FanDuel $6,900)\nBig weeks Derek Carr Photo: AP Derek Carr QB, Raiders; at Bears (DraftKings $5,300/FanDuel $7,000)\nThe Bears have given up eight passing TDs this season — including seven in the first two games. Carr is enjoying WRs Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree.\nKarlos Williams RB, Bills; vs. Giants (DK $3,400/FD $6,300)\nWith LsSean McCoy out, Williams becomes a must-start in season-long formats and a strong, affordable daily option — though he will have high usage. And the matchup isn’t bad either.\nMarvin Jones WR, Bengals; vs. Chiefs (DK $3,800/FD $5,500)\nThis isn’t a reflection of the Chiefs’ pass defense, which is better than its bottom-five ranking. But Kansas City will sell out on stopping A.J. Green, which should leave Jones open frequently.\nMartellus Bennett TE, Bears; vs. Raiders (DK $4,500/FD $5,500)\nThis is a case in which the distrust of all things Bears is outweighed by the trust in the Raiders’ defensive apathy against tight ends. Oakland has allowed more than 100 yards per game to TEs and five total TDs in three games — a group that includes also-rans Crockett Gillmore and Gary Barnidge.\nSmall weaks Ryan Tannehill Photo: Getty Images Ryan Tannehill QB, Dolphins ; vs. Jets (DK $6,200/FD $7,700)\nPut him on the bench indefinitely at this point, and certainly this week against the stout Jets defense. If CB Darrelle Revis plays, bench WR Jarvis Landry as well.\nJeremy Hill RB Bengals; vs. Chiefs (DK $6,500/FD $6,700)\nExpecting a Hill rebound long-term, but plan for another disappointing outing first. Chiefs rank second in fantasy points allowed by RBs. but with team likely in pass mode, heavy use of Giovani Bernard will cut into Hill’s opportunities.\nKeenan Allen WR, Chargers; vs. Browns (DK $7,000/FD $7,700)\nStellar Cleveland cover man Joe Haden had a rough go last week covering Amari Cooper. This just in: Keenan Allen is no Amari Cooper.\nSt. Louis D/ST, Rams; at Cardinals (DK $2,700/FD $4,400)\nThe sixth-highest scoring defense/special teams unit looks like a bargain in daily leagues, but employ judiciously. Arizona has showed they can score some points.\nTweet of the week Interesting stat: The #Eagles are 1-0 whenever Jonathan Papelbon attacks the National League's best player.\n— Mike Sielski (@MikeSielski) September 27, 2015 \nThe Decision \nPost fantasy Madman Drew Loftis and Roto Files columnist Jarad Wilk debate whom you should start this week :\nAndy Dalton vs. Cam Newton \nDrew : Dalton — Dalton can throw to A.J. Green, Marvin Jones, Tyler Efiert and Mohamed Sanu, and hand to Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard. Newton, who may be without RBs Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert, could find himself handing to Fozzy Whittaker while throwing to Philly Brown. Sounds like a bad episode of “The Muppets.”\nJarad : Newton — Newton has played without receivers and running backs his entire career, yet still has gotten the job done. In six career games against the Buccaneers, Newton has thrown for 1,414 yards and 10 TDs (he also has rushed for 281 yards and six TDs). If history tells us anything, Newton will get it done with his arm and legs, while Dalton may be in for a letdown (in three games after throwing for 300 yards last year, he completed just 55.2 percent of his passes while throwing for one TD and one INT).\nLast week : Drew 3 (Michael Crabtree — 36 receiving yards), Jarad 0 (Torrey Smith — 0 receiving yards)\nSeason series : Drew leads, 3-0\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under fantasy football", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:56:16.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
