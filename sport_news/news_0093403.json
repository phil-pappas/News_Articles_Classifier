The Black Hills Beast, based on a new 2015 Indian Scout, was customized to emulate the purpose built nature of historic hill climb motorcycles.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Transforming the look of the Scout started relatively easily with the addition of several new accessories including the 1920 Solo Saddle Seat (MSRP $379.99) and a set of the accessory laced wheels ($499.99 each). Custom details that set the bike apart include an elongated custom swingarm, custom handlebar, custom radiator shroud and front number plate with an LED headlight. The 100+ horsepower of muscle in the Scout powerplant chewed up the earth via a custom tire chain designed for maximum grip when charging up a hill.\n\"Building a hill climber seemed easy enough, but it posed some unique challenges,\" Says Doug Siddens. \"Enthusiasts know what a hill climber looks like - so some of the mods were logical - but scaling them to fit the new Scout was the key and took a lot of work and planning. We are very proud of the result and the reception that the bike got at such an important Sturgis milestone, the 75th anniversary.\"\n\"We put the bike into our custom photo booth for the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally,\" Says Indian Motorcycle Marketing Director Scott Meek. \"Loads of attendees climbed up and took photos on the bike. It was cool to see such a positive reaction and enable so many riders to experience a key piece of Indian Motorcycle’s performance heritage.\"\"We settled in on a design quickly,\" adds Nick Jaquez of IndianMotorcycles.net \"But none of it would have worked without the assistance of our suppliers and partners in this build. We cranked on it for a month and tossed out a few bits along the way - I do feel like we delivered one hell of a machine - and it was a blast getting it dirty too!\"\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 6 NEXT SLIDE >\nAdditional support for the Indian Scout Black Hills Beast came from Aeromach (Floorboards and heel shifter), Dobeck Performance (Engine tuning), Fox Shocks (Suspension), RPW USA (Exhaust), Starr Studios (Paint), Ricochet Customs (Powder coating), BTR Moto (Swingarm and tire chain), Zippers performance (Chain Drive Conversion) and Traxxion Dynamics (Front Suspension).Indian Motorcycle will continue to play with this gritty work of art through upcoming celebrations of custom Scout motorcycles, including the International Motorcycle Shows tour as part of the Scout Custom Series launched last year with the Wall of Death Scout, and now including the USO Scout and the Black Bullet Scout inspired by land speed racing.\nRelated: Indian Chief Classic - BEST CRUISER of 2015\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf6ueL.img&quot;}}", "http://cdn-api.ooyala.com/v2/syndications/a18c4a562046bdbfe942cf491a4dfd/feed?pcode=htZDIxOib2XLGFf6qedEtlNvln7l&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeWUbt.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA3cQLN&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Dave", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkREzI.img&quot;}}", "http://www.cycleworld.com/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;autosenthusiasts&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_L", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfadqL.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAeadnv&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Self-driving", "https://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos/"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:12:49.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
