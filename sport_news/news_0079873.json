The Tide went into a hostile environment, in bad weather, and smashed the Bulldogs to the tune of 38-10.\nNow, the Tide are back in the friendly confines of Bryant-Denny for a match-up against a 2-3 team who lost to Toledo.\nDoesn't sound too threatening, right?\nThink again, because this isn't your average ( er ... below average ... ) 2-3 team.
