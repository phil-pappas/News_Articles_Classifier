(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) more > By NOAH TRISTER   \nWith four teams remaining in each league, there are 16 possible matchups for the World Series. We could wait and see who makes it, but what fun is that? \nHere’s a list of every possible World Series matchup this year - and why each of them would be interesting. They’re listed in descending order of probability, according to figures from Fangraphs.com at the start of play Thursday. \n___ \nBLUE JAYS vs. DODGERS (12 percent) \nBaseball’s highest-scoring team goes up against Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, and Toronto gets a chance to avenge one of the city’s toughest defeats - a seven-game loss by the Maple Leafs to Wayne Gretzky and the Los Angeles Kings in the 1993 Campbell Conference finals. \nASTROS vs. DODGERS (10 percent) \nThese former NL West rivals have met once in the postseason. The Dodgers prevailed in a best-of-five series in 1981, beating Nolan Ryan in the finale. \nROYALS vs. DODGERS (9 percent) \nGreinke spent his first seven seasons with Kansas City. Since leaving, he’s pitched against the Royals three times and hasn’t won. \nBLUE JAYS vs. CUBS (8 percent) \nBonus points to anyone who manages to watch this series from the Rogers Centre hotel AND the Wrigley rooftops. \nASTROS vs. CUBS (7 percent) \nPurists, cover your eyes. This series would include the No. 2 wild card from each league. \nRANGERS vs. DODGERS (7 percent) \nPlenty of people remember that Adrian Beltre began his big league career with the Dodgers, but how many recall the 59 games Adrian Gonzalez played for Texas a decade ago?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:08:31.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
