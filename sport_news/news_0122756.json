It was cold, for one. And he was far from home, so he considered trying to join the team at Central Florida. \nBut Wainman, the Vikings' redshirt junior kicker, had committed to Olszewski when the coach plucked him out of Florida and gave him a chance to play immediately. The same was true for Augustana senior safety Chad Curry, who felt he had \"unfinished business\" after missing much of his senior year in high school with a fractured back and seeing his team lose the state championship game. \nWhen their coach left Northfield for Sioux Falls, the decision for Wainman and Curry was easy: Go with him. \nIn Olszewski's mind, Wainman and Curry were \"gems\" as far as Division III recruits went. \n\"I thought we stole some,\" Olszewski said. \nWainman made six of eight field goals his senior year in high school and made a 42-yarder. He also averaged 40.5 yards on punts for the year. Curry didn't start until his senior year in high school and then missed much of that season because of his fractured back. He received multiple injections for pain in his back and hip and one doctor told him to quit football altogether. \n\"I was like 'I'm not listening to this,'\" Curry said. \"So I went to another doctor.\" \nHe drew some interest from Division II and NAIA schools near his native Overland Park, Kansas, but decided to join the Oles, where he started eight games as a freshman and made honorable mention all-conference. Wainman also excelled as a freshman, earning second team all-conference honors as a kicker and honorable mention as a punter. He also showed a knack for tackling, earning an unnecessary roughness penalty for wrapping up a ballcarrier and driving him into the ground, which earned him the team award for hardest hit. \nBut the rigorous academic environment at St. Olaf made it tough for athletics and academics to coexist, and Curry was already thinking about transferring. His mother had warned him when they visited campus, but Curry paid little heed, which he quickly regretted. \n\"A month into it, I called her and I was like 'Yeah, you're right, this place isn't for me,'\" Curry said.

(Photo: Elisha Page - Argus Leader) \nCurry soon had a clear second option. The players at St. Olaf had no clue that any announcement regarding their coach was coming; Curry remembers being in the library with a few friends and getting a text from one of his high school coaches telling him that Olszewski was a finalist for the Augustana job. On Dec. 11, 2012, Olszewski was announced as the Vikings' new head coach. \nOlszewski wasn't allowed to approach players himself and try to get them to come to Augustana, but players could come to him and ask for advice on their future. For some, Olszewski didn't see them playing at the Division II level. Others were in an academic situation at St. Olaf that Olszewski couldn't tell them to leave in good conscience. \nWainman and Curry were different, though. They were both freshmen, so they hadn't formed the deep personal connections that would keep them in Northfield. They also were fully convinced that Olszewski was the man they wanted to play for and asked for their release from the Oles right away. \nCurry was the first to look at Augustana. He had some suitors calling when his release papers came through, but when he called Olszewski, the coach asked Curry to come visit Sioux Falls. Curry took a tour of the campus and the Vikings' facilities and committed shortly afterwards. \n\"I was like 'Where were you all day?'\" Wainman said. \"And he was like 'I met with coach OJ.'\" \nWainman's parents couldn't come visit Augustana, so after getting his release papers he visited the campus with his uncle and decided to join Curry in Sioux Falls. \nThe decision has paid off for both players. They've found plenty of playing time with the Vikings and also benefit from the scholarship advantages Division II offers over Division III. Most importantly, they get to play for the man who made them college football players in the first place. \n\"It's just a certain competitiveness and competitive edge that he brings that I don't think other coaches have,\" Curry said. \"It was something that drew me out of high school and still does. Every time that dude has a pregame speech, my heart's beating out of my chest, you know what I mean? It's awesome.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:55:05.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
