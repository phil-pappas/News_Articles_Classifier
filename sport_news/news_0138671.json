Kelly, who was a junior-college recruit at the time, watched the pushing and shoving on the opening kickoff. He saw the intensity.\n\"I kind of felt the rivalry that was really there,\" Kelly said.\nThat rivalry will continue Saturday morning at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, and it figures to be among the most ballyhooed meetings between Memphis and Ole Miss in more than a decade. The Tigers are ranked just 10 spots behind Ole Miss in the Amway Coaches Poll, at No. 22. The Rebels are No. 13 in The Associated Press poll. They haven't lost a game in a full calendar year. They'll be playing in their home stadium and coming off a bye week.\n\"They'll be a good team,\" Kelly said after Ole Miss' 52-3 win over New Mexico State on Saturday. \"They're undefeated. They're undefeated for a reason.\"\nOnly 73 miles separate the schools, creating overlap in fan bases and recruiting territory. The Rebels have five Memphis natives on their team and a head coach, Hugh Freeze, who spent more than a decade in the city as a high school football and girls basketball coach at Briarcrest Christian School. The Tigers, meanwhile, have 11 players from Mississippi on their roster.\nThough Memphis has not beaten Ole Miss since 2004, Freeze said the rivalry has become more heated as both programs have grown in recent years.\n\"There's no hiding that fact,\" Freeze said Saturday. \"Any time you play a team that's in close proximity to you, there's an element of rivalry there. And both teams having good seasons and a lot to play for, that just intensifies it.\"\nAfter Saturday's game, many Ole Miss players were unable to speak about the specific challenges the Tigers will provide because they had yet to watch film of Memphis. Kelly said he saw Memphis' nationally televised games against Cincinnati and South Florida and knows that it has a quarterback in Paxton Lynch who is \"able to throw it around a little bit.\" Senior wide receiver Laquon Treadwell said it's just another game.\n\"I'm pretty sure we're going to get their best game. They're going to get our best game,\" Treadwell said. \"They're undefeated, and that brings confidence. We know they'll give us their best shot, and they'll take our best shot, and we'll see who's standing at the end.\"\nFor Memphis, Saturday's game is an opportunity to knock off a ranked opponent and reach bowl eligibility far ahead of schedule. A win would likely vault the Tigers into the AP Top 25 and provide another significant boost to their national profile. For the Rebels, whose only loss of the season came at Florida this month, it will mark a steep step up in competition from last week; New Mexico State has lost 15 games in a row, and Memphis has won 12 in a row.\n\"We're ready to play,\" Ole Miss senior defensive back Mike Hilton said. \"They're an undefeated team, so they're trying to make a statement against us. And everybody knows how big the rivalry is between us. So it's going to be a fun one. We're ready for Saturday.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:30:52.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
