The Osprey duo, currently ranked the No. 50 doubles tandem in the country, opened play with a straight set semifinal victory over Georgia Tech's brother duo of Casey and Michael Kay, 6-4, 7-6. The win advanced the UNF pairing into the Regional finals against No. 23 ranked Diego Hidalgo and Gordon Watson from Florida, who topped the No. 1 ranked doubles team in the country, Georgia's Wagland/Smith, in the other semifinal. In the final match, Findel-Hawkins and Zuern used strong serving to battle in a tightly contested back-and-forth competition which saw the Gator duo eventually holding off the Ospreys for a hard fought, 7-5, 6-4, victory. \"I'm really proud of the guys and how they performed throughout the whole tournament,\" said head coach Mark Finnegan . \"We came up a little short today, but I was proud of the fact that the guys stuck to their doubles philosophy and plan. Give all the credit to Florida because they came up with some big shots in big moments.\" North Florida wraps up their fall tournament schedule Nov. 13-15 at the Dick Vitale Intercollegiate in Sarasota, Fla.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:47:40.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
