But the “wise guys” who make the betting lines do. I’ve been saying for years that, if people were serious about getting the college rankings right, they would have them done by the oddsmakers in Las Vegas. I’ll take the bookmakers rankings over the coaches poll – or a media poll – any day. The latest in a long list of examples why occurred Saturday night, when undefeated and nationally third-ranked Utah played at Southern Cal, which was coming off its third loss in four games – a 41-31 setback at Notre Dame. Yet the unranked Trojans were favored by 3.5 points. And won by 18, 42-24. If you thought that was an upset, think again. It’s not an upset when the team that’s favored wins. What the oddsmakers clearly knew, even if the pollsters didn’t, was the Utah was vastly overrated. Clearly, the Utes were not as good as many people who looked only at their record thought. I’d say that, obviously, Utah wasn’t the third-best team in the country, except that it apparently wasn’t obvious to the people who vote in the polls, even though it was crystal clear to the wise guys in Vegas. What should be obvious is that, if you want a line on which teams truly are the nation’s best, you should rely on the professional oddsmakers and not the know-nothings who look only at a team’s record when filling out their poll ballot.
