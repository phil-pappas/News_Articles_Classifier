Bush will likely assume the backup role to Carlos Hyde and provide a much-needed receiving threat out of the backfield against the visiting Green Bay Packers. \n“Reggie’s a playmaker,” wide receiver Torrey Smith said per the San Francisco Chronicle . “And you put him out there, he can run routes like a receiver and turn a simple run into a huge one for us. \n\"So we’re looking forward to having him back and I definitely think it’s going to take some pressure off (quarterback Colin Kaepernick ).\" \nSan Francisco has fallen behind by at least 24 points by halftime in each of its last two games, basically rendering the ground game useless. Bush has at least 40 catches in seven of his nine seasons and is the active leader among running backs with 466 career receptions. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
