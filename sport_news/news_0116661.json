This year, only January and April did not surpass records going back to 1880.\nClimate scientists blame man-made global warming and El Nino.\nThis is has been the hottest first nine months of any year. NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden said it would take a highly unlikely cold stretch the rest of the year for 2015 not to pass 2014 as the hottest on record.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:43:16.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
