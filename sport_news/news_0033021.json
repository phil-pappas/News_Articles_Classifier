The likeable Italian would be a popular champion should she overcome her seven rivals next week. \n\"I don't exactly know what my plans are as I need to first finish here,\" Pennetta told reporters on Saturday. \"I am really focused on my job, (I will) do what I have to do, finish this week and enjoy it a little bit as well.\" \nThe Italian limped out of her most recent tournament in Moscow earlier this week and the highest-ranked players in Singapore, Simona Halep and Maria Sharapova, have also suffered troubled build-ups to the season finale.
