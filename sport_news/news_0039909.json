Wa-Hi harrier Erika Leinweber self-motivates to her first cross country victory at Fort Walla Walla — but has her sights higher. Hector del Castillo, The Walla Walla Union-Bulletin Print this article Advertisement Day after day, week after week, for the last three years, long-distance running kept demanding Walla Walla High School’s Erika Leinweber push herself. Photo by Greg Lehman Leinweber crosses a bridge at Ft WW on her way to a recent victory. Her coach, Mike Locati, says her self-movitation climbs to levels unfathomable for most young athletes. Yet Leinweber had never captured a first-place medal at any of those cross country races until Sept. 24 at Fort Walla Walla, where the Wa-Hi junior who had grown accustomed to chasing competitors her first two seasons outran the 41 other Mid-Columbia Conference girls from start to finish over five kilometers, or 3.1 miles. “Her legs were tired,” Locati said. “We had been training all week. We had just gotten through four races in about two-and-a-half weeks. Her legs were sore, and she was tired. She didn’t have to totally gut it out, but we knew she could do it. “The biggest thing she has is her ability to take herself to a place where a lot of people wouldn’t go. She has a high pain tolerance.” Leinweber had set a new personal record the previous week in Seattle, where she completed the Sundodger Invitational’s 5K in only 18 minutes, 27.39 seconds. That followed her fourth-place finish out of 103 in the season-opener on Sept. 12 at Spokane. Fort Walla Walla’s course may have taken more than a minute longer to finish (19:34.9), but Leinweber would tell you she had a great time, regardless what the spotwatch said. She outpaced the runner-up by more than 15 seconds. “I always like running at home, getting all of your family and friends and people you know to cheer you on. That’s always really nice,” Leinweber said. “The second time I went up the hill, about two miles into it, I felt so tired I wanted to slow down. But I saw my teammates cheering me on, on that hill, and I knew that I just had to keep pushing through that.” Two years earlier, as a freshman midway through the annual Fort Walla Walla meet, Leinweber was prepared to declare it her last race. Leinweber’s experience running cross country actually goes back to only her first year at Wa-Hi. She had instead played soccer throughout elementary school with the Walla Walla Parks & Recreation program. But upon starting the ninth grade, she followed in the footsteps of two older sisters, Kayla and Emily, and her older brother, Jacob, and joined the program as its fourth Leinweber. Erika’s 2013 season warmed up with a couple of shorter 2.5-mile races, including an intrasquad competition, before she went on her first 5K at Fort Walla Walla. The rookie finished in the middle of the pack, 19th out of 37. “I came across one mile into the 5K and I told myself that if I finished the race, ‘You can quit cross country’ because I wasn’t liking it so much,” Erika said, “but I stayed with it.” Leinweber steadily improved as that first season progressed until it concluded with the state championship meet at Sun Willows in Pasco, where she ran alongside six varsity teammates and finished with her best 5K of the season. The following year, as a sophomore, with her younger sister Katie joining the team, Erika regularly placed in the Top 5 at each race on the heels of two seniors runners: Lindsey Bradley of Richland, the eventual state champ, and Wa-Hi’s Courtney Cox, now a runner at the University of Portland. Both Erika Leinweber and Cox finished the season with a return to the state meet, where Leinweber improved over the previous year by almost 40 seconds and jumped from 79th place out of more than 140 girls to 31st. This year, Leinweber has emerged as one of Wa-Hi’s leaders. “She’s an ideal athlete,” Locati aid. “One of the things you have with Erika is you have somebody with holds a strong reputation with multiple facets. She never stops working hard, she’s made herself a great athlete, she’s terrific in academics, she’s just a great person who gets along with everybody on the team. She’s an ideal athlete, the kind you love to coach.” Leinweber has balanced a full schedule each year at Wa-Hi, maintaining a 4.0 grade point average in seven classes — her junior-year workload having increased with advanced placement English — while running cross country in the fall before switching to track-and-field’s distance events come springtime. The track in warmer weather had already given Leinweber tastes of victory. Running an eight-lap (3,200 meters) marathon at the Davis Invitational in Yakima as a freshman in 2013, she beat 24 other girls. Last year, she reclaimed the title. She also teammed with Cox, her sister Emily, and Talyah Nelson as each raced a lap and they won the 1,600-meter relay at Lewiston. A month later, the team of Erika, Cox, Emily and Colleen Gibbons bested Spokane Valley’s relay. Fort Walla Walla may have been Erika’s first-ever victory in cross-country, but the rest of this season offers her more chances to continue building on the success she has gradually developed over the last three years. “She’s the fourth Leinweber in our program, and her younger sister (Katie) runs for us, too,” Locati said. “The whole family is like that. You can tell she’s the kind of person she is because of her family and their support. We’ve been blessed to have that family as long as we have. “She has a younger brother, Jack,” he said. “We don’t think he’ll run, but who knows? Maybe we’ll get lucky.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:06:37.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
