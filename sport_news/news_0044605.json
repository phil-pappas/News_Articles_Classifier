Encina) \n\"We need to focus on a stronger pitching staff. I know we've got plenty of free agents to sign, but any informed analysis of a team is you've got to have a good pitching staff,\" Duquette said. \"That's where it starts and that's where we're going to put our focus in the offseason.\" \nWhen asked if he thought the club would be able to purchase a free agent ace — the top of the class is led by David Price, Johnny Cueto and potentially Zack Greinke — and still have a chance at retaining Davis, who could demand a six-year or longer contract worth $20 million or more annually, Duquette said he was hopeful. \n\"I don't know what the final market's gonna be for Chris Davis, but having looked at some of the other contracts, it's gonna be a lot of money. And we're gonna have to weigh the competitiveness of the team and the need of the team to staff a strong pitching staff,\" Duquette said. \"I don't know where the money's going to end up, but we have enough resources in this market to field a competitive team and our aim is to do that again in '16.\" \nThe absence of Davis, who led the majors with 47 homers this season, would create a huge offensive hole on a club that had only two other players hit more than 15 homers in Manny Machado (35) and Adam Jones (27). \n\"Chris Davis is a very compelling player, because he hits prodigious home runs. And the club understands that value,\" Duquette said. \"Having said that, there's a lot bigger markets that are out there than this market. So I don't know where that's going to end up. But we like Chris Davis. We tried to sign Chris Davis. We'd like to have him back for next year.\" \nThe Orioles entered this season with a payroll around $119 million, 13th of 30 teams in the majors and the largest in their history. But they constructed the roster without retaining three high-profile free agents, outfielders Nelson Cruz and Nick Markakis and reliever Andrew Miller, all of whom signed four-year deals elsewhere. \nThis year, there are six that could leave for more lucrative deals: Davis, starter Wei-Yin Chen, reliever Darren O'Day, catcher Matt Wieters, outfielder/infielder Steve Pearce and outfielder Gerardo Parra. \nThree — Davis, Chen and potentially Wieters — could be made qualifying offers this offseason, meaning a one-year deal for 2016 at approximately $16 million. If the player rejects the offer, the Orioles would then get a compensatory draft pick if that player signs elsewhere. Of the 34 that have been made the offer in the past, no one has accepted it. \n\"The qualifying offer is under consideration for all those players,\" Duquette said. \"The club has to decide that by the end of the World Series, so we're currently working on that.\" \nHe said they are also working on potential trades and minor league signings as well in hopes of improving the club's obvious deficiencies, including more hitters with higher on-base percentages. \n\"We could do a better job of finding guys that get on base and that's gonna be one of our priorities this offseason,\" he said. \"So that when you need a run or when you hit a home run you've got a guy on base.\" \nUltimately, Duquette said he believes the foundation is still there, but proper changes must be made to get the Orioles back to the playoffs. \n\"We have some things to build on. We have got a decent talent base in our organization already,\" Duquette said. \"We've got a lot better players in our farm system than the perceived value of those players out there. And you'll see next year, when we get to spring training, you'll see some good players come up through the Orioles farm system.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:19:02.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
