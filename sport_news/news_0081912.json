Again, I think you always have to evaluate at the end of the year.” \nJames said he received several phone calls and emails after UM’s loss at Cincinnati on Oct. 1. \n“We have a very passionate fan base, so any time we lose, there’s passionate feedback. There’s passionate feedback when we win,” he said. “I fully expect I’ll get emails post-game tonight, whether we win or lose. Obviously, everyone wants to win.” \nUM pays its fifth-year coach $2,539,315, according to a USA Today report on FBS coaching salaries released this week. His pay, which does not include any potential bonuses, ranks 42nd of the 121 the newspaper was able to report and is behind at least seven ACC coaches. \nGolden, whose Hurricanes were 3-1 (0-0 ACC) entering Saturday’s game at No. 12 Florida State, is under contract through Feb. 1, 2020. \nHow does Golden, who is 31-23 at Miami and 58-57 in his career, compare to his peers who make about the same? \nHe’s a better value than Mike Leach ($2.75M), who is 14-27 at Washington State, but not Kyle Whittingham, who is 88-43 at Utah and had his fifth-ranked Utes 4-0 entering Saturday. Northwestern’s Pat Fitzgerald ($2.49M) is 65-53, but his 13th-ranked Wildcats were 5-0 before Saturday’s loss to Michigan. Golden also makes Stanford’s David Shaw ($2.25M) look like a bargain hire: the 16th-ranked Cardinal is 46-13 under Shaw and 4-1 this year. \nHe earns less than at least seven other ACC coaches: FSU’s Jimbo Fisher (approximately $5.15M, not including bonuses), Clemson’s Dabo Swinney ($3.305M), Virginia’s Mike London ($3.198M), Louisville’s Bobby Petrino ($3M), Georgia Tech’s Paul Johnson ($2.8M), Virginia Tech’s Frank Beamer ($2.775M) and Boston College’s Steve Addazio ($2.586M). \nKicker greets Canes: Seminoles kicker and Lou Groza Award winner Roberto Aguayo was involved in a pregame tiff with several Hurricanes. During warmups 70 minutes before the game, he decided to do part of his warmups on UM’s half of the field. Hurricanes safety Rayshawn Jenkins, a Tampa native, took exception. \nAguayo stuck out his hand, but Jenkins didn’t shake it. The two conversed animatedly, and UM cornerback Ryan Mayes, a redshirt freshman from Miami, came over and shoved Aguayo on the shoulder. \nA Seminoles staff member rushed in to grab Aguayo, and Mayes got in another shove before several Hurricanes staff members got in front of a swelling group of UM players. \nHall call: Former Hurricanes running back Willis McGahee, tight end Kellen Winslow and offensive lineman Joaquin Gonzalez were among eight named to the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame. The 2016 class also includes John Jay (baseball), Will Allen (men’s basketball), Tamara James (women’s basketball), Megan Bradley (women’s tennis) and swimming coach Charlie Hodgson. The group will be recognized at halftime of UM’s Oct. 24 game against Clemson and officially enshrined next April. \nIn the house: Two Miami natives of note showed up on the sidelines before the game: New York Yankees veteran Alex Rodriguez, a UM fan and trustee, and Laurence “Marlins Man” Leavy. Rodriguez, whose team was eliminated from the playoffs Tuesday, attends Hurricanes games occasionally, and showed up for UM at FSU in 2013. Leavy always seems to show up everywhere. \nBanner day: The weekly anti-Al Golden banner, flying over Doak Campbell Stadium three hours before kickoff, read: “UM ADMIN LOWERED THE BAR — WE HAVEN’T #FIREALGOLDEN”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:05:48.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
