The Northeast Portland sanctuary celebrated the 25th anniversary of the festival in 2012.\nChoirs from Lane Middle School and Grant, Cleveland, Wilson and Lincoln high schools were set to perform this year, according to district spokeswoman Christine Miles. She didn't know exactly how many years district choirs had participated, but said one retired teacher told her it had been decades.\nHowever a complaint from the Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation has put a stop to the tradition. The foundation's goal is to promote the separation of church and state, according to its website.\nThe district received a complaint from the foundation citing concerns with students performing at a religious venue and that admission is charged for the festival, Miles said. She said the district's legal team reviewed the complaint and found that the district could be at risk of legal action if choirs continued to participate. The district informed staff of the decision last month.\n\"It was a sad decision for us to make and it was a hard decision,\" Miles said. \"If we know there is a legal risk and we don't do anything, then that's not the right thing to do.\"\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, said student participation at a religious event shows endorsement for that faith and leaves out non-believers.\n\"Just because it's a tradition doesn't mean its legal,\" Gaylor said. \"Whole generations of students in Portland are being sent the message that it's fine for public schools to promote Catholic events.\"\nGaylor said she appreciated the district's decision. She didn't know if the foundation had also received complaints about other schools performing at The Grotto.\nChoir directors are disappointed that their students will miss out on performing in The Grotto's chapel, which is known for it's high quality acoustics, Miles said. She said the district had never gotten a complaint about the festival before.\n--Laura Frazier\nlfrazier@oregonian.com\n503-294-4035\n@frazier_laura", "external_links": ["http://ffrf.org/", "https://twitter.com/frazier_laura", "http://www.thegrotto.org/christmas/", "http://www.thegrotto.org/about-us/"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:07:21.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
