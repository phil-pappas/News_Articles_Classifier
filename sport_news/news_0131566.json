Yet also with increasing regularity computers are being given increased control of our lives.”\n“With crime out of control, a former police chief in federal prison and other police officers under investigation, how can anyone claim ‘Proven Leadership’? Savannah City Council: Can we get our police department issues handled? It is frustrating that we have too many vacancies and cannot patrol the high crime areas. Maybe it’s time for new blood on city Council.”\n“Kudos to the Tybee Island Police Department for their Citizens’ Police Academy. We had no idea how well educated and well trained our Tybee Police are. They are one smart police department!”\n“Please tell me why Al St Lawrence isn’t being held accountable for all the missteps at the Chatham County jail? He seems to be missing in action. He needs to step down if he can’t handle his responsibilities.”\n“Jack Fitzgerald wrote a nice letter to the editor hoping the county would make repairs at the Henderson Golf Course. My response is to take a good look at the horrible condition of U.S. 17. The grass hasn’t been cut in months. The median is full of trash and has never been edged. The county will never make the repairs you want.”\n“There are some nice people in Pooler. When I fell at the Enmark Gas Station on Wednesday, many people came to my aid.”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or emailing us at vox@savannahnow.com .
