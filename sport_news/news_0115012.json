But in their final game, they ran into perhaps the very best of the bunch in Remus-Chippewa Hills junior quarterback DeAngelo Lowery. Unfortunately for the Chiefs, he was as good as advertised and then some. Lowery accounted for 324 total yards and five touchdowns to lift the Warriors to a 46-7 victory over the Chiefs at Western Avenue Field in the regular season finale for both teams on Friday. “He’s pretty electric, he touches the ball and big things happen right away,” said Cheboygan head coach Dave Schulz, discussing Lowery’s stellar performance that included four passing touchdowns in the first half. “He made good plays, he’s a good football player, but we had a slow start. That’s unfortunately one of our worst starts we’ve went through this year, when last week (against Bay City John Glenn) was one of our best.” That slow start for the Chiefs included a 94-yard touchdown pass from Lowery to Cole Dangler on the opening play of the contest, helping the Warriors jump out to an early 8-0 lead. “That (touchdown) was really huge for us,” said Chippewa Hills head coach Larry Jose. “My expectation was certainly not a 94-yard touchdown pass. We just thought we could take advantage of the coverage there, and it was better than expected. It was a great catch (by Dangler), he made a kid miss, and he just showed he was a good athlete for us.” On the very next possession, Lowery struck again on a 40-yard TD pass to Gonzalo Rubio to increase the lead to 15-0 with 5:10 left in the first quarter. Lowery was far from finished as he tossed TD passes to Spencer MacKenzie (32 yards) and Adams (seven yards) to help the Warriors build a commanding 29-0 lead after one quarter. “We count on him (Lowery) a lot, he’s big for us,” Jose added. “He’s a junior, and he’s made some junior mistakes this year, but he’s getting better every week. He’s just getting a lot more confident now.” Despite the dreadful first quarter, the Chiefs (1-7) got on the board thanks to a 65-yard touchdown drive that was capped off by a four-yard run from senior quarterback Zach Socha. A made PAT by Jeff Ostman cut Cheboygan’s deficit to 29-7 with 7:38 left in the second. The Chiefs had another chance to get back into the game on their next possession, but a deep ball from Socha intended for senior Logan Mills on fourth down fell incomplete. Page 2 of 3 - While Lowery clearly proved he could throw the ball well, he also displayed an ability to hurt the Chiefs with his legs, scampering 51 yards for a touchdown to help move the Warriors’ advantage back up to 36-7, a lead they would take into halftime. Despite the deficit, Schulz praised his team’s ability to battle back with a pair of strong offensive possessions in the first half. “It’s just an example of the ability of these guys to be relentless and resilient against bad things that happen,” Schulz said. “A lot of people just throw in the towel and give up and say that’s the way it is, but these guys are still going to execute and play the best football they can play. They don’t let it keep them down, and that’s what makes us proud of these kids every day.” On the night, the Warriors (7-2) used a 503-145 advantage in total yards to dominate the contest, with Lowery tossing for 216 yards and rushing for 108. The Chiefs also hurt themselves by committing four turnovers on the night. Junior fullback Ethan Campeau led Cheboygan’s offense with 48 yards rushing, while Socha tallied 32, Austin Sidelinker had 16, Dan Pearson had 14, Mike Radle had nine, and Logan Mills had seven. Socha tallied just 19 yards passing in the game, throwing an interception. Mills finished with 10 yards receiving. Defensively, Sidelinker led Cheboygan with nine tackles, while Trent Brandau (fumble recovery) and Jack Ormsbee each had eight, Pearson (forced fumble) and Campeau each had seven, Dylan Socolovitch (sack, forced fumble) had six, Socha and Garrett Lindgren each had five, and Dalton Oikarinen had four. For Schulz, it was a disappointing end to his first season at the helm for Cheboygan. “Everybody’s going to look at how many wins we got and how many losses we got, so I’d say from that standpoint it’s not so good,” Schulz said. “I gotta look back and I gotta evaluate not only myself but the other parts of my program and coaches, and see where we can make improvements and be better next year. “I believe in what we’re doing. That, to me, that’s what’s going to keep us progressing forward is believing in what you do, do it the right way, not be afraid to work hard and grind it out. There ain’t quick and easy fixes to everything in life like a lot of people want to think, and playing good football ain’t a quick and easy fix either. You’ve gotta play hard and tough football, and you’ve gotta play with integrity, so that’s what we’re working for.” Page 3 of 3 - Friday night marked final game for the Cheboygan senior players Alex Chasse, Ryan Dorey, Brandon Heath, Tristan Jarman, Garrett Lindgren, Logan Mills, Dalton Oikarinen, Dan Pearson, Dominic Reese, Dylan Shampine, Austin Sidelinker, Zach Socha, Dylan Socolovitch and Travis Thompson. While Cheboygan’s season is complete, Chippewa Hills will wait to see who it faces in the state playoffs, which start next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:56:18.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
