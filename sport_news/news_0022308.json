And yet that’s what happened as the No. 23-ranked and previously unbeaten Golden Bears fell in front of a sellout crowd at Rice-Eccles Stadium.\nSo the question remained, were Goff’s gaffs just an outlier or were they the result of the Utes ’ stout defense?\n“Just made too many mistakes to win the football game,” Dykes said.\nIn the moments after a tough loss like the one Cal suffered Saturday, coaches like Dykes bring their competitive spirit into the interview room.\nA 40-point blowout and, yes, the other team was simply too dominant. But in a six-point loss, on the road, with a chance to win the game in the closing minutes? Well, that’s a different matter.\nAnd so Dykes tiptoed on the fine line between “they beat us” and “we gave it to them.”\n“Got to give Utah a lot of credit. That’s a good football team and they played really hard,” Dykes said. “We turned the ball over six times, but they had a lot to do with that as well. So you have to give them credit. That’s two football teams that played really hard and it was a very good football game.”\nComing in to Saturday’s game, Goff had thrown just four interceptions while completing 70 percent of his passes and racking up 15 touchdown passes.\nAgainst the Utes he went 25 for 47 for 340 yards and two TDs and those five pesky picks.\n“They mixed stuff up pretty well,” Goff said of Utah’s secondary. “They were good at changing stuff and keeping me on my toes. I mean, they’re one of the best defenses in the country for a reason. They played pretty well tonight.”\nAnd perhaps showing a bit of that competitive spirit, Goff made a passing reference to the fact Utah had two weeks to prepare for the Bears.\n“But that’s not to take anything away from them,” he added. “They played really well.”\nDykes said the same things: give the Utes credit, they’ve got a good defense, they played hard.\nHe also said he felt his players — Goff in particular — were pressing a bit in the face of such a big game.\n“We’ll look at the tape and talk to (Goff) a little bit,” Dykes said. “He struggled a bit tonight. I think we all wanted to win really badly, especially Jared. Sometimes when you want to win really badly, you might try to do a little too much. Next time we’ll react differently.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:49:36.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
