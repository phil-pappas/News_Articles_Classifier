The Royals lead the AL Championship Series 3-2. \nMurphy broke the postseason mark set by Houston's Carlos Beltran in 2004 with a two-run drive in the eighth inning. \nLucas Duda homered and drove in five runs. Travis d'Arnaud also connected as the Mets advanced to their first World Series since 2000. \nKris Bryant homered for Chicago, but a championship drought dating to 1908 continues. Joe Maddon's young team had many believing this might be the year, but the Cubs did little against the Mets' fresh aces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:38:17.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
