(AP) — Following his first game as Maryland's interim coach, Mike Locksley lamented his team's five turnovers and its inability to win a tight contest.\nGiven everything that preceded Saturday's 31-30 loss to Penn State, keeping it close was an improvement.\nLocksley was promoted from offensive coordinator to interim coach on Oct. 11 after Randy Edsall was fired in the wake of three straight losses by a combined 122-34 score.\nIn his debut, Locksley got everything he asked from the Terrapins in terms of effort. Unfortunately, three interceptions and two lost fumbles — along with a porous pass defense — were too much to overcome.\n\"The mark of a good team is one that doesn't beat itself, and we did just that,\" Locksley lamented.\nThe Terps couldn't finish, either, despite taking a lead into the fourth quarter.\n\"Good teams find a way to win these games,\" Locksley said.\nMaryland (2-5, 0-3 Big Ten) gave Penn State (6-2, 3-1) all it could handle. But that was of little consolation to Locksley, who said: \"We're way beyond moral victories.\"\nHe added, \"What I did tell them is, 'If you can come in that locker room after a game like today and look yourself in the mirror and know that you did everything you could possibly do to win that ball game, then the scoreboard won't define you.'\"\nMaryland quarterback Perry Hills ran for 124 yards and went 19 for 28 for 225 yards and a touchdown. But he threw three interceptions and lost two fumbles.\n\"We were moving the ball pretty well today,\" Hills said, \"but things happen.\"\nChristian Hackenberg went 13 for 29 for 315 yards to help Penn State improve to 36-2-1 against the Terrapins. Chris Godwin had four catches for 135 yards and DaeSean Hamilton totaled 96 yards on his five receptions.\nHackenberg, a 6-foot-4 junior, became the school career leader in completions (608) and yards passing (7,453), displacing Zach Mills in both categories.\nPenn State went up 31-27 with 13:39 left when Hackenberg tossed a 27-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis.\nMaryland cut the gap with a field goal, and then recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff. But Hills fumbled it back as he was hit while throwing.\nThe Terrapins got the ball following a missed field goal try. Locksley opted to go for it on fourth-and-2 from the Maryland 36, and Hills was intercepted by Trevor Williams with 7:51 to go.\nMaryland had one turnover left, and it sealed the defeat. After the Terps took over at their own 25, Hills had a pass bounce off the arm of his receiver into the hands of Malik Golden with 1:15 remaining.\n\"He made some plays in the passing game and he made some plays with his feet,\" Locksley said of Hills. \"Where he can improve starts with his decision making in the passing game.\"\nThe Terrapins wore throwback uniforms patterned after the 1961 team. That was the year in which Maryland earned its lone win over the Nittany Lions at home.\nFor a while, it appeared as if that 44-year drought would end.\nMaryland moved 68 yards on its first possession of the third quarter to take a 20-17 lead. After Hills ran 36 yards to the 10, Brandon Ross scored on third down.\nHackenberg responded by completing a pass to Godwin for 31 yards, then throwing a 20-yarder to Hamilton for a touchdown. Both passes were put up for grabs, and on both occasions the receiver made the play.\nThe back-and-forth duel extended into the next drive, when Hills directed an 88-yard march that ended with a 10-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Lane, making it 27-24.\nThat laid the groundwork for an intense fourth quarter.\nPenn State led 17-13 at halftime despite being limited to 15 yards rushing and converting only once on third down.\nHackenberg went 7 for 16 before intermission, but his completions went for 196 yards — including a 37-yarder to Godwin, who made an outstanding one-handed catch in the end zone while his defender was being called for pass interference.\nMaryland led 13-7 in the second quarter despite committing two turnovers inside the Penn State 20.\n___\nAP college football website: http://collegefootball.ap.org\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
