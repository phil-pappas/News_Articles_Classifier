Then again, the defence pair of Morgan Rielly and Roman Polak were of little help. \nAthanasiou burst between the two, with Polak barely glancing at him, and beat Bernier with a wrist shot that was stoppable. \nDetroit increased its lead to 2-0 at 19:06 of the second when Anthony Mantha scored a power-play goal as public address announcer Andy Frost was giving notice of a holding penalty to James van Riemsdyk. Mantha took a pass from Athanasiou and fired the puck over Bernier. \nBrad Boyes scored for the Leafs at 22 seconds of the third period, his goal coming on Toronto’s 22nd shot. The puck pinballed behind goalie Petr Mrazek before Boyes tapped it into the net. \nCoach Mike Babcock knew it would be a long road to get the Leafs back to respectability. With the pre-season done, and final cuts coming in the next day or two, he has a better grip on the fact little will come easy for this group. \n“What matters to me is we make the best decisions we possibly can,” Babcock said after the morning skate, referring to cuts. “We better know what we have before we get in a hurry to do something and then we find out later it was wrong. Being patient, I think, is important and we are going to do that.” \nterry.koshan@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:56:37.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
