They'll need to get off to faster starts here real soon. Why it hasn't happened more often with this veteran line is one of this season's great mysteries. The saving grace is the work the starting offense is doing in the red zone. The Buckeyes stretched their streak to 16 for 16 inside the 20, with 15 touchdowns, before it was snapped by the mop-up crew. The second half in microcosm was the play where Jalin Marshall looked to throw an option TD pass, but opted to cut back and stroll to the end zone through a hole wide enough for a tank. Elliott had the same hole on a 55-yard TD run that put him over 100 for the 13th straight game. \nGRADE: B \nRUNNING GAME \nTake away runs of 39 and 16 yards by J.T. Barrett, who did most of that work on his own, and the Buckeyes only had 57 yards on the other 20 runs in the first half. Ezekiel Elliott had just 15 yards on nine carries as he and his QB get used to being together again. It's probably too soon to expect them to be the complementary pieces from the get-go that they were by the end of last season, but at least we saw glimpses of it in the second half as both finished with more than 100 yards rushing. That's a good sign. The added dimension Barrett brings to the running attack with his breakaway ability should pay huge dividends. The only players stopping Barrett were his own teammates â€” receivers Michael Thomas and Jeff Greene colliding with him on separate running plays. \nGRADE: B \nPASSING GAME \nHow great was it to see J.T. Barrett looking left and then zipping a completion to the right? Did we ever see that from Cardale Jones? Barrett's timing isn't quite there yet with his receivers, which is to be expected. An athletic play by Michael Thomas (five catches, 103 yards) played a big role in their 50-yard TD hookup, and Braxton Miller made the catch of the year on a pass that seemed to hit every body part before resting in his hands while on his back. That 34-yarder set up a short TD run by Barrett in the second quarter, and then Barrett came back in the third quarter to throw a beautiful 30-yard TD strike to Curtis Samuel while taking a fist to the facemask. The greatest asset Barrett brings to the attack, and we saw some of that here, is getting everyone involved. \nGRADE: B \nDEFENSIVE LINE \nJoey Bosa, especially in the first half, looked like the first overall pick in next spring's NFL draft. Tommy Schutt, who had been playing well before needing wrist surgery, was hardly missed thanks to the way Bosa and his mates were getting after the quarterback. Fifth-year senior Joel Hale, making his first start for Schutt, got in on a sack, and he unleashed some emotion after the play. It can't be fun sitting on a team this talented. (Ask Brionte Dunn and Warren Ball on the other side.) After sitting out the opener on suspension, Bosa was quiet for four weeks, but has now had a sack in each of the last three games and is setting a tone that has this unit living up to preseason acclaim as maybe the best DL in the country. \nGRADE: A \nLINEBACKERS \nThe Scarlet Knights were the only team with two backs ranked among the Big Ten's top 10 in rushing yards per game. When they had some success on the ground early it looked like a repeat of what we've seen the last few weeks, with quarterbacks and tailbacks capitalizing on poor tackling. But the Buckeyes tightened things up in a hurry and an expanding lead forced Rutgers to the air. It was good to see Joshua Perry back out there after spraining his ankle last week, although it was a little bit of a surprise OSU didn't hold him out as a precaution with a bye week coming. \nGRADE: A \nDEFENSIVE BACKS \nCornerback Gareon Conley went across the field to make a diving interception, his second of the year. It was only the 12th takeaway this season, too low for a defense with this kind of athleticism. I've said it before and I'll say it again: this defense is functioning at its best when LB Darron Lee is wreaking havoc. It filters back to the secondary, but we haven't seen many impact plays from Lee lately. Nice open field tackles from safety Vonn Bell seem to be coming on a weekly basis, but corner Eli Apple showed terrible form on a missed tackle on Rutgers' opening drive. When that scoring threat fizzled on a failed 29-yard field attempt, that might have killed the will of a team already dealing with a number of hobbled players. \nGRADE: A minus \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nJalin Marshall isn't Ted Ginn Jr., but he had another nice punt return, covering 29 yards to set up a first quarter touchdown. In addition to an interception, Gareon Conley deflected a punt and the Buckeyes immediately capitalized on a 55-yard TD run by Ezekiel Elliott. Cameron Johnston punted once, and it was a rare clunker by him. The Buckeyes didn't attempt a field goal. Didn't need to. Let's keep it that way. \nGRADE: A minus \nCOACHING \nThe play-calling was very conservative at the outset. Maybe it's a road thing (remember Indiana?) or maybe Urban Meyer and his offensive staff just wanted to ease J.T. Barrett into the flow in his first start of his season. Everything came together in the second half, but it would be nice to see the Buckeyes get back to those fast starts that were a trademark of this offense in 2014. Defensively, they came within 13 seconds of a shutout, which didn't look like a possibility after Rutgers marched right down the field on its opening series. All in all, a good night for Luke Fickell's troops, but they need to come up with more turnovers. Eight games in and OSU is at minus-one in turnover ratio. The style points scored here, combined with losses by Utah and Florida State, are only going to help. \nGRADE: A minus 2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1S3DfVu MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:08:15.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
