They won their pool by beating Byron-Bergen in two games, Webster Thomas in two games, Fulton in two games and splitting with Mercy. Sutherland won the pool because they had one more win than Mercy. They faced Cazenovia in the quarterfinals, winning in two straight, then beat league rival West Irondequoit in the semifinals 25-12, 25-22 to get to the finals. Sarah Blowers and Savannah Bothner had big games against Mercy, combining for 17 kills. The middle tandem of Andrea Green and Hope Shuman added seven kills and two blocks. The Knights hosted Mendon Oct. 13 winning in straight sets 25-10, 25-7 and 27-25 after being down by eight points earlier in the third game. Freshman Kieran Nanavati had a big night with two aces and six kills, and her sister, junior Erina Nanavati, dished out eight assists and had one kill. The team traveled to Canandaigua for a league match on Oct. 14, coming away with a victory, 25-11, 25-7 and 25-14. Sisters Andrea and Rachel Green combined for two aces, nine kills and a block. Sarah Blowers blistered the Braves with her swings, accounting for 11 kills. Junior Giuliana Johnson had two aces as part of her streak of serving 10 points in a row. Andrea Allen contributed five aces, three kills, one block, 13 digs and 22 assists and Aliah Bowllan added three aces, five assists and 17 digs. Penfield visits Sutherland on senior night Oct. 16, and the Knights end their season on the road at West Irondequoit and Webster Schroeder. The team’s record is 7-0 league, 13-0 match play and 34-3-1 overall.
