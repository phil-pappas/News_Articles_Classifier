He has Toledo, also 6-0, at No. 18 and Houston (yes, the Cougars are 6-0, too) at No. 21.\nWhen the final, official, CFP rankings are released in early Dec. 6, the highest ranked Group of Five program (one outside the Power Five conferences) earns a spot in one of the New Year’s Six bowls. The Cotton and Orange Bowls are playing host to the national semifinal games. The other New Year’s Six Bowls are the Rose, Fiesta, Peach and Sugar.\nAfter last weekend’s dismantling of then-No. 13 Ole Miss, the Tigers (6-0) moved into the Associated Press Top 25 for only the second time in school history DURING the regular season. Memphis is No. 18.\nThe U of M’s 37-24 win over the Rebels have some projections placing the Tigers in an at-large spot in the Fiesta Bowl, which will be played Jan. 1 at Glendale, Arizona.\n(And Tiger fans thought the New Orleans Bowl and the Miami Beach Bowl were festive.)\nTo reach this uncharted territory, Memphis must pull for a second-half slip-up by Toledo, enjoying as promising a season under 35-year-old head coach Matt Campbell as the Tigers are under 39-year-old coach Justin Fuente. While 4-3 Northern Illinois could be challenging, Toledo’s toughest test may come Nov. 17 when it plays 5-2 Bowling Green, whose only losses are to Tennessee and Memphis.\nFor their New Year’s Six hopes to remain intact, the Tigers will need more than a Toledo second-half-of-the-season stumble. The Tigers must take care of their closest competitors in the American Athletic Conference.\nMemphis plays at Houston – under fast-rising first-year coach Tom Herman - Nov. 14 and at Temple the following weekend. Temple (6-0) is nipping at the cleats of Memphis and Houston at No. 24 in the Feng rankings.\nHELTON DEBUT: Former longtime U of M assistant Clay Helton’s debut as USC interim head coach nearly had a storybook finish.\nHelton’s first game taking over for Steve Sarkisian, dismissed a week ago, was at Notre Dame. The Trojans held a 31-24 lead entering the fourth quarter, but were unable to protect it. Notre Dame scored 17 fourth-quarter points to win, 41-31.\nHelton, the team’s offensive coordinator, said the Trojans “had great momentum going into the second half.”\n“And then, at the end of the day, mistakes hurt us, whether it was penalties, special teams, some missed tackles and some turnovers on offense. You can’t have those mistakes.”\nHelton may take consolation in this: USC had 440 passing yards, the most allowed by Notre Dame in the program’s history.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5mGfXqrc0I", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z63W60ikMaE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RH8ldE87bo"], "published": "2015-10-19T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:34:40.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
