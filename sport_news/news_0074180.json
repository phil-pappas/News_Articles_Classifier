It wasn't competitive as the SJSU offense fizzled in a 30-7 loss to the Aztecs. \nSan Jose State's star running back Tyler Ervin, the nation's leader in all-purpose yards entering the week, was bottled up by the league's No. 4 ranked defense. Ervin finished with just 22 yards on 17 carries and minus-1 yard on three catches. \nQuarterback Kenny Potter, a week after the first 300-yard passing game of his career, had his worst outing as a Spartan. He completed 14 of 24 passes for 113 yards and threw two interceptions. He was sacked four times to contribute to a night that saw San Jose State (3-4, 2-2 Mountain West) collect just 35 yards on 35 carries and gain only 148 yards of offense. \nThe matchup also figured to feature two of the conference's best running backs in Ervin and San Diego State's Donnel Pumphrey. While Ervin was shut down, Pumphrey carried 20 times for 152 yards and a touchdown and caught three passes for 55 yards and a score. \nWith the win, the Aztecs (4-3, 3-0) not only remain in sole possession of first place in the West Division, they are the only team with a winning overall record. Advertisement \nSan Jose State struggled from the start, going backwards more often than it went forward in the early going. Three of the Spartans' first six plays lost yardage and they opened with consecutive three-and-outs. \nMichael Carrizosa, the national leader in punting average entering the game, shanked his first punt of the night. He was being pressured and got off just a 17-yard kick that went out of bounds at the SJSU 37-yard line. \nPumphrey, the Mountain West's third leading rusher, scored the game's first points with a 13-yard touchdown run to cap that drive. \nThe Spartans forced an Aztecs' punt and got a little bit of offense going. Potter flipped a pass to true freshman running back Malik Roberson that he nabbed and raced for a 35-yard gain. A late hit penalty on San Diego State tacked on 15 more yards to reach the Aztecs' 26. \nBut Potter was sacked on second down, scrambled for no gain on third down and Austin Lopez was wide left on a 48-yard field goal. \nThe Spartans' helped San Diego State with a defensive penalty on its next drive, with Nick Oreglia jumping offside on third-and-3. Pumphrey hauled in 38-yard touchdown reception from Maxwell Smith on the next snap to make it 14-0. \nSan Jose State answered with a drive that featured plenty of help from the visitors. Potter was hit late out of bounds on a third-down scramble to allow the Spartans to convert. Later in the drive, SJSU converted again on third down thanks to a pass interference call, although that likely prevented a touchdown. \nTwo penalties on one play on San Diego State's J.J. Whitaker -- he was called for unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct -- put the Spartans at the 2 and Potter scored on a third-down sneak to get within a touchdown. \nThe Aztecs took a 10-point lead into halftime when Danny Hageman made a 31-yard field goal with 18 seconds left in the second quarter. \nSan Jose State had just 91 yards of offense in the first half and it got worse when Potter's first two passes of the third quarter were intercepted. San Diego State scored 10 points off those picks to boost its lead. \nDespite Potter's struggles, the Spartans never made a move to senior backup Joe Gray. SJSU is 2-1 in Gray's three starts -- the only loss being to Auburn -- and he's averaged 243 yards passing in those games with five touchdowns and two interceptions. \nSan Jose State starting cornerback Jimmy Pruitt, the team's leader with three interceptions, sat out the game after developing concussion-like symptoms during the week.
