A judge ordered her to return Nov. 19.\nThe 64-year-old Greig is serving an eight-year sentence for conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud and conspiracy to commit identity fraud.\nThe indictment alleges that from December 2014 until last month, Greig disobeyed a judge's order to testify before a grand jury in an investigation into who assisted and harbored Bulger.\nBulger fled Boston before being indicted in 1995. He and Greig were captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
