The former Borussia Dortmund coach had been the hot favorite from the start. \nSky Television said Klopp, 48, had agreed to become manager. The Daily Mail newspaper said Klopp would sign a three-year deal under which he would earn more than 4 million pounds (US$6.1 million) a year. \nSeveral of Rodgers’ backroom staff — including Gary McAllister and Sean O’Driscoll — left Liverpool yesterday in anticipation of the new manager arriving. \nKlopp led Borussia to two Bundesliga titles in seven years before leaving in May saying he wanted a sabbatical. \nDortmund captain Mats Hummels, meanwhile, has backed Klopp to succeed at Liverpool, hailing his former manager as a “fantastic coach” who “eats, lives, breathes and thinks football”. \nAsked about Klopp’s prospects at Anfield, defender Hummels said his former manager would be a perfect fit. \n“There’s no doubt he’s a fantastic coach and when people put their mind to the question of ‘what does he do post-Dortmund?’ then clubs like Liverpool naturally come into the equation,” he said in Dublin ahead of Germany’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Ireland. \n“He eats, lives, breathes and thinks football day after day and is a fantastic addition to any team. I’ll keep my fingers crossed for him in his next venture,” the 26-year-old added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:37:12.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
