Related \nEverybody knows the baseball players but if you’ve been a fan for years,going to a game is like going to see family. \n“He has been here a long time. He has been very friendly, every time I come down to a game I have to see him. Stop by and visit, to get a hug and a kiss,” said Sheila Cox after pulling up a picture with her and Charles Keith. \nOn Thursday before the first pitch, the Reds recognized some of the staff, in particular five retiring employees, two of whom, have worked with them for 46 years. \n“Good memories, and you know what? Working with the people here has just been fantastic. And the fans, you know that’s what makes it worthwhile,” said Benny Clary. \n“Crosley Field was No. 1, because that is where I got initiated at, or installed,” said Charles Keith. \nKeith broke the color barrier in 1969 and is considered the Jackie Robinson of Reds ushers. \nClary has been a ticket taker for years, but while their tenure may be over, they still have a little advice to pass along. \n“The first thing I would advise you to do is smile, smile, no matter who it is. Don't forget to smile,” Keith said. \n“I enjoy it. You know, and I want to treat them the way I want to be treated when I come to the ball park. And that’s what it is all about,” Clary said. \nWhen we asked who Keith and Clary favorite players were, they both said Pete Rose without hesitation. \nThe Reds final game of the season is Sunday at PNC Park against the Pittsburgh Pirates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:42:16.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
