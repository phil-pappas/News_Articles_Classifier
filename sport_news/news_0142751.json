Trout hit the second pitch deep into the right-center gap, then slid headfirst into third base before emphatically pumping his right arm toward his teammates in the dugout. \nPujols followed with a soft single to left field on the next pitch. \nTexas went into Friday already assured a playoff spot, but able to secure the division title with a win over the Angels or a loss by second-place Houston. \nT25-MISSISSIPPI ST-TEXAS A&M \nUndefeated No. 14 Texas A&M hosts Prescott, Mississippi St \nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Mississippi State visits No. 14 Texas A&M on Saturday coming off a win over Auburn. \nThe 21st-ranked Bulldogs are led by quarterback Dak Prescott, who has completed almost 67 percent of his passes for 1,069 yards and seven touchdowns. He's thrown 191 straight passes without an interception, a streak that is the longest in the nation and the sixth longest in SEC history and that dates back to the Orange Bowl. \nTexas A&M looks to improve to 2-0 in conference play for the second straight year, doing so for the first time since 1997-98 in the Big 12. \nT25-TCU-PLAYERS-CASE CLOSED \nCase against TCU players closed with no charges filed \nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - Police say the case against two TCU football players accused of stealing a case of beer while attacking another student and his friends has been closed with no charges being filed. \nFort Worth police spokesman Sgt. Steve Enright said Friday that the case was closed by the investigating detective after the victim refused to pursue charges against TCU senior defensive end Mike Tuaua and freshman receiver Andre Petties-Wilson. \nThe two were arrested last week on charges of robbery-bodily injury. The incident happened Sept. 4, a day after the fourth-ranked Horned Frogs beat Minnesota in their season opener. Tuaua and Petties-Wilson played against the Golden Gophers but missed the past three games. \nBoth have been reinstated and are eligible to play against Texas on Saturday. \nT25-TEXAS-TCU \nNo. 4 TCU still undefeated, Texas 1-3 for 1st since '56 \nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - Gary Patterson has plenty of reasons to shake his head this season. The TCU coach has been constantly plugging in different players on defense to do enough to back a high-powered offense. \nStill, what matters for the fourth-ranked and playoff-hopeful Horned Frogs is that they are still undefeated. \nThe 4-0 Frogs are back home Saturday to play Texas, which is 1-3 for the first since 1956 after losing consecutive home games with late breakdowns on special teams. \nA missed extra point with 71 seconds left cost Texas a chance to take California to overtime two weeks ago. Then a dropped punt snap set up Oklahoma State for the winning field goal in the final seconds as the Longhorns lost their Big 12 opener at home last week.
