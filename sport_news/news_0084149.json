H.S. football: Week 6 scouting report 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Express-News staff writer Terrence Thomas sets the stage for what to watch for this weekend:\nKey storylines\nStaying alive: Two weeks ago, Alamo Heights hosted Boerne Champion in a game that figured to go a long ways in determining who might capture the District 27-5A championship.\nWhen the Mules (2-3, 1-2) host San Marcos (4-0, 2-0) on Friday at Heights’ Orem Stadium, they could very well be playing for their playoff lives. Alamo Heights has already lost to Champion (3-2, 3-0) and Lockhart (5-0, 3-0) in league play and still has Kerrville Tivy (4-0, 2-0) left on it schedule. So the Mules are as close to being in a must-win situation as a team that hasn’t played half its district games can be.\nRun, run, run: When Judson and Wagner square off in their annual “Hammer Bowl” on Friday at Rutledge Stadium, the game will feature two of the area’s top rushing attacks. Wagner is No. 3 in the area at 321 yards per game, while Judson is No. 4 at 276.2.\nThe Rockets, with tailbacks Jay Miller , Mi’Kel Jackson and Sincere McCormick and quarterback Julon Williams all rushing for 100 yards, ran for 500 yards in last week’s 49-35 win over Clemens. Paced by tailback Jamaree Yelton (799 yards and 15 TDs) and quarterback Jordan Batson , Wagner rushed for 520 yards in a 72-35 decision over Marshall on Sept. 18.\nUnder the radar games\nHolmes vs. Clark: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Farris Stadium — During the 1980s and 1990s, this was Northside ISD’s premier game. The district title was seemingly always on the line and the outcomes were close — between 1985-1989, three games were decided by a point and another ended in a tie.\nThe importance of this year’s District 27-6A Zone B contest is high once again. Holmes (3-2) can match its win total of the previous three seasons combined with a victory, while Clark (0-5) seeks its first win.\nLa Vernia at Navarro: 7:30 p.m. Friday — The Bears close out a tough non-district slate when they travel to play at Class 4A’s No. 10-ranked team. La Vernia is 1-3, with its losses coming against Port Lavaca Calhoun, La Grange and Sinton.\nBy the numbers\n27: Consecutive wins for Madison over Lee heading into Friday’s District 26-6A game at Comalander Stadium. The Volunteers haven’t defeated Madison since a 17-6 decision in 1987, and are 2-33 all-time against the Mavericks.\n5,018: Career rushing yards for Antonian’s Daniel Rosenfeld , ranking him at No. 7 in Greater San Antonio area history. A senior, Rosenfeld has rushed for 710 yards — 359 vs. South San last week, 351 vs. Boerne on Sept. 18 -— in his last two games. He has six career 300-yard rushing games.\ntthomas@express-news.net\nTwitter: en_terrence", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/72/8724138/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/72/8724138/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/53/8657623/19/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/72/8724144/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/13/03/8696024/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/13/03/8696024/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/21/72/8724144/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/53/8657623/19/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:09:13.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
