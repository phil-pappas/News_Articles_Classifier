The Cowboys have an offensive head coach, and with him comes an offensive mentality. Factor in perennial Pro Bowl tight end Jason Witten and those three first-round blockers and it becomes obvious the Jones family has built a team that asks its offense to win games.\nBut Pro Bowl wide receiver Dez Bryant didn't make it through the first week of the season, suffering a broken foot in the opener against the New York Giants. Then NFL passing champion Tony Romo didn't make it through the second week, suffering a broken clavicle Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nNow, with Brandon Weeden, Joseph Randle and Terrance Williams the new faces of the Dallas offense, the burden to deliver victories becomes a bit heaver for a defense that itself is playing short-handed.\nEven though the Cowboys are without their best cornerback (Orlando Scandrick) and two best pass rushers (Greg Hardy and Randy Gregory) because of injuries or suspensions, this defense has emerged as the backbone of the 2-0 NFC East leaders.\nThe Cowboys allowed only 289 yards and one offensive touchdown in a 27-26 victory over the Giants in the season opener, then went on the road against an even better foe Sunday and flashed even more dominance, allowing just 226 yards and one offensive TD in a 20-10 triumph over the Eagles.\nThe lone New York touchdown capped a paltry 1-yard, one-play drive after a gift Romo interception. The lone Philadelphia touchdown came during garbage time with 81 seconds left after the Cowboys had already iced the game with a 20-3 lead.\nBut the challenge heightens over the next three weeks. The 2-0 Falcons come to town Sunday with their own $100 million quarterback in Matt Ryan. Then Super Bowl champion quarterbacks Drew Brees and Tom Brady face the Cowboys in Weeks 4-5. Nothing less than the A-game from this defense will do.\nBut the Dallas defenders I visited with in the bowels of Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday night aren't consumed with either the injuries or the schedule.\n\"We don't control what we can't control,\" safety Barry Church said.\nThis bunch has the blinders on. They are focused on each play and each possession. That won't change whether it's Sam Bradford or Tom Brady taking the offensive snaps.\n\"We're going to keep playing the same defense we've been playing,\" Church said. \"It worked the first week. We held them to nothing but field goals. It worked this week. It should have been just one field goal.\n\"We're just going to keep doing what we're doing. It's not a matter of turning it up. It's about playing at the same level consistently. Romo's down. That's just an added factor for us to continue to play the way we've got to play.\"\n\"The way\" the Cowboys have been playing has been suffocating. DeMarco Murray won an NFL rushing title with the Cowboys last season but bolted to Philadelphia in free agency when the Eagles waved a $42 million contract at him. The Eagles expected Murray to bring his own A-game against the Cowboys in his first crack at his old employer.\nBut the Cowboys wouldn't allow him to bring the A-game, bottling up Murray for 2 yards on 13 carries. During one 30-minute stretch, from the late first quarter through the late third quarter, the Cowboys tackled Murray for losses on five consecutive carries totaling minus-21 yards.\nThe Eagles managed only one first down in the first half -- and that came on a pass interference penalty against the Cowboys. Bradford was supposed to be the perfect fit for Chip Kelly's up-tempo offense. But the Cowboys rattled him into three turnovers -- two interceptions and a fumble. He didn't complete a pass longer than 13 yards to a wide receiver until Philadelphia's final drive.\n\"We care about running to the football, causing turnovers and playing the right way,\" said linebacker Sean Lee, who collected 14 tackles and an interception against the Eagles. \"That's all we're going to focus on. We're not worried about stats. We concern ourselves with doing our job every time out there and causing turnovers. That's what we did today, and that's why we got a win.\n\"We have guys who are going to step up. We have to continue to get better defensively and find a way.\"\nThe 2015 season of the Dallas Cowboys will hinge on just that.\n Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges.\nFollow Rick Gosselin on Twitter at @RickGosselinDMN.\nDo you believe the Cowboys have a chance to make the playoffs without Tony Romo More on Tony Romo's injury, the Cowboys' win over the Eagles\nCowlishaw: Even without Tony Romo, Cowboys aren't dead yet\nGosselin: Without Romo, the 2015 hinges on Cowboys' defense\nCowboys QB Tony Romo injured; Jerry Jones: 'Just about as low as a crippled cricket's ass'\nEx-Longhorn, Eagles linebacker who injured Tony Romo: 'I just kind of attacked him'\nFox's Buck brings up Tim Tebow as Cowboys' QB; Jimmy Johnson predicts DeMarco's bad day\n5 thoughts: Critical division win tarnished after Tony Romo fractures clavicle\nBob Sturm: Catastrophic!
