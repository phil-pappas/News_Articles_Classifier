I mean they were all over. They weren't just doing straight lines,” says Carl Junction resident Rene Consier.\nSome residents are downright upset with the botched paint job. Others are laughing it off.\n\"I didn't even notice it at first, until it was pointed out to me and then the next time I drove down the road I noticed it and started laughing. It's hilarious,” says Carl Junction resident Dawn Smith.”\nTo make matters worse, Briarbrook Drive is basically the only road in all of Carl Junction that the city even paints, since most of the other busy roads running through town are state highways.\n\"It needs to be pretty straight for safety reasons, you've got golf carts, you've got young kids…this is just full of kids and older people and their golf carts. It really needs to be straight they need to watch what they're doing and pay attention,” says Consier.\nCarl Junction resident Bob Smith says \"It didn't catch my eye until this morning, as far as the striping. But I was thankful that they put some black top down. And they'll get out here and straighten out the stripes I'm sure.”\nAnd the squiggly lines will be straightened out. The city administrator says the painter was inexperienced.\n\"He's been an employee that's been with us a long time, it's not his normal job, street work is not his normal job. And so it was a little bit out of the ordinary for him. But that's no excuse. It should have been a lot better than it was and that's why we're going to take care of it,” says Carl Junction City Administrator Steve Lawver.\nConsier says \"It does give me a little piece of mind that they're going to fix it, but what if they don't fix it correct again. What if it's crooked again?\"\nThe city is out another $500 to redo the stripes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:59:08.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
