Edwardsville won the regional with a 329 team score, with O'Fallon (346) and Belleville East (356) also advancing all their players to the Normal Sectional to be held Monday at Weibring Golf Club. Marion was fifth at 392, but Kuhnke's score of 86 was the best of anyone not on the advancing teams. Frassato-Krack's round of 92 earned her the seventh of 10 advancing individual spots. Kuhnke had two birdies in her round, which included a 39 on the back nine at Tamarack. Frassato-Krack fared better on the front, where she carded 45. Also playing for Marion were Celia Roark (104), Taylor Carter (110), Olivia Gray (113) and Aubrey Wooten (141).
