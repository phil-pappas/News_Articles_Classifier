Ornelas, Staff / San Antonio Express-News Image 21 of 21 Popovich could be tabbed to lead Team USA 1 / 21 Back to Gallery The 2016 Olympics will be Mike Krzyzewski's last as head coach of Team USA.\nUnder Coach K, the U.S. has reestablished itself as the dominant basketball power in the world, going 75-1 under his reign with two Olympic golds and one more likely to come in Rio de Janeiro next summer.\nCoach K and managing director Jerry Colangelo will be in charge of selecting a successor, and the man at the top of their list is Gregg Popovich, according to a report from CBS Sports' Ken Berger .\nThe 66-year-old is \"clearly, unquestionably the No. 1 choice,\" according to a person involved in the coaching business.\n\"I think it would be good if somebody had experience in international basketball,'' Krzyzewski told ESPN . \"They will pick the best person, from whatever — the NBA or collegiate environment.\"\n\"There has to be a succession ... a planned succession with really good people so we can keep the continuity of the program going.''\nPops has international experience as both a player and coach.\nHe served on the Team USA coaching staff for the 2002 FIBA World Championship, the 2003 FIBA America Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament and the 2004 Olympics.\nPopovich also toured the Eastern Bloc with the U.S. Armed Forces Basketball Team during his five years of active duty in the Air Force.\nNow entering his 20th season as head coach of the Spurs, Popovich's contract with San Antonio runs through the 2018-2019 season.\nBerger's report mentions that several NBA coaches believe it's time for one of them — not someone from the collegiate ranks — to take control of the ship from K and his college cohorts.\nIf that's true, Popovich would be the most likely candidate to receive universal backing from his peers.\nWhether he wants to accept all of that is another story entirely.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links":
