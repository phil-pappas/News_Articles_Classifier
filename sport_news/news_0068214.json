She was taken to University Hospital where she was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm and face. Her injuries were not considered life-threatening.\nThe suspect in the shooting, 47-year-old David Kramer, a Sergeant with the Louisiana DPS Police – Crescent City Connection Unit, was taken into custody without incident. He was transported to the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center where he was booked with one count of attempted first-degree murder.\nInvestigators determined the victim and Kramer were involved in a verbal altercation prior to the shooting. The woman who called 911 told police the argument continued at which time she heard a gunshot. It was then she discovered her mother had been shot.\nCrime Scene technicians recovered a revolver from the scene.\n\"Upon learning of Kramer’s actions, he was immediately placed on administrative leave pending further investigation. Every member of our organization has not only legal responsibilities but also high standards of integrity that must be upheld at all times while serving the citizens of Louisiana,” stated Louisiana State Police Superintendent Colonel Mike Edmonson.\nFollowing a criminal investigation by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office and an administrative investigation by the Louisiana State Police, the Department of Public Safety will review all findings in this matter and take swift steps to ensure an impartial and appropriate course.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
