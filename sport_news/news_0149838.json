But there were a few strings attached.\nBuy this photo ASSOCIATED PRESS PHOTOS Rafael Nadal, above, and Novak Djokovic mixed tennis with politics during a trip to Bangkok. Djokovic won the exhibition. Before their Friday night match, Djokovic and Nadal swapped tennis clothes for formal Thai silk jackets in baby blue and pastel yellow.
