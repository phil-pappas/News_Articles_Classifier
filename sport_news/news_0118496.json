While the majority of ACL injuries occur in boys, the rate of injury per exposure is higher in girls. Specifically, in girls, the highest ACL injury risks per season were observed in soccer (1.1 percent), basketball (0.9 percent), and lacrosse (0.5 percent). In comparison, the highest risks per season for boys were observed in football (0.8 percent), lacrosse (0.4 percent), and soccer (0.3 percent). \n\"It has been well established that the risk for ACL tear per athletic exposure is higher in female athletes compared to males,\" said lead author Alex L. Gornitzky, a fourth-year medical student at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. \"As participation rates in high school athletics continues to rise significantly, it has become increasingly important to establish up-to-date, individualized injury information for high school athletes and their families, who represent a large proportion of patients visiting pediatric orthopaedic and sports medicine clinics.\" \nKnowledge of such sport-specific, seasonal risk is essential for evidenced-based parent-athlete decision-making, accurate physician counseling, and targeted injury-reduction programs for the most at-risk sports, said Mr. Gornitzky, who will present the abstract, \"Sport-Specific Yearly Risk and Incidence of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears in High School Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\" at 10:53 am on Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015: 9:50 AM in room 143A of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. \n  Basketball, soccer, lacrosse lead to most ACL injuries among high school female athletes Public / Patient:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:40:31.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
