Twin City Bank has committed to buy $3.8 million of Hometown's assets, according to the FDIC, which estimated the cost to its deposit insurance fund is $1.6 million.\nSeveral Northwest banks followed during the financial crisis that spawned the Great Recession, when a number of smaller banks – and a few large ones – were consumed by bad loans underwritten with questionable lending standards.\nBut the pace of closure has eased considerably as the economy has improved. Hometown is the eighth FDIC-insured bank to close this year, and the first in Washington since Westside Community Bank in University Place closed in January 2013.\n-- Mike Rogoway\nmrogoway@oregonian.com\n503-294-7699\n@rogoway", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/rogoway"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:35:27.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
