The former Burns High standout elected to end his playing career due to concussion-related issues. The 5-foot-8, 185-pounder made the choice along with his family after consulting with medical personnel. WCU football coach Mark Speir said that Ramsey would remain with the team as a student assistant coach. The Catamount team captains, after being informed of Ramsey’s situation, immediately named him an honorary team captain for the remainder of the 2015 season. “Darius Ramsey has been and remains a part of our football family,” Speir said in a statement for the media. “He has been a cornerstone and part of our foundation in turning this program around. He was a big part of our first recruiting class, and when times have been tough, he’s always been there for this team.” Ramsey, a second team All-Southern Conference pick during his junior year, rushed for two touchdowns in the season-opening win over Mars Hill, but had seen action in only two games since. The Waco native finishes his career with 14 touchdowns, 1,907 rushing yards plus 63 receptions for 428 yards via the airways. He amassed 2,476 all-purpose yards during his three-plus years for the Catamounts. Ramsey’s successes weren’t confined to the field. He is a three-time Southern Conference Honor roll recipient and also took Fall Academic All-Southern Conference honors in 2013 and 2014. Last season, he was a Capital One Academic All-District 3 first team selection, then became just the fourth Catamount to earn the national Division I Academic All-America honors. The accounting major carries a 3.489 grade-point average with plans to graduate in May, 2016.
