And unlike University of Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino and others connected to the program, she has no trouble believing Katina Powell — the Louisville woman who alleges that she received thousands of dollars for her and her under aged daughters to have sex with Louisville basketball recruits.\nMonae is a self-described escort who says she gets paid for sex, and says she knows Powell personally. In fact, Monae directed a USA TODAY Sports reporter to one of the apartments where she says Powell and her daughters lived in recent years.\n“I think she’s telling the truth,’’ Monae told USA TODAY via text message. “In this business you wouldn’t believe who all is indulging in sexual pleasures.’\n\"Yes, I talked to her,’’ Monae adding, writing that she has worked as an escort for eight years. “But in this business girls don’t like other girls. May the best win.’’\nLouisville said earlier this month it hired a private investigator to conduct a review and had notified the NCAA.\nUSA TODAY\nLawyer: Author's daughters in Louisville allegations were not underage\nMonae advertises on backpage.com, an online service for escorts, and she said Powell did as well, and that their family members were acquainted.\nMonae said the money is enticing — her rates are $150 per half hour and $200 per hour — and in some cases feeds drug addiction.\n“I don’t know anyone making that kind of money in such little time,’’ she said. “Do you?’’\nMonae declined to meet in person, saying, “I can’t afford to get into anymore trouble. …I like to keep a low profile because of what I do.’’", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2015/10/14/lawyer-katina-powell-prostitute-daughters-lawyer-larry-wilder-louisville-cardinals/73955370/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33c9f2e2863232bf3caca517636837a5c78d8adb/c=270-73-1359-688&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804460397185685-XXX-LARRY-WILDER-DEC-1223-76735428.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:50:56.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
