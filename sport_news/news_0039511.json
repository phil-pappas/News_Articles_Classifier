Then they were driving somewhere else and the teacher decided to turn around and take them back and show them the toys in greater detail.\nThe Williams County Sheriff, Steve Towns, is asking about this incident now because he was wondering whether there was a record of it, but he found at Ohio jobs and Family Sevices there was no record.\nThe school board claims it did report the incident, saying, \"A report was made to Children's Services who chose not to pursue the matter at that time.\"\nThe board went on to say, \"The Sheriff complained directly to the School Board and attempted to intimidate them to take action against a Bryan school employee.\"\nAccording to the board the independent investigator and a Special Prosecutor found that there had been no crime and no cover-up by the District or the Board They added that while the employee may have exercised poor judgment, nothing criminal occurred.\nSteve Towns, the Sheriff of Williams County said,\"Any comments the schools have made against me or the school board have made against me have been misrepresented. I've tried to help everybody, but mostly we're here to be the kids' advocate. We're here for the children in their safety. And that is the bottom line.\"\nThe sheriff does consider this an open investigation and says it is not over.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*197/bryanmiddleschool.jpg", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7FB/722/7FB722861A594E069FD5837259777FE2.mp4", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/bryanmiddleschool.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:03:02.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
