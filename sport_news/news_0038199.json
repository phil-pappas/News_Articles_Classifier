Each week before a home game, students camp out in front of the stadium in order to hold their positions in line for front-row seats. Football players, the Blue Band, local food vendors and even the coaching staff frequently visit Nittanyville, pepping up the students as game day draw near. Nittanyville is governed by the student-run Nittanyville Coordination Committee. The tradition was established during the 2005 football season, when students began setting up tents and \"camping\" in front of Beaver Stadium one week before the game with rival school Ohio State on October 8. \n1. Injuries, Injuries Everywhere: The Penn State Nittany Lions are dealing with injuries to significant members of their program. Penn State’s top two running backs ( Akeel Lynch and Saquon Barkley ), starting center and one of their top secondary members ( Jordan Lucas ) are all battling injuries. James Franklin is understandably being guarded with the information they release about the status of players and nothing definitive is known but through diligent research, we’ve learned a couple of things. Franklin has confirmed that Barkley is practicing and that “he looks good.” If forced to guess, I think Barkley and safety Jordan Lucas both play while Lynch is forced to sit Saturday’s game out. \n2. Containing Barkley: The status of true freshman running back Saquon Barkley is a huge deal because he is a key to the Penn State offense. On the season, Barkley has run the ball 42 times and gained 373 yards with three touchdowns. He is averaging 8.9 yards per carry and his explosiveness could make a huge difference in Saturday’s game. The Indiana defense gave up three long touchdown runs (also known as “explosive plays”) to Ezekiel Elliott last Saturday. \n3. Get to Hackenberg: Penn State’s presumptive future NFL QB, Christian Hackenberg , has had a rocky college career. After a very promising freshman season under Bill O’Brien , Hackenberg has struggled to find consistency under the duo of James Franklin and offensive coordinator John Donovan . His offensive line has hindered his progression as well as he often has to hurry throws or deal with pressure from the opposing defense. On the season, Hackenberg has been sacked an average of three times per game (10 of those were against Temple so there has been improvement and adjustments in the play calling to help the woeful offensive line). \n4. Dealing with the Defense: Penn State is surrendering only 15.8 points per game and they are considered to be one of the best defensive units in the B1G. Bob Shoop is a tremendous defensive coordinator and he has consistently fielded strong defensive teams. This year is no different. Leading the way on defense is the interior duo of Anthony Zettel and Austin Johnson . The standout edge rusher is Carl Nassib . Nassib’s eight sacks rank second in the entire country and keeping him from the quarterback is a priority for any opponent. At linebacker, Penn State might be without Brandon Bell (he’ll be another game-time decision) but Jason Cabinda leads the team in tackles (25.5) and Troy Reeder is second (20.5). \n5. Turnover Margin: The offense has done a great job of taking care of the ball and the defense has done a nice job of taking it away. As a result, Penn State is +1.6 in turnover margin, tied for eighth nationally. Since PSU plays close games, turnovers often play a critical role in determining the outcome of their games. \nTo Read More From Sammy Jacobs, TJ Inman & Nick Holmes of HoosierHuddle.com, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:29:29.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
