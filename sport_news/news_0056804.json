Smith birdied the hole the first time around. \n\"He pulled his drive (in the playoff) a little,\" Bucyrus coach Martin Myers said, \"but he still gave himself a chance.\" \nSmith's drive landed left of the fairway, near a tree. That tree wasn't the problem. It was the tree just ahead that stuck out one of its limbs and struck down his second shot, after the ball had traveled no more than 30 yards. Smith recovered to put his next shot within 15 feet of the cup, but then pushed his attempt at par five feet past the hole. His bogey putt died on the lip of the cup, sealing his fate as Kennedy left himself a fairly easy par putt with his third shot from the fringe. \n\"(Smith) gave himself a chance to make par, but was a little overly aggressive with that putt,\" Myers said. \"But he didn't leave it short. He gave himself a chance.\" \nBrayden Dunlap of team champion Mohawk was medalist with a 79, but it was Smith who was on target for those honors after shooting a 38 on the back nine to begin his round. He made four birdie putts in a row: a 5-footer on No. 13, a 40-footer on No 14 and 10-footers on Nos. 15 and 16. \nBut a couple of triple-bogeys started him down a path he didn't want to travel. \n\"After that I started thinking about what I needed to do instead of just playing,\" Smith said. \"I tried to tell myself that if I stayed calm, good things would happen. It caused me to think less about what could go wrong.\" \nIt was Smith's best 18-hole round of the season and 10 strokes better than he fared on the same course in the Northern 10 Tournament. He began the season No. 1 for the Redmen and then flip-flopped with Keegan Sims after slamming his hand in a car door, forcing him to miss a couple of weeks. He was happy with the improvement he made since the league tourney and considered himself fortunate to be in contention for a district berth. \n\"Putting was a pretty big struggle (in the N10 tourney),\" Smith said, \"so I took a little more time reading the greens. I had the speed down today.\" \nSims (92), Mason Light (90) and Dakota Picou (115) also figured in Bucyrus' final score of 383. Buckeye Central, led by Dillon Weithman (92), finished at 374, one stroke out of fifth place. Mohawk won the sectional title at 344 with New London (346) and Seneca East (351) also moving on to districts. \njspencer@nncogannett.com \nTwitter: @jspencermnj Buy Photo \nBuckeye Central's Josh Dentinger chips on to the green during Thursday's Division III sectional golf tournament at Valley View (Photo: Jason J.
