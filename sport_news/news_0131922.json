Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images View all 12 photos There is a saying that “It is not how you start, but how you finish that matters “ but The 2015-16 NHL rookie class could wind up being one of the best in more than a decade and a good start from this crop could lead to a notable finish years from now.\nPhoto by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images The most publicized in the pack are Edmonton Oilers pivots Connor McDavid and Buffalo Sabre's Jack Eichel . The two 18-year-olds will be measured, compared, criticized and praised all season. Chosen first and second, respectively, in the 2015 NHL Draft, each has been projected by scouts as a generational talent. Both are projected to contribute immediately, and barring no unforeseen injury they expected to be in the race for the Calder Trophy as NHL rookie of the year.\nThe last time there was such hype was when Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins stepped in and dominated as rookies in 2005-06, Ovechkin won the Calder Trophy that season, led all rookies with 52 goals and 106 points, and Crosby was second with 39 goals and 102 points.\nIn that same rookie class was Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry, Zach Parise, Jeff Carter, Thomas Vanek, Duncan Keith, Dion Phaneuf and Brent Seabrook .There will be a host of rookies this season garnering attention throughout the League in addition to McDavid and Eichel. Here are some young players to watch in 2015-16 :\nSam Bennett , C, Calgary Flames: The versatile Bennett (6-foot-1, 186 pounds) had surgery last October; after rehabilitation, he had 11 goals and 24 points in 11 games with Kingston of the Ontario Hockey League and fits well into the Calgary depth charts.\nMax Domi, C, Arizona Coyotes: Domi, had 32 goals and 102 points in 57 games with London of the OHL last season. and finished his junior career with 126 goals and 331 points in 244 games. He also has his fathers (Ty Domi’s) chippiness.\nAnthony Duclair, LW, Arizona Coyotes: was acquired from the New York Rangers as part of the Keith Yandle trade March 1. He had one goal and six assists in 18 games with the Rangers last season. He turned 20 on Aug. 26, had 15 goals and 34 points in 26 games with Quebec of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League last season. If the proper blend of rookies, and veterans come together he could excel.\nNikolaj Ehlers , LW, Winnipeg Jets: Ehlers, the ninth pick of the 2014 draft, scored 37 goals and 101 points in 51 regular-season games before scoring 10 goals with a league-high 31 points in 14 playoff games with Halifax.\nDylan Larkin , C, Detroit Red Wings: The 6-foot-1, 190-pound left-shot forward was the second-leading scorer at the University of Michigan last season and was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year. Larkin, 19, made the opening-night roster with three goals, four points and a plus-3 rating in five preseason games, highlighting his offensive abilities.\nNoah Hanifin D, Carolina Hurricanes, “a smart and powerful two-way force… big, but very mobile… moves well with good speed and agility…uses his strength and reach very well when he rushes the puck, and he is tough to contain when he gets going…is skilled and confident with the puck and has the ability to take it end-to-end…used his size and body well to contain players and box them out on the walls…is smart and makes great defensive decisions…has an instinctive knack for knowing where his teammates are on the ice…supremely skilled quarterbacking the power play.”\nJared McCann , forward, Vancouver Canucks, He brings a number of offensive skills to the table and possesses a quick burst of speed when cutting through the middle of the ice that catches many defenders flat footed. Jared displays excellent vision and is particularly so successful because of his very high level of hockey sense. He reads the game at a level higher than most of his peers and it allows him to create, execute and read plays that some players simply cannot. He scored a number of highlight reel goals this season and possesses an absolute rocket of a wrist shot with a lightning quick release that catches many goaltenders off guard.”\nJake Virtsnen, forward, Vancouver Canucks, Jake Virtanen has the size, skating, drive and physicality teams look for in a power forward – Jake is probably the purest power forward in the draft.\nArtemi Panarin, LW, Chicago Blackhawks: He agreed to a two-year contract on May 1st and could be a top-six forward to start the season. The 23-year-old had 26 goals and 62 points in 54 games for St. Petersburg SKA in the Kontinental Hockey League last season, and has drawn comparisons to Blackhawks teammate Patrick Kane with his speed and agility. Panarin (5-foot-11, 170) had five goals, 10 points and a plus-4 rating in 10 games for silver medal-winning Russia at the 2015 IIHF World Championship.\nColton Parayko , D, St. Louis Blues: The 22-year-old has spent the past three seasons with the University of Alaska and had 17 goals and 49 assists in 104 games. He signed a two-year, entry-level contract March 10 and had four goals and three assists in 17 games last season with Chicago of the AHL.He played six seasons in the KHL.\nSam Reinhart , C, Buffalo Sabres: Reinhart (6-foot-1, 189) wasn't NHL-ready last season, Playing for Kootenay in the Western Hockey League, he had 19 goals and 65 points in 47 games. He also had five goals and six assists in seven games to help Canada win the gold medal at the 2015 World Junior Championship.\nThere may be even a few more rookies like Darnell Nurse and Dylan Strome could be called up and surprise everyone, but with this crop all the horses will be coming out of the gate fast and those in the back of the pacy will probably not be able to catch up-at least this season. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:35:48.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
