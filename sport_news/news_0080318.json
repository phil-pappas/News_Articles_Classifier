National Park Service / Courtesy photo. Fire crews in Yosemite National Park were monitoring several smoldering fires and burn areas Monday, including one that broke out Oct. 5 above one of the park’s iconic waterfalls. The Bridalveil Fire had burned 30 acres or more between 5,600 and 6,000 feet elevation in the Bridalveil Creek watershed above the fall and below Glacier Point Road, according to Gary Wuchner, fire education and information manager for Yosemite. Crews are committed to suppressing the fire, and they’ve used helicopters to insert personnel and make bucket drops, Wuchner said. A crew on Helicopter 551 rappelled into the burn area the day the fire broke out to try to fight it. Two Forest Service hotshot crews, from Groveland and Sierra, are among the crews assigned. One injury has been reported so far. The fire poses no threat to public safety or park infrastructure, but the Pohono Trail from Dewey Point to Taft Point and McGurk Meadow junction is closed. The cause of the fire was unknown, Wuchner said. There’s been no lightning in the area since early August. Other fires and burn areas smoldering in Yosemite include the Wegner Fire, one-tenth of an acre around 8,300 feet elevation north of Tioga Road, the Middle Fire, 260 acres just above 8,000 feet west of White Wolf and south of Middle Fork Tuolumne River, the Tenaya Fire, 415 acres at about 7,200 feet south of Tioga Road, and the Cathedral Fire, 42 acres at 9,400 feet near the John Muir Trail to Cathedral Lakes. The Cathedral burn area received some rain and snow the weekend of Oct. 3, Wuchner said. The perimeter may continue to smolder in lodgepole pine needles and logs. Where trails remain open, visitors are advised to hike through any fire area quickly and stay on the trail. “Please remember Yosemite and California continue to experience very dry conditions,” Wuchner said. “Although it is fall and days are cooler, all visitors are urged to be diligent in any use of fire, including smoking. And be sure all fires are out!” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:12:14.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
