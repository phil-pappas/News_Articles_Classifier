Lakeland always gives us a tough game. I had to stress the importance of the game and hoped that there wouldn’t be a hangover from Sunday.\"\nThe Cutters took IHA through regulation, two overtimes, and finally succumbed to the higher seed via penalty kicks. But that loss Sunday seemed to trigger something within the Cutters.\n\"[Sunday] was a big confidence booster for us,\" said senior midfielder Lisa Kestelboym, who snapped a scoreless tie with a header in the 66th minute, leading Fair Lawn to a 2-0 victory over the Lancers on Monday. \n\"We didn’t think the game [Sunday] had a negative effect on us at all,\" said Kestelboym, who perfectly timed a corner kick from Allison Hyde to break the scoreless deadlock.\n\"I thought it gave us confidence and momentum coming into this one. It’s what we needed if we wanted to get an upper hand on this one.\"\nAfter Kestelboym broke the scoreless drought, the Cutters scored again on an unusual goal.\nSenior forward Vicki Telewiak had a throw-in from the right side with 6:46 left and somehow managed to throw it right into the net off a deflection from Lakeland keeper Jenna Bracken.\n\"I never saw that happen before,\" Telewiak said.\n\"I was just throwing it to make a play, so I threw it into the box. The fact that it went in amazed me, but it gave me the best feeling in the world.\"\nTelewiak also didn’t think that there was any negative carryover from the tough loss to IHA.\n\"We played IHA tough and tried our best,\" Telewiak said. \"Sure, we were all a little tired and our legs were restless. But we all knew we could control the game. How much we wanted this game was the motivation behind it.\"\nThe Cutters (9-3) scored their two goals off set pieces — a corner kick and a throw-in. It’s not uncommon for them to score in that fashion.\n\"We’re not going to beat teams with give-and-goes,\" Van Soest said. \"We’re all about corners and throw-ins. We win the corners and win the throws.\"\n\"Whoever’s closest to the header takes it,\" Kestelboym said.\nThe Lancers (9-3) had some early scoring chances, but Fair Lawn goalkeeper Brianna Meitzler kept the Lancers off the board by making some good saves early, then remained steady throughout.\nMeitzler thwarted a scoring chance with 13 minutes left, when Lakeland junior Maddie Burgner had a diving attempt all alone in front. Meitzler came out of net to pounce on the loose ball. She had 10 saves. \nBracken was equally up to the challenge, making nine saves, one of which came in the 36th minute that would have given Fair Lawn a lead at the half.\n\"In the first half, I thought we had more scoring opportunities,\" Lakeland head coach Rick Capozzi said.\n\"We had about three or four opportunities and couldn’t put one in the net. Give Fair Lawn credit. They came out and wanted it more than us. I’m surprised how well they came back after [Sunday].\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:35.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
