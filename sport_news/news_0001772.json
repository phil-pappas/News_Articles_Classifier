They acquired him in 2013 as a second baseman from the Oakland A’s – who drafted him ahead of Mike Trout in the first round in 2009.\nThe Angels converted Green to a utility player, using him at all four infield positions and left field. His defense apparently never progressed to the point where he was a viable regular on the major league roster.\nHe hit .309 in seven minor league seasons, including .306 this year at Triple-A Salt Lake City.\nManager Mike Scioscia said Wednesday that it was a tough decision to designate Green, who is now likely to be released once he clears waivers.\n“There is nobody in our organization that worked harder than Grant to get to be where he is,” Scioscia said. “He worked hard for every opportunity he had. There is no doubt he can fill a role in the major leagues.”\nGreen, 28, will be out of options next season, so the Angels probably would have had to move him sometime before opening day 2016.\nGreen lost his roster spot because the Angels have been desperate for arms lately.\nThe absences of Huston Street and Joe Smith, who is available to pitch again on Wednesday, have put extra stress on the other relievers. Starter Matt Shoemaker is out with forearm tightness. Jered Weaver has had a sore shoulder.\nReyes, 30, has a 6.05 ERA in parts of five major league seasons, most recently in 2011. A product of Poly High in Riverside, Reyes spent the last half of this season pitching at Salt Lake City, where he had a 4.76 ERA in 68 innings.\nReyes hasn’t pitched since the end of the Triple-A season, but Scioscia said “You have to take a leap of faith at some point.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:22:14.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
