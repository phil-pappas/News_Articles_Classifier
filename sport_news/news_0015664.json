It's not like we're not getting chances, it's not like things aren't getting generated out there. It's just not going in yet. I just have to stick with it. ... I'd rather get it out of the way now than later.\"\nDuchene also is a minus-4.\n\"The plus-minus doesn't look good right now, but that's because we haven't scored any goals,\" he said. \"We score a few goals, we're probably even or close to it. In game one (against Minnesota), we had some tough breaks, but since then it's been solid.\"\nAvalanche coach Patrick Roy cautioned against overreacting.\nAdvertisement \"Dutchy is an important part of our team and we'd like to see him producing,\" Roy said. \"But at the same time, he's playing well defensively. At the same time, while he's not producing, we think he's doing a lot of good things on the ice.\n\"He's not the only one. I looked at Anaheim last night — (Ryan) Getzlaf, (Corey) Perry don't have points so far this season, either. You're best players always normally need to be your best players if you want to have success, and I am confident things will turn around for Dutchy.\"\nDuchene's high-water marks in his six previous seasons were 27 goals in 2010-11 and 70 points in 2013-14, Roy's first season behind the bench. Although he was among the forwards selected in fan voting for the team's 20th anniversary team — results were announced Saturday — Duchene hasn't broken through to the superstar status expected of him when he was the third overall pick in the 2009 draft. He also hasn't had that one \"monster\" season.\n\"It's four games in,\" he said. \"It's not like it can't happen.\"\nFootnotes. After practice, defenseman Tyson Barrie went through a long-distance hearing with the NHL for his unpenalized leaping hit on Anaheim's Simon Despres in the corner during the second period Friday. Despres left the bench shortly after that with an \"upper body\" injury. The NHL announced late Saturday that it had suspended Barrie for three games for the hit. ... The Avs' 20th anniversary team will be honored Dec. 7 at the home game against Minnesota. The forwards selected: Duchene, Valery Kamensky, Adam Deadmarsh, Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Claude Lemieux, Milan Hejduk, Stephane Yelle, Paul Stastny, Chris Drury, Alex Tanguay, Gabe Landeskog. Defensemen: Rob Blake, John-Michael Liles, Erik Johnson, Sandis Ozolinsh, Adam Foote, Ray Bourque. Goalies: Roy, Semyon Varlamov.\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:06:18.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
