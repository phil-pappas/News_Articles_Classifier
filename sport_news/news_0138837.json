That group was active last year on all of CU's campuses, including Boulder, where students held a three-day \"camp out\" demonstration last spring to urge the Board of Regents to divest from coal, oil and gas.\nAdvertisement The students, apparently undeterred by the regents' formal \"no\" vote on divestment last spring , have been holding regular meetings this fall.\n\"We are really excited about this opportunity because it is such a high-profile event,\" said P.D. Gantert, who is taking time off from his studies at CU to work on the divestment movement. \"Opportunities like this are exciting because it allows everybody to come together and merge the vision that we have for change in the world.\"\nGantert said the march is not meant to be \"antagonistic or aggressive,\" but rather, a peaceful and informative demonstration that organizers hope will encourage students to engage with the political process.\nMike Eubank, special events coordinator for the city of Boulder, said he is aware of the \"march concept\" but has not received formal notification from the group yet.\nThe city encourages groups to fill out an \"advocacy application\" for activities on public property that fall under the free speech protections of the U.S. Constitution.\nBoulder police traffic and special events Cmdr. Greg LeFebre directed all questions about potential demonstrations to the CU-Boulder Police Department.\nFor its part, the university's police force is trying to coordinate with any groups or individuals who want to demonstrate outside the Coors Events Center.\nStudents who are calling on debate organizers to make more tickets available to them are also planning their own event and live broadcast from some to-be-determined campus location \"to discuss the issues facing our generation and the nation,\" according to a resolution going before the CU Student Government.\nCU has also been contacted about hosting a rally with several Colorado Democrats, though details are still being worked out, said CU police Sgt. Mike Lowry.\nThe Business Field has been designated as a \"free speech zone\" for all demonstrators, Lowry added.\n\"Certainly people are allowed to disagree, that's what makes this country great and we're going to try and do it in a safe manner so that everyone can be heard,\" Lowry said.\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "external_links": ["http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27914391/cu-boulder-students-camp-out-draw-attention-fossil", "https://www.facebook.com/events/1651952255062322/", "http://twitter.com/sarahkuta", "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27924351/cus-board-regents-says-no-fossil-fuel-divestment", "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28879339/outcry-from-cu-boulder-students-about-limited-seating"], "published": "2015-10-08T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:03:16.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
