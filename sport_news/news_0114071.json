He had been eligible to return to practice next week and return to play against the Raiders Nov. 8.\nThe Steelers could still carry him the rest of the way in the hopes he might be able to return late or in time for the playoffs, if they make it.\nPouncey missed all of the 2013 season with a torn ACL. He returned to play every game last season and earn his second All-Pro honors and fourth Pro Bowl. However, he injured his ankle and fibula in the team's third preseason game Aug. 23 against Green Bay at Heinz Field and had subsequent surgery.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738457", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738457&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738457&h=Maurkice+Pouncey%27s+season+in+jeopardy+after+infection+forces+new+surgery"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:09:02.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
