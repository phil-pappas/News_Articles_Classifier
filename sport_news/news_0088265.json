It's not as if I've got a huge game-plan which is completely different and they're going to say, 'what's that?' \n\"But we need to improve and I need that conversation with the powers that be that I want to do it a bit differently.\" \nColeman says he will make a few changes for Andorra after the emotional and physical energy spent in S aturday's 2-0 defeat in Bosnia-Herzegovina. \nBut Gareth Bale is set to start after coming through his first 90 minutes since suffering a calf injury playing for Real Madrid last month. \nThe Wales manager said Real boss Rafael Benitez had sent his assistant Osian Roberts a text message congratulating them on qualifying for Euro 2016 - and Coleman described Madrid as \"first class\" in their relationship as far as Bale was concerned. \n\"We've got Andorra (on Tuesday) and I should be working on that, but this is not a normal time in Welsh football,\" Coleman said. \n\"I just keep looking at the table and it's always nice to see - I've never seen Wales spelled with 'Q' in it! \n\"But qualification is the holy grail for us. We've been chasing it for so long, it's indescribable.\" \nWales are still searching for high-profile opposition in November after being turned down by some of European football's biggest nations for a friendly fixture. \nColeman, who will make a third visit to France next month to run the rule over potential Euro 2016 training camps, said Portugal could prove an attractive option, and that a meeting between Real team-mates Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo could even be staged at Cardiff's 72,500-capacity Millennium Stadium. \n\"Portugal would be a good one but they could be part of a mini-tournament in Miami,\" Coleman said. \n\"If not, we would be interested. We would want it in Cardiff and it's possibly a good time to go the Millennium Stadium and play in front of a big crowd.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:00:43.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
