We've let these guys get out ahead of us a little bit. I wish it was that easy, but it's not. This is going to be another tough one and we're ready for it.\" \nIn those 14 games against the Browns, Flacco has completed 253 of his 409 attempts (61.9 percent) for 3,027 yards and 18 touchdowns against seven interceptions. He carries a quarterback rating of 92.0 into Sunday's game at M&T Bank Stadium. \nHowever, in order to have that same success, Flacco must continue developing a rapport with his young corps of receivers, especially now that veteran pass-catcher Steve Smith Sr. is expected to miss time because of injured ribs. \n\"I can be patient,\" Flacco said. \"It's just what you have to do. We've had weeks where we come out looking pretty good this year on offense, doing those kind of things, and we've had weeks where we've come out and we've been frustrated a little bit, but part of playing quarterback is to be able to not make mistakes and play well through those tough times. These guys have a good secondary this week, so we have to be ready to come in for a fight and be patient, take our shots when we get them. \n\"The biggest thing is we're just young and we don't have a ton of experience. Besides that, I think we have good guys. We haven't had a guy that could run quite like Torrey (Smith) has been able to run for us in the past, so to stretch the defense out has been maybe a little bit tougher. Bottom line is we have good guys. It's just a lot of guys nobody really knows about.\" \nAlthough the Ravens' receiving corps is banged up, so is the Browns' secondary. \nSafety Tashaun Gipson was unable to practice for the second straight day on Thursday and two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Joe Haden has been hampered by a broken right ring finger, which kept him out of Sunday's 27-20 loss to the San Diego Chargers. \n\"He is a really good corner, and he's got great coverage skills,\" Flacco said of Haden. \"Hopefully, we can get after him a little bit. I don't want to shy away from anybody or have to feel like we can't go anywhere. Hopefully, we can get after him a little bit. It's just a matter of being disciplined with our routes and putting the ball where it needs to be on time.\" \nThis season, other quarterbacks have had success against the Browns by throwing short routes and letting their skill position players take the ball up the field for huge gains. But in order to keep the momentum going from the win over the Steelers, Flacco and the Ravens know they cannot rely solely on big plays to beat the Browns. \n\"They've got a lot of talent, and they are good,\" Flacco said of the Browns' defense. \"They're physical. Like I said earlier, from watching a little bit of tape, the one thing that they've done is they've let up some big plays, just simple catches out of the backfield for the running back or little crossing routes and things like that where quarterbacks have only thrown the ball a couple yards and the guys have ran a good distance with the ball. I'm sure that stuff is not that hard to correct, and if you eliminate some of those things, I think they've done a pretty good job.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LmmDap TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:46:27.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
