I really like that!\" Sebata says. \n\"She could be surprised by some winters here yeah!\" O'Gorman Tennis Coach Don Barnes says. \nIt'll take you even less time to see just how good the O'Gorman freshman is with a tennis racquet. \n\"The strongest part of my game would probably be my backhand at the moment. It's always been my favorite shot. It's just made life easier for me!\" Danielle says. \nSebata's road to Sioux Falls starts in her native home of Bornmouth, England. A mear 4,175 miles and 15 hours by plane away. \n\"I came here last year just to visit and play some tournaments around and I really liked it. So when I went back home, I mean, my parents wanted to move anyway, and we have family here as well.\" Sebata says. \nThat would be her cousin, Dodi Makwinja, who plays for the O'Gorman football team. And Sebata quickly found another family with her new tennis team. \n\"I was really overwhelmed. I really don't think I would have done it without such a supportive team around me. But it's been great!\" Danielle says. \nAnd Danielle looked at home in her first season, going 31-0 in singles play and capturing the top flight singles and doubles state championships. \n\"She's got long arms, long legs, so she's got some leverage with her for the power shots. And I think put another year on and she's going to pound it even more.\" Barnes says. \nIf that's true.... \n\"It would be nice to go to college as well. A very good college down south and play tennis down there so that's obviously one of my main goals.\" Sebata says. \nDanielle's journey is only just beginning.
