When Solomon rejoined the lineup last week after recovering from a concussion, you did hear that huge sigh of relief, right? \nWhile he was out, Arizona completed just 23 of 51 passes for 256 yards, a paltry 5.0 yards per attempt. If you extrapolated that figure over the course of a whole season -- which would be kind of silly, but you'll get our point -- that yards-per-attempt number would rank 127th out of 128 teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision. \nIck. \nWhat's more, only two of those 51 passes from backups Jerrard Randall and Brandon Dawkins resulted in completions of longer than 20 yards. \nSolomon's return last week in a 44-7 win over Oregon State put everything back in sync. He's the chicken soup and mashed potatoes of this team. Anu Solomon is comfort food. \n\"Anu, on and off the field, is just a super-chill person,\" said receiver Samajie Grant \n\"He has that personality. Even in bad situations, we don't ever panic, not with Anu at quarterback because Anu is just always calm. If he misses a pass or misses a read, he'll sit there like nothing happens. He keeps everybody else calm and he doesn't ever panic. That is what helps us out a lot.\" \nSolomon wasn't great against Oregon State. Nobody is saying that. He missed some throws he should have hit. But he was good. And just his presence made the receivers feel good about their chances to catch passes, and Solomon's passing ability stretched the OSU defense enough that the running game could find easier footing and bigger holes. \n\"He's our starting quarterback because he's the best we have at operating the whole system,\" said coach Rich Rodriguez, whose team plays at Colorado on Saturday. \"Anu does have a feel for the game. ... He makes some big plays because he does see some big plays developing.\" \nSolomon was 17 of 30 for 276 yards against Oregon State. He had a 50-yard pass and a 70-yard completion. Six of his completions covered at least 18 yards. \n\"A little rusty,\" he said Monday of his performance. \"I can tell, throwing the ball out there, I was lobbing it. I need to go in and get an extra lift in because I haven't lifted in two weeks.\" \nSolomon suffered the concussion in the second quarter of the UCLA game, when, while trying to slide at the end of a run, his head hit a defender's thigh. What does he remember about that? \n\"Nothing,\" he said. \"Not a thing.\" \nHe was forced to watch from home a week later when the team lost at Stanford. \n\"Depressing. Very sad,\" he said of what it was like to sit out. \n\"It was my first time not traveling, just watching my team go out there and compete without me. ... It was weird. It was frustrating at times, but just weird.\" \nIt was weirder for the team to be without him. \nGrant was asked if the \"calm\" vibe changes when Randall is at quarterback. \n\"The only difference with Jerrard in there, is we know he's going to run it,\" Grant said with a grin, drawing big laughs at the team's press conference Monday. \n\"He even tells us, 'I'm going to run the ball.' We get ready to block.\" \nBefore Solomon's injury, you might have heard calls for Randall (the long-run touchdown specialist) to get more time, or for the coaches to kick the tires on Dawkins, a redshirt freshman. \nBut now everyone has a better idea of what it means to miss Anu Solomon. \nHe keeps the receivers happy. He can hit big plays. He keeps the defense from keying on the running attack. He knows where and when to deliver the ball. \nSolomon doesn't have a \"wow\" factor. He's not a fast runner. He doesn't have a huge arm. He doesn't have the stature of a prototypical pocket passer. \nHe's not caviar. \nBut sometimes all you need is comfort food. \n* * * \nAnthony Gimino has covered University of Arizona athletics for more than two decades, including as the football beat writer for the Arizona Daily Star and the columnist for the Tucson Citizen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:57:06.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
