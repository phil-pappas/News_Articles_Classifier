I think the first match is always very tough, to feel the conditions, the court. Today I felt a little bit lighter on my feet.” \nJankovic, 30, has never played 21-year-old Gavrilova. \n“She’s a young and up-and-coming player and she’s had a great season. It will be our first encounter and I look forward to playing it,” she said. \nAustralian Samantha Stosur beat Puerto Rico's Monica Puig 6-4 6-4 to secure her quarter-final place. \nStosur will play Britain’s Heather Watson who beat Taiwan’s Lee Ya-hsuan in three sets today. \nSeven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams will play her second-round match tomorrow, when she takes on Wang Ya-fan of China. \nWilliams, 35, is fighting for a place in the eight-player WTA Finals in Singapore later this month with Hong Kong her last chance to get the points she needs. \nShe is currently 11th in the Road to Singapore rankings. \nWorld number nine Angelique Kerber takes on Kurumi Nara in her second-round match, also tomorrow. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:19:21.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
