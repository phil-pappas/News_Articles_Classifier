We love Vidal. He’s a good guy. He’s made some mistakes, we all know that. I’m sure he’s going to play well (Tuesday).”\nThe Argos left Hazelton behind in Toronto 11 days ago when the team came to Ottawa in a move that could have backfired because of the rookie’s talent and the Argos’ fragile position in the standings. The Argos are two points behind Hamilton and Ottawa in the East, although all three teams have five losses.\nHazelton, a USC and Cincinnati product, has caught 47 passes for 565 yards and five touchdowns this season. At 6-foot-2, he combines with 6-foot-4 Tori Gurley and 6-foot-3 Kevin Elliott to give Toronto three towering, physical receiving threats.\nWhen the benching came, the Argos were on a three-game losing skid and Hazelton was the team’s leading receiver (he is now No. 2 behind Gurley in yards). Milanovich had already pulled Hazelton for one series against Winnipeg in mid-August. But there was no zip to the lip. The benching sent a message that Milanovich is not afraid to show who’s boss.\nThe Argos responded with perhaps their most complete game of the CFL season on Sept. 26 by beating the Redblacks here 35-26, and Hazelton’s replacement, Diontae Spencer, stepped up with four catches for 62 yards and 77 more yards on three kickoff returns. Spencer will also dress against Ottawa on Tuesday.\nMilanovich likes the emotion that players such as Hazelton, Gurley and Elliott bring to a game, but with a caveat.\n“It’s a fine line that those guys walk,” Milanovich said. “I love that emotion. It feeds through your team. That’s what’s so difficult: to play on the edge, but not go over the line.”\nGurley doesn’t want Hazelton to over-correct and become placid.\n“I want that dog to come out,” Gurley said. “While we’re in the huddle, we’ll contain him, but I want him to be a dog because that’s what makes Vidal the player he is. He’s an animal out there and we need that.”\nNOTES: The Argos will debut Canadian punter Anthony Alix. The Argos signed him Sept. 30 after releasing American Michael Palardy, who played only one game. The move was made for import/non-import ratio reasons. Alix, who spent some time with the Argos in 2012, was released Aug. 18 by the Redblacks after playing in six games . . . Running back Curtis Steele, who has been injured all season, will dress in place of Chad Kackert . . . This game is proving to be a tough sell. Ticket sales as of Monday were just a bit above 11,000 in TD Place Stadium, but this was Redblacks’ third home game in 11 days, and it was a late add-on to the schedule after the Blue Jays’ playoff drive forced the Argos to seek another venue.\nMore on thestar.com\nRaffi Torres gets 41-game ban for illegal hit to the head", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:10:44.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
