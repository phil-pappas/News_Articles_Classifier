Presumably, if Bickell clears waivers and is assigned to Rockford, one of the forwards assigned there could take his place on the roster. If Bickell clears waivers and is assigned to Rockford, the Hawks stand to recoup $950,000 in salary-cap space.\nThe Hawks also placed goaltender Michael Leighton on waivers, according to a source.\nIn addition to Dano those players are Ryan Hartman, Vincent Hinostroza, Brandon Mashinter, Dennis Rasumssen and Garrett Ross. Defensemen Erik Gustafsson and Ville Pokka were also assigned to Rockford.\nWith Michal Rozsival and Kyle Cumiskey injured, it would appear David Rundblad, Viktor Svedberg and Trevor van Riemsdyk will make up the back end of the blue line for the Hawks to start the season. Duncan Keith, Brent Seabrook, Trevor Daley and Niklas Hjalmarsson are the top four.\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ead9f/turbine/ct-spt-blackhawks-roster-cuts-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:00:32.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
