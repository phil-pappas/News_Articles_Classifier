Which means actual running. \nRun, Anu, run. \n\"If they're dropping eight (into coverage), I need to run,\" Solomon told reporters on Tuesday, talking about how Colorado's defense was playing against Arizona last week. \n\"I need to be the dual threat I used to be. I just got comfortable sitting in the pocket. ... I'm not really a runner, but if I have to, I will. If the defense if giving it to me, I just have to attack the defense and be smart on the field.\" \nSolomon isn't too far removed from a concussion Sept. 26, which forced him to miss the next week's game at Stanford. So, there might be hesitation on his part to keep the ball and take off. And coaches might not want to risk it, either, tailoring the game plan to try to limit hits on Solomon. \nWhatever the case, it wasn't working against Colorado. The problem was solved by making a call to the bullpen for Randall's legs. The success of that move -- he directed three touchdown drives as Arizona came from behind -- has led to this week's mystery. \nRandall or no Randall? \nTune in Saturday... \nTHREE WILDCATS TO WATCH \nRB Jared Baker -- Starting running back Nick Wilson missed last week's game and is still questionable because of a foot injury. Wilson is better at getting some of the tough yards, but there is no doubt Baker has a burst and his 207-yard effort marked the sixth time a Wildcat has hit 200 rushing yards under Rodriguez. \nCB Cam Denson -- Somebody has to defend those 55.3 passes per game that Washington State attempts, a figure that leads the nation. Denson is healthy, so that's a start. Fellow starting cornerback DaVonte' Neal has missed the past two games with a hamstring injury and is listed as questionable, although he expressed confidence after Wednesday's practice that he's ready to play. Denson intercepted a pass against the Cougars last season, playing a lot after Jarvis McCall was injured in the first half. \nDE Reggie Gilbert -- Last season against Washington State, Arizona moved linebackers Scooby Wright and Derrick Turituri to defensive end, pushing ends Gilbert and Dan Pettinato inside. That would be a swell plan again, but Wright and Turituri are out because of injuries. We'll see what defensive coordinator Jeff Casteel comes up with, and Gilbert's flexibility is plus. \n\"He swallows up a lot of blockers,\" Rodriguez said. \"Reggie has the ability to play inside and outside in our front. He's just a really good football player.\" \nTHREE COUGARS TO WATCH \nQB Luke Falk -- The sophomore has nice stature at 6-4, 205 pounds, to be the accurate delivery man in coach Mike Leach's Air Raid offense. He has been intercepted only four times in 325 attempts this season, averaging almost 400 passing yards per game. He was sacked 14 times in back-to-back games earlier this season, but was quicker with his release last week against Oregon State, when he threw six first-half touchdown passes and was sacked just twice. \nS Shalom Luani -- He's the reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week after intercepting two passes and making 11 tackles against Oregon State. The junior college transfer is a big-time hitter who has forced two fumbles among his 46 tackles. \nWR Gabe Marks -- Marks is a former four-star recruit from Los Angeles who had at least three other Pac-12 offers, including Arizona State. He redshirted last season, but he's back to his team-leading ways with 49 catches for 620 yards and six touchdowns. Other headaches for the Wildcats will be Dom Williams (36 for 526, six TDs) and River Cracraft (33 for 382, three TDs). \nNOTES \n--True freshman CB Jace Whittaker got a surprise start last week, which says something about the lack of health and experience at the position. Question is: What has become of true freshman Sammy Morrison, who started the first two games of the season? \nRodriguez says Morrison is healthy but lacks ideal strength for now. \n\"He's a freshman and about 160 pounds,\" Rodriguez said. \n\"He's going to be a really good player as we get him in the weight room and as he gets experience. I really like Sammy Morrison.\" \nRodriguez suggested Morrison could have a bigger role this week as it is all hands on deck in the secondary vs. Washington State. \n--Arizona will induct running back Kadeem Carey and receiver Bobby Wade into its Ring of Honor at Arizona Stadium during a halftime ceremony. \n--Washington State's defensive line coach is Joe Salave'a, the former Arizona standout, NFL player and assistant coach under Mike Stoops. Salave'a was a first-team all-conference defensive tackle for the Wildcats in 1997, and they haven't had one since. Arizona is the only team in the league that has such a drought at defensive tackle. ARIZONA INJURIES \nQuestionable : CB DaVonte' Neal (hamstring), DB Tellas Jones (concussion), RB Nick Wilson (foot), DL Parker Zellers (knee) \nDoubtful: WR Tyrell Johnson (hamstring) \nOut : LB Derrick Turituri (hip), LB Scooby Wright (foot) \nWhat it means: We've talked about Neal and Wilson above. Zellers might not have been slated for a big role in this game, if the Wildcats go without a nose guard as they did last season against Washington. But defensive end Jack Banda -- The Sackmaster -- could have ample opportunity to follow up on his breakthrough game at Colorado. \nIt seems as if Johnson, the team's fastest player, is having nothing but bad luck. He missed the first five games with a foot injury. Not sure how long he will be out now, but because he played past the midpoint of the season, he's not eligible for a medical hardship. \nIf Jones can't go, Anthony Lopez is next up. That wouldn't be too much of a drop-off, but it would take away some depth and flexibility in the back end. \nPREDICTION \nArizona jumped out to a 31-0 lead at Washington State last season and coasted to a 59-37 win. We likely will see a repeat of the total points but not the runaway decision. The Cats are favored by about a touchdown, but call this one a coin flip. It's hard to see either defense stopping the other offense. \nLast year, Arizona schemed to get a four-man rush and play with essentially seven defensive backs, putting Tra'Mayne Bondurant and Jared Tevis in the second level of the defense. Those guys could tackle in space. Arizona isn't as good in that area, and Scooby Wright isn't around to cause three fumbles as he did last season. \nWhat am I'm saying is, I could easily see the Cougs winning this. But I do like the Cats' resourcefulness when they get into close games. \nArizona 48, Washington State 45.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:55:34.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
