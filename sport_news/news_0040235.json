By Diana Churchill If I could inherit one thing from my father, it would be what he often refers to as his “dumb luck.” Some people might call it divine guidance or the gift of being at the right place at the right time.\nMy dad joined the Army Air Corps when he got his draft notice before World War II. Had he not — through a series of circumstances that included training time, as well as recovery from an injury sustained when the cockpit cover blew off the plane he was flying — managed to arrive in Europe on the very day that the war ended, I likely would not be here writing these humble bird tales.\nMy dad is also fond of quoting well known photographer Ansel Adams, who, when asked the secret of his photographic success, replied “f-8 and be there.” Translated, that means “set the aperture on your camera to a standard-size opening and get out in the field.”\nWith watching and photographing birds, you have to get out there, but it sure helps to have a measure of luck. Even if you are just dealing with birds in your yard, you need to fill those feeders, and then spend some time actually watching them.\nWhen it seems like I am at the wrong place at the wrong time, I can come down with a case of the “grumps.” Last week, on Tuesday morning, two days after I got back from the Georgia Ornithological Society meeting on Jekyll Island, DNR biologist Tim Keyes found a juvenile red-footed booby on the fishing pier on St. Simons Island. I have never seen a red-footed booby. Were I a true bird nerd, I would have jumped in the car and immediately retraced my steps south. I hesitated, held back by “responsibilities.” For the next four days, I jealously read the reports while I kept the world safe for bird feeding at Wild Birds Unlimited.\nOn Thursday evening, I tried to get home to Tybee, only to be turned back by an accident that closed the road to Tybee for four hours. On Friday morning, several birders on Tybee North Beach — my home turf — saw a magnificent frigatebird flying from the river back towards the ocean. Where was I? In Savannah, on my way to work. Grump! Grump! Grump!\nAlso on Friday morning, down at St. Simons, at 7:30 a.m., the red-footed booby\nflew by the fishing pier, took one look at all the people gathered there, and headed south, presumably back out to sea. It hasn’t been reported since.\nOn Sunday morning, after my week of work, I woke up early, finally able to hit the beach for some long-awaited birding. It was raining. Grump and again grump!\nBefore I headed to church, I did my morning bird chores — put out mealworms for the wrens and cardinals, filled the safflower feeders for the piggy house finches, and topped off the millet feeder, which was half-empty even though I hadn’t seen a bird in it for a couple of weeks. As I made one quick stop in the bedroom, I glanced at the feeder just in time to see a handsome male painted bunting chowing down on the millet. Presto, change-o, forget the grumps! I was cured!\nAfter church, I headed down to Richmond Hill to visit my co-worker Nicole. We had planned to go to St. Simon’s if the booby were still in residence. Instead, we watched the birds in her yard. There were cardinals, house finches and brown-headed cowbirds at the seed feeders, and half-a-dozen bluebirds chowing down on mealworms. A young male ruby-throated hummingbird perched on a branch near the nectar feeder. (Yes, there are some still around!) Two lime-green female painted buntings snacked on millet. A pair of blue jays ignored the feeders, preferring to dine on the abundant crop of acorns.\nAs we wandered near the small pond, I spied another migrant, a yellow-billed cuckoo, snacking on a prickly caterpillar. Cuckoos are usually easier to hear than to see, and this one was perched at eye level in the open, not far from a cuckoo buffet — a tree filled with tent caterpillar webs. We didn’t have our cameras, but this cuckoo obligingly remained in place while I fetched them from the house. Even without seeing the red-footed booby or the magnificent frigatebird, I can still count myself among the bird lucky.
