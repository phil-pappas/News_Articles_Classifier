Photo by Ian Shalapata. \nBy Ian Shalapata \n(TECUMSEH, ON) – The world-famous OPP Golden Helmets rode into town on Sunday to put on a free display of motorcycle precision riding. A large crowd gathered along a closed section of Tecumseh Road as the 14-strong team manoeuvred intricately through a series of professional ridership demonstrations.

The synchronized performance is a display of manoeuvrability with slow speeds and balance at the top of the skill set. But, it is not without some danger in the criss-cross and thread-the-needle patterns run at high speed. The OPP Golden Helmets in Tecumseh on 11 Oct. 2015.

Each season, a nucleus of returning riders train a new cadre of replacements. Each member has a three-week training course and at least one year of regular motorcycle patrol duty experience, before joining the team. The OPP Golden Helmets in Tecumseh on 11 Oct. 2015.
