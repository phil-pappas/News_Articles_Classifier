The veteran replacement for Brandon Weeden completed 20 of his 27 passes -- except three were completed to members of the Giants secondary. \nEven still, Bryant walked off the field with some swagger. \nThe star wideout, who hasn't played since Week 1 due to a broken bone in his foot, told hecklers in the stands at MetLife Stadium that the Cowboys would still \"run the [NFC] East,\" pointing to the star on his chest. #Cowboys @DezBryant leaves the field with a promise - &quot;We still gon&#39; run the East!&quot;&#10;&#10; #WFAACowboys #NFL pic.twitter.com/5u5gyo2IiT â€” Mike Leslie (@MikeLeslieWFAA) October 25, 2015 \nWFAA's Mike Leslie captured the moment on video . \nDallas is 1.5 games behind the division-leading Giants after breaking a seven-game road winning streak against NFC East rivals. An anemic passing attack has hindered the Cowboys without Bryant and starting quarterback Tony Romo. Darren McFadden put up 152 rushing yards in Sunday's loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:56:23.106+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
