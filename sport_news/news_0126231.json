Just let everyone vent and then we'll go from there.​ \n*I'm an ex-Spartan and an ex-pro baseball player. Every article I've read, or sportscast I've seen and heard, folks are talking about the incredulous, miracle ending in Saturday's MSU-Michigan game. Some called it \"fluky,\" \"good fortune\" for the Spartans, with no mention of credit to the Spartans for what they did to win the game. Having competed as an athlete on all levels, I recognized it as an excellent football play that went well for one team, and bad for another. Sorry, there was nothing \"fluky\" about it. \nWith 10 seconds left in the game, and Michigan choosing to punt, MSU put in its \"Ranger\" team to rush the punter. Eleven guys on the line of scrimmage, with no one back to defend a punt. Personally, I've seen teams do this before, perhaps not as \"all-out\" as this, but it was a \"punt pressure\" play designed to rush the punter into making a mistake, i.e., to block his punt or, in this case, have him feel the all-out pressure from the rush defense, which might cause him to panic, take his eye off the snap, or worse, forget what the smart thing would be to do, like fall on the ball. \nWhatever the case, the play worked. MSU's last-ditch, furious rush, distracted the Michigan kicker's concentration, and a well-designed, well-practiced football play happened, to Michigan State's benefit. Think of it in the same way as when teams blitz the opposing quarterback. They hope to cause the QB to take a loss, make an errant throw, take him out of his comfort zone, lose his concentration, rush his thought process, etc., ultimately causing him to make a mistake, possibly resulting in a turnover. \nTHIS is what happened Saturday night. It wasn't \"fluky.\" It wasn't \"good fortune.\" It wasn't luck. IT WAS A SMART, WELL-EXECUTED, SPECIAL TEAMS FOOTBALL PLAY! And, in State's case, it worked so well, it won the game for them. \nPeople who have competed on a high level in sports understand my reasoning. The game is played for the full 60 minutes. This game wasn't over. There were still 10 seconds left to play. You play until the final whistle/buzzer sounds. You play to win or lose until the full 60 minutes are up. If nothing else, this should be a good lesson for playing hard, and not giving up until the clock shows no time left. \nWith 10 seconds left in the game, State ran a practiced, special teams, punt pressure play, and it created so much havoc (and pressure) for the Michigan punter that he panicked, resulting in a winning football play for MSU. That's what these Spartans special team players were coached to do. \nForget luck. Winners make their own \"luck.\" Instead, everyone should give the MSU players and coaches credit. THEY made this so-called \"luck,\" this \"fluke,\" happen! \nSo, please stop saying it was fluky, lucky, good fortune, incredulous, a miracle, whatever other words you might want to use to take away from the outstanding football play that Michigan State made, one that's been practiced hundreds of times. \nIt was not some surreal occurrence that caused the Michigan punter to muff the snap, and \"lose his mind.\" A football play was the culprit! \nAnd sadly, typical of the arrogant, elitist, pompous Jim Harbaugh, instead of crediting Michigan State with executing an outstanding football play, he blamed the refs for their penalty calls, and blamed his kicker, saying \"he made a mistake.\" Maybe it was you, Jim, who made the mistake, especially since you had other options. Perhaps, the former Australian rugby kicker made a mistake, but just maybe Jim it was created by the fierce rush put on by Michigan State's \"Ranger\" special team. \nExcuses, excuses. What is fact is that the excuses made for MSU's win by some are seemingly meant to take away from the fact that State's players went all out for a full 60 minutes determined to do ALL they could to win the game. They deserve to hear what a great play they made, not hear that they won by virtue of a pure lucky play. \nSo, NO, it was not a bad snap that lost the game for Michigan. It was not the referees. It was not the kicker. It was not some divine influence coming down from Sparty heaven to ruin almighty Michigan's victory party. It simply was a well-coached, perfectly executed, damn good football play that won the game for MSU! \nJoseph \n*I'm seeing a consistent thread among some writers saying Michigan really outplayed the Spartans. Then the game was stolen. That isn't the way the stats show the game. The blatant pass interference calls that went uncalled against Michigan in the fourth quarter, and the 12-second wait to allow the TD call for Michigan surely offsets the bad call on ejecting Joe Bolden. Article idea: the last play was kind of a fluke, but the game wasn't. We had over 100 more yards than Michigan and neither rushing attack was effective. \nI'm not a whiner, but I sure would like to see a balanced article on how a win for Michigan 23-21 wouldn't have been domination anyway. Take out the last play and Michigan wins.... It would have been a good victory for Blue but hardly domination. Some of these writers are making it seem like one play undid a flawless game from Michigan. It wasn't that way. Let's not be revisionists. \nBen \n*I wish to point out the MSU win against U-M is being minimized. Saturday's ending was \"lucky\" and I agree with your words. However, I prefer to think of it as \"FORTUNE FAVORS THE PREPARED MiND\" \nYou introduced this aspect by mentioning MSU's special teams Ranger quad after Riley Bullough named the special teams unit during a video interview. I hope someone will elaborate on the Rangers duties of punt blocking and or returning a blocked punt. We know they practice it and this preparation led to the win. \nIn contrast, why are there so few stories regarding U-M's failure to prepare an Aussie kicker for punting with the game on the line or falling on a bad snap at any time? SI's Michael Rosenberg is the only journalist to directly question U-M's preparation. Dan Wetzel of Yahoo pointed out U-M's inappropriate punt team alignment facing MSU's Ranger's 10 man rush (one MSU player covered UM's gunner). To further my pro U-M slant on the game's last play, I am going to mention the largest-reaching sources of college football and basketball news outlets do influence opinions, and they are pushing the luck and lo- probability angle. Although true to a degree, the tone and context minimizes MSU's credibility or ability to earn and take advantage of such opportunities. It appears CBS and ESPN are unlikely to question Harbaugh's assistant's inadequate coaching after featuring Harbaugh since his return CFB coaching ten months ago, but I expect local media outlets to address this aspect. \nAgain, there are many teams that have had opportunities and failed to capitalize on those opportunities. MSU did prepare and U-M failed to prepare their Australian punter in case of such an event occurring. \nChris in Ireland \n*Reports of MSU's demise have been greatly exaggerated. The Harbaugh lovefest and hype machine fueled by the media since his hiring this past December was derailed this past Saturday night. The coronation cancelled. \nDid you hear it Saturday night? The collective gasp of hubris, arrogance and overconfidence that wafted out from Michigan Stadium was audible nation-wide but heard loudest the 65 miles between Ann Arbor and East Lansing. Just when the \"Weasel Wolverine\" thought it was safe to stick its head up out of the \"Big Hole\" and claim its self-ordained place as ruler of the State of Michigan, B1G and soon the country … Dantonio, Cook, Burbridge, Watts-Jackson, et al… ripped a beating heart out of their collective chest, held it up still pulsating for all to see and then discarded it the end-zone in a post-game celebration for the ages. Revenge is best served cold. \nLucky? Perhaps, but you still have to give credit where credit is due. MSU had no one back to field the punt, punt block team on the field. Michigan knew we were coming, Harbaugh said as much in the post-game presser. MSU executed the play perfectly and their guy panicked giving us the desired outcome from an oft-maligned special teams unit -- albeit by a fortuitous mishandling of the ball. Still, luck and success are more often the result of repetition and practice than the proverbial blind squirrel finding the occasional nut. \nDue respect given to both teams for a great game played but this was beyond surreal, an event that while not necessarily reaffirming Dantonio and MSU's dominance, certainly delayed U-M's projected rise. The national media disrespect for Dantonio and MSU was a festering sore that needed to be lanced. Dismissive rhetoric akin to \"nice run boys but there's a new sheriff in town.\" You saw it in Dantonio's face, heard it in his voice. While not pretty or dominating, all Dantonio's team does is win… somehow, someway. It's not how, it's how many. The type of game that MSU loses under prior coaching regimes. We may be the worst undefeated team in the country but we are still in the hunt and conversation for divisional, conference and final four consideration. While the gap with U-M may be closing the current streak now stands at three in a row and seven of the last eight. Little Brother is all \"grow'd\" up! We defiantly say; Molon Labe -- \"Come, take it from us!\" Once again, all is right in the universe. Good conquers evil. \nBrian \n*Just posted this after doing some research, as I've been hounded by some U-M fans who are friends of mine. What do you know about this? \nPer NCAA Approved Ruling 9-1-2-XVIII-XX: Immediately after the snap, with Team A in an obvious scrimmage kick formation, noseguard B71 attempts to \"shoot the gap\" between the snapper and the adjacent lineman. B71's initial legal contact is with the lineman next to the snapper. RULING: Legal. Incidental contact with the snapper after this initial legal contact is not a foul (Rule 2-15-10).\" \nSo if the defensive player first contacts a player other than the snapper, and then incidentally contacts the snapper, it is legal (from what I can see of the rule). From what I can see of the replay, it does appear that the MSU player is attempting to \"shoot the gap\" and is blocked into the snapper, which would make it a legal play. Once again, justice prevails and MSU can now be declared the legitimate winner in the eyes of the Lord, the NCAA and Muddy Waters. \nCarl \n*I think it's been a little funny – and totally predictable – that there's already been a bit of revisionist history done in the media about that last play. As if MSU didn't really do anything right to deserve the win, and Harbaugh was just a victim of his punter. I was listening to some guy on ESPN who was acting like Michigan actually won the game – as if the game was only 59: 50 long. \nThe truth is, yes, the mishandled punt was certainly the center of it all. But the MSU coaches did all the right things — put pressure on to get the punter jumpy, and put their players in the right place to execute. The U-M coaches, including Harbaugh, did not. Among 10 things U-M coaches failed on was why in the world send guys out to cover the gunners when there was no one back to get the punt? Protect the punter. That's it. They didn't do it. \nAnd that run – 38 yards was no easy thing. He almost went out of bounds, then he turned back to the field and committed – end zone or bust. If you ask me, with all the apologists out there, nearly no one has given Jalen Watts-Jackson all the credit he deserves. He's more than just a guy who lucked out and got the ball, which is the conclusion on way too many reports about this. He was in the right spot, and that was a hell of a gutsy run. He gets tackled, MSU loses. He goes out of bounds, we probably lose. \nGod Bless Harbaugh, but Harbaugh ain't God. But lots of sports writers seem to think he is. \nMark \n* I just read your most recent blog post from Oct 20 -- very good, love to hear about other journalists' past experiences with crazy finishes. You mention how Matt Macksood \"topples\" the long snapper. Well, I have heard that from some U-M fans and I think it is just sour grapes. If you re-watch the play again (for the umpteenth time -- I smile every time), it appears that Macksood gets blocked into the long snapper, therefore, in my mind, negating any sort of phantom penalty. Not sure that's how the referees saw it, but that's how I see it -- probably just because I am a Spartan fan. \nAnyway, one other thing I was wondering about...I've heard how upset some journalists get when something crazy like that happens at the end of the game and his/her story is trashed. My question is: Do you keep those stories that get trashed? Would make for an interesting book possibly. And fun to look back on and reminisce. \nBen \nBen, I just hit delete. The larger response here is simple, to MSU and Michigan fans: You're never going to hear what you want to hear from the other side. MSU fans want everyone to say this was simply a great play by a better-coached team at the expense of the naked emperor, who's also apparently an evil emperor. Michigan fans want it known this was pure luck – in a game that, if called correctly by officials, would have ended 48-3 Michigan. Anyone who actually watched the game saw two evenly matched teams, MSU with the better quarterback, both with excellent defensive play, U-M with a much better kicking game, and the Wolverines in position for the win. Then the luck (and I don't care how many people were unblocked or how intimidating they were) of a dropped punt. Then a great play by MSU to take advantage. Cool? \n* I think I know No. 1, but how would you rank Saturday's punt botch TD, Little Giants, Cousins-Nichol Hail Mary and Spartan Bob/Duckett? \nMike in Stockton, Calif. \nRank as in wildness of play/situation, I assume. The only other time I've seen a press box react with pure shock on a game-ending play was \"Little Giants,\" and that one has to go No. 2 on the list (obviously after the one we just saw). Then I'm going Spartan Bob and the finish of the 2001 game. And that boring old Hail Mary last. What a beat, eh? \n* MSU vs. U-M was a modern-day version of three yards and a cloud of black rubberized pellets. It looked like both coaches were more than happy to run the ball, play defense, play field position, don't turn it over, win special teams, all the old cliches. In the end, Coach D seemed to take more risk. Do you think that is because Coach Harbaugh is more prone to coaching risk-averse NFL games or because Coach D felt it was needed to get a win? \nMichelle \nMichelle, I think it's because Mark Dantonio is by nature an aggressive coach in big games. I really can't speak for Harbaugh on that. You're right that for the most part, both sides were careful. But it's almost a guarantee that Dantonio will try something jazzy in a big game – going back to the exact same fake punt working in consecutive weeks in 2007 against Purdue and Penn State (though Penn State had the encore performance stuffed until Jehuu Caulcrick made a great individual play). There's \"Little Giants\" and \"Mousetrap\" and \"Charlie Brown\" and the Mike Sadler fake punt at U-M in 2012 and so on, and how about that fake extra point against Wisconsin in the Big Ten title game? The funny thing is, if MSU ends up losing this game we're talking a lot more this week about the MSU fake punt that didn't work. \n* I've heard in the past that cheering is not done in the press box. Having heard the MSU radio call and hearing the shouts in the background I'm wondering: Was the \"unwritten rule\" broken, or were the cheers/shouts we heard from the MSU coaching staff? What is the set-up in the U-M press box and is it any different from other stadiums? Are the \"non-cheering\" sportswriters separate from the radio and TV teams and the coaching staffs? I'm curious about the culture in this world you operate in and what happens at big moments in big games. Can you share with your readers some other unwritten rules that we might not know about or find interesting? \nRob R. \nThis is a great question. And I'm very glad to clear this up – the \"press box\" is inhabited by writers, broadcast media, athletic communications folks and stadium employees. There's no cheering there, though at times a violator will pass through (or a bunch of them – looking at you, Notre Dame). The radio teams have their own enclosed rooms, at every stadium I've encountered. Sometimes they're on the same level as the press box (they are at U-M and MSU) and sometimes they're on a different floor altogether. The radio folks can, and do, yuck it up all the want. And it's the same thing with the coaching boxes. Sometimes they're at press box level (they are at MSU and U-M), sometimes on a different level. I still remember the old Ohio State press box, the coaches were directly above the writers and you could vividly hear fists slamming against windows and tables. I'm not sure whether it was someone from the MSU radio box or coaching box on Saturday, but someone leaked into the hallway and let out a piercing scream of joy that could be heard all through the press box a few seconds after Jalen Watts-Jackson found the end zone. \n* Is MSU the most snake-bitten team of destiny in the history of sports? Perfect evidence is the last play of the game, pulling the miracle ending to win, and also making sure that they have a significant injury after finally looking like they survived a game without one. \nSpartisimo \nI thought of that, too, the fact that MSU had to make sure to have a serious injury in tandem with the incredible victory. But this \"team of destiny\" is starting to get healthier in some ways. And that's really the only way it has any chance of maintaining that label past Nov. 21. \n* I try to email you with a question that not everyone else is going to email you but for the love of God what is wrong with our special teams? I understand Tyler O'Connor in for the Michigan game to enable a trick play but from Jake Hartbarger not placing the punts without them rolling into the end zone to Michael Geiger missing field goals to our (lack of) coverage on kick/punt returns … what is going on? New coach Mark Snyder was hired as the special teams and linebackers coach. Can't say I have one single issue with the LBs, especially with how nicely Jon Reschke and Chris Frey are doing with filling in for Ed Davis. But I keep thinking the special teams aspect is going to improve from week to week and it just isn't. Specifically on the return coverage … what's the issue? I know we have been spoiled in recent years (especially with Mike Sadler dropping them in behind the 10 yard line) but this is pathetic. The biggest thing, in my opinion, that needs to fixed immediately is no more short fields for our opponents. \nKeithKZ \nI'm writing a story on this for later in the week, Keith, and I talked to Mark Snyder (not the one who covers U-M for us) about it. The bottom line is MSU needs its specialists to live up to their ability. Start there and everything looks better. MSU's coverage units are not disastrous as they were early in the season, but U-M certainly got plenty done in that regard Saturday (thanks in part to Tyler O'Connor hitting some line drives, in a punter switch I think switches back this week). But your concerns are valid and MSU will have a much tougher time reaching its goals if it can't improve in this aspect. \n* Maybe it's time to flip the question on this year's team. Rather than asking what's wrong with the Spartans, let's ponder if Mark Dantonio is coach of the year material. He's really had to scramble to deal with injury issues on offense and defense, and performance issues from kickers. Despite that, the team is 7-0 and still dreaming. Given that MSU has tended to improve late in the season the past three years, I could see this being a team no one wants to play come bowl season...even with a loss to Ohio State. \nJack from Oxnard \nJack, if the Spartans can absorb these injuries and somehow finish 11-1 or 12-0 in the regular season, I would think Dantonio would be on the short list. Of course, that also probably requires the people doing the voting to understand the quite astounding string of injuries his team has endured. Then again, any coach going 11-1 or 12-0 should be in the mix, right? \n* Two-part question about the defensive backfield. One, Dantonio has played true freshmen from time to time but has he ever done anything as bold as starting two side by side in a game of this magnitude? Two, if and when Darian Hicks returns am I being too optimistic to think that a back four of Hicks and Arjen Colquhoun at the corners and Cox/Willis/Miller/Nicholson at safety could be an improvement over the level of play seen after Copeland first got hurt? \nBill in Caledonia \nOn the first part, Bill, I just wrote about that move, it's probably not getting enough attention for how bold it was. And it worked. As for the second part, I'm not sure I buy that MSU can be better than what I saw in the first three quarters against Oregon, with Copeland and Cox at the corners, RJ Williamson playing really well and Montae Nicholson making some big plays. But I think it can be quite good with more growth. It will be interesting to see if MSU sticks that that freshman tandem or sends Cox to the back line once Hicks returns. The fact that there are still some viable options is kind of wild, right? 10 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1RWpAjc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:02:31.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
