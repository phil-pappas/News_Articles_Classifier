(AP) - Republicans including Gov. Phil Bryant and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves are touting their stewardship of the state's economy, but say they want Mississippi to do better.\nThe state has made economic progress in the last four years, but less than the nation. Mississippi's unemployment rate has fallen more slowly and wages have increased only half as fast as elsewhere. Employer payrolls have inched forward and the overall economy has barely grown.\nState economist Darrin Webb says Mississippi's economy has struggled for the last 15 years and needs strong national growth to pull it ahead.\nMississippi employer payrolls in September remained 2.6 percent below its prerecession high.\nWest Point resident Era Walker says she's making more, thanks to a new job, but says times remain hard in her town.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
