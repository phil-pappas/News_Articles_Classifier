Additional photos and a video below. CBS4 In March 2010, we told you about the murder of Lyndsay Pham at Aurora's Descano Plaza Apartments, which she co-owned and managed.\nIt didn't take long for investigators to identify two suspects: Descano assistant manager Lupe Rubio and Javier Aguirre, who were thought to have conspired to kill Pham.\nRubio subsequently confessed to her role in the crime and is currently a Colorado Department of Corrections inmate. But Aguirre evaded responsibility for his alleged role in the homicide for more than five years.\nThe reason: He fled to Mexico, and extraditing him proved difficult owing to his status as a Mexican national and the fact that he was wanted for murder, a crime that could have resulted in a death sentence — and while the United States allows capital punishment, Mexico does not.\nThe apartment building where Lyndsay Pham died. CBS4 In recent days, however, Aguirre was back in Colorado and finally facing prosecution for Pham's death.\nAround noon on March 3, 2010, as we reported at the time, officers with the Aurora Police Department were dispatched to the Descano, located on the 11100 block of East 16th Avenue.\nThe report: a critically injured woman subsequently identified as Pham. She had been beaten and was suffering from multiple stab wounds.\nRelated Stories Lyndsay Pham, Mile High Murder No. 77: Woman identified as slain apartment manager, police offer $5,000 reward First responders rushed Pham to a nearby hospital, but she ultimately died of her wounds. In the meantime, officers canvassed the area looking for suspects but came up dry.\nInvestigators at the crime scene in 2010. CBS4 As the investigation continued, however, suspicion fell on Rubio and Aguirre — and while Rubio was ultimately arrested and charged, Aguirre managed to make it to Mexico.\nGetting Aguirre back to the States wasn't easy.\n17th Judicial District DA Dave Young, speaking to CBS4 , notes that he had to take the death penalty off the table.\nThen, he essentially needed to convince authorities in Mexico of his case's merits.\nThe process was long and laborious.\nAnother family photo of Lyndsay Pham. CBS4 But to the great relief of Pham's family, extradition was ultimately arranged, and on Tuesday, Aguirre made his first appearance in Adams County Court.\nHe's due back before a judge for a preliminary hearing scheduled for October 14. Until then, he's behind bars.\nOur condolences to the friends, family and loved ones of Lyndsay Pham.\nLook below to see booking photos for Aguirre and Rubio, followed by the aforementioned CBS4 piece .\nJavier Aguirre.
