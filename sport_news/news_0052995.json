The shots that went in, they won’t count in a week, but it felt like they might. It was just the preseason, but maybe, Thursday at Staples Center, there was a moment people might remember.\nThe Clippers came back from 35 points down against the Portland Trail Blazers in their preseason finale, and it was the bench doing most of the heavy lifting.\nThere was Paul Pierce, staging his own, albeit late, Back to the Future day, hitting 3-points shots on three possessions in a row.\nThere was Austin Rivers, hounding opponents and hitting big shots, chest out, oozing confidence.\nThere was Wesley Johnson firing from the corners, hitting shots without hesitation.\nThere was Josh Smith, patrolling the paint and swatting away shots at the rim.\nAnd there were the starters on the bench, just like the fans in the seats, jumping up and down as the reserves finished off the wild comeback.\n“We were playing for real,” Rivers said.\nRivers and other members of the Clippers bench have seen a difference with their group over the past week, a difference that coincides with Johnson moving out of the starting lineup and into the second unit.\nMost players in Johnson’s position – on a one-year minimum deal auditioning for a hefty payday next summer – wouldn’t accept a demotion with grace, much less enthusiasm.\nBut Johnson sees the upside to coming off the bench.\n“We’re starting to build chemistry. In practice when they moved me down there, it was a comfortable fit,” Johnson said Thursday. “Playing with the starters, it was (comfortable) as well, but you were just trying to figure out how they play. They’ve been together awhile. You come in and you try not to do the wrong things when you’re with them, but with (the bench) you come in and it’s free flowing.”\nClippers coach Doc Rivers could see the ease Johnson played with off the bench, calling the forward’s lack of hesitation maybe his “favorite part” of Thursday’s win.\nJohnson’s enthusiasm about his new role comes from a simple place.\n“It’s bigger than me,” Johnson said. “We’re trying to do something historic here. That’s bigger than me. We want to win. That’s the main thing, and it’s everyone’s goal.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:13:45.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
