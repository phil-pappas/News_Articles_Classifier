He was the sports information officer for many years for the Tigers. He knows the game could sell out and that means many fans could be in search of a parking space. \nMark and Lee Ann Castellaw arrived at 1 p.m. Friday to beat Saturday’s traffic. \n\"I think it will be devastating; lots of traffic, lots of traffic,\" Lee Ann said. \nIt is the hottest game in the Mid-South and one of the Tigers’ biggest rivals. If you want to park in the Tiger Lane area, you need a pass and have it on display like the Castellaws did. Just having a pass is not enough; the person who gets the spot is the person who gets there first. \n\"We decided to come out early to make sure we claimed our spot,” said Randy Underwood. “We have a bunch of bandwagon jumpers coming on board, so we had get out here and make sure we got our spot.\" \nUnderwood is waiting for his camper to arrive. He told friends who plan to tailgate with him to show up early. \n\"It’s about rivals,” said Winn.”“It's about neighborhood, friendships, our players know their players. They all come from the same area.\" \nThose braving the chillier weather overnight had their own plans to cope with the weather. \n\"It's going to be cold,” said Dr. Lauren Mitt, who was wearing shorts and a t-shirt to the tailgate. \nMitt does plan to change, however. \n\"Jeans, sweatshirt, hoodie as much as we can get on.\" \nRalph Griggs plans on wearing shorts and a t-shirt to the game, however, proving he can bear the cold better than most. \n\"I work out in it year round,” Griggs said. “It’s just natural when you're waiting outside like we do. You don't get cold easily.” \nThe gates will open at 9 a.m. Saturday, 30 minutes earlier than usual. Kickoff for the game is 11 a.m. \nCopyright 2015 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.
