The experience of a game at Wrigley Field from this unusual perch has been part of Cubs lore for decades but the end may be in sight.\nThe team and the rooftop owners fought for months after the Cubs decided to erect ad-friendly videoboards at the stadium. The owners say the big signs and video screens block the view — and that's true — and that it unfairly impacted their businesses. The rooftops, more than a dozen of them, have a revenue-sharing contract with the Cubs based on ticket sales.\nBut a federal judge recently threw out a lawsuit brought by two rooftop businesses, and the Ricketts family that owns the Cubs and its entities has bought at least six buildings with rooftop businesses. Eventually, most fans believe, the rooftops will go away.\nThe 2015 postseason was the first for the Cubs since the team sliced into the view from the rooftops with the Jumbotron above the left-field wall and a huge videoboard in right field. There was no getting around the fact that these fans could not see as much of the action as they used to.\n\"Before, you at least saw 70, 80 percent of the flight of the ball,\" said Ken Kasowicz, 43, of Chicago, \"Now you see 25, 30 percent.\"\nThat meant these fans were forced to wait for a play to pop up on a nearby television screen to see exactly what they'd just cheered about. It was more time to brace for the ugly sight of a ball bouncing off Schwarber's glove in left field as the Mets cruised toward a commanding 3-0 NCLS lead — but it's not the best situation for a baseball fan eager to track the action in an era of smartphones.\nWaldron's friend, Amanda Burger, pointed to the Jumbotron and said: \"All this, it's just too much.\"\nThe Cubs won't comment about what plans they might have for the rooftops, but most agreed the beginning of the end of the rooftops has probably arrived.\n\"I don't know if all of them will (survive) but I don't think this location will,\" said Mike Osterhout, a 38-year-old fan who works in Chicago.\nFans said they don't begrudge the Cubs for putting up the new signs, particularly if the team uses the money to sign better players and keep top players.\nAt the same time, they say it would be sad if some or all the rooftop businesses disappear.\n\"They're part of what makes Wrigley Wrigley,\" Osterhout said.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
