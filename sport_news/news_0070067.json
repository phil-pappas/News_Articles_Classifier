He was arrested Sept. 15.\nOnce he was booked into the county jail, a detective with the Albuquerque Police Department realized Martinez matched the description of a man who robbed three businesses, two times each, throughout August and early September, according to a criminal complaint filed in Metropolitan Court.\nEach time Martinez robbed a business, he would return less than a month later to rob it again, according to the complaint.\nPolice said he pointed a gun at the clerk at the Valero Gas Station on Moon and Indian School to get his largest haul of $252 and $36 worth of cigarettes, two weeks after robbing the same clerk of $60. He also robbed a clerk at La Quinta Inn on San Antonio near Interstate 25 at gunpoint and threatened clerks at the Holiday Inn on Alameda NE with a knife and a screwdriver, according to the complaint. The last time Martinez robbed the Holiday Inn he walked out without any cash, only credit cards. He was arrested in the Family Dollar robbery three days later.\nClerks and officers watching surveillance footage from each robbery were able to identify Martinez by an “X” tattooed on one calf and an “8” on the other, police said.\nHe was rebooked in the Metropolitan Detention Center on five counts of armed robbery and one count of assault with intent to commit a violent felony.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/c01_jd_08oct_martinez-e1444281967652-125x175.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:28:16.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
