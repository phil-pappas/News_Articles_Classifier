Is Andy Dalton emerging as the best AFC North quarterback the Browns face? Can Josh McCown compete? Comment Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 11:21 PM BEREA • Browns game day notebook: Recalling Phil's famous bank shot Dalton, Flacco, Roethlisberger. Until now, alphabetical order is the only way anyone would list Cincinnati’s Andy Dalton ahead of Baltimore’s Joe Flacco and Pittsburgh’s Ben Roethlisberger in a ranking of Browns quarterback rivals in the AFC North. The light has come on for Dalton. In the Bengals’ 4-0 start, his passer rating is 123.0, a deep shot better than his 83.5 for the 2014 season. Hard times have fallen on Flacco as he heads into today’s game against the Browns. To wit: n Even after a lucky win at Pittsburgh, his Ravens are 1-3, and his passer rating, 80.5, is the worst since his rookie year of 2008. n He has won six of his last eight starts at home, but his only home game this year was a 28-24 loss in a duel against Dalton. n While Flacco has posted a quarterback rating of 100 or better 25 times in his eight-year career (and is 23-2 in those games), he has been under 100 in 10 of his last 14 home games, including the only one this year. n Even Flacco’s lone victory is tainted because of Roethlisberger’s situation; namely, out with a sprained knee. Flacco’s current supporting cast is hamstrung by injuries, forcing young receivers onto the field. “Joe has to make sure these young guys are up to speed and he can trust them,” offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said. “He can only do so much.” His contract demands much. He is in the third year of a six-year deal worth $120.6 million. Roethlisberger has been to more Super Bowls than Flacco, 3-1, but four seasons have come and gone since he even won a playoff game. Roethlisberger had a career year (4,952 passing yards, 103.3 rating) in 2014, but he has taken 424 sacks in 12 regular seasons, not counting beatings absorbed in 15 playoff games. Tom Brady has been in the league four years longer but has taken 54 fewer sacks. “Big Ben” will turn 34 a month after the Super Bowl, and the clock is running. Roethlisberger won two Super Bowls within his first five seasons with the Steelers. It is way too late for Dalton to match that. The Bengals are hoping hard, though, that Dalton is on the same career arc as Flacco was to start his career. Flacco reached postseasons in each of his first four years with the Ravens. So did Dalton with the Bengals. Flacco won a Super Bowl in his fifth season. This is Dalton’s fifth season. Dalton, 27, appears to be hitting his prime. On the other hand: n Roethlisberger is 0-2 in postseasons since losing in the Super Bowl in the 2010-11 campaign. His regular-season record since going to his third Super Bowl is 39-24. Prior to that, it was 69-29. Page 2 of 3 - n Flacco’s regular-season record since winning a Super Bowl in the 2012-13 season is 19-17. Prior to that, it was 54-26. Browns head coach Mike Pettine lost to Flacco twice last season. He was a defensive coach in Baltimore in 2008, Flacco’s rookie year. “We know a lot about Flacco,” Pettine said. “Big guy, can make all the throws, great touch on the long ball, the vertical routes, the posts, the corners. He throws them as well as anyone in the league. “And he can move better people think a guy that tall (6-foot-6) can move.” At 1-3, rallying the Ravens into contention is a tall order for Flacco. Dalton’s team has a three-game lead on the Browns and Baltimore. “We have to keep the faith,” Flacco said. “The Bengals are playing really well right now. We just have to win football games.” Going on 31, with injury replacements all around him, can he? After what happened to the Browns against old man Philip Rivers in San Diego, the Browns aren’t assuming much.
