To keep playoff hopes alive, the Titans must defeat Monticello at home on Senior Night next Friday. A Quincy Notre Dame kick return on the first play of the game set the tone early. Despite a late onside kick recovery, the Titans were unable to capitalize on several fourth downs throughout the second half. Charlie Bertelsen put up the only score for the Titans with a 36 yard run. With the win Quincy Notre Dame clinched the West Central Conference at 4-0. Monmouth-Roseville fell to 2-2 in the conference.
