Wapahani plays Burris on Thursday in the Burris Sectional semifinal. \nAfter watching the offense sputter for two sets, Wapahani coach Jared Richardson decided to switch up the rotation. At the start, he had Skyler VanNote and Estella Davis manning the middle, but VanNote was struggling to get into a rhythm. He moved VanNote to the outside and spread out the offense, letting the offense flow from the entire court. \n\"I've told the girls all year that it's going to take different rotations to get to the state finals,\" Richardson said. \"They responded as well as I could have asked them to.\" \nFor the first two sets, it was the Alysa Sutton and Emily Hale show. The Wapahani pair overwhelmed the Wes-Del defense, which in turn didn't allow Wapahani to set up its offense. \nWapahani had already beaten Wes-Del earlier in the season in three sets, giving Wes-Del even more incentive to hand its opponent a loss in the postseason.
