Smith said Texas should part ways with head coach Charlie Strong on First Take.\n\"Texas should wait until the season is over and then they should replace Charlie Strong,\" Smith said. \"I think people are misconstruing what I'm saying ... In no way am I questioning the football acumen or the coaching ability of Charlie Strong. I'm just saying the odds are stacked against him.\"\nSmith cited the fact that Texas is getting out recruited by other schools in the state including Houston as a reason Strong should go.\n\"We're talking the Texas Longhorns and you're being out recruited by Houston?\" Smith said. \"This ain't about Charlie Strong. I believe in this man. I believe in better circumstances he should stay. But the A.D. who hired him obviously hired him against the wishes of a bunch of boosters, alumni members, etc.\"\nSmith said behind Strong's back the boosters and alumni members want to get rid of him.\n\"See the handwriting on the wall,\" Smith said. \"They ain't going to support you, Charlie Strong. I don't care what they say get the hell out of there. Get out of there quick, fast and in a hurry.\"\nSmith said the people around Strong want him to fail.\n\"There are great opportunities for [Strong] elsewhere.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHAGDkt21U0"], "published": "2015-10-07T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:33:43.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
