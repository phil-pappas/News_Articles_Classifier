The Thunder won the first meeting 30-20 at McMahon Stadium on Oct. 4. \n“You have two teams that don’t like each other and that’s no secret,” Colts head coach Matthew Blokker said. “It gets pretty ugly down (at field level). The best way to describe it is that it’s ugly in the trenches. When we play them, it’s right on the edge — let’s just say that.” \nAnd it’s a sharps bet nothing will change when the ball is booted into the air at 1 p.m. \nThe Colts are playing well at the right time, and, in the words of recently deceased New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra, “it’s like deja vu all over again.” \nLast season, the team started playing its best football during the latter half of the regular season and bullied itself past the Thunder in the PFC semifinal before losing to the Saskatoon Hilltops in the final. \nApparently, the good vibrations that come with playing well seem to be exactly the same way for the ponies this year as well. \n”We’ve put in a couple of performances that have us peaking at the right time and playing playoff football,” Blokker said. “The boys are up for it.” \nThere’s no doubt the engines are going to be running hot off the top, so the Colts won’t need a blast of nitro to get revved up. Instead, they need to downshift in to game-play mode quicker than the opponent. \n“We all know there’s going to be a ton of emotion, and our job as coaches is to get us playing football and focusing on the next play as fast as possible,” Blokker said. “Once someone gets hit or makes a hit or runs around a bit, that part will slow down.” \nAnd let’s not sweep last week’s 34-4 victory over the previously undefeated Hilltops under the rug with the other dust bunnies. It was an achievement, and there was true value in the win over a less-than-full-strength opponent. \n“It was a good performance all the way around,” Blokker said. “That was our best performance of the year as far as playing for all 60 minutes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:09:54.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
