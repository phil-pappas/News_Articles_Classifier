It was kind of hot today.” \nIf the temperature stood at a touch sultry for late October, it was Bonaguidi who was really red-hot. \nAs she emerged from the woods in the last half-mile of the race, it became clear there were two races being run: Bonaguidi’s and everybody else’s. \nThe Terrier finished 38 seconds ahead of runner-up Anna DiMarcello of North Hunterdon. \n“There’s usually somebody with me,” said Bonaguidi, perhaps remembering the madcap finish at last year’s Skyland meet where she took third in a quartet of girls who all came in at pretty much the same time. \nNot this year. \n“She’s all alone!,” said one long-time Skyland official as Bonaguidi rolled to the finish line. \nBonaguidi now stands alone in another way – she’s the first Delaware Valley girl to win a Skyland individual cross country title in the 25-year history of the conference. She’s also the first Terrier to win any league title since Teresa Bennett finished first in the old Delaware River Conference in 1989. \nAnd remember, this is not just any conference meet – the Skyland has the top three teams in New Jersey in Ridge, Hillsborough and North Hunterdon. \nSo to dominate this field stands as one dazzling accomplishment for Bonaguidi, who had been equally impressive at the Hunterdon/Warren/Sussex championship at Phillipsburg last week. \n“The H/W/S meet showed me that if I pull away in any race, I can hold on and win it.,” Bonaguidi said. “It showed that when I want to go, it’s hard for girls to try and hang with me and I can control the race.” \nThat’s precisely what happened Thursday. As the race started up the steep hill in front of the majestic Natirar mansion, roughly a half-mile in, Bonaguidi took off and nobody went with her. \n“The last two and a half miles, nobody was close,” she said. “That’s actually more nerve-wracking for met than if I had somebody with me. That allows me to focus on running against that person rather than the clock.” \nBonaguidi had targeted Hillsborough’s Paige Novak as someone to run with. Novak finished fifth in 19:12. \n“We went to the same running camp in the summer and she beat me there,” Bonaguidi said. “But I think today Hillsborough was running as a pack to try and win the team title (won by North Hunterdon).” \nAs happy as Bonaguidi was to win the championship, the time nagged at her. \n“This wasn’t the day to run under 18 minutes, it was too hot,” she said. “I am a little disappointed.” \nOnly her own high standards can disappoint Hannah Bonaguidi these days. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
