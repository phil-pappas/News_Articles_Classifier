The recall now covers certain 2013 to 2016 Altima midsize cars and some 2016 Maxima large cars. Also included are some 2014 to 2016 Teana sedans made in Russia. All have V6 engines. Nissan says in documents posted by U.S. safety regulators that in a crash, fuel could leak from a seal between the gas tank and the fuel sending unit. That could cause a fire. The company says the problem was discovered in crash tests, and it has no reports of fires, injuries or fuel leaks. Dealers will install a retainer ring to help maintain a proper seal. The recall should begin within the next two months. \nTo see if your vehicle is included, enter your VIN into Nissan's recall website . Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
