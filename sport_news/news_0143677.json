Richardson is back this week and will play against the Redskins, and makes a ferocious defense even scarier . The Jets are second in total defense (280.2 yards per game) and first in scoring defense (13.8 points per game). Richardson gives coach Todd Bowles another piece to play with.\nMilliner has been on the short-term IR list since training camp with a wrist injury, and can return to practice next week and play in three weeks against the Jaguars. Milliner no longer will be asked to be a No. 1 or 2 corner. Instead, he’ll slot in as the team’s fourth or fifth corner. That gives the Jets tremendous depth at the position.\nRidley has been on the physically unable to perform list since training camp, as he recovers from knee surgery. He also can return to practice next week, and the team has 21 days to add him to the active roster after that. Ridley will give the Jets another big back to spell Chris Ivory and provide depth at a position where Ivory and Bilal Powell both have dealt with nagging soft-tissue injuries.\nThe reinforcements are coming.\n  Filed under dee milliner ,  new york jets ,  sheldon richardson ,  stevan ridley", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:03:54.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
