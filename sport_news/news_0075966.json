But it left the door open to his candidacy should the ban be lifted.\nThe committee, without mentioning Platini by name, said candidates for the top job who are suspended were not eligible to run. But its statement said that should a ban expire or be lifted before the election, such candidates could be reinstated by the “Ad Hoc Electoral Commission.”\nPlatini, the president of Europe’s governing body, was at one point considered the front-runner for the post. He was suspended for 90 days earlier this month amid a corruption investigation by the Swiss at the same time as the longtime president, Sepp Blatter. Both men have vigorously protested their innocence.\nFIFA also confirmed Tuesday that the election for a new president would take place Feb. 26, as scheduled.\n Related Coverage Times Topic: International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) Live and Kicking: Soccer Games to Watch This Week OCT. 19, 2015 Q&A: Alex Ferguson on Coaching, FIFA, Chelsea and U.S. Soccer OCT. 16, 2015 U.S. Sees FIFA as Victim and Its Leaders as Wrongdoers OCT. 9, 2015 The executive committee also endorsed several reform measures. The committee said it “welcomed” recommendations by a reform committee that include a term and age limit for the president. The changes will be considered by the full FIFA conference in February. The reforms also include more transparency for its ethics committee.\n“The tone in the meeting today was good,” said Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, of the executive committee’s meeting Tuesday. “We took some steps - small steps, maybe, but important steps in the right direction.”\nFIFA, which runs world soccer, has been embattled over ethical matters for years, culminating in the indictments in May of nine top soccer officials by the United States on corruption charges.\nIn June, Blatter, 79, said that he would step down after 17 years in office when a successor was elected. In September, Swiss investigators announced that they had opened criminal proceedings against him.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/sports/10fifa-1/10fifa-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/sports/18SIRALEXweb/18SIRALEXweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/20/sports/20SOCCERWATCH/20SOCCERWATCH-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:39:07.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
