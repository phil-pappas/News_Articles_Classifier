I’m not stiff. I’m not sore.” \nCollins said rookie left-hander Steven Matz, his Game 4 starter, will be available out of the bullpen this weekend. \nJacob deGrom, who won twice in the Division Series, is set to start Game 3. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:06:12.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
