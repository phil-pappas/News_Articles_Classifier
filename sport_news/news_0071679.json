From Sept. 1, the Angels won 20 of their final 31 games, pushing the very brink of the postseason. The Angels (85-77) were the final team to be eliminated.\nEleventh at a table for 10.\nThe Rangers won the American League West and the Houston Astros took the second wild-card, setting up a date with the New York Yankees. The Rangers will play the Toronto Blue Jays in one division series, while the Kansas City Royals await the wild-card winner.\nManager Mike Scioscia, who concluded his 16th season at the helm of the Angels, said several times in the last week that he had never been more proud of his players.\n“They played hard, they played long, and for us to even be talking about a playoff opportunity the last week of the season is (a testament to) everything they did in that room,” Scioscia said. “They were incredible. They left their hearts on the field, and it was an inspiring group. I was inspired by these guys. As bleak as it looked at some points in the last month, the bleaker it looked, the brighter they shined, and it was fun to watch.”\nThat was never demonstrated more vividly than Saturday, when the Angels rallied for five runs in the ninth inning to keep their season alive with an 11-10 victory over the Rangers.\nHowever, amid that exhilaration were the hints at what would bring them down in their final game.\nThe Angels had to use eight relievers to pitch five innings on Saturday, pushing to 271/3 innings their workload in the previous eight games. It had been that way for most of the past three weeks, with the Angels exhausting their bullpen to squeak out 11 one-run victories since Sept. 9, every one of them vital.\nSo when they needed one more, after Garrett Richards had given the Angels six innings on 99 pitches on three days rest, Scioscia had few no easy choices to try to manage a 3-2 deficit.\nWith the Rangers also having four dangerous left-handed hitters in the middle of their lineup, Scioscia had to weave through the order with a patchwork group of relievers, some overworked, some inexperienced.\nIt all exploded in one horrific, 37-minute seventh inning when the season went down the drain.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:37:44.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
