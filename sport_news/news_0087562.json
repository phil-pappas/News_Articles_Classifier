Jones received a chance to shove himself into the Celtics plans but failed to force his way past any of the other 15 players on guaranteed contracts. \nDespite elite size and athleticism for a wing, the 6-foot-11 forward has never found a niche in the NBA. In Oklahoma City last season, he flashed potential with three big games early but ultimately scored with below-average efficiency in just about every play type NBA.com tracks while offering little help as a rebounder or playmaker. On a crowder Celtics roster, the whispers of his potential were not enough to earn a spot. A cousin's death caused Jones to leave the team early in the preseason; when he was on the court, he rarely showed how he could fit into Brad Stevens' vision. \nAccording to the Boston Herald's Mark Murphy , the Celtics explored trade possibilities but decided to waive Jones on Saturday -- two days before the deadline -- to give him a better chance of latching on with another club. Boston is still on the hook for the 24-year-old's $2-million deal, but received cash when acquiring him this summer from the Oklahoma City Thunder. \nThe Boston Globe's Adam Himmelsbach added this: Source says Celts knew there wasn't a market for Perry Jones, but they liked him & probed other trades w/thought of keeping PJ. No deals tho â€” Adam Himmelsbach (@AdamHimmelsbach) October 24, 2015 \nThe Celtics could still be scanning trade options but don't need to make any more moves prior to the regular season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:59:07.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
