(Photo by David Simonis) \nBy SCOTT COTTOS STAFF WRITER \nNEW RIEGEL — One of the famous lines from the classic comedy “Animal House” the John Belushi character: “It’s not over until we decide it is!” \nSt. Wendelin decided in the second set of Tuesday night’s Division IV sectional semifinal that its match with New Riegel wasn’t over. \nThe Mohawks ended up losing that set to fall behind 2-0. But having rallied back from as many as 11 points behind to make it close, St. Wendelin in effect switched the momentum in its direction and never entirely gave it back while claiming a 21-25, 23-25, 25-11, 25-16, 15-11 victory. \nThe Mohawks, who went over the .500 mark for the first time this season at 12-11 with their second win of the season in three matches with their Sandusky River League rival, will travel to Cardinal Stritch (16-3) to play for a sectional title on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. St. Wendelin won a close match over the Cardinals during the regular season. \nStritch’s players attended Tuesday night’s match, and for most of the early going on, they likely weren’t counting on getting another crack at the Mohawks. In fact, St. Wendelin’s players weren’t feeling too good about things as they fell as far behind as 19-8 in the second set. \n“Sitting on the bench, we were all really nervous that we were going to be done,” Mohawks senior Victoria Walter said. “I think we just got so scared that we just lit a fire under our butts.” \nSt. Wendelin closed to within one point before the Blue Jackets (12-11) held on to win the set. \n“I said, ‘Girls, don’t hang your heads. … We battled back and lost within a couple of points. Use that momentum into Game 3,'” Mohawks coach Stacey Taylor said. \n“Obviously, in that second set we allowed St. Wendelin to get back into it and they really gained a lot of momentum at that point,” New Riegel coach Drew Cardwell said. “We just let off the pedal going forward and we couldn’t get out of it. \n“In those first two sets, I really felt we were the aggressor on our serve and on our swings. But we just stopped later on in that second set, and moving forward we just got real tentative.” \nSt. Wendelin went from a 4-4 tie in the third set to a 10-4 advantage in a surge that included three of Walter’s team-high 18 kills and a pair of Allie Rutter aces. The Mohawks built a 21-8 advantage before closing out the set. \nSt. Wendelin never trailed in the fourth set after going up 3-2 on a Rutter tip for a point. The teams were tied at 8 in the fifth set before a Blue Jackets serve went out of the bounds. \nThe Mohawks then got two kills and a stuff block from Hailee Burns while running off to a 14-9 lead, and the match ended on a Peighton Troike block. \n“We started to play together as a team,” Walter said of her team’s turnaround. “We started to play in sync more.” \nJust as Cardwell saw his team become less aggressive, Taylor saw growth in that area from her squad as the match progressed. \n“We stopped tipping the ball and we started actually hitting the ball,” Taylor said. “It’s very simple. And it’s effective when they do it.” \nBurns finished with 13 kills and 15 digs for St. Wendelin, while Rutter tallied nine kills, five aces, 20 assists and 11 digs, Maddie Borer handed out 14 assists and Sophia Volpe made 39 digs. \nBrianna Gillig notched 18 kills and 15 digs for New Riegel, which also got nine kills, two aces, seven assists and nine digs from Leah Bouillon, 24 assists from Lindsay Bouillon and 14 digs from Christen Hohman. \nST.
