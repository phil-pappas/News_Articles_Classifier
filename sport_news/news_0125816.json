Nugent's doink pushes Bengals to best start in 27 years The bounces are going the Cincinnati Bengals way so far in the 2015 season. By Connor Kiesel Oct 11, 2015 at 4:58p ET 0 \nThe bounces are going the Cincinnati Bengals way so far in the 2015 season. \nThat was taken to a very literal place Sunday. \nWith time dwindling in overtime, Mike Nugent tried a 42-yard field goal to push the Bengals past the defending NFC champion Seahawks -- and had the left goalpost on his side. \nIf you're looking for a scientific explanation, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson provided some insight. true Today's @Bengals winning OT field goal was likely enabled by a 1/3-in deflection to the right, caused by Earth’s Rotation. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 11, 2015 In the N. Hemisphere, Earth’s Coriolis force deflects airborne north-south projectiles to the right. About 1/2-in per 50 yds. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 11, 2015 The @Bengals stadium isn’t oriented exactly North-South. And the field goal was 42-yds. Yielding a 1/3-in deflection, not 1/2 — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 11, 2015 \nThe win sends the Bengals to their first 5-0 start since 1988, the last time they reached the Super Bowl. They try to reach 6-0 next Sunday in Buffalo against the Bills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:36:12.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
