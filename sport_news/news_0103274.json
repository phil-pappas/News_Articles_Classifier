Sponsored by FanDuel Chicago Bears at Kansas City Chiefs\nMust start: Matt Forte, Jamaal Charles, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring), Jeremy Maclin, Martellus Bennett, Travis Kelce, Chiefs DST\nWhen these two teams get together on Sunday, we’ll be watching two of the three most complete running backs (the other is Le’Veon Bell) in the league.
