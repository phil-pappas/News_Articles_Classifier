The 50-19 Boise State victory is fresh in the mind of coach Matt Wells and his players. \n\"We have a lot of respect for that program and staff,\" Wells said in a Monday press conference. \"What (Broncos coach) Bryan Harsin and his staff do schematically makes you rethink a lot of things you do, especially in the run game and protection-wise on offense.\" \nIn a matchup featuring the conference's two best defenses — Boise State is fifth nationally in total defense while Utah State ranks 18th — the casual observer could expect points to be at a minimum. But that hasn't been the case in either of the last two games, with the Aggies surrendering 34 points the last time the Broncos visited Logan prior to last year's lopsided loss. \nAccording to junior center Austin Stephens, much of the game will be decided at the line of scrimmage. \n\"It's all about the front seven on both sides of the football,\" he said Monday. \"We're going to have to stop the run and we're going to have to run the football. That's a challenge for us this week as a group and we're going to take that under our wing and put that on our shoulders.\" Boise State head coach Bryan Harsin talks with quarterback Brett Rypien and running back Jeremy McNichols during an NCAA college football game against Hawaii, Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015, in Boise, Idaho. (Kyle Green/Idaho Statesman via AP) \nLast year, Utah State simply didn't have an answer for Boise State running back Jay Ajayi, as he became the first opponent to rush for more than 200 yards against the Aggies since Oklahoma's Demarco Murray in 2010. Ajayi led the way, and the Broncos finished with 313 yards on ground. \nThe rushing attack helped Boise State keep the ball for 11 minutes more than Utah State possessed it. Jeremy McNichols spearheads the Broncos' running game this season with almost 500 yards through six games, but the Idaho Statesman reports that his status is uncertain for Friday after exiting last week's win over Colorado State with an apparent head injury. \nBehind McNichols on the depth chart is a trio of capable backs, albeit with much more limited experience than he. Kelsey Young, a transfer from Stanford, would likely get the bulk of the carries in McNichols' absence, and Devan Thomas and Cory Young could also get chances. Each of them is averaging at least 4.7 yards per carry. \nAnd while stopping the run game is crucial for the Aggies — requiring defenders to quickly shed the blocks of a talented Broncos offensive line — Wells and his staff aren't overlooking true freshman quarterback Brett Rypien's abilities. \n\"He can make all the throws,\" Wells said of Rypien Monday. \"He's got a good head, he's very accurate and he's got a great supporting cast around him with a veteran offensive line that has played a lot of football together, a deep running back group and talented wideouts out on the perimeter.\" \nUtah State will need to be more disciplined in its assignments than it was allowing Washington freshman quarterback Jake Browning to pass for 368 yards and three touchdowns. Related Harsin, Broncos wary of Utah State on quick turn-around The winner of Friday night's showdown of Boise State and Utah State will likely determine who wins the Mountain Division of the Mountain West Conference. The Aggies have struggled mightily against the Broncos in recent years. \nRypien has shown maturity in his decision-making and has only thrown one interception. He also still has the speedy Shane Williams-Rhodes to count on at wide receiver, who has 19 catches for 194 yards in two games against the Aggies. \nUtah State has already gone through a fair share of ups and downs this season, and in the midst of two consecutive wins some players have noticed the strides they've made since a five-game winning streak was halted at Boise State. \n\"We're a much more mature defense and we want to prove that,\" junior defensive end Ricky Ali'ifua said Monday. \"If we want to reach our goal of a Mountain West championship, we know the road goes through Boise. Every team in the nation knows Boise State is a good team and shouldn't be taken lightly. That's not what we're doing. We're taking them very seriously.\" \nThe game is scheduled for 7:05 p.m. MDT and can be seen on the CBS Sports Network. Kyle Spencer is a freelance journalist residing in Orem.
