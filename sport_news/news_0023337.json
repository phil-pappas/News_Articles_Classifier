Overnight, the culture and sports minister has become the prime minister’s most enthusiastic spokeswoman, outdoing even Ofir Akunis and Yuval Steinitz on their worst days. She drags her stand-up routine to every studio and website, quoting talking points drafted in some anonymous office that have one consistent message: Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party is responsible for the current wave of terrorism.\nHer claim is usually met by a loud burst of laughter, the kind that actresses Adi Ashkenazi and Orna Banai would be thrilled to get in theaters. But the scorn doesn’t deter Regev from driving home her idiotic message that’s hard to combat with arguments from the realm of logic or mental maturity.\nRegev’s argues that during the previous six years, Yisrael Beiteinu was responsible for public security at the Temple Mount, in East Jerusalem and in general. The public security minister during those years was the party’s Yitzhak Aharonovitch, a former police major general. But he showed “weakness” — Regev’s watchword.\nFormer Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch. Moti Milrod She repeated it at least seven times in an interview with news site Walla Hadashot. So here are a few facts she has chosen to ignore.\nFirst, throughout those six years, Netanyahu was prime minister. And during all those years, he boasted that on his watch there was no intifada and no terror.\nSecond, throughout those six years, we never saw anything like the current wave of terror. So maybe Aharonovitch and his policy of restraint weren’t so bad.\nThird, Aharonovitch was one of the ministers Netanyahu relied on and trusted most, and he never hid it. At every opportunity, the prime minister lavished praise on “Itzik.” He was Netanyahu’s point man for difficult assignments. When the Carmel forest fire broke out in 2010, it was Aharonovitch that Netanyahu tapped to head the ministerial task force to handle it.\nFourth, let’s forget logic, statesmanship and integrity for a moment, since these are qualities Regev has never had any dealings with from up close. What about a modicum of humanity and decency?\nWhat she’s been doing over the last few days is nothing less than character assassination and nonstop incitement against a decent, honest, judicious man who left political life about six months ago and hasn’t said a word in public. He doesn’t criticize people, doesn’t offer advice and doesn’t sit in the gallery and play the pundit as many former ministers and MKs do.\nIn the previous Knesset, when Regev headed the Knesset Interior and Environment Committee, she convened more meetings on the Temple Mount than any other issue. Only the Mount was at the front of her mind. If it were up to her, a region-wide religious conflict might already be at its height. The brakes to this obsession of hers were Aharonovitch and senior police officers.\nNow she’s taking revenge on him. And even more disturbing than Regev’s vile settling of accounts is the thought she was sent on this mission by the Prime Minister’s Bureau.\nYossi Verter\nHaaretz Contributor\n ", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:41:59.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
