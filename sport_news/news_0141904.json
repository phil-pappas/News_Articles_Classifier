Shaun Martin experienced this himself as a young man, and then he continued to witness it as a coach at Chinle High School, where he remains a teacher.\nFriday night, he told the story of how the 3-year-old race was born as part of a pre-race meeting that included an education of Navajo history and beliefs, especially those who made their home in Canyon de Chelly’s sacred valleys and cliffs.\nMartin told the crowd of about 160 runners and their families about an experience he had while running, a couple of years after he’d quit coaching at Chinle High School. During that run, he came around a corner and startled a group of wild horses.\nThe horses bolted from Martin, but they traveled the same direction he ran. Energized by their strength and beauty, he sprinted after them, pushing himself to try and keep up with them. There was a young horse, just a few months old, and when this little one started to slow with fatigue, the entire herd slowed, surrounding the yearling as they all continued running.\nThat allowed Martin to catch the herd, and as he approached the back of the pack, the mares protecting the young horse, parted and let Martin into the center of the still moving mass.\nAs he ran alongside the colt, in the center of the herd, he said he listened to the young horse’s labored breath, felt the drum of the sand under his feet and was energized by an experience that moved him to his core.\nAs he reflected on what happened, he decided he needed to find a way to do more for the Navajo youths, many of whom face lives fraught with hardships that most teenagers can’t even imagine.\n“I just came up with this idea,” Martin said the night before the Canyon de Chelly 55K in Chile, Arizona. “I need to share this. I need to create an event that celebrates our culture, the canyon, and our kids. And so the race was born.”\nSo many aspects of this event make it uniquely beautiful — from the reasons it was born to who benefits from it to the remote and breathtaking course to what the actual race offers.\nThe race’s purpose is to support Navajo youths who want to pursue running. With the proceeds from the race, Martin has purchased new uniforms for the junior high and high school cross-country and track athletes.\n“We’ve bought shoes for countless runners,” he said. They’ve paid for training gear for youth and high school runners, sent athletes to regional and national prep meets, and paid for college tuition and books for one runner.\n“We’ve done a lot with this race,” Martin said, choking back emotion. “It continues to give. ... This is all because of you here running in that canyon tomorrow.” To put what it means for the Navajo people to have an event that celebrates their culture as much as it celebrates athletic excellence, Martin told his father’s story.\nAt the age of 9, Allen Martin was loaded into a military Jeep and transported to a boarding school about 100 miles from his village near the north rim of the Grand Canyon. After his clothes were burned, his head shaved and he was disciplined with an electrified cattle prod, he ran away. It took him three days, but he eventually made his way home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:58:06.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
