Important stuff.\n“He told me what to expect, how to carry myself. On the court he just lets me do what I do out there,” Delon Wright said.\nA four-year American collegian, Wright does have a bit more basketball experience than the teens who are generally high first-round draft picks . It’s allowed him to stand out early in training camp and infuse Raptors coach Dwane Casey with enthusiasm.\n“He has seen it all and on top of that being the brother of an NBA player, he’s heard and seen it all,” Casey said. “He has been around NBA players so he’s not in shock and awe of other NBA guys. This is not overwhelming to him. His temperament is unbelievable\n“He is ahead of the game by being four years older and having Dorell as his brother and being around NBA players all this time.”\nThat savvy could allow the Raptors to accelerate Wright’s contribution. Toronto is already set with Kyle Lowry as the starting point guard and Cory Joseph as his backup, but Casey can see playing two of the three at the same time.\nA two-guard lineup of Lowry and Greivis Vasquez worked well two seasons ago for Toronto; playing two of Lowry, Vasquez and Lou Williams was a times an abject failure last year.\n“I thought it hurt us somewhat last year when we had two small guards in when you are going against six-six or six-seven guards” Casey said. “But with Cory’s size and Delon’s size I think that is a huge plus for us.\n“Kyle can go hide and rest on offence a little bit, if there is such a thing for him.”\nWright knows he’s got as much to learn on the court as he does off it but one thing the staff has been impressed with is his on-court instincts. The game’s still a bit fast for him and the competition is better and more consistent than anything he’s ever seen but he seems to just “get it.”\n“Delon is one of those guys that is not a drill guy . . . Once the lights come on or the official throws it up, he plays the game,” Casey said.\n“He does some uncanny things where you’re saying, ‘Whoa, what happened there?’ He’s always doing that. He has excellent hands defensively, but he’s still learning.”\nMore on thestar.com\nBetter late than never for AL East champion Blue Jays: Griffin\nBlue Jays clinch AL East title", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://www.theplayerstribune.com/dorell-wright-delon-wright-brothers-nba-rookie-letter/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:06:55.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
