This six-day trip to Europe to beat up on lesser opposition may serve more for marketing purposes than regular-season preparation, but it has made clear that what this squad lacks in superstar power, it has to make up for in team chemistry.\n“I think it comes from my teammates: Isaiah Thomas, David Lee, I could go down the list. All those guys that made the right play and help me to knock down shots,” said Bradley.\nThe team effort was clear to see on the scoreboard. Thomas chipped in with 15 points, while first-round pick Terry Rozier made his presence felt with 14 points in just 16 minutes.\n“That is the good thing about this team. Any given night you can have a different leading scorer, and that shows how deep and talented our team is and how well we play together,” added Bradley.\nEver attentive to the small details, C’s coach Brad Stevens preferred to concentrate on Bradley’s defensive duties as he didn’t gave former Utah State guard Jaycee Carroll a minute’s peace.\n“He is a quality player,” Stevens said of Bradley. “He impacts the game in lots of ways and the best thing he did tonight was make life tough on Jaycee Carroll.\n“(Carroll) made his shots, but at the end of the day, when that kid gets going you’re in trouble. And even when he got some open ones in the third quarter, he was uncomfortable because of how he had been guarded the whole night. That is a testament to Avery.”\nAfter a 124-91 demolition of Olimpia Milano on Tuesday, the test in the Spanish capital was an expected step up as Madrid kept the deficit to 11 points at halftime.\nBut impressive play from the Celts rookies off the bench eased the tourists to a comfortable win, which was cheered on by a huge number of green jerseys in the crowd.\nMuch of the support for the C’s is thanks to the visit of a Celtics team containing Larry Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale and Danny Ainge back in 1988 when, incredibly, the visitors from America also won by an identical scoreline of 111-96.\nA good omen for these Celtics? Stevens isn’t getting too carried away.\n“We made some technical errors but we played pretty hard for 96 minutes on this trip,” he said. “We can build off that. We can get better from the film, but if we have a hard mentality and show up every day with that energy, we will have the chance to be a good team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:07:45.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
