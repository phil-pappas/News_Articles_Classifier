I'm very, truly sorry, and we'll rectify that situation this year.\"\nCurry's response was part of an answer to questions about the Warriors being deserving of the title because they avoided the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Clippers in the NBA playoffs last season.\nWarriors forward Draymond Green also chimed in.\n\"If they saying that, they aren't the champs. It's simple. (Spurs coach) Gregg Popovich didn't say that. That's one organization I really respect. And you haven't heard anybody in their camp say that. You ain't heard anybody from OKC say that, some of the organizations that I really respect,\" Green said.\n\"You see the ring fitting man over there? Jason of Beverly Hills, he over there fitting us for our ring? That's pretty cool. So if they saying that, it's some bitterness and some saltiness going around. They obviously not the champs.
