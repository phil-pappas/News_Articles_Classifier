But, others say that couldn't be further from the truth. For instance, Kurt Arnold points to the explosion in 2013 and says it could have been avoided.\n\"The actual thing that caused the explosion was identified years in advance they just ignored it,\" says Arnold. \"It wasn't a case of negligence or something happens and it was unfortunate it was intentionally ignored and ultimately it caught up with them.\"\nOne worker caught in the blast is still in a Baton Rouge hospital, and the others are being treated at other locations.\nCopyright WAFB 2015.
