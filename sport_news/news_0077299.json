Now, the seemingly most popular choice for the job, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), hasn't officially jumped into the race.\nBut if you're worried about the future of the country, rest easy because Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) has a solution.\nTakano tweeted Thursday he has created a job posting for the position on Craigslist.\nIt seems like we’re having a hard time finding the next Speaker, so I created a Craigslist ad to boost our search. pic.twitter.com/JrYX5w9OVA\n— Mark Takano (@RepMarkTakano) October 8, 2015 The post has since been removed from the site.\nSpeaker of the House has no official qualifications under the Constitution, but every speaker to date has been a member of the House of Representatives. Takano is just fine with the next one being an outsider, provided they meet certain other criteria.\nTakano's ad asks for someone willing to keep the government open, maintain women's access to healthcare, an ability to work with irrational people and babysitting experience is \"STRONGLY PREFERRED.\"\nAdditionally, RINOs (Republicans in name only) are discouraged from applying.\nOh, and you also need to be proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoint.\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
