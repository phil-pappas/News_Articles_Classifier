He missed the first month of this season with a lower-body injury unrelated to the blood clots. \nDupuis was working his way back from an ACL tear when he scored six goals in 16 games in 2014-15 before he was forced to sit out the final five months of the season because of blood clots that threatened his career. He came back to score a goal in four preseason games this season before his lower-body injury. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
