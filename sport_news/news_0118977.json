(AP) â€” Supporters of Michigan and Michigan State are on guard duty to prevent possible vandalism to campus landmarks ahead of this weekend's football game between the schools.\nAt the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, students are guarding the block \"M'' on the Diag, the main pedestrian walkway through Central Campus. At Michigan State University in East Lansing, the \"Sparty\" statue is being kept under watchful eyes.\nMichigan sophomore Austin Fregene of Detroit tells The Detroit News (http://detne.ws/1MqjyT8 ) he's prepared to camp outdoors in the cold, saying the block \"M'' is \"something we hold near and dear to our hearts.\"\nThe landmarks sometimes are targeted by vandals ahead of big games, including the clash between the Wolverines and the Spartans.\nNo. 12 Michigan hosts No. 7 Michigan State on Saturday.\n___\nInformation from: The Detroit News, http://detnews.com/\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
