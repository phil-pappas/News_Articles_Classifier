The lawsuit is also seeking damages.\nMoltz said he purchased the guitar in June 2014 from someone who bought it from Sheldon Reynolds, ex-husband of Hendrix's adopted sister, Janie Hendrix.\nMcPherson says Reynolds, a former member of Earth, Wind, and Fire, stole it.\n\"The guitar is priceless to our family,\" Janie said in an email. She is the CEO of Experience Hendrix. \"It is one of the few guitars that came home after Jimi passed away. We just want our guitar returned safely and back where it belongs.\"\nTucson-based lawyer Todd Jackson is representing Moltz.\n\"My client purchased the guitar in good faith from a private seller, without knowledge of competing claims of ownership,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.jimihendrix.com/us/home", "http://bit.ly/1OuM1M5", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHdlSolwktU"], "published": "2015-10-12T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:19:40.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
