Several groups have since made requests to have their own monuments installed, including a satanic church in New York that wants to erect a 7-foot-tall statue that depicts Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, wings and a long beard. A Hindu leader in Nevada, an animal rights group and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster also have made requests.\nThe original monument was smashed into pieces last year when someone drove a car across the Capitol lawn and crashed into it. A 29-year-old man who was arrested the next day was admitted to a hospital for mental health treatment, and formal charges were never filed. A new monument was erected in January.\nSeveral supporters of the monument attended Tuesday's meeting and complained about the commission's actions. Former Republican state Rep. Mike Reynolds attempted to address the panel, but acting chairwoman Linda Edmondson declined to recognize him.\n\"This is an illegal meeting,\" Reynolds argued.\nReynolds maintained that the commission only has the authority to approve or disapprove plans and that its power does not extend to areas outside of the Capitol building.\nEstus said the monument will be removed by a court-ordered deadline of Oct. 12.\nThe Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in June that the monument's display violates a constitutional prohibition on the use of public property to support \"any sect, church, denomination or system of religion.\" A district court judge earlier this month ordered the monument to be removed within the next 30 days.\nRep. Mike Ritze, a Republican from Broken Arrow whose family paid about $10,000 for the monument's construction, did not immediately return a telephone message seeking comment on what he plans to do with the sculpture.\nA bill authorizing the monument was approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed into law by former Gov. Brad Henry, a Democrat, in 2009. A Norman minister sued to have it removed, arguing that it violates the Oklahoma Constitution. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt fought to keep the monument, maintaining that it serves a secular - not religious - purpose.\n___\nFollow Sean Murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:46:09.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
