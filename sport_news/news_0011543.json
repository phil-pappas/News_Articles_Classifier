(Photo by Jon Durr/Getty Images) The Chicago Cubs have advanced to the National League Championship Series thanks to a series-clinching win against the St. Louis Cardinals Tuesday, but their opponent in the upcoming series is still up in the air. Fans weighing which team they should root for in the Mets-Dodgers series might want to take one more thing into account – ticket prices. Cubs Hope Recent Trend Holds After Eliminating Cardinals It appears it would be cheaper to attend NLCS games in Los Angeles rather than in New York. In fact, it could save fans hundreds of dollars. According to prices listed Wednesday on TiqIQ, which compares secondary market ticket prices, the cheapest tickets to a Cubs-Mets game Saturday would be $306. Tickets to a Cubs-Dodgers game go as low as $106. It’s a similar pattern for Game 2, with Cubs-Mets tickets dipping to $266 and Dodgers-Cubs tickets as low as $100. Schwarber Home Run Ball to Stay on Top of Video Board The Chicago Tribune reports the average ticket price for a Cubs-Dodgers game in LA is $366.24, while the average cost for a Cubs-Mets game is $846.43. As for Games 3 and 4, which will take place at Wrigley Field, well, prices are higher than ever. Broker Steve Buzil of Sit Close Tickets said fans started calling for tickets almost immediately after the final strikeout Tuesday. As of Wednesday, Buzil said single tickets for next week’s home games are listed from $500-$2,500. “Mortgages are probably going in this now,” he said. “How often does it happen?” Barber Shaves Amazing Arrieta Portrait on Fan's Head On StubHub, tickets to Wrigley Field home games hovered around $500 as well. Buzil predicted a little patience could help fans, saying he expects those prices will drop, but not by much. “People have been waiting a long time for this, to bleed this Cubbie blue,” he said. “There’s a lot of people out there.” The Cubs estimate around one million people registered through the franchise for an opportunity to buy tickets. The window for fans to enter for the opportunity to buy tickets through the team ended Oct. 8, and now fans in the pool will be randomly selected. “On a first-come, first-serve basis they’ll be able to purchase any inventory that’s available,” said Cubs spokesperson Julian Green. If the Cubs move on to the World Series, however, things take a costly turn. Cubs World Series tickets at Wrigley Field this year would reportedly be the most expensive tickets for a series game in history . Although prices are not set, ticket-selling websites are estimating costs to be in the $2,000 to $3,000 range and above. Published 4 hours ago \nNews breaks at inconvenient times.
