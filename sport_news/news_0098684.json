Goalkeeper Kelly McMorrow wasn’t tested often but she rose to the occasion all five times when EF tried to strike. Defensively Jasmine Brouwer took the lead in helping to thwart each of EF’s offensive drives. \n“Jasmine has been good and reliable, to no surprise,” said Harvey Coach Greg Janos. “She has done an excellent job leading the younger players on the field.” \nHarvey’s offense continued to stay hot and maintain pressure all game long, outshooting EF 24-5 and creating multiple scoring opportunities. \nJoJo Greenwood and Charlotte Levy each had two goals while Sadie Albert came off the bench with a breakout performance, scoring a goal and earning the game’s hardest worker team award. \nAs Harvey continues to collect victories, the coach says he likes his team’s competitive edge \n“I’m proud that the girls are staying hungry and working as hard as they have been. We still have a few parts of our game that we need to fine tune, but overall we are definitely the team to try and beat,” said Coach Janos. \nThe Lady Cavs have an away game next Wednesday against Wooster and then play on the road again Friday at EF International. \nNo related posts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:49:41.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
