South Carolina was struggling and the gregarious and once innovative coach was a big reason why. Always one to do things his way, Spurrier believed he needed to step aside, and no one was going to change his mind. \nSpurrier resigned as the Gamecocks’ coach Tuesday, resisting pleas from the University of South Carolina president and athletic director to stay through the season — accepting the harsh reality that the team’s awful first half was on him. \n“You can’t keep a head coach as long as I have (coached) when it’s heading in the wrong direction,” Spurrier said. \nSpurrier, 70, considered leaving several times during his 11 seasons at South Carolina, most recently after last year’s 6-6 regular season. But a victory over Miami in the Independence Bowl re-energized him and gave him hope for better things ahead. \nThe Gamecocks, though, have struggled at 2-4 and are 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference, a first in Spurrier’s 23 seasons in the league. \n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards \n“I’m responsible. I’m the head coach,” Spurrier said. “It’s time for me to get out of the way and let somebody else have a go at it.” \nSpurrier said he felt he needed to step down now because he doesn’t believe there is accountability with players if they know the coach won’t be back next year. He also said he would be a recruiting liability. \nSpurrier said it was unlikely he would ever be a head coach in college again because of the recruiting aspect. \nSpurrier’s decision ends a 16-year run for South Carolina football, which was led by two of college football’s greats in Lou Holtz (1999-2004) and Spurrier. \nSpurrier had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons a coach at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) or South Carolina, where he has been since 2005. \n“I was the best coach for this job 11 years ago, but I’m not today,” he said. \nAthletic director Ray Tanner said he would form a search committee and hire a firm to help identify candidates going forward. Tanner said interim coach Shawn Elliott would be a candidate to earn the full-time job. \nFormer Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said he was always infatuated with Spurrier, not just because he changed football with his offensive innovation but because of his humor. \n“I always pictured him as the national champion at needling people,” Bowden said. \nSpurrier once referred to archrival Florida State as “Free Shoes University” following a 1993 scandal in which several FSU players went on a shopping spree at Foot Locker. \n“That never got to me because I thought they were funny and I thought they were clever and I knew him,” Bowden said. “He was good at it whether it was us or Tennessee or Georgia or whoever. That’s his nature. It was humorous to me.” \nSpurrier was in his 11th season at South Carolina, and although the Gamecocks are struggling, university officials praised the impact he has had on the football program. The winningest coach at Florida and South Carolina, Spurrier joins Bear Bryant as the only coaches to win the most games at two SEC schools. Spurrier has 135 SEC victories, second to Bryant’s 159.
