White found the end zone four times, helping the Bears down Sprayberry 42-17 in Region 7 (B) play Friday.“We got beat,” Sprayberry coach Billy Shackelford said. “They outplayed us. They outhustled us. I’m disappointed because we didn’t play our best game.”After the Jackets kicked a 32-yard field goal in the third quarter to pull within 12 points, White ran for a 75-yard touchdown to put the Bears up 28-9. Sprayberry quarterback London Roberson added a 1-yard diving touchdown and a two point conversion with 1:21 left in the third quarter. However, two late rushing scores, one coming in the form of a 42-yard run from White, sealed the game.Sprayberry starting quarterback Andrew Pereira sustained a lower leg injury late in the second quarter and was replaced by Roberson. The Jackets scored early with Dreshun Miller returning an interception for a 30-yard touchdown 2 minutes into the game. After a missed extra point, the Yellow Jackets had an early 6-0 lead. Sprayberry did not score again until the second half.“We had seven snaps for the first 22 minutes of the game,” Shackelford said. “It was hard to get some rhythm offensively because we weren’t on the field. Our defense has been our backbone; one of the key reasons for our success, and we just didn’t play very well.”Cambridge followed with a stalled drive deep in its own end zone. The Bears punted to the Jackets’ 29-yard line, but Sprayberry fumbled and the Bears recovered deep in Jackets territory. Taking advantage of the miscue, the Bears got on the board with a 12-yard touchdown pass from Cameron Moore to White and took a 7-6 lead.Late in the second quarter, Cambridge went on a 76-yard drive that culminated in a 2-yard Kaelin Byrd touchdown run for a 14-6 lead. With 2:20 to go before half, Sprayberry punted from its own 5-yard line and watched White return the kick for a 45-yard touchdown, extending the Cambridge lead to 21-6.“They played lower than us, they played faster than us, they played more physical than us,” Shackelford said. “There’s no secret play they ran or anything like that, they just outplayed us.”Roberson finished 5 of 10 for 41 yards passing with 78 yards rushing. Nygel Green led the Yellow Jackets in rushing with nine carries for 46 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:27:14.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
