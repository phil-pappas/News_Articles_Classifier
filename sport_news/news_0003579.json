It was a major let off for Middlesbrough but they could not survive a second time as Wolves broke the deadlock with a classy goal.Kevin McDonald's pass picked out left-back Scott Golbourne and when his centre flew across the face of the Middlesbrough goal, Edwards was on hand to stoop low eight yards out and steer his header beyond goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos.Wolves continued to carry the greater threat into the second period and would quickly have put the result beyond doubt but for some frantic last ditch Middlesbrough defending.Twice in the space of four minutes, Benik Afobe was denied, first by a challenge from George Friend and then on the hour by a perfectly timed block by Daniel Ayala.Wolves should really have increased their lead in the 66th minute but for Konstantopoulos. He somehow managed to beat away James Henry's close range drive and that proved to be a turning point as it galvanised Middlesbrough.They were level five minutes later.Wolves paid the price for giving Fabbrini too much time and space 20 yards from goal and he accepted the invitation to shoot - beating Martinez with a low drive at his near post. That changed the entire complexion of the game and Middlesbrough were a different proposition after finding the way to goal.Albert Adomah was twice denied by Martinez before referee Darren Drysdale, who had replaced James Linington at half-time, pointed to the spot after Byrne had brought down Friend. Leadbitter made no mistake with his low drive before Downing sealed the win with a stunning 20-yard free-kick.
