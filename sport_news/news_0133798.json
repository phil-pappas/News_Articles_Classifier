He destroys teams after a loss (I know that Alabama played ULM in between their Ole Miss loss and their UGA beat-down, but I think the question still stands). This made me wonder if that thought was actually based on anything. So I spent more time than I should have running some numbers*. Since Saban has been at Alabama he is 9-6 after a loss (60%) and 2-3 against ranked teams after a loss (40%). That isn't as comforting as I hoped it would be. So removing his first year at Alabama (by far his worst) he is 7-2 after a loss (77.8%) and 2-2 against ranked teams after losses (50%). A little better but still not fitting in to the \"you really don't want to play Saban when he is mad\" narrative. If you combine in his years at LSU to these numbers (to get a larger sample size) Saban is 20-9 after a loss (68.97%) and 5-5 (50%) against ranked opponents. Ehh. Not too cheered up. \nLet's flip it. What can we look forward to from Mark Richt against Tennessee? Well, since Richt started at UGA he is 32-11 after a loss (74.41%) and 7-5 (58.33%) against ranked teams. I would call those numbers pretty comparable to Saban's. Except for the fact that Richt has played 43 games after losses to Saban's 29. Richt has lost a few more ballgames. \nThere lies the real difference. It isn't about what you do the game after a loss it is not losing in the first place. Losing streaks are more rare than winning streaks (among decent programs) and so your record after a loss really doesn't mean much. Especially if you assume that most of the games you lose are to tough opponents and your next game then is probably against a weaker one. At the end of the day, that loss to Bama sucks. But that's the breaks. Just beat Tennessee. \n*These numbers include bowl games. Of course a loss in a bowl game is the last game of the season so there is \"next game\" to evaluate. This also means that bowl wins or losses after the last regular season game are included though which may or may not be fair.
