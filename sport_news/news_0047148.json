The veteran second baseman set a playoff record in Wednesday’s decisive Game 4 of the National League Championship Series by homering in his sixth straight game , breaking the record of five straight set by Carlos Beltran in 2004.\nThat homer, a two-run shot in the eighth inning, was also Murphy’s seventh of this postseason, one shy of the all-time record held by Barry Bonds (2002), Beltran ('04) and Nelson Cruz ('11). Murphy will get a chance to tie that record and extend his streak in the World Series starting Tuesday night, but with his team inactive for the next five days, it’s worth wondering if he is in the midst of one of the best postseason performances of all time.\n• MORE MLB: Full postseason schedule, start times, TV listings\nIn nine playoff games, Murphy has hit .421/.436/1.026 (1.462 OPS) in 39 plate appearances with seven home runs, 11 RBIs, 11 runs scored and just six strikeouts. Those rate stats will come down if he cools off in the World Series after the long layoff, but for now, let’s see how many players in postseason history posted a higher OPS in 39 or more plate appearances.\nplayer year pa ops Barry Bonds 2002 74 1.559 Carlos Beltran 2004 56 1.557 Rickey Henderson 1989 44 1.509 That’s it: three guys. Bonds and Henderson are all-time greats who were near their respective peaks, and Beltran is a potential Hall of Famer with a reputation as one of the greatest October hitters of all time. Unsurprisingly, two of the men Murphy is chasing for the single-postseason home run record are there; Cruz (.959 OPS in 70 PA in 2011) is not, in part because he went 1-for-15 in the Division Series that year.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nThose aren’t the only three postseason lines we can compare to Murphy’s, of course. The most notable performance that just missed the cutoff above was Manny Ramirez’s 2008 showing, in which he posted a 1.747 OPS in 36 PA for a Dodgers team that lost to the eventual World Series champion Phillies in the NLCS.\nMLB Video Lucas Duda’s bat awakens as Mets, Daniel Murphy finish off Cubs in NLCS by Ben Reiter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:39:35.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
