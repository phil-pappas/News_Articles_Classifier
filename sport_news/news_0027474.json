A Queens judge has rejected Bob Oliva ’s motion to dismiss the $20 million lawsuit filed by a man who was sexually abused by the former Christ the King Regional High School basketball coach.\nThe decision by Queens Supreme Court Judge Roger N. Rosengarten means the case will go to trial later this year unless Oliva’s attorney, Henry Weil , files an appeal or a settlement is reached with the plaintiff, Jimmy Carlino .\n“The trial will continue to expose Bob Oliva for the sexual predator that he is,” Carlino’s attorney, Mitchell Garabedian , told the Daily News.\nOliva admitted in a Boston courtroom last year that he had sexually abused Carlino during a trip to Massachusetts in 1976, when Carlino was 14. Oliva was sentenced to probation for five years and required to register as a sex offender.\nWeil had argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed because it was barred by the statute of limitations and Oliva had not been charged or convicted of abusing Carlino in New York.\nRosengarten wrote in his decision that under New York law, the clock on the statute of limitations is reset after a defendant is convicted of a crime — and that it doesn’t matter where the crime occurred or where the defendant was charged.\nRosengarten’s decision was dated Feb. 3, but it wasn’t filed with the court until Friday and was not available until Tuesday. Weil said he has not decided if will appeal the judge’s decision and declined further comment.\nThe lawsuit, filed on April 1, 2011, three days before Oliva pleaded guilty to two sex-abuse charges, says the disgraced former coach abused Carlino more than 100 times between 1974 and 1978. Most of the incidents took place in New York, the suit says, but Oliva also molested Carlino during out-of-state trips.\nAnother man told the Boston grand jury that indicted Oliva that the legendary coach had sexually abused him.\nFormer Mets and Yankees pitcher Allen Watson told the Daily News that Oliva showed him pornography, masturbated in front of him and took him to prostitutes when he was a teenager.\nOliva, once one of the most influential men in New York City basketball, won 549 games and four championships during his 27 years at the Catholic high school. Scores of his players, including the NBA’s Lamar Odom and Jayson Williams , later played for top Division I programs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:52:14.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
