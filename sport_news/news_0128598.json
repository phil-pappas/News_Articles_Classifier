Mike George/The Sun Chronicle via AP Jay Hewitt is definitely in the running for World’s Best Grandpa. The 59-year-old from Attleboro has put in about nine months of work over the past two years to build his two grandchildren a 40-foot-tall, tri-level treehouse in Attleboro.\nHewitt isn’t new to building — he’s a licensed contractor and building inspector, as well as a member of the Attleboro Planning Board — and he isn’t new to the delight that treehouses bring kids. But this was his first attempt at building such a “castle in the sky,” he said.\n“When I was a kid, I thought that was the coolest thing, to have a treehouse. It was my house,” Hewitt said. “When my kids were growing up, I built treehouses for them almost the size of a shed, but [they weren’t] that big, not like this one.”\nThe fully enclosed and shingled structure features a room for family gatherings, a loft for sleepovers and a built-in spiral slide. Mike George/The Sun Chronicle via AP This treehouse is truly one of childhood dreams: It features a common room, a loft bedroom for sleepovers, a built-in spiral slide, and a deck.\nHewitt decided to expand his skills into the sky after he started following Pete Nelson of Treehouse Masters . He sat down with his local building inspector, but because the treehouse doesn’t have a footprint greater than 110 square feet, it doesn’t require a building permit. Still, he built it to code just in case.\nHewitt’s grandkids — 6-year-old grandson and a 4-year-old granddaughter — love the treehouse, he said, though by this point they’re kind of used to it.\n“It’s not new or exciting to them, though they’re gonna be helping me from this point forward,” Hewitt said. “I did that with my kids — they always helped me.”\nJay Hewitt sits in the treehouse he built for his grandchildren in his backyard in Attleboro. Mike George/The Sun Chronicle via AP Hewitt and his wife are planning to put their home, along with the treehouse, up for sale soon because they really want a lakefront property. But if there aren’t any takers, he plans to expand the treehouse by adding a fourth-floor deck and a rope bridge that reaches to another tree that sits 30 feet away.\nAnd if his house does sell, don’t worry: Wherever Hewitt moves next, he plans to keep building.\n“One of the requirements of a new house on a lake is big trees in the backyard so I can build a treehouse,” he said. “So my grandkids won’t be disappointed.”\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Mass. travel 10 Things you didn’t know about the New England Aquarium 10.13.15 | 10:45 AM Life This Attleboro grandpa built a three-story treehouse and it’s what dreams are made of 10.13.15 | 10:34 AM Relationships My parents hate him 10.13.15 | 8:21 AM Moms When teens drink at home, do they develop alcohol problems later on? 10.13.15 | 7:29 AM Conn. travel Roseland Cottage hosts arts and crafts fest 10.13.15 | 6:41 AM Vermont travel Drone footage captures Vermont fall foliage in all its glory 10.12.15 | 6:00 PM Vermont Photo: Vermont State Police K-9 dispatcher? 10.12.15 | 3:12 PM Relationships It’s time for self-help, 2015 10.12.15 | 9:04 AM Fashion UNIQLO just opened its first Boston store 10.11.15 | 2:59 PM Restaurants Four fall comfort food recipes from Inman Square chefs 10.10.15 | 1:52 PM Restaurants Talking wine with Mark Tosi 10.09.15 | 12:23 PM Restaurants Starting the morning with Jugos 10.09.15 | 12:23 PM Relationships I want to downsize 10.09.15 | 12:23 PM Relationships Sick of people telling me I’ll change my mind about marriage and children 10.09.15 | 12:23 PM Relationships He lied and cheated.
