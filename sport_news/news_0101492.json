The operation was performed Friday at St. Mary's Hospital in Athens. Ron Courson, the school's senior associate athletic director for sports medicine, says the procedure \"went extremely well.\" Chubb, one of the nation's top players, tore the posterior cruciate and other knee ligaments on the first play from scrimmage in Georgia's loss to Tennessee two weeks ago. Georgia has not given a timetable for Chubb's' recovery, but coach Mark Richt says he's \"optimistic\" the sophomore will be able to return next season.
