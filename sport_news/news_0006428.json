With a handful of forwards already unavailable, they would prefer not to test their organizational depth at another position. \nMartin, who had averaged close to 23 minutes of ice time in the first four games, sat out Saturday's 6-3 loss to the New York Islanders. Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said after the loss that Martin was hurt in Friday's win over New Jersey and that the team will \"see how it looks going forward.\" Martin's status for Monday's game against the New York Rangers is uncertain.

You see what he has added to our team so far. You don't really replace guys like that.\" \nBut even if Martin returns Monday, the Sharks are still hurting. \nForwards Logan Couture, Raffi Torres, and Melker Karlsson all are out for one reason or another, two of them for an extended period. Couture has a fractured right fibula and won't be back for at least another month. Torres is suspended until mid-January. Karlsson, who is in San Jose with the AHL Barracuda, can't help because he has a nagging lower body injury.

Smith's status for the Rangers' game is also uncertain. \nThe schedule doesn't let up much, either. Once they return from this seven-day, four-game Eastern swing, the Sharks play the rival Los Angeles Kings, a Carolina Hurricanes team they've beaten just once in five seasons, and the Nashville Predators, who are off to a 4-1 start. \nIt's possible that DeBoer merely was resting Martin on Saturday. Martin, 34, played more than 30 minutes Friday night against New Jersey, as did his defense partner, Brent Burns. They didn't realize it until after the game, Martin said. \n\"It wasn't as hard of a 30 minutes as you might think,\" Martin said before Saturday's game. \"Usually when you play that much, you're pretty fatigued. Killing penalties had a lot to do with it. We weren't always skating up and down the ice.\" \nIn that game, Martin played just over 24 minutes at even-strength, 4:29 on the penalty kill and was on the first power-play unit for the one time the Sharks had the man advantage. With Couture out, San Jose's first power-play unit included Martin and Burns, plus Pavelski, Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau. \nBut Martin's absence was felt throughout the defensive corps Saturday night, as the Sharks allowed five even-strength goals after giving up just one in their first four games. \nBurns was partnered with Brenden Dillon, and they were on the ice for three of the Islanders' even-strength goals. \n\"He's so effective,\" Sharks goalie Alex Stalock said of Martin. \"It was time for a guy to step in and get a chance, and that was good. Take a little break for Paulie and get better.\" For more on the Sharks, see the Working the Corners blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks .
