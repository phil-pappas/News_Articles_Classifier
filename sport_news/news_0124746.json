BYU brought plenty of it last month against the Bruins, and Rosen threw three first-half interceptions.\nThrough four games, the young signal caller has completed just 44 percent of his passes while under pressure, according to Pro Football Focus, compared to 70 percent when he isn’t hurried.\nThe Sun Devils, who meet the Bruins on Saturday night at the Rose Bowl, blitz more than any team in the country, doing so 66 percent of the time on dropbacks, per ESPN Stats & Info. They led the nation in this category last season, as well, as it has remained a hallmark for any Graham-coached team.\n“He’s always done that,” UCLA offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone said. “They’re a very aggressive, attacking defense.”\nThough Arizona State has struggled to find its footing, it has had success getting to quarterbacks. Its nine sacks are third most in the Pac-12.\n“They move around,” senior center Jake Brendel said. “They bring a lot of heat, a lot of stuff we really don’t see from a lot of teams as consistently as them.”\nThough Rosen faced pressure from BYU and Virginia, Brendel and the Bruins’ offensive line have kept him upright. He has been sacked just twice, both in the third quarter of last week’s win at Arizona.\n“With a freshman quarterback, we see pressure every week,” UCLA coach Jim Mora said.\nExperience facing a formidable rush is something the seventh-ranked Bruins (4-0 overall, 1-0 Pac-12) plan to lean on against Arizona State (2-2, 0-1).\n“That’s what’s important about playing teams that come after you and give you varied looks, especially early in the season,” Mora said. “When you do get it figured out, then you’ve got that in your memory bank and you can draw from it.”\nSPECIAL WORK\nOne of the more unheralded reasons for UCLA’s undefeated start remains its consistent work on special teams, particularly kickoff coverage.\nSenior kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn has booted 23 touchbacks, fourth most in the country, and a touchback percentage of 79 percent, third most.\n“I like it when it’s not a touchback, too,” Mora said.\n1 2 Next Page Related: No. 7 UCLA vs. Arizona State: Who has the edge?
