Orsillo wasn't offered a new contract by NESN. « 1 » \nSAN DIEGO &GT;&GT; Don Orsillo has landed with the San Diego Padres after being ousted as the Boston Red Sox's television play-by-play voice. \nThe Padres said Thursday that Orsillo has signed a long-term deal and will become the primary television play-by-play broadcaster on FOX Sports San Diego when Dick Enberg retires after next season. Next year, Orsillo will do select games on television and radio. \nIn Boston, Orsillo wasn't offered a new contract with NESN and is being replaced by Dave O'Brien. Orsillo first broadcast Red Sox games on NESN in 2001 and became the full-time play-by-play man in 2005 when the network acquired rights to all local telecasts. \nOrsillo's first job in professional baseball was as a play-by-play broadcaster for the Pittsfield Mets of the New York-Penn League. Orsillo spent the 1991 and 1992 seasons in Wahconah Park. He helped broadcast road games and was the public address announcer for home games. \nAfter leaving Pittsfield, he spent several seasons working for the Mets' Class AA Eastern League team in Binghamton. While he did that, Orsillo was also the voice of the American Hockey League's Springfield Indians.
