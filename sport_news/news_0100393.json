(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Willard may have limited Paige Perry, but Ozark had a trump card in Macey Putt. The sophomore middle hitter came up with 14 kills and three blocks as Ozark recovered from a first-set loss to defeat Willard 22-25, 25-14, 25-16 in Saturday night’s Class 4 volleyball quarterfinal.“It was huge that Macey Putt got involved in the offense, and man, did she go off,” said Ozark coach Adeana Brewer. “We’ve gotta have that offense (at state) next weekend from her. That’s probably her best game of the season. She was huge.\" Putt’s performance helped send Ozark to the state volleyball final four for the seventh consecutive season. With much of Willard’s defensive attention focused on the Missouri State commit Perry, Putt became Ozark’s next-best offensive option as the match progressed.“(Setter) Kendra (Sater) did a really good job of spreading our 5-1, drawing her arms up and holding the block for our middles to be 1-on-1,” Brewer said. “They have to prepare for Kendra to attack and usually that leaves our middle open. And then, Putt executed.” PHOTOS: OZARK VS. WILLARD Said Putt: “It was fun. (Sater) was setting me and then we were all covering. It was creating a lot of energy. I didn’t expect (14 kills), I thought we would both be up there going as hard as we could. Things just sort of came my way.” Ozark needed a boost after dropping the first set of the match against a Willard team that was fired up to play on its home court. It was Willard’s first state quarterfinal appearance since 2004 and the first as a Class 4 team.“This team, we all felt extremely confident coming in,” said Willard coach Jamalee Hancock. “We felt like we knew what Ozark had, I felt like we matched up well. Our kids have a lot of heart. It’s hard to beat a team with as much tradition and success as (Ozark) has had lately. It was tough going into that third set. If you get down two or three points with them, it’s hard to make that up because they don’t make strings of errors. They’re a great team.“Going to a third set, you get that close, it stings a little bit more.” Ozark, forced to change up its attack, led 10-2 then 20-10 in the second set. In the third set, a Kara Finkbiner kill brought Willard within 15-12 of Ozark, but Ozark would push its margin to 19-16, then score the final six points of the set. Ozark, which has six seniors that see regular playing time, also got big contributions from the junior duo of Ryley Thixton and Kaylan Smith.“The good thing is, we have depth,” Brewer said. “(Junior MH) Kaylan Smith, (sophomore MH) Macey Putt, (junior OH) Ryley Thixton all had big games tonight. I have to decide every game who I’m going to play. That’s obviously a blessing to have as a coach.” Finkbiner had 10 kills and Kaitlyn Williams eight kills for Willard (31-5-1 overall). SEMIFINAL PHOTOS: OZARK VS. REPUBLIC “We got back to 16-14 in the third set, and there were a couple of points that if they had just gone our way…,” Hancock said. “The girls wanted it, they were not scared. But when that gap got there, it was tough to come back.” Ozark, which also dropped the first set of Wednesday’s 2-1 district final win over Nixa, heads to Cape Girardeau next weekend. Ozark faces Lafayette-Wildwood, St. Joseph’s Academy and St. Teresa’s Academy in pool play Friday. Ozark seeks its first state championship since 2009.\"The past couple of weeks, when we were getting into the postseason, Coach Brewer kept telling us, 'Don't play in the fear of losing what you once had, play because you want it back,'\" said Ozark senior Delaney Reese. \"That's kind of just resonated with all of us. We knew we have a long tradition behind us and that we needed to pick it up. We were more than capable of continuing it, we just needed to have that mindset of working for us, not the tradition.\" Filed Under :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:36:15.137+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
