Paire beat Marcos Baghdatis 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. \nBoth Nishikori and Wawrinka had the day off after booking their places in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:11:59.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
