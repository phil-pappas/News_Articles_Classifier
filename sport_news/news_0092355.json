Pellegrino was one of 20 members of Team Stars and Stripes, which faced Team Maple Leafs (Canada) and Team Iroquois Nation.Team Stars and Stripes fell to Team Maple Leafs 10-9 due to a goal in the closing seconds but were ahead of Team Iroquois Nation 4-0 before a fight caused the game to be stopped.“Those games taught me that in college that is what the competition will be like,” said Pellegrino, who started both games and had an assist against Team Maple Leafs. “Also that I need to get bigger and play all around better lacrosse.”Pellegrino spent plenty of time on the field as an attacker or midfielder. He went to a tryout last summer and became one of three players from Georgia to make the team.Pellegrino is also a member of C2C Georgia. He plans to attend at college prospect camp in Dallas (TX) next week and another in Maryland next month.“Traveling for lacrosse is very good because I can get lots of exposure and I can learn from other players because they also have a high level of talent,” Pellegrino said.Last season for the Wolfpack, Pellegrino was second on the team in goals (42), assists (37) and points (79). Kyle Banks led the team in goals with 67 and Matthew Rodgers had a team-high 40 assists.“I like the fast pace of the game,” said Pellegrino, who has been playing lacrosse since the fourth grade.North Paulding earned a 12-6 overall record, including a 6-2 mark in Area 1- , and advanced to the first round of the playoffs.
