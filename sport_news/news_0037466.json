By KRISTIE RIEKENAP Sports Writer \nHOUSTON (AP) - Andre Johnson had two touchdown catches against his former team to help the Indianapolis Colts beat the Houston Texans 27-20 on Thursday night. \nJohnson, who spent his first 12 NFL seasons in Houston before he was released in March, pushed the lead to 27-17 with a 2-yard touchdown reception from Matt Hasselbeck in the fourth quarter. Johnson finished with six catches for 77 yards. \nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left. \nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100 percent either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
