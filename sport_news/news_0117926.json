When they were announced to the crowd, to the tune of “Meet the Mets,” all wearing white home jerseys, they received a standing ovation that was soon followed by thunderous “Let’s Go Mets” chants.\nEvery mention of the Mets drew booming responses. Even Public Enemy, the show’s musical guest, led the crowd in a “Let’s Go Mets” chant to end the show.\n“What a great year to be a Mets fan. Who the hell expected this to happen?” Kimmel joked when the Mets joined him on the stage.\n“Ya gotta believe,” Wright responded, and said the Mets gathered during spring training to discuss the goal of reaching the postseason.\nKimmel, a lifelong Mets fan who was born in Brooklyn, joked during his monologue about the exorbitant prices of World Series tickets at Citi Field where the Amazin’s will play the Royals.\n\n“The only people who can afford to go to a Mets game are Derek Jeter and A-Rod right now,” he said.\nKimmel made sure to talk to Harvey about getting revenge against Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley for his late and dirty slide in the National League Division Series that broke Ruben Tejada’s left leg, ending his season.\n“Someone still has to penalize him for this,” Kimmel told Harvey.\n“I think it’s already happened once,” Harvey said, referring to when he hit Utley with a pitch during the regular season, and perhaps hinting that it would happen when the Mets face Utley next year. Kimmel wants it to happen sooner.\n“Maybe we can all do this in the offseason, wait for him to come out of his house and nail him with one,” Kimmel said, to a rousing response from the crowd.\nKimmel asked the Mets if he would get a World Series ring for throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series. They all feigned ignorance of his pitch.\n“I have an idea that’s what spurned you on to victory, but I guess not,” Kimmel said, and then turned to deGrom. “I know you felt the heat from that pitch.”\nKimmel did have one problem with the Mets. He doesn’t feel their champagne celebrations have been over-the-top enough. He wants them to destroy their clubhouse after winning the World Series — yes, the comedian guaranteed victory over the American League champion Royals — do away with the goggles and the plastic wrap covering the lockers.\n“I want that locker room to be unfit for human life when you guys are done with it,” he said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under david wright ,  jacob degrom ,  jimmy kimmel live ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:25:34.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
