He was trained by Nathan Chapman of Prokick Australia and spent a successful season at Weber State last year before switching to Michigan as a graduate transfer.\nO'Neill's mishap at the Big House on Saturday provoked an angry reaction from some Wolverines fans that included death threats .\nMichigan interim AD Jim Hackett's open letter to UM community pic.twitter.com/vEMvS8a5Jd\n— angelique (@chengelis) October 18, 2015 “It is not nice for young blokes to have unpleasant things said about them on the Internet,” Chapman told USA TODAY Sports by telephone. “But all he is going to care about is that he wants to go out there and do the best for his team. Saturday was a rough day for him on a big occasion, but he’s got to take it on the chin and come back stronger.”\nO’Neill, 22, is part of a growing trend toward Australian kickers and punters in college football, thanks in large part to the specific skills they have acquired playing Australia’s national game.\nIn Australian Rules football, where players do not wear padding or helmets, O’Neill suffered a split liver several years ago. He has also worked as a male model and is now pursuing a masters degree in sports management.\nIn the first quarter of Michigan’s 27-23 defeat to their in-state rival, O’Neill boomed a spectacular 80-yard punt that landed inside the Michigan State 1-yard line.\nHowever, the play that will go down in the folklore of the rivalry was the last one of the night.\nO’Neill fumbled the snap and after he picked up the ball and tried to still get a kick off, it flew into the hands of the Spartans’ Jalen Watts-Jackson, who ran it back for the game-winning touchdown.\nFOR THE WIN\nDespicable fans tweet death threats at Michigan punter after disastrous play\n“It is a rough day and when something like that happens in a big game you are going to cop a lot of heat,” Chapman added. “But Michigan fans should embrace him instead of trying to drag him down.\n“He is a tough kid and in this game you need to have a thick skin. I’ve reached out to him with a bit on tongue in cheek by text and we will be here for him if he needs picking up.\n“But he’s worked as hard as anyone to get here and he’ll be looking forward for the next game to come around quickly and move on.\"\nFOR THE WIN\nMichigan punter boots 80-yard punt against the Spartans", "external_links": ["http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/despicable-fans-tweet-death-threats-at-michigan-punter-after-disastrous-play", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df8d0a1c3353d8f96bbcc9e3e8d57c1eeda7709/r=300/https/i0.wp.com/usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ap_michigan_st_michigan_football_76809606.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "https://twitter.com/chengelis/status/655788117220315136", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/michigan-80-yard-punt-michigan-state", "http://t.co/vEMvS8a5Jd", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dqv48MwEbaQ?feature=oembed", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffba58a203d559e0587373be9adfa5c30bd390ba/r=300/https/usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-17-at-3-52-48-pm.jpg?w=1200"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:29:34.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
