Five losses later, several of the painful variety, and Mr. Aitch had closed the weekend at 7-8 (2-1 in BBs).\nAs a result, the following culprits will be subjected to a HondoNation shame walk: Russell Wilson, who had two costly fumbles, Peyton Manning, who threw two killer picks, and the immortal Zach Hocker, who spit the bit and clanged from point-blank range what would have been a game-winning field goal for the Saints and, more importantly, a cover for Mr. Aitch and the Cowboys.\nGiants over 49ers: The Niners have more problems than their 1-3 record. First-year head coach Jim Tomsula found himself in the middle of a full-fledged fart furor after he seemingly tooted his horn at a recent press conference. Oh, sure, he denied, but, according to basic flatulent theory, that means he supplied. It’s obvious the team and coach stink, so feel free let a wager rip on the Giants.\nJaguars over Buccaneers: In his time with the Knicks, Derek Fisher has proven that, whether on the court or off, if you’re going to partake in “the triangle,” you’re going to get beaten.\nBills over Titans: Rex Ryan turned on the bluster after his undisciplined, penalty-riddled Bills were flagged 17 times penalties in their embarrassing loss to the Giants. Said Rex: “I’ll take a team that will fight over a team that won’t.” Apparently, judging by the Bills complaints about Odell Beckham’s rough tactics, he also likes a team that whines.\nBrowns over Ravens: Al Jazeera America’s employees have voted to unionize by a margin of 32-5. What’s interesting there is that, according to the ratings, it’s the only network that has more employees than viewers.\nFalcons over Redskins: From emailer BarkingMut, aka HondoNation SoBe Bureau Chief: Inspired by the newly released Ted Kennedy oral history project, Bill Clinton says he is raising money for a new wing to his library devoted to the oral history of his administration.\nBears over Chiefs: Emailers “Boom” and former colleague Frank Drucker both suggested another show that should be added to Dick Wolf’s “Chicago” franchise, which already includes Chicago PD, Chicago Fire and Chicago Med (and possibly “Chicago Sanitation”). This one would be called “Chicago Community Organizer.” It will be about a local community organizer who keeps failing upward until he reaches the highest office in the land and proves to be totally overmatched.\nSaints over Eagles: Hillary Clinton said this week she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement, contradicting the position she took in her most recent book, “Hard Choices.” She will explain the flip-flop in her next book: “Saying And Doing Whatever The Hell It Takes To Get Elected.”\nPackers over Rams: Have to go with the Packers on “JD’S 13TH Annual Football Sunday,” which honors the memory of 9/11 victim Joey Doyle by funding scholarships for St. Joseph by the Sea High School students. A passionate Packers fan, Joey, who had been a pitcher for Wagner College, was an employee of Cantor Fitzgerald. The Z-Two Lounge on Staten Island again is the site of the bash, which kicks off at noon and doesn’t reach the end zone until 8 p.m. If you’re scoring at home, that’s eight hours of non-stop football and fun, with revelers having the opportunity to participate in raffles and auctions throughout. You definitely want to Z-Two it you don’t miss this year’s gathering for a great cause.\nBengals over Seahawks: It seems that in addition to abstaining from sex, Russell Wilson also is abstaining from holding onto the football.\nCardinals over Lions: If Roger Goodell is so concerned about “the integrity of the game” as he again professed to be at the NFL meeting in New York, he might want to make sure his officials at least know the rules. That way, minor details like the outcomes of games won’t be affected as happened Monday night when the Lions lost in Seattle.\nPatriots over Cowboys: You don’t want to give Bill Belichick two weeks to prepare, because that gives him one week to practice and one week to spend in the lab devising new forms of nefarious subterfuge.\nRaiders over Broncos: Joe Biden, who replaced Hillary Clinton as the speaker at the Human Rights Campaign dinner Saturday, went into full pander mode, calling transgender rights: “The civil rights issue of our time.” That seems a bit overstated. It’s hard to envision an activist from the movement stirring up the country with an MLK-type speech along the lines of: “I have a dream, that someday we will be judged by the quality of our character and not the content of our evolving crotches …”\nChargers over Steelers: Midnight Madness tipped off this week. The nominal start of the college hoop season provides most teams the first chance for its players and coaches to get together on the court. However, at some schools a different approach is taken. If you believe what you read, the Louisville Cardinals’ Midnight Madness might be the first chance for the players to get together and work with this year’s crop of hookers.\nBest bets: Falcons, Packers, Patriots.\nThursday night: Texans.\n  bettor's guide ,  hondo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:21:21.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
