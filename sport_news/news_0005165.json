The results, announced after markets closed Wednesday, met analysts' expectations and increased 20 percent from the same time in 2014. They were up 4.5 percent from the previous quarter.\nShares of the institution's stock reached a three-month high after the report, rising 3.5 percent, or 47 cents, to close Thursday at $13.87 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nExecutives of Oregon's third-largest bank said loan growth drove the institution's positive results. Loans have increased 31 percent to nearly $1.34 billion since the third quarter of 2014, after accounting for fees and potential losses. That figure increased $50.3 million from the second quarter of 2015.\nPacific Continental's recent growth has been fueled in part by its $42.4 million acquisition in March of Capital Pacific Bank, a former competitor based in Portland. Both focused on commercial clients.\n\"Our loan growth during the past two quarters has been substantial, and we are very pleased to set another record for production this quarter,\" chief operating Casey Hogan said in a written statement.\nTotal assets rose 26 percent over the year to $1.88 billion, and liabilities increased 27 percent to $1.66 billion. Deposits grew 33 percent to $1.52 billion.\nDuring the past quarter alone, assets and liabilities both increased 2.6 percent; deposits climbed 0.7 percent.\n-- Molly Young\nmyoung@oregonian.com\n503-412-7056\n@mollykyoung", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/finance?q=pcbk&ei=_PkfVoGFKKT-igL0waXgCQ", "https://twitter.com/mollykyoung", "http://www.snl.com/Cache/31454418.pdf", "http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=PCBK+Analyst+Estimates"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:25:49.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
