Phillip) \nPower, pitching, plus some dazzling defense — just like the Amazin' Mets of 1969. \n\"We've beaten some of the best the game has to offer,\" Mets captain David Wright said. \nBaseball's most dominant pitcher since the All-Star break, Arrieta had not even settled in when Murphy homered for the fourth straight game, a two-run drive just inside the right-field pole in a three-run first inning.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) \n\"We're having a whole bunch of fun right now,\" said Murphy, who homered in the first inning for the second straight game and seems to have a reserved star-of-the-game seat in the interview room. \nGiven the quick lead on a chilly night, Syndergaard kept the bats of Chicago's young sluggers on ice with shutout ball into the sixth. \nCurtis Granderson robbed Chris Coghlan of a likely home run with a leaping grab at the center-field wall, swiped a pair of bases and scored two runs for the Mets.

Rookie left-hander Steven Matz is set for Game 4, followed by Game 1 winner Matt Harvey on Thursday, if needed. \n\"They don't have the credentials that Kershaw and Greinke and Lester and Arrieta have, but they're going to be good pitchers,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"We think we can stack up with anybody.\" Fans cheer during the first inning of Game 2 of the National League baseball championship series between the New York Mets and the Chicago Cubs Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in New York.

If the long-downtrodden Cubs are to reach the World Series for the first time since 1945, they must first force the best-of-seven NLCS back to Citi Field next weekend. \n\"We're all about one-game winning streaks,\" Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. \"I know it's psychobabble 101, but it actually works.\" \nAfter homering off Kershaw, Greinke and Lester, Murphy added his fifth home run of the postseason, giving him eight RBIs in seven games. He's one from matching Carlos Beltran's record of homering in five straight postseason games.

He gained the nickname Thor — the Norse god known for fierce storms — after he tweeted a photo of himself in costume doing squats on Halloween two years ago. \nAhead of his start against the Cubs, Syndergaard changed the photo atop his Twitter page to a shot featuring lightning striking Chicago's famous Willis Tower.

Chicago didn't advance another runner past first.

Jeurys Familia's fourth postseason save finished a five-pitcher five-hitter and sent the Cubs to consecutive losses for the first time since they dropped three in a row from Sept. 23-26. Arrieta had not lost since July 25. \nIt was 45 degrees at game time with an 18 mph northwest wind. Some players wore balaclavas that covered their faces, including Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, who played on his 30th birthday. \nArrieta, who wore short sleeves, had not given up a first-inning run in 25 consecutive starts since May 29. With his velocity down slightly, he found himself trailing after nine pitches and down 3-0 after 13.

Wright, in a 1-for-19 playoff slide, drove a fastball on a hop off the center-field wall with Granderson running. \nMurphy hit an 0-1 pitch about 10 feet to the foul side of the right-field pole, then reached down for a shin-high curveball and with a one-handed swing sent it just inside the pole. Murphy raised his right fist in triumph while rounding first base and took a curtain call after a prolonged ovation. \n\"The ambush early got us,\" Maddon said. \nGranderson made his dashing defensive play in the second, leaping to get his glove to the top of the 8-foot wall just to the right of straightaway center. \n\"I was able to time it up, reel it in,\" Granderson said. \nHe walked leading off the third and stole second as Wright struck out. After Murphy was walked, Granderson swiped third, too — at Murphy's suggestion. He came home when Cespedes grounded to the shortstop hole for an infield single. \n\"Two tough games here, but the series is not over,\" Arrieta said. \"We feel good where we're at.\" \nUP NEXT \nCubs: Hendricks (8-7) did not get a decision in the Division Series against St. Louis, allowing three runs and four hits in 4 2-3 innings with seven strikeouts and no walks. \nMets: DeGrom (14-8) got the wins in Games 1 and 5 against the Dodgers. He is 0-2 in three career starts against the Cubs. \nDRESS CODE \nThe Mets stayed with their alternate blue jerseys after winning in them in Game 3 of the Division Series and the NLCS opener.
