WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER This group of Knights has had success from an early age, and it hasn’t stopped in high school. From left, Alyssa Jasuale, Justine Ricciardelli, Nicole Garcia and Alexis Monroy. NEW MILFORD — They’ve been together for so long, the occasional sister-like fights are almost inevitable.\n“If we didn’t fight sometimes, we’d deeply hate each other on the inside,” Nicole Garcia said before bursting out laughing in the New Milford gymnasium with teammates/best friends Alexis Monroy, Alyssa Jasuale and Justine Ricciardelli sitting by her side.\nThe girls soccer star seniors have been linked on the pitch since they were 5 years old. The on- and off-field chemistry they’ve developed since then is undeniable.\nMonroy and Ricciardelli’s fathers often coached the group before high school. New Milford coach Joe Albanese, one of their grade-school teachers, attended their games, often coming away impressed and excited for the future.\nThe talented bunch got accustomed to winning consistently at an early age.\n“Growing up, winning was really all we knew how to do,” Monroy, a starter on New Milford’s 2013 sectional championship team — the first such title in program history — said of her fellow senior captains. “When we came to high school, we didn’t expect that to change. We were always good.”\nThe joke — although they’re adamant it’s serious — is that they’re New Milford’s version of the Yankees’ Core Four —four longtime friends, all three-sport athletes, who have experienced a great amount of success in their high school careers.\n“If you hear Core Four in school, they’re usually referring to us,” Garcia, a strong-legged midfielder, said with a laugh, describing a group that’s gone 56-16 as starters since 2012, including two undefeated league titles and the aforementioned sectional crown.\n“But that’s what we call ourselves. People make fun of us sometimes, but it’s OK. We hashtag it on pictures on Instagram.”\nNew Milford has been picture-perfect the first month of the season, winning its first seven games while allowing just one goal, thanks in large part to an unheralded but talented defense anchored by Ricciardelli, the Knights’ fast and physical sweeper, and Jasuale, a speedster (and track star) on the outside.\nThe closeness is not limited to the field, either. Ricciardelli and Jasuale — a “jack-of-all-trades” and “workaholic,” according to Albanese — share the same birthday and are neighbors, living close enough to crack open windows in their homes and have conversations.\n“They’re our head honchos back there,” Monroy said. “We always have confidence knowing those two are back there.”\nMonroy is the offensive headliner, as the Kean-bound forward is fast approaching the 100-goal milestone. She has 92.\n“She’s the complete forward,” Albanese said of Monroy, who has 55 career assists and often can be seen dancing in pregame warm-ups. “Not only does she have a natural knack for finding the net, but she provides great crosses. And her corner kicks, 99 times out of 100, are spot on. She can find almost anybody.”\nNew Milford has high hopes as the season enters October, and it seems to be in good hands with the Core Four leading the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:28:01.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
