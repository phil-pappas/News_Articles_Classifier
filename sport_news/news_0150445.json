A year ago, Reina's time of 18:54.3 was good enough for 12th place at the Chile Pepper, but the big improvement on the course Saturday was plenty of reason to celebrate as Reina was the top finisher among local runners. \n\"This was so important. This is my favorite race of the whole year, and it's just such a great environment,\" Reina said. \"And to run a PR made it even better.\" \nReina is the defending 7A-West Conference and Class 7A state cross country champion. Performing well at Saturday's Chile Pepper should leave no doubt she's again the one to beat at this year's conference and state meets. \n\"The first mile I went through I felt good, and the last mile, which has been my weakness, I held through,\" Reina said. \"So it was a pretty good day for me. \n\"This will definitely push me towards the rest of the year. I've already hit my PR so now I know I'm capable of more and I'm just excited to help my team. We have a good chance to finish top five at state, and I'm really proud of all of us.\" \nSouthlake Carroll, Texas, who most recently won the girls' team title in 2012, took top team honors Saturday in convincing fashion. Carroll scored 46 points with Jackson, Mo., finishing as the runner-up with 196. \nFayetteville was the top team from Northwest Arkansas with a 325 score to finish seventh. Junior Corrie Purcell led the Lady Bulldogs with a 24th-place finish in a time of 19:07.45. Sophomore Becca Boushelle added a 38th-place run in a time of 19:30.73 \n\"I have four sophomores and one junior in my top five, so the sky is the limit for them,\" Fayetteville coach Michelle Fyfe said. \"A couple of them thought they had a bad race today, and they were down. But I thought they had a good race, and I was proud of how well they competed.\" \nBentonville finished 11th in the girls' team standings with 396 points, and Rogers High was next among local teams in 13th with 402. \nSports on 10/04/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:55:08.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
