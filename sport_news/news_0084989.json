He would go on to win three consecutive provincial championships on the very field he once worked. In fact, his team was so dominant they were dubbed the \"DMCI Dynasty\" and were inducted into the Winnipeg High School Football Hall of Fame in 2002.\nAnder never played another game after high school -- \"I wasn't heavy enough to make the junior team,\" he said -- but his love for the game never died. Despite moving hundreds of kilometres away, he still keeps a close eye on the Bombers and has watched every Grey Cup game.\nThe Grey Cup has become more than just a football game for Ander and fans like him. The trophy resembles a piece of history. Every name engraved is a story. With every championship, a new chapter written.\nLike a drug, it's an addiction that once it grabs a hold of you, it's next to impossible to shake. It consumes you, and sometimes can make you do things you'd never thought imaginable.\nTake Joanne Basson, another resident of The Pas. When games weren't on TV, she and a girlfriend would hop in the car and drive until they could get a signal on the radio. Her greatest memory is when she got the chance to see the Bombers beat the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 1984 Grey Cup in Edmonton.\n\"The only reason I could get time off was because I said it was my honeymoon,\" she said with a smile. \"So I went to the Grey Cup game with nine of my husband's buddies and that was my honeymoon.\"\nThen there's Lyle Borgstrom, a resident of Flin Flon who thought he missed his only chance to see the Cup up close when he showed up late for a rare visit from the CFL's holy grail Monday because he had to drive his grandkids around for their own sporting events. Missing it brought him to tears.\nBut it was tears of joy Tuesday morning when a friend of the family took a shot in the dark and reached out to the handlers of the Cup with his story. He almost fell over when the Cup was delivered to his doorstep the next morning.\n\"This is unbelievable,\" said Borgstrom. \"Things in life happen, they come and they go and I thought this was one time where it that happened to me. My family, we're nuts about the CFL.\"\n\"When we missed it last night at the park I was so upset,\" said Kristina Lies, Lyle's daughter, tears running down her cheek. \"The kids were saying 'that would have been a lifetime memory' because when are you ever going to get to do that again? You know, that's what made me feel so bad. So when they said this could happen, I was, well obviously emotional.\n\"Just incredible. It's something that brings all of us together.\"\njeff.hamilton@freepress.mb.ca twitter: @jeffkhamilton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:48:08.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
