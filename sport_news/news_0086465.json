Fox admitted on the red carpet that he was a little torn over that one.\n“It’s tough because I’m a New Yorker and I would love to see the Mets do well. But I’d love to see the film be right. So I’m torn,” Fox said before the game ended, adding, “Whatever happens, happens.”\nLuckily for Fox, The Post’s video team — with apologies to the Blue Jays, who are still alive — came up with an alternate to the much-talked-about Cubs World Series scene.\n\nChristopher Lloyd, who played Emmett “Doc” Brown, said he didn’t really follow the predictions, except for that one.\n“I’m hoping the Cubs win tonight and go into the series, that would be the ultimate prediction,” Lloyd said with a bit of trepidation.\nBut that was not to be.\nThe Mets defeated the Cubs 8-3 Wednesday in the National League Championship Series to advance to the World Series.\n \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under back to the future ,  chicago cubs ,  michael j. fox ,  mlb playo ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:13:21.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
