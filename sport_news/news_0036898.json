Bret Hulsey, a 30-year-old Republican from Douglas County, wants reasonable compromise instead of endless gridlock. Morgan Smith, 19, president of a nonpartisan political group at the University of Denver, wants his generation to be more than a campaign prop.\nBefore the Oct. 28 Republican debate at the University of Colorado at Boulder, a review of polling data and interviews with 16 millennials, adults born after 1980, indicate most — on the right and the left — don't want their parents' brand of partisan politics, where bombast replaced compromise and zero-sum gamesmanship altered politics, from Washington, D.C., to the local school board.\nRELATED: Trump, Carson demand that next debate be limited to 2 hours\n\"I'm listening for something new in every one of these (Republican and Democratic) debates that I haven't heard yet,\" said Chris Johnson, a 28-year-old landscaper and staunch Republican from Jefferson County.\n\"Everybody wants to talk about the future, but the future they talk about is what they want, not what those of us who are going to live in it want.\"\nWhat does Johnson want? Reasonable taxes, affordable insurance and apprenticeships for good-paying jobs that don't require an unaffordable college degree.\nAdvertisement \"We're the young people, but every election I think we're more the grown-ups,\" said Jen Buckner, 32, a Democrat and social worker in Jefferson County.\n\"We grew up on Rush Limbaugh and Fox News, and now it's just white noise that doesn't really get us anywhere. Just stop it, and work together.\"\nA Pew Research Center study last year indicated a political climate change for the Republican Party. Millennials are more liberal than any generation before them.\nForty-one percent identify as mostly or consistently liberal in their positions, while only 15 percent hold mostly or consistently conservative views. The good news for the GOP is that 44 percent were ideologically mixed and potentially up for grabs. And it's a big voter bloc that each party should covet. This year the number of millennials will top the number of Baby Boomers 83.1 million to 74.9 million nationally, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections released in June.\nAs of 2013, the latest census figures, millennials made up almost one-third of the U.S. population, and Colorado has more than 1.1 million millennials to 958,289 Baby Boomers. In Denver the gap is even wider: 176,458 to 99,095.\nNews Newsletter and Updates Subscribe for updates and our roundup on Front Range news, delivered to your inbox daily.\nGen-X'ers — those now between 34 and 49 years old — are expected to peak at 65.3 million in 2018. By 2020, millennials are expected to make up more than half of the American workforce.\n\"In short, not only are millennials less likely than older generations to identify as Republicans, but even those who do express significantly less conservative values than do their elders,\" the Pew study found. \"No such generational divide exists among Democrats.\"\nDespite Pew's findings, Republicans seek to cast the next generation as jaded after cutting their teeth on Barack Obama's campaign of \"Hope\" in the 2008 race.\n\"People voted for Obama because he was a celebrity,\" said Jonathan Lockwood, 26, a Denver-based Republican strategist and communications consultant who is the former state director of the conservative, youth-oriented Generation Opportunity chapter. \"But we know he hasn't delivered.\"\nNonetheless, Republicans can learn a lot from the way Obama campaigned and stuck to his message toward younger voters, Lockwood said.\n\"The person who sounds the most hopeful is going to win out,\" Lockwood said. \"The person who sounds the angriest is just going to turn millennials off.\"\nLockwood said a proven record is critical to winning over younger voters.\n\"Millennials aren't saying, 'Get rid of every social program,' but even the most complete bleeding-heart voter is tired of seeing so much abuse in the system,\" he said. \"And broke millennials want to know where their money is going.\"\nBut Martinez, who calls herself a liberal Democrat, said a focus on cutting programs and taxes for the rich is a poor approach.\n\"We're not rich people, and rich people aren't helping us,\" she said. \"Talk about tax cuts translates in our minds to making the rich richer and making it harder on people on the back end of the scale.\"\nSmith, an unaffiliated voter, cited as an example student loans, a $1.3 trillion burden for millennials. He noted while at least three Democrats have put out plans to deal with college debt, the only Republican candidate who's given the issue a cursory mention is Ted Cruz, in the Sept. 16 debate.\n\"His point was there aren't jobs, but a lot of my friends watching the debate said, 'Why are students having debt in the first place — a lot of debt?' \" Smith said.\nWhile young people tend not to vote, they turned out strong for both Obama elections. But there isn't that kind of candidate in this election, said Denver pollster Floyd Ciruli. Even Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton is old-school party establishment, he said.\nWith disappointment in Obama's economy, Republicans have an inroad, but they need to prove they can get something done, Ciruli said.\n\"My sense is that if Republicans can find a candidate with the right personality who speaks directly to (millennials) and seems like they can actually get something done with the other party, younger people would vote for that candidate,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2015/09/17/gop-debate-student-loan-debt/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic", "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/09/25/the-gops-millennial-problem-runs-deep/", "http://www.finaid.org/loans/studentloandebtclock.phtml", "https://generationopportunity.org/", "http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2015/01/07/in-5-years-millennials-will-make-up-50-of-the-work", "http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:04:11.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
