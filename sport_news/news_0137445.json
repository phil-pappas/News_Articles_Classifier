Share This Article Ottawa, Ontario • Mike Condon got all the help he needed in his NHL debut for the Montreal Canadiens. Condon made 20 saves, and Tomas Plekanec scored twice in the first period in the Canadiens' 3-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Sunday night. The 25-year-old Condon allowed only Jean-Gabriel Pageau's short-handed goal midway through the second period in the Senators' home opener. \"It was exciting and I thought the guys played an awesome game,\" Condon said. \"I think we only had 15 shots against going into the third period and then only maybe five or six scoring chances, so it made my workload very light.\" VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:40:25.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
