The Nagpur-based lawyer, who headed BCCI from 2008 to 2011, has been able to secure all six nominations from the East Zone, whose turn it was to elect the president till 2017. Manohar has garnered support from six East Zone units — Bengal, Jharkhand, Tripura, Assam, Orissa and National Cricket Club (NCC). The development has come even before former BCCI president N Srinivasan could make a last-ditch effort to reach some compromise by meeting BJPchief Amit Shah in the capital. It has been learnt that Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and National Cricket Club (NCC) — both controlled by former India captain and newly-elected CAB president Sourav Ganguly — have proposed Manohar’s name. All other five East Zone members, including Amitabh Chaudhary, a close confidant of Srinivasan, are reportedly keen to second Manohar’s candidature. According to sources, most of the Srinivasan supporters in the BCCI are now reconciled with the fact that Manohar is going to take over and it would be better for them to support his candidature in order to remain in his good books. Srinivasanhas been left isolated in his fight to save his ICC chairman’s post and prevent his IPL team Chennai Super Kings (CSK) from getting scrapped by Manohar in the next AGM. Manohar, who was in Delhi on Wednesday to depose before the Justice R.M. Lodha Committee, reached Nagpur the same night, thus ending all the speculation over him joining Shah and Srinivasan in their meeting. Manohar and his supporters will reach Mumbai on October 3, the day of filing the nomination. It is learnt that the 57-year-old Manohar’s top priority is to cleanse the BCCI, starting with the IPL mess. In this context, his views expressed before the Justice Lodha panel would be very crucial in effecting strong reforms. Sachin, Kumble depose\nOn Wednesday evening, former India captainsSachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble too appeared before the Lodha Committee. Thetwo had an hour-long meeting with the three-member panel, where they put forth their views on administrative reforms and how to make cricket corruption-free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:23:27.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
