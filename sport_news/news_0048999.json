Comment   By Randy Hogan Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 3:08 PM By Randy Hogan Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 3:08 PM High school gridiron action heads into its seventh week tonight. Teams have reached the halfway point of their conference schedules and are preparing for the stretch run. However, it could be a short season for most Phillips County football fans with only two of the county’s teams having a legitimate shot at postseason play. The Marvell Academy Eagles appear to have an excellent opportunity but have three of their conference contests remaining. However, two of them are at home. The Eagles are 7-0 and 1-0 in conference play. The Eagles play the North Sunflower Academy Rebels at Drew, Mississippi tonight in the first of three conference games to close out the season. The Rebels are 5-3 and 2-0 in the conference. Caleb Gannon and Morgan Steeland provided the offensive spark for the Eagles in 46-16 rout of Hebron Christian Academy last week. Gannon generated 77 yards on three for six passing and rushed for another 230 yards and three touchdowns on 12 touches. Steeland contributed 134 yards on the ground on 9 carries for 2 touchdowns. It’s a big game for both squads. Central is currently in third place in the 2-4A race after knocking off the Riverview Raiders, 38-22 last Friday night. Tonight, the Cougars host the Lonoke Jackrabbits at Cad Polk Stadium. Central is 2-1 in conference play and 3-3 overall. The Jackrabbits have not won a conference game but sport an overall, 3-3 mark. Lonoke dropped a 34-28 decision to Southside last weekend. At this point, the Cougars are still in control of their playoff destiny. The Cougars nipped the Jackrabbits, 14-12 at Lonoke in last year’s meeting. Barton fans hope homecoming will give the Bears an incentive to come out of a 4-week hibernation and get back on the winning road when they play the Atkins Red Devils. Atkins is 0-3 in 2-3A Conference competition and 2-4 overall. Bald Knob blew out the Red Devils 43-14 last Friday evening. Ugly is the only word to describe Barton’s 52-22 loss to Harding Academy. The Bears controlled the ball early on but failed to capitalize on two extended drives. The Wildcats took advantage of a porous Barton secondary. Offensively, the Bears got a pair of touchdowns from Cam Anderson on runs of 65 and 37 yards respectively. Bradley Smith scored Barton’s only other TD in the first quarter. Smith also had a 2-point conversion. A lot of things will have to go Barton’s way for the Bears to make a return trip to the playoffs. First, the Bears would have to run the table and win all their remaining games, which includes a meeting with the Bald Knob Bulldogs. There also would need to be a couple of upsets along the way. Page 2 of 2 - Barton defeated the Red Devils, 50-32 in a high scoring affair at Atkins in 2014. Marvell, 0-6, 0-4 heads to Des Arc to take on the Eagles. Des Arc appears to be headed for the runner-up spot in the 6-2A Conference behind the so far undefeated McCrory Jaguars. The Eagles enter the contest at 5-1 overall and 3-1 in conference action. Palestine-Wheatley downed the Mustangs, 34-14 last weekend. Des Arc pounded the Mustangs, 48-20 at Marvell a year ago. DeSoto rallied from behind twice to defeat the Kirk Academy Raiders 26-21 at Sam Howe Field last Friday night. Ryan Self led the charge with a 4-touchdown performance. It appears as though the T-Birds may have salvaged a .500 season. Tonight, they travel to Marianna to do battle with the winless Cougars, 0-8, 0-3, in a conference contest. Prairie View Academy blanked the Lee Academy, 44-0 last week. DeSoto is 4-4 overall and 0-2 in their conference. All games are slated to kickoff at 7 p.m. By Randy Hogan   By Randy Hogan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:03:59.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
