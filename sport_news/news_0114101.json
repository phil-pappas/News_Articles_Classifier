(Image Source: Andy Lyons/Getty Images) \nWeek 7 preview: \n-London’s Calling: The NFL’s “International Series” continues this Sunday in London’s Wembley Stadium, as the Jacksonville Jaguars take on the Buffalo Bills. \nWhat makes this contest different is it will be the first-ever NFL game that is live streamed globally. The league has partnered with Yahoo! Inc. to bring the world an NFL game via Yahoo!’s digital platform on yahoo.com/nflstream. \nThis is the second-straight season that the NFL will play three games in London. The New York Jets beat the Miami Dolphins 27-14 on October 4 and the Kansas City Chiefs will play the Detroit Lions on November 1. \n-It’s Not Over ‘Till It’s Over: Through six week, there have been 91 games played and 27 of those games have ended with a fourth-quarterback comeback, that’s 29.7 percent. That’s the second-highest percentage in NFL history trailing only the 1989 season when 70 of 224 games (31.3 percent) featured a comeback in the final stanza. \n-6 & Oh: There are five undefeated teams heading into Week 7, including three teams—the Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers—that are 6-0. They all have a bye this week, which gives the 5-0 Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots a chance to catch up. If they both do it would set a record for most teams to start a season 6-0 in the same year. The most ever is four, which happened in 2009. \n-QB Watch: New England Patriots QB Tom Brady enters Sunday’s game against the New York Jets needing 43 yards to reach 55,000 passing yards in his career. He is fifth all-time, trailing Drew Brees (57,649), Dan Marino (61,361), Peyton Manning (71,215) and Brett Favre (71,838). \nIn Atlanta, QB Matt Ryan is chasing 30,000 passing yards, needing 83 yards this Sunday to get there in game 117, which would move him ahead of Drew Brees as the fifth fastest to get there. Only Dan Marino (114), Kurt Warner (114), Peyton Manning (115) and Aaron Rodgers (116) have gotten there quicker. \nSan Diego Chargers passer Philip Rivers is coming off a franchise-record 503-yard passing game, his third-straight effort with 350-plus yards. If he throws for 350 yards this week against Oakland, Rivers will have the second-most passing yards the week after going for 500. Of the 17 QBs that have thrown for 500 yards, Tom Brady holds the record for the following game, with 423 yards. \n-Rookie Watch: St. Louis Rams running back Todd Gurley has rushed for 146 yards (Week 4) and 159 yards (Week 5) in his past two games, which were also his first two starts as a pro. If he can crack 140 yards against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, Gurley would join Pro Football Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson as the only rookies to rush for 140-plus yards in three-straight games. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
