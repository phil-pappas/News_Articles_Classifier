They're kids but they're resilient. This was a big game, no question. They were all right in the locker room and we'll get back to work on Monday afternoon. We've got a great Toledo team coming in and that's all we can do.\" \nBlake Frohnapfel was also asked about how the team can keep things from unraveling. With a top-25 team coming to town next week and half the season already gone, he spoke mostly of urgency: \n\"It's disappointing and you never want to lose a game like that. Sitting down in the locker room, we're talking about the chance we have against Toledo next week. They're a ranked team. They come here and play us at Gillette and we have a great opportunity. It's a great challenge. For a lot of the guys on our team, this is the last time we'll play football. It's like, why get discouraged? You have to be optimistic about the season. Toledo will be a great challenge, but I think it's one we're excited for. They're a great team. They're a top 25 team. They definitely do a lot of things well. But it's a chance to come back. \nJovan Santos-Knox, who is usually pretty outspoken, but didn't have a whole lot to say in Saturday's postgame, felt similarly: \n\"I'm not worried about that. We have strong guys in that locker room. We've had tough losses here over the past years and we've always bounced back and kept spirits up in the locker room. I'm not worried about that. We have resilient guys. We should be good.\" Blake Frohnapfel & Jovan Santos-Knox Talk After UMass' Loss To Kent State The quarterback and linebacker share their thoughts on the 15-10 loss Saturday. \nWhipple, an avid golfer during the offseason, went into some golf terminology to describe the uphill battle UMass was fighting for most of the evening: \n\"The game played out the way they wanted it to play out. We couldn't make a big play to get us something and it was just kind of a rain day today. Hitting a tee ball sideways. It's hard to score. A couple of hooks and a few slices and you can still make par, make birdie, but it's a lot harder.\" \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:37:14.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
