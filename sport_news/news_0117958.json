Katherine Dunn Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun How many Top 15 football teams remain undefeated after eight weeks? \nThe fall season is winding down with eight weeks completed and the top high school football teams continue to separate themselves from the rest of the pack. \nOnly one Top 15 team lost to an unranked team this week -- Mervo, which had gone undefeated through its first seven games. That leaves just five unbeaten teams -- Old Mill, Howard, John Carroll, Eastern Tech and Dundalk -- as the season moves quickly toward the playoffs. \nHere's a look at how The Baltimore Sun's Top 15 teams fared this weekend.
