The Golden State Warriors played the New Orleans Pelicans in Game 2 of the 1st Round of NBA Western Conference Playoffs at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, April 20, 2015. Steve Kerr, who led the Warriors to the NBA title in his first year as a head coach last season, is taking a leave of absence from the team as he continues his rehabilitation from a pair of back surgeries he had in the offseason.\nAdChoices In a statement issued Thursday afternoon, the team said assistant coach Luke Walton will serve as the interim coach in Kerr’s absence.\nThere was no timetable given for Kerr’s return.\n“At this point, the most important thing is to make sure Steve is healthy, completely recovered and ready for not only the rigors of a long NBA season, but day-to-day life in general,” said Warriors General Manager Bob Myers in the statement. “We don’t anticipate the recovery process will be long term, but as of today we don’t know the exact timeframe. We’ll evaluate his progress daily and provide updates as necessary.”\nIn the statement, Kerr added: “After the first two days of training camp, I realized I need to take a step back and focus on my rehabilitation in order to be ready for the grind of another NBA season,” said Kerr. “As I noted last week, my summer was difficult and no fun due to the multiple back surgeries. At this point, I simply want to get healthy and back to my normal daily routine on and off the court.”\nThe Warriors began training camp this week and will play the first of their seven preseason games Monday in San Jose against Toronto.\nGolden State opens defense of its first league championship in 40 years on Oct. 27 against New Orleans at Oracle Arena.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:22:02.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
