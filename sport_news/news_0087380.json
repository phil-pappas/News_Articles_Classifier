I hope the new operator comes in and runs it properly.\"\nA release about the sale didn't announce a buyer. \"The transaction is expected to be completed within the next three weeks. We anticipate that the stores will stay open during this time,\" the release said.\n\"Bella's will have a joint announcement with the buyer once the transaction is complete.\"\nMancini didn't return a call for comment.\nHe owes Gypsum several months of sales tax, said Jeff Shroll, the Gypsum town manager. That money will be recovered when the stores are sold, he added.\nIn August 2014, Mancini sold Bella's Market stores in Akron, Haxtun, Walden and Wiggins to the Leroy Odell family of Akron.\nThe sale returned the markets to the family, which had sold them to Mancini in 2006.\nThe markets were the only supermarkets in each of the towns, and when Mancini was unable to keep them stocked, some residents were driving up to 120 miles to get groceries.\nAdvertisement Residents of Akron, who had confronted empty shelves at the Bella's there, have been thrilled with the result, said Annette Bowin, the town's clerk and administrator. \"It has been great because they went back to the original owner. It took a little while, the stores were empty. We are back to business as usual, life is good,\" she said.\nNeither the Odell family, nor their lawyer, John O'Brien, could be reached for comment.\nMancini had earlier sold two other stores after months of financial trouble, in Limon and Stratton , to Tony Ford, the owner of a grocery store in Flagler, and his son, Trey.\nThe deal with Odell that gave Mancini the stores called for him to purchase inventory at the stores and lease the buildings.\nHe didn't have the money to purchase the business outright, so Odell provided a $2 million loan to finance the deal, according to a document filed in Washington County District Court, during an attempt by Odell to evict Mancini from the store in Akron.\nThe deal quickly disintegrated, and a 2012 bankruptcy filing by VM Odell's claimed that even as Mancini was missing payments to the Odells, he was milking the business to pay creditors and finance \"his excessive lifestyle.\"\nBetween 2010 and June 2013, Mancini paid himself $1.4 million and used about $700,000 of that to pay off judgments and claims against him, the bankruptcy document said.\nVM Odell's emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan.\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:08:28.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
