Most Read Stories \nDuring the past week Tacoma Power employees released: \n64 coho adults, 62 jacks, 315 fall Chinook adults and 36 jacks at Franklin Bridge in Packwood; \n503 fall Chinook adults, 47 jacks, with 126 coho adults, 533 jacks and one cutthroat trout into the Tilton River at Gust Backstrom Park in Morton. \nRiver flows at Mayfield Dam are approximately 3,670 cubic feet per second on Monday, October 12. \nKalama River – Bank anglers are catching some fall Chinook, coho, and summer run steelhead. \nEast Fork Lewis and Washougal river – Light effort and catches. \nDrano Lake – Still some fall Chinook being caught here. \nFrom the Little White Salmon National Fish Hatchery Facebook page on September 30: \nFor those who are interested in fish numbers, here’s a breakdown of estimated numbers expected to return to Little White Salmon Hatchery. “PIT” stands for Passive Integrated Transponder. Prior to release, a specified number of fish are tagged internally with a PIT tag containing information. This information includes its PIT tag number, tagging location, organization responsible for the tagging, species, run, weight, length, wild or hatchery type, marks and general health. \nAfter the fish is released its movements can be tracked in various ways depending upon the reason for tagging. Hatcheries use PIT tags to estimate the number and age of fish returning to their individual hatchery. \nInfo courtesy of Steve Lazzini with the Lower Columbia River Fisheries Program in Vancouver, WA. \nYakima River – From Paul Hoffarth WDFW District 4 Fish Biologist in Pasco – The salmon fishery in the lower Yakima River picked up this past week. WDFW staff interviewed 212 anglers with 70 adult chinook, 1 jack, and 1 coho. An estimated 995 anglers fished for salmon in the Yakima River harvesting 352 adult fall chinook, 8 jacks, and 6 coho. Anglers averaged 7.6 hours of fishing per chinook. This season, 1,016 adult chinook, 49 jacks, and 9 coho have been harvested from 3,648 angler trips. \nThis fishery will close on October 22. \nLower Columbia mainstem below Bonneville Dam – Fall Chinook catches continue to remain strong from the mouth of the Cowlitz upstream. Boat anglers from Woodland upstream averaged ½ adult fall Chinook or better per rod last week. \nBonneville Pool – Anglers continue to do well for fall Chinook at the mouth of the tributaries. Effort is fairly heavy at the mouth of the Klickitat with 65 and 55 boats counted there last Saturday and Sunday, respectively. \nHanford Reach – From Paul Hoffarth – Fishing for fall chinook in the Hanford Reach continues to be excellent. Harvest for the week was estimated at 5,958 fall chinook (5,680 adults and 278 jacks). WDFW estimates there were 6,838 anglers fishing in the Hanford Reach this past week. To date, 25,631 adult chinook and 1,306 jacks have been harvested in the Hanford Reach by the 40,235 anglers. \nEffort dropped off a bit this past week with the opening of the hunting seasons. Fish were harvested throughout the Hanford Reach with the best catch per boat at White Bluffs, Ringold, and Vernita at 2.8 fish per boat. Anglers fishing in the Tri-cities averaged 1.3 chinook per boat. Overall, anglers fishing in the Hanford Reach average 2.4 chinook per boat, 7.4 angler hours per fish, slightly better than the week prior. Bank anglers are picking up a few fall chinook each day at the Ringold Springs Access area. This past week 63 chinook were harvested off the bank. \nWDFW staff interviewed 2,412 anglers from 856 boats and 198 bank anglers fishing for fall chinook in the Hanford Reach. \nThe in-season run update (Oct. 7) for the Hanford Reach continues to predict a record escapement of over 200,000 adult chinook. \nWalleye \nLower Columbia below Bonneville Dam – Boat anglers in the Vancouver area caught some fish last week. \nMark Yuasa : 206-464-8780 or myuasa@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @markkyuasa .
