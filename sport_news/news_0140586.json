Senior Emily Lucitt and sophomore Morgan Loggins were the two Lady Tigers to score. \"For us to come out strong like we did, and put a couple runs on the board, I think we did halfway decent against this pitcher,\" Waynesville coach Kelly Jackson said. \"She brings it.\" Uthe pitched all seven innings giving up three hits and a pair of walks. Junior third baseman Kylee Compton cut the lead to 2-1 with a swing of the bat, crushing the ball over the left-field wall in the bottom of the second. \"That ball went a long way didn't it?\" Calbert said. \"That was a nice hit and kind of turned the game around for us.\" The Lady Lakers got three more runs in the bottom of the third, one on an error and juniors Erin Rasmussen and Kristyn Carpenter both had RBI singles. Carpenter had another RBI on a double to left center in the bottom of the fourth and Uthe had a RBI double off the left-field wall as well to put Camdenton up 6-2. As with most teams, the end of the season means the departure of some seniors and in the Lady Tigers' case it is three staples. Jordan Kane, Emily Lucitt and Cierra Parker have been staples for the Waynesville softball program for four years. \"That's three key girls at the plate -- a leadoff (Lucitt), a power hitter (Kane) and CJ [Parker] is a strong five or six hitter from the left side,\" Jackson said. \"CJ does a good job at first base for us, she made some good scoops last night in the game, Jordan Kane can play anywhere, we lose her as a pitcher as well. She's a number four hitter, we lose her power. And Lucitt, she's speedy out of the left side of the box, she's a triple threat and she can get down the line.\" It would've been nice to see her seniors get to play at least one more game, but there's a reason the Lady Lakers has cracked the 20-win mark -- they're a buzz saw. \"Obviously we were the underdog,\" Jackson said. \"But we jumped on them early. We just couldn't keep them down at the plate.\" By Derek Dueker   Derek Dueker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:52:43.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
