The problems arise when the horse's destination doesn't match the rider's, which is why early techies invented saddles, bridles, hackamores and democracy.\nWhile the path home to the barn appears to be a \"yes\" vote on a referred ballot question that reads like a Macy's ad, and the cost placed as an \"indefinite\" $2 billion tax burden on the shoulders of future tourists, Denver voters would do well to peer into the distance, check the angle of the sun, and calculate whether the fine gelding between their legs branded \"2C\" intends to get them home by dinnertime.\nWhile doing nothing isn't really an option — as The Post's endorsement of the measure highlights — the current governance model places host neighborhoods Elyria, Globeville and Swansea in \"satellite\" status to the National Western Center Board. None of the \"neighborhood reps\" on the advisory board has kids in the school system; nor are they elected by the neighborhoods. As co-author of the Elyria 2020 Vision Plan in 2006, I wonder where and whether the new school will be built, the one we drew into our plan approved almost 10 years ago by 580 neighborhood signers, most of whose kids are expected to attend their studies alongside the $1.3 billion, five-year Interstate 70 project.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:02:51.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
