The 38-year-old Sun played for The Citizens from 2002 to 2008, the first Asian player to sign for the club. \nSun was widely considered one of the best Chinese defenders in the 1990s and early 2000s. Winning 4 domestic league titles from 1996 to 2002, Sun was transferred to Man City in 2002 and voted the best for player for the club in September. In October, Sun became the first Chinese player to score in the Premier League when he headed home the first goal in a 2-nil win over Birmingham City.
