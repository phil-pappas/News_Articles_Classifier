(AP) - Mississippi officials say they will release results next month from the multistate test that high school students took last school year. However, results for grades 3-8 from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness of Colleges and Careers test won't be available until December, and school accountability grades won't be available until early next year.\nWhen Mississippi releases results, state Superintendent Carey Wright says it will be in PARCC's five-level format, instead of Mississippi's previous four-tiered format of minimal, basic, proficient and advanced. The share of Mississippi students scoring proficient is likely to be much lower than in past years, because only PARCC's top two tiers meet its proficiency standards.\nMississippi used PARCC tests only last year, but will keep a five-level format going forward. Labels and proficiency levels could change.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
