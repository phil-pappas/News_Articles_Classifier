I was really young at the time. It was literally a one-second conversation. \n\"I said 'Stop, I'm from Wales and love Wales'. Everyone knows how much I love playing for Wales. \n\"My grandmother's English, but I'm Welsh and I would never want it to happen.\" \nBale scored seven goals in Wales' 10 group games, including vital winners against Andorra, Belgium and Cyprus, and the 26-year-old praised the support Coleman's side gained from the whole country over the qualification period. \n\"The passion from our players is I would say the best in the world. You never see a nation get behind the team like Wales, whether it's away from home or at home, or whether it's for the football or for the rugby. \n\"The anthem is just incredible when it's sung, even in the middle of a game. Everyone pulls together in one direction.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:41:07.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
