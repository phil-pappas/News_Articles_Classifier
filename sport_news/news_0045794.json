Although the 2009 world champion admitted that he was uncertain about his future at one point, he added that his conversation with Ron Dennis made him realise that the team's chairman and chief executive remained 'utterly determined' and 'uniquely equipped' to help the team overcome its current difficulties and lead it to great success in the future, the Guardian reported. Meanwhile, Dennis confirmed the news saying that Button will race for the team under the terms and conditions as set out in the two-year contract that both parties entered into a year ago. McLaren endured a disappointing season so far this year as engine partner Honda struggled to deal with a number of reliability problems and a lack of competitiveness.
