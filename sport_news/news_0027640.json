Bielema got between the players and instigated the issue while making contact with Robinson. \nWhile Robinson didn’t appear to make any contact with Bielema, the officials threw a flag after Bielema jerked as if he had been shoved. Upon seeing the flag thrown, Bielema then celebrated by pumping his fist and spinning around. Arkansas received the ball at the 12-yard line which set up the game’s first touchdown. \nSEC commissioner Greg Sankey released a statement about the incident on Tuesday. \n“I visited with Bret over the phone on Monday and we discussed the play that has now become widely reviewed through a brief video clip,” Sankey said in a statement, according to CBSSports’ Jon Solomon. “Football is played in an intense competitive environment, and I reminded him of the need for head coaches to resolve with their own players issues that may arise, which was his intent. The unsportsmanlike penalty assessed on the play was not directly associated with Bret’s efforts to intervene at the end of the play and we are moving forward in a positive manner.” \nESPN’s camera didn’t pick up the incident, but a video posted to the Twitter account of Anthony Jacks, a high school football coach at Pelham, provided an angle from the Arkansas sideline. @ClayTravisBGID watch Beilema instegate Cam Robinson, fake like he was shoved, then dance a jig to celebrate. pic.twitter.com/DYSSZdEkOM — Anthony Jacks (@Coach_Jacks) October 12, 2015 \nOn Monday, Alabama coach Nick Saban said he hadn’t seen the video from the Arkansas sideline. \n“This is something that just came up here recently for me,” Saban said. “I have not seen it. What I did see was Cam got blocked pretty well on the play by one of their players. On our tape, he got up and shoved another player in frustration. That’s basically what I saw and what I assumed the penalty was for and about. \n“That’s really all I can comment on. I think when you retaliate and push a player, you can expect to get a penalty. The rest of it I can’t really comment about because I haven’t seen it.” 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RFZNeP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:42:25.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
