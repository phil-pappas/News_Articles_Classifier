Photograph by: GABRIEL BOUYS , AFP/Getty Images \nCARDIFF, Wales — Millennium Stadium has played an important part in shaping New Zealand captain Richie McCaw’s illustrious rugby career, and he hopes it won’t be where his last remaining international ambition ends. \nThe 34-year-old flanker, a veteran of 145 test matches, is bidding to become the first captain to successfully defend the Rugby World Cup title. He led the All Blacks to World Cup victory at home in 2011, and wants to be the first New Zealand captain to win it on foreign soil. \nFirst, his team must get past France in today’s quarter-final (Noon, TSN 5). \nNew Zealand is the clear favourite, even more than in 2007, when Les Bleus rallied from a first-half pounding at the same stadium to beat the All Blacks 20-18 and reach the semifinals. That is one of McCaw’s worst memories, but the bitter defeat proved useful. \n“It probably shaped what’s come since,” McCaw said Friday. “You learn from those lessons.” \nAlthough France is not hosting the tournament — as it did in ‘07 — it will effectively turn into a home game for the French, considering the comparative travel for both sets of fans. \n“Hopefully see plenty of black (shirts) in the crowd tomorrow,” McCaw said. “Plenty of noise from the Kiwis would be great.” \nEven if the stadium turns into a sea of blue, that will do little to intimidate McCaw. He still vividly recalls the Cardiff roar of 2004 — when the All Blacks beat the Welsh 26-25 in a frenzied atmosphere. \n“The 2004 test against Wales, my first test at captain, went right to the wire. Their whole crowd was singing and they thought they could get over the line,” McCaw said. “I went off the field thinking that we got pushed right to the limit and you remember. All over the world, people ask me my favourite place to play and the Millennium Stadium’s got to be right up there.” \nNew Zealand has lost only three times anywhere since winning the last World Cup — and none of those defeats were against France. \nIt has beaten France four times in that period, with all of those victories in 2013 — including a 30-0 rout. \nGiven how close that 2011 final was, and what happened four years earlier, McCaw is the last person prepared to write off coach Philippe Saint-Andre’s French squad. \n“We’re expecting a French team very fired up,” McCaw said. “I’m expecting the best of them and that’s been our preparation all week.” \nFrance lost 24-9 to Ireland last Sunday, handing the French the tougher side of the knockout draw. \nIn a somewhat desperate attempt at changing tact, Saint-Andre has tried to restore some much-needed flair to his team’s attack. \nScrumhalf Sebastien Tillous-Borde has been replaced by the more imaginative and quick-handed Morgan Parra. An accomplished player with 65 caps, Parra was a regular at the last World Cup and many observers wonder why he has not remained France’s first-choice pick. \n“To be honest I wasn’t surprised to see him starting. He’s very experienced and knows these situations,” McCaw said. “He has a lot of ability, but the best way to fix a No. 9 is to make sure he gets ball that’s a bit scrappy.” \nIn another change, battering ram Mathieu Bastareaud was replaced by the more elusive and likely more inventive Alexandre Dumoulin at outside centre. \nThat selection took the All Blacks more by surprise. \n“You take what you can from the footage you see,” said Conrad Smith, an 11-year test veteran. “I thought he was pretty impressive when he came on against Ireland, added a bit of energy.” \nThe three other matches being played this weekend in the United Kingdom: \nSOUTH AFRICA vs. WALES (Saturday, 8 a.m. Pacific Time) \nThe Springboks have the best strike rate at the World Cup, having won the title twice since rejoining international competition in the post-apartheid era, in 1995 and 2007. The South Africans have only lost twice in 30 tests against Wales. And although they tend to do most of their work in or close to the rucks and mauls, the Boks have two of the best try scorers in the business on each wing in Bryan Habana and JP Pietersen. On the plus side for the Welsh, they beat South Africa in Cardiff last November, and came through the toughest group of the tournament. \nIRELAND vs. ARGENTINA (Sunday, 5 a.m. PT) \nSix Nations champion Ireland has won 12 and drawn one of their 20 matches against Argentina, and are on a five-match streak since losing all three head-to-heads in 2007. But Argentina has a 2-1 edge in World Cup encounters. The Irish have never won a World Cup quarter-final and they’ll be without captain Paul O’Connell, who injured his hamstring against France, and flanker Sean O’Brien, who is serving a suspension. The Pumas, meanwhile, are showing more attacking flair than ever and have only struggled in one game in the tournament — a loss to the All Blacks. \nAUSTRALIA vs. SCOTLAND (Sunday, 8 a.m. PT) \nThe Wallabies are strong favourites after topping a group containing Wales and England, and facing a Scotland team that lost every match in the Six Nations tournament, plus struggled to hold off Sa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:12:53.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
