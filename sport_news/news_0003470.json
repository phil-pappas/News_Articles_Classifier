The boys ran first and girls second. \nLincolnville runners and coaches wore a little foot with the letter K on it to represent team member and eighth-grader Kristina Kelly, who was unable to participate in her final race due to a medical issue. Kelly is the girls team's second fastest runner and a key member of the LCS coed soccer team. \nKelly was on hand to cheer on her teammates. \nBesides those from Lincolnville, many youngsters and their teams, in a geographically area from Searsport to Boothbay, performed well on the course, which included downhill starts and finishes, woods, long straight stretches near marshes and a few challenging hills. \nVideo, complete individual and team results and links to more photos from the championship meet will appear later with this story. \nThe league includes teams from Troy Howard Middle School of Belfast, Searsport District Middle School, Islesboro Central School, Medomak Middle School of Waldoboro, Great Salt Bay of Damariscotta, Camden-Rockport Middle School, Appleton Village School, Oceanside West of Thomaston/Rockland, St. George Elementary School, Boothbay Elementary Region School and Lincolnville Central School. \nDuring the regular season, there were 11 meets at 11 sites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:38:23.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
