After all, who had more job security than Cooper’s now former head coach Steve Spurrier? Spurrier stepped down and resigned on his own accord after the Gamecocks lost to LSU Oct. 10. “It was definitely kind of different, weird,” Cooper said. “We are all just trying to stay positive I think and have some new energy starting off with a new coach and stay focused on trying to win games.” The new coach, for now, is former Gamecocks’ offensive line coach Shawn Elliott. He led the Gamecocks to a win his first outing last week, a 19-10 over Vanderbilt. Cooper said Elliott resonates well with the players. “He’s cool, always excited to coach people up and he has a lot of energy and he loves football,” Cooper said. That task of winning, and the one of making a bowl game, becomes tougher for Elliott over the Gamecocks’ five games to finish the season. South Carolina finishes at Texas A&M on Halloween, at Tennessee, versus Florida, versus The Citadel and versus Clemson. “We aren’t even really thinking about that (making a bowl game) right now, just focused on A&M,” Cooper said. While South Carolina has struggled at 3-4, Cooper has continued to put up stats and do his thing. He has caught 40 passes for 587 yards and four touchdowns. The past few weeks have been eventful for Cooper, going to school in a city impacted by flooding from Hurricane Joaquin and playing for the first time at LSU’s Tiger Stadium. “It was cool, it wasn’t fully packed because we moved the game from our place, but it was a great experience,” Cooper said of playing at LSU. Cooper also added that he did not get to do a lot of helping with the flood as he was too busy with football. Another decision looming quite large for Cooper is the one at the end of the year – return for his senior season or head to the NFL. He said the loss of Spurrier won’t have much of an impact either way. “Nah I don’t think it will matter too much,” he said. “That’s a decision for my family and me to make, before and after coach left.” Jordan Honeycutt can be reached at 252-635-5670 and you can follow him on Twitter @JHoneycuttNBSJ By Jordan Honeycutt, Sports Writer New Bern Sun Journal By Jordan Honeycutt, Sports Writer Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 8:13 PM Updated at 8:14 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:07:45.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
