That means updated win and loss records and a change in the bowl opponents the Cats could face if they win two more games. Without further ado, here are your updated bowl games from the national media: \nESPN’s Mark Schlabach : Liberty Bowl Vs Kansas State (Saturday, January 2, 3:30 p.m, ESPN, Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, Memphis,TN) \nESPN’s Brett McMurphy : Belk Bowl vs. Duke (Wednesday, December 30, 3:30 p.m., ESPN, Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, NC) \nCBS Sports’ Jerry Palm : Belk Bowl Vs. Virginia Tech (Wednesday, December 30, 3:30 p.m., ESPN, Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, NC) \nSB Nation’s Jason Kirk : TaxSlayer Bowl vs. Penn State (Saturday, January 2, 12:00 p.m., EverBank Field, Jacksonville, FL) \nFootball.com : Music City Bowl Vs. Wisconsin (Wednesday, December 30, 7:00 p.m., Nissan Stadium, Nashville,TN) \nThoughts? As fun as a trip to Jacksonville in early January would be, I’ve got my fingers crossed for a match-up with the Badgers in Music City. First, its a chance to end the year with some revenge for the Final Four loss. Second, its Nashville on the day before New Years Eve. Please football Gods make this happen!
