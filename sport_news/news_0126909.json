(AP) - The group backing Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential bid is sending 40 volunteers from Ohio to New Hampshire this weekend to campaign on his behalf.\nIt's the latest example of how outside money groups are boosting the 2016 campaigns.\nThe effort by New Day for America is among the most significant displays of on-the-ground action by a super PAC in New Hampshire. Group spokesman Connie Wehrkamp says the group and an ally also plan to spend $11.5 million on television ads through New Hampshire's February primary election.\nSuper PACs backing some of Kasich's Republican rivals, like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have concentrated their money on TV ads rather than on-the-ground efforts.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:08:40.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
