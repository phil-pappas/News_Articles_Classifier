What the Raiders (19-2, 12-2 CCC) didn't expect was the gift they received due to what transpired a couple hundred miles north. That's where Northwest (Wash.) pulled off a five-set stunner against No. 7 Eastern Oregon to give the Mountaineers their first conference loss and put the Raiders right back in the hunt for a title. Emma Gasman led the Raiders with 10 kills on just 13 attacks, giving her 22 kills on 33 tries on the weekend. Lauren McGowne dropped 41 assists and four digs, Tyana Andrews had eight kills and eight digs, Nila Lukens had a career-high eight kills and Ashlyn Flynn corralled 18 digs. SOU hit .367 as a team, its best average since a .386 effort Sept. 19 of last year at Warner Pacific. Multnomah, which is now 0-for-42 in CCC sets during its first year as a member of the NAIA, got 11 kills from Miranda Halverson. The Lions led only after the first point of the second set. Gasman also assisted four of SOU's six blocks. The Raiders have four conference matches remaining, all at home, starting with next Friday's 3 p.m. tilt against Walla Walla. Should they win their next two, they'll be in position to force a first-place tie when Eastern Oregon comes to town Oct. 31. SOU and EOU were conference co-champions last season. Cross Country LEWIS & CLARK INVITE : At Estacada, Ray Schireman and Jessa Perkinson paced the Southern Oregon University cross country teams, along with the rest of the men's and women's fields at the Lewis & Clark Invite. Top-ranked SOU had half of the top-12 finishers in the 126-person men's 8,000-meter race at McIver park, led by Schireman's win in 24 minutes 52.3 seconds. Jared Hixon was third (24:57.9), Connor Cushman fifth (25:14.9), Trevor Lynneighth (25:30.1) and Zach Boyd-Helm ninth (25:30.1). Also contributing to the Raiders' point total were 12th-place Eli Stillman (25:55.7) and 17th-place Ryan Alexander (26:08.4). SOU totaled just 26 points to easily clear Puget Sound (117) and Whitman (119) for the team victory. The 17th-ranked Raider women were second to Whitworth in the team standings — nine teams competed in all — but Jessa Perkinson blew out the rest of the field individually in the 6K. She hit the finish line in 21:55.4, beating second-place Katie McKay of Whitworth by a full 33 seconds. Rebecca Lupescu placed seventh in 22:50.3 for the Raiders, whose other scorers were Margarita Lauer (28th, 24:02.3), Aspen Abbott (35th, 24:15.2), Marisa D'Orfani (40th, 24:28.8) and Braana Weber (44th, 24:36.6). Whitworth, which amassed 30 points to SOU's 97, had five runners in the top ten. Both Raider squads will race for the third straight week next Friday at Oregon State's Beaver Classic.
