The most-popular and powerful U.S. sports league, revenues at the NFL topped $12 billion last year.\nBut the co-chairman of the NFL's head, neck and spine committee, Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, said the conference is meant to help fill in gaps in an area of medicine where a lot about concussions remains unknown.\n\"It is accelerating the research because... when you get a lot of scientists in a room you get a lot of controversy and discussion so the science is just better,\" Ellenbogen, also chairman of neurological surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told Reuters.\nFifteen different organizations will be represented in London, including the world soccer governing body FIFA, Australian Rules Football, World Rugby, the Canadian Football League and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports.\nAlso sending officials are the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\nThe conference is being held ahead of an NFL game in London on Sunday between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars.\nSome critics said the NFL conference is a marketing bid to shape how the public views an issue that is still unfolding.\n\"What they're attempting to do is create a body of opinion and body of literature that tells the public that these concussions are manageable ... short-term problems,\" said Michael Kaplen, an attorney specializing in traumatic brain injuries who teaches at George Washington Law School, and a long-time critic of the NFL's science around the subject.\nWhile Ellenbogen acknowledges the criticism is fair, he said the leagues must fight their biases to protect the athletes' health.\nMiller said player safety is a top priority for the NFL, pointing to 39 rules changes over the past decade related to player safety and a 34 percent decline in concussions in the league over the last three years. The NFL has awarded more than $135 million in grants over the same period related to research on player safety.\nThe league and players union estimate that 30 percent of former players will develop brain conditions such as Alzheimer's or a less debilitating form of dementia.\nMost sports leagues have been caught \"flat footed\" by the concussion issue, said Ohio University sports business professor Robert Boland.\nIn addition to the NFL, lawsuits have been filed in recent years against FIFA, the NHL and the NCAA. Even on the youth level the issue has gained prominence.\nU.S. President Barack Obama and National Basketball Association all-star LeBron James are among those who have said they would not allow their children to play pro football due to the dangers from head trauma.\nSeveral suicides by former NFL players, including Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau in 2012, garnered public attention. Last month, a study released by the Concussion Legacy Foundation found all but four of 91 former NFL players who donated their brains for research were diagnosed with a disease linked to concussions and head trauma.\n(Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Jill Serjeant and Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:52:54.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
