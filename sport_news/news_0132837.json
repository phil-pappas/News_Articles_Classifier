Caption (Dan Voitik for Shaw Media) Morris' Nathan Guth runs through the line in a 23-7 loss to Kaneland on Friday night. By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – In Friday’s 23-7 loss against Kaneland, things started out well for the Morris football team. Kaneland received the opening kickoff, and the Redskins’ Jake Webb made a diving interception at the Morris 10-yard line.

On the next play, the two teamed up again in a decidedly unconventional manner. \nGuth ran up the middle, was hit and the ball squirted free, bouncing toward the right side of the field. Balentine came in from his slot position and picked it up, running the remaining 30 yards for a touchdown and a 7-0 Morris lead after Collin Tucker’s extra point. It seemed to be a good omen, as the Redskins had scored nearly exactly the same way in an earlier win over Sterling, except that time Feeney picked up the loose ball instead of Balentine. \nAgainst Sterling, however, the Morris offense kept the momentum going. Against Kaneland, Morris’ first touchdown also was its the last. \nThe starting field position on the first drive was a sign of things to come. Of the 12 times Morris had the ball, eight started at its own 20 or worse. The Redskins’ average starting field position was their own 22. That, in turn, led to good field position for Kaneland, as did three interceptions, a fumble returned for a touchdown and a sack in the end zone that resulted in a safety. \n“We had a good opening drive,” Morris coach Alan Thorson said. “We drive 90 yards and get a touchdown. That’s great. Even the drive after that, we missed a field goal, but I can live with that. It was still a good drive and we were in a position to score. \n“After that, though, we really struggled to block, both in the running and passing games. We made way too many mistakes. Even though our offense has had its ups and downs this season, we haven’t had a lot of turnovers and have done a pretty good job of protecting the ball. Tonight, the turnovers were a killer.” \nThe first turnover was a pass intercepted by Kaneland’s Matthew Redman at midfield, returned to the Redskin 22. \nTwo plays later, the Knights’ Jake Marczuk hit Tanner Robertsen with a 22-yard touchdown pass to tie the score. \nMorris had a pair of interceptions of its own in the first half, by Webb and Guth, but both were deep in their own territory. \n“I thought our defense played very well,” Thorson said. “The points on the board weren’t an indication of our defense. Two of their scores, the fumble return and the safety, came when our offense was on the field, so I don’t fault our defense at all. We have really played well defensively all year. \n“Now, our backs are against the wall. We have to win our next two games. There’s no quit in these kids and we will get right back to work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:44:39.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
