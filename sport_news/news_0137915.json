Dave Hyde Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Columnist Steve Ross says Dolphins' issues \"can't get worse.\" But they can, Dave Hyde writes: \nAt the end of another day that couldn't end quickly enough, Dolphins owner Steve Ross left the quiet of another losers locker room and said to a member of his suited entourage, \"Well, it can't get worse than that.\" \nHe then walked out dejectedly of Wembley Stadium, pausing only to say, no, he didn't want to take questions about his looming decisions. And that's fine. Words are empty now anyhow. \nIt's nine months past time for action by Ross, really, but Sunday's 27-14 loss offered an international platform for all the fundamental reasons Joe Philbin is a nice man and not much of a NFL head coach. \nLimited offense. Poor defense. Costly penalties. No answers. And to the larger point about Ross' gallows humor, it can get worse. Much worse. The season's playoff goal is gone, the easiest scheduling stretch is over, there are 12 games to go and by Philbin's admission the players' effort isn't there. \n\"Not all the time, not yet,\" he said. \nIf the effort's not there by now, when? If the fourth game in a fourth season isn't enough to instill a fundamental bar of effort, how will it suddenly appear in the coming weeks? And which unit needs it more? \nCheck all the images from the Miami Dolphins' second year in a row visiting London. \nThe offense is the least productive in the league at 14.4 points per game. Sunday showed why. The Jets used a cornerback blitz 22 times, the most by a NFL team in five years, according to ESPN Stats. \nCornerback Buster Skrine blitzed four straight plays in the second half, resulting in four straight incompletions. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill either didn't recognize Skrine even by the fourth time or the offense wasn't coached up to figure how to attack it. So the Jets kept bringing it. \nAnd the defense? It needed three Jets snaps to fall behind, 7-0, where it took five plays the previous week against Buffalo. The Dolphins were gashed for 166 yards by Jets running back Chris Ivory, which might push them from 31st to worst in the league against the run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:40:54.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
