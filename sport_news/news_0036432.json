From there, we have little takes when we just have to make the fundamental play.\" \nZiska will tell you it keeps her team steady throughout a match, which is what helped the Lions take a 25-14, 25-23, 25-23 decision on the night. On the other side of the net, end-game just doesn't go as well. \nTVHS coach Nathan Fristed said his team has improved every facet of the game physically since the season started. Mentally, the Eagles still lag at times defensively or remaining calm when the offense is out of system. \n\"We just get tight right around 18s, and then it's a couple of errors,\" Fristed said. \"It's not even big runs anymore. Early in the season we let them have some big runs, but each team, we've cut it down. But now it's a 2-point, 3-point run at 18, at 20, and all the sudden, we're fighting uphill when there's no uphill left.\" Advertisement \nThe Mountain Lions took the opening set without much of a challenge, using six aces and serving tough in general, keeping the Eagles out of their offensive sets. Close at the midpoint, the Lions scored three straight to push the lead to 18-13, then followed that up by scoring the final six in the match, with Gabriella Quezada acing the Eagles, followed by a Caylee Boman kill. \nMVHS coach Kaitlyn Schiffelbein knew from the earlier meeting that the service line was the one place the Lions could really set a tone, and she was more than happy with the approach. \n\"From seeing them earlier in the season, we know they have some talented hitters, and when they're in system, they make things work very nicely,\" she said. \"So we wanted to give them tough serves, get them out of system and make them set the back row more often than the front row, not let them go to the go-to hitters every single time.\" \nThe remaining two sets were tight all the way through, with neither team able to pull away. Thompson Valley relied on the hitting of Taylor Sharp (12 kills) and a strong block (11 as a team), led by eight (one solo, seven assists) from Alayna Sheldon, who the team affectionately refers to as Inspector Gadget because of her arm reach. \nIn each set, Thompson Valley fought back to cut the Mountain View lead to 24-23, and in each case, it was a Racquel Valdez kill that sealed the set. Valdez led the team with eight kills, with Boman adding six. \n\"I think we just need a little more perseverance in our playing,\" said TVHS setter Gwen Sheldon, who finished with 20 assists. \"We tend to shut down with each other, and I think we just need to stay true to the team, play together.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:13:29.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
