(File/AP Photo/Anderson Independent-Mail, Mark Crammer) × \nCLEMSON – Seven wrap-up notes and quotes from Saturday night’s postgame locker room, when Clemson’s 24-22 win over Notre Dame proves the Tigers’ claim they belong in the national title conversation holds water: \n1) Fickle crowd, these people called fans. Tony Elliott could do no wrong his first two games at the controls, orchestrating perfect gameplans last December vs. Oklahoma and Sept. 5 vs. Wofford. \nThen Appalachian State was a little bit of rough goings, though ultimately excusable with a second-quarter explosion of touchdowns. The Louisville trip led to even more concern, and then Saturday’s win over Notre Dame even more, though Clemson has not yet paid in the form of a loss. \nIt’s fair to suggest Clemson got a bit conservative with the play-calling Saturday, comfortable to play with a lead and let the defense do the dirty work without making life any easier for Notre Dame. To that end, the plan was successful in that Clemson only committed one turnover – Deshaun Watson’s deep throw to the end zone intended for Charone Peake – and Notre Dame couldn’t cobble enough points in the time it had to mount a furious fourth-quarter rally. \nThe Tigers’ offense had six three-and-outs Saturday, and mustered just 144 yards in the second half. Its final three drives went 4, 8 and 6 yards on three plays each. \n“Obviously there was a concern with the weather. I think the rain picked up there in the beginning of the fourth quarter,” Elliott explained. “But we were having a good rhythm running the ball. We didn’t want to take the ball out of (Wayne Gallman’s) hand or (Watson’s) hand. The ball had been on the ground a couple times. Obviously we dropped a touchdown when we had a shot there in the end zone. But we were having some rhythm running the football. We put it on the backs and came up short a couple times. But overall, we had good success running the ball.” \nWatson had just 96 passing yards, and Clemson won with less than 100 passing yards for the first time since 1998. \n“We probably could have taken more (chances), but we just go with the flow of the game,” Watson said. “I just go with whatever Coach Elliott and Coach (Jeff) Scott want to call. We managed the game pretty well, especially against a top team that everyone thought was going to walk in and dominate us.” \n2) Watson called Clemson’s defense “one of the best in the country”, and didn’t sound too alarmed with his team getting outgained by 141 yards on its own field. \n“It wasn’t anything we struggled on. We didn’t execute our plays,” Watson said. “We had two dropped touchdowns, one to Artavis (Scott) and Charone kind of faded away on that one. So we could have went up 35-3. We just didn’t execute at the time, and the second half, we just milked the clock.” \nWatson did have a postgame message for Notre Dame cornerback KeiVarae Russell, who said two weeks ago he didn’t regard Watson as a top-five quarterback nationally. \n“I talked to him after the game. He just said we were trying to fire up the game,” Watson said. “But it is what it is. I don’t really care about anyone else’s opinion. My focus is this team and the next game, and that’s Georgia Tech.” \n3) Meanwhile, in the team meeting room at his postgame press conference, head coach Dabo Swinney had something to say, in an opening statement captured on video by TigerNet.com. \n“The media didn’t give us much of a chance in this game,” Swinney said. “The last 38 years, if you did a poll that said who’s had the most wins between Clemson and Notre Dame the last 38 years, you’d be wrong. Clemson’s had more wins, more bowl wins, more top-25 finishes. My message to the team was, just be Clemson. Don’t buy the lie.” \nSwinney then referenced the remarks of CBS College Sports commentator Aaron Taylor, a former Notre Dame offensive lineman who apparently had his own fighting words going into the game. Swinney took the last words. \n“I don’t know who Aaron Taylor is, I guess he’s an analyst or a commentator. The comment was we weren’t going to be ready. The word was our crowd was going to be ‘lugubrious’ when the game was over. I don’t know how to spell that. I’m hooked on phonics. But I did look it up. Lugubrious means, ‘to look sad and disappointed.’ \n“So I want to wish Notre Dame and their lugubrious fans safe travels back to South Bend, and we will show up in 2020. We look forward to that trip. I appreciate the education that we got this week, the vocab lesson. Our players, the first thing they said to me in the locker room, was the leprechaun looked a little lugubrious. But at the end of the day, it’s not about who we play, it’s about Clemson.” \n4) More on Clemson’s motivation: ESPN NFL Draft analyst Todd McShay wrote last week as an advance to the Notre Dame-Clemson game that “10 of our top 150 draft-eligible prospects will be playing in this game on Saturday, and all 10 of them will be wearing gold helmets.” \nAs one could imagine, that didn’t sit well with Clemson’s draft-eligible defenders like defensive end Shaq Lawson, cornerback Mackensie Alexander and safety Jayron Kearse among a few others. \n“That had me hungry. That had me amped. I was mad about the situation,” said Lawson, who had 3.5 tackles for loss in the first quarter while matched up with Notre Dame left tackle Ronnie Stanley, whom McShay projects to be the No. 10 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. \n“I kept that in my head all week. I just feel like we had to come out there, our 10 best players had to step up better than their 10 best players, and I feel like we did that.” \nOne more from the disrespect department: Notre Dame receiver Will Fuller sent a semi-vague tweet last week saying it was going to be “savage” in Death Valley, which Clemson players took as a personal challenge. \nAfter Clemson stopped Notre Dame on a 2-point conversion to all but seal its victory, “I said a few words to Will Fuller,” Lawson said. “I said, yeah, it’s savage in Clemson, ain’t it? We just had a little talk. They weren’t ready for this environment. It was a great game between two great teams.” \n5) Dabo Swinney is now 6-4 against top-10 opponents . The records against top-10 foes for other coaches: Gus Malzahn 4-5, Kevin Sumlin 4-5, Jimbo Fisher 5-4, David Shaw 6-6, Mark Dantonio 6-10, Hugh Freeze 4-8, Art Briles 4-13, Mike Gundy 4-12 and Bret Bielema 3-15. \n6) According to an email from ESPN, College Gameday’s broadcast Saturday morning from rainy Bowman Field was the program’s highest-rated edition since late 2013. Ratings were also up 45 percent from the week 5 broadcast in 2014, which just happened to be hosted in Columbia, S.C. for the Missouri-South Carolina game. \n7) The final word from Clemson wide receiver Artavis Scott : what is Clemson’s potential going forward, if the offense and defense are playing to their capabilities? \n“It’s scary. Once we put it all together, it’s going to be hard to stop us,” Scott said. “It’s like a puzzle. We’re just putting it together, and when we put it together, we’re going to be scary.” \n-AB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:33:15.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
