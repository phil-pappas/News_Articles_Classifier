Michel Platini might never even get there. \nTwo of the most powerful men in soccer were handed 90-day suspensions by the FIFA ethics committee on Thursday, essentially ending Blatter’s 17-year reign as president and likely stunting Platini’s chances of replacing him. \nBoth Blatter and Platini, former allies who turned into rivals in the buildup to the most recent FIFA presidential election, have become embroiled in a Swiss criminal investigation. Blatter has been labeled a suspect and questioned by authorities, while Platini was said to be somewhere between a witness and a suspect. Both maintain their innocence. \n\"President Blatter looks forward to the opportunity to present evidence that will demonstrate that he did not engage in any misconduct, criminal or otherwise,\" Blatter’s lawyer, Richard Cullen, said in a statement. \nPlatini also pledged to fight the decision, calling the allegations against him \"astonishingly vague\" in a statement sent from UEFA hours after the Frenchman was banned from working as the body’s president. \n\"I want everyone to know my state of mind: more than a sense of injustice or a desire for revenge, I am driven by a profound feeling of staunch defiance,\" Platini said.\nThe statement from UEFA, which stressed \"its full confidence\" in Platini, has exposed the body’s officials to potential action under FIFA ethics rules. According to UEFA statutes, Platini should have been replaced by Angel Maria Villar, the highest-ranking vice president.\nLIVERPOOL NAMES KLOPP: Juergen Klopp is headed to Liverpool to take over as manager of the Premier League club. Brendan Rodgers was fired Sunday following an 18-month slump since nearly winning the Premier League title in 2014. \nKlopp, one of the most respected and charismatic coaches in Europe, left Dortmund at the end of last season after guiding the club to two German league titles and a Champions League final.\nMESSI MESS: Lionel Messi will stand trial in Spain on three counts of tax fraud. Court documents made public said a judge has rejected a request to clear the Barcelona player from wrongdoing and decided to charge him and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:04.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
