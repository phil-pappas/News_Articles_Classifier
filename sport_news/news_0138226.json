PHOTO BY CLINT COLE/DALLAS COUNTY NEWS \nBy Clint Cole \nSports Editor \nOn a normal day at Creston High School the first bell rings to start the school day at 8:10 every morning and the final bell to end the school day rings at 3:15 in the afternoon. \nHours before that 8:10 a.m. bell, Camryn Somers, a student at Creston High School, is in the pool at the Creston YMCA doing the same morning workouts as the rest of her team, only her teammates aren’t with her. That’s because the rest of her team is in the pool at the Waukee Family YMCA before the school day starts. \nWhen the final bell rings at 3:15 p.m. to let the Creston students out of school, Somers has already been gone for 45 minutes. This is because she has to drive about an hour one way to be a part of the Waukee swimming team, something she has been doing now for four years. \nIt has been a family commitment for Somers’s family, says Waukee girls’ swimming coach Shelley Twigg, who has been her high school coach for four years now. \n“When she was a freshman and a sophomore her mom had to drive her to and from (practice) every single day,” said Twigg. “And then we have morning practices on Saturdays and so she would normally spend the night with one of the high school girls on Friday night so she could get up and be at practice at 6 a.m. on Saturday morning and then her mom would come and get her and drive her home. Her mom or her dad.” \nDuring her freshman and sophomore years on the Waukee swimming team, Somers’s mother Deb, a stay-at-home mom, would drive her to practice and to meets while her father Matt, who used to own Precision Optical, would attend her two brothers’ athletic activities during swimming season. \nHer two brothers are Kyle, 16, a junior in high school and Kainen, 21, a junior in college. \nEvery day during the swimming season, Somers deals with needing to leave school early and having to do homework at night and she says it’s gotten harder for her personally since she has been old enough to drive herself to practice. \n“It was fine when my mom drove me up here because I could do my homework on the way here and on the way back,” said Somers. “But now that I drive myself I get home around 7:30 and I have to eat and do two to three hours worth of homework and then get to bed and wake up the next morning and do it all again.” \nDuring two-a-days at the beginning of the season, Twigg said that Somers basically lives with Annie Whitehead’s family for a whole week so that she can be at practices in the morning and in the afternoon every day. \n“She comes to morning (practice) and she goes home with that family,” said Twigg. “All the team’s family have just embraced her and she spends the night when she needs to.” \nIf she wasn’t able to stay with teammates on Friday nights and during two-a-days, Somers said she would need to wake up at 4 a.m. to get to morning practices on Saturdays and at the beginning of the year. \nClicking instantly \nFor many athletes who have to come in and compete in a sport at a different school than the one they attend, it may be hard for them to be able to click with the team or find ways to get to know them. \nThis was not the case for Somers. This is in part because she got to know some of the players and assistant coach Dan Briggs while swimming in the club system and in part because of her personality and who she is. \n“She is like sunshine… Everybody loves her,” said Twigg. “She can adapt to any situation. She is a phenomenal swimmer but she’s really humble and I think that’s where we would’ve gotten into a problem. \n“If she came from another school and was the best swimmer… but had and arrogant attitude, or didn’t give 110 percent or the girls wondered ‘is she really working out at Creston YMCA?’ I think we would’ve had a lot of issues but she’s so trustworthy and self-driven and responsible.” \nTwigg said that with someone different doing what Somers does, they “probably would have” had problems, but with Somers there have been none and that she has become a leader for the Warriors. \nDuring her time swimming for the Creston YMCA team before she was in high school, Briggs talked to Somers a lot and even let Creston use some swimmers for relay teams when they didn’t have enough to compete and that’s how she got to know the Waukee swimmers. \n“I kind of knew most of the girls, which is actually why I picked Waukee to swim in high school for, is because I knew most of the team anyways,” said Somers. \nWhen they knew that she would be competing for Waukee in high school, Twigg asked her to start swimming for the Waukee Rays, the club team in Waukee, when she was in eighth grade to help her get to know some of the girls on the team as well and that helped her fit in right away when she was a freshman. \nIn addition to her staying the night with her teammates on Friday nights for Saturday morning practice, Somers said that they have team sleepovers on Saturday nights and she usually stays in Waukee for those. She said there have even been times that the team has gone to her home in Creston for team sleepovers. \nDuring her time at Waukee, Atlantic High School started a swimming team. The Atlantic YMCA is about five miles closer to Creston High School than the Waukee YMCA but she was grandfathered into the Waukee team and didn’t have to switch to a new team. \nDisaster strikes \nSomers already has to make special arrangements and go the extra mile to compete for the Waukee girls’ swimming team, but it was never more difficult than in 2012, her freshman year. \nA Tornado hit the city of Creston and damaged the YMCA there, leaving her with no pool to do her morning workouts in before school. \n“That was a huge stumbling block for us because she didn’t have anywhere to swim in the morning,” said Twigg. \nDuring her entire freshman swimming season in the Fall of 2012, Somers did the morning workouts and team practice with the Warriors in the afternoon. She and Twigg said that she would try to do as much of the workout as possible while the junior varsity team was still in the pool before the varsity team started regular practice. \n“I just never finished the morning workout because right when I got here I’d get in the pool and get as much as I could done until we started the next practice and she (Twigg) didn’t want to keep me here any later than I already was here,” said Somers. \nSince the YMCA in Creston has been repaired and she has gotten back to the usual routine the last three years, Twigg said she never doubts that she is doing the workouts on her own and never asks for any proof that she is doing them. \nTwigg said that sometimes Somers goes above and beyond, even when the rest of the team isn’t able to get through the whole workout due to time constraints in the morning. \n“There are times when I would text her and say ‘hey, we didn’t get through all of this workout so if you only want to half of it,’ and she’s like ‘oh, I’m finishing it, Shell,’” said Twigg. “And she’s like ‘I have time, I’m going to do it all.’ I mean she’s that kind. \n“It was obvious from the very beginning that she’s just super athletic and driven and wants to do her best that I don’t even doubt it.” \nLeading to the future \nIt seems that Somers and Waukee have both benefitted by the circumstances that have brought Somers to the team. She has qualified for the State Meet for three straight years and she will be shooting for her fourth straight this season. \nSomers was a member of the State Championship 200 yard medley relay team last year along with Maddy Bridges, Zoe Bussanmas and Maddie Gehrke. They finished the race with a time of 1:46.57 in the finals, helping Waukee take seventh place as a team at the State Meet. \nSomers also took 15th place in the 50 yard freestyle with a time of 24.59 seconds, helped the 200 yard freestyle relay to a third-place finish and helped the 400 yard freestyle relay to a 13th-place finish at last year’s State Meet. \nSomers said that what she wants to take away from this experience with the Waukee girls’ swimming team is to “definitely swim in college” after she graduates from Creston High School. \n“I’ve been going on recruiting trips these last three months and I’m kind of, finally, deciding where I want to go,” said Somers. “I definitely did it to swim in college, not just to drive up here to work my butt off and just enjoy it, I guess.” \nWhile she has her college choice narrowed down to two schools: Wingate (N.C.) or University of Nebraska, Omaha, up first is the rest of this season, which includes the Regional Meet and a potential fourth straight State Meet appearance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:08:28.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
