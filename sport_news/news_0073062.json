(AP) - Triple Crown champion American Pharoah had a six-furlong workout at Santa Anita as part of the preparation for his final career race in the $5 million Breeders' Cup Classic next week. \nWith jockey Martin Garcia aboard, the colt was timed in 1:10.80 for the distance Tuesday. \nTrainer Bob Baffert calls it the \"last serious drill of his life.\" He says American Pharoah \"looked fantastic.\" \nIn his previous start, American Pharoah finished second in the Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 29. Baffert says the colt needed a 60-day break before the Classic because he runs well off a long layoff. \nThe colt is scheduled to work again Monday at Santa Anita before being flown to Keeneland on Tuesday. Among his expected rivals in the Classic at Keeneland on Oct. 31 is Santa Anita-based Beholder. \nAmerican Pharoah is set to retire to stud duty after the BC Classic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:54:26.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
