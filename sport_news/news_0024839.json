Amid the hubbub of the Eagles' locker room, Maxwell finds moments to stretch. He does yoga whenever he can - when he wakes up in the morning, in the hotel room on the night before games, in the idle moments between practice and meetings. He finds classes after the workday.\nDuring his four years with the Seattle Seahawks, Maxwell spent time at a local yoga studio that partnered with the team. Other players tagged along, but Maxwell often was there alone with middle-aged women. When it was a \"good class,\" Maxwell said, he never noticed the other women in the room.\n\"Every now and then,\" Maxwell said with a laugh, \"I'd take a look.\"\nThat laugh is a distinguishing characteristic. It endears Maxwell to teammates. It also perplexed fans who saw footage of Maxwell chuckling after the Eagles' season-opening loss. But it's part of his personality. He learned from his grandmother that the \"humble child takes the grace,\" and he reminds himself of that motto \"before I blow up.\"\nMore coverage VOTE: Who will win Giants-Eagles game?

Eagles. Giants. View results But his every move is watched in Philadelphia, in part because he's the Eagles' top cornerback and also because the six-year, $63 year million contract he signed in March made him one of the NFL's highest-paid players at the position. He was signed to help solve the Eagles' defensive back woes and for assignments like the one he could have Monday night against New York Giants star receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\nMaxwell's first month in Philadelphia was inconsistent, with the low point coming when Atlanta's Julio Jones beat him for two touchdowns in the season-opening loss. But Maxwell has improved each week, and he's coming off what defensive coordinator Bill Davis labeled \"one of his better games.\" If Beckham is in the lineup on Monday, the Eagles cannot afford a step backward from their high-priced cornerback.\n\"The expectations are so high when you sign a contract like that,\" Davis said. \"I think right now, he's feeling comfortable in our system. I'm learning him, we are learning him, and we are using him in the best way, and I think every week you'll see him climb and climb and be better and better.\"\nThe learning curve The biggest change for Maxwell has been Davis' reducing his responsibilities. Davis is now more familiar with Maxwell, and Maxwell better understands the scheme. So Davis knows how often to use Maxwell in press situations, how often to play him off the receivers, and in which scenarios Maxwell plays best.\n\"I had him doing a lot of different things,\" Davis said. \"And I think by limiting that and letting him settle into the defense first before he moved too fast forward, is benefiting him. And again, it's a learning process. All free agents, I don't care how long they have been in the league, there's a learning curve from the coaches learning the player and the player learning the system, and I think we are going in a great direction with Max on that.\"\nMaxwell is still learning the defense. He left the game early in Week 4 against Washington, so he's only played four full games. The targets against Maxwell have decreased from 10 to nine to six to four. He allowed only two catches for 39 yards last week, according to Pro Football Focus.\nOf course, he didn't play a wide receiver like Beckham last week. And if Beckham plays - as the Eagles expect - and is on the right side - he plays both sides - then Maxwell will be tasked with covering Beckham, just as he did Jones and Brandon Marshall earlier this season.\n\"You know it's going to come, you know [Eli Manning] is going to throw the ball,\" Maxwell said. \"It's one of those days as a DB you look forward to.\"\nMaxwell's contract created expectations, even though the contract was more a function of the cornerback marketplace than his skills. But Maxwell has not shied away from what comes with the deal.\nMaxwell was unabashed during the summer about his desire to be considered one of the NFL's elite cornerbacks. He said he wants to be remembered as \"one of the great winners\" of the NFL. After changing teams during the offseason, that can only happen if he can transform the Eagles into contenders.\nHe's already transformed himself from a sixth-round pick to a top cornerback - a process that started when he first tried yoga as a senior at Clemson.\n'My body just changed' Maxwell knew he was an NFL prospect during his last year in college, but he was not sure at what position. He was always tall, but Maxwell kept adding muscle to his 6-foot-1 frame. With all the muscle mass, he was not as flexible as top cornerbacks.\n\"Where I was headed, I was going to safety,\" Maxwell said. \"I couldn't bend as I should as a corner.\"\nHe explored ways to become more flexible. Yoga was the best path. He didn't do much at first. Then he went to Seattle, where there were free classes.\n\"When I can go for free,\" Maxwell said, \"I was getting into it more.\"\nThe most growth came after his second year in the league. The Seahawks lost in the second round of the playoffs, and Maxwell spent 21/2 months on the yoga mat. When he returned, teammates wondered why he looked taller even though he hadn't grown.\n\"My body just changed,\" Maxwell said. \"I got leaner. I got more long. My limbs grew. I don't know what happened.\"\nWhat happened was the benefit of yoga, Maxwell claimed. The Seahawks inserted Maxwell into the starting lineup that season and won the Super Bowl. He credited yoga with keeping him healthy and transforming him into a top-level cornerback.\n\"Maxwell came into the NFL stiff - literally,\" former Seahawks teammate Richard Sherman wrote on theMMQB.com last year. \"He couldn't touch his toes while standing. . . . He even finds a way to do [yoga] in road cities. Sometimes before he goes to bed on the road he'll do the poses right there in the room.\"\nMaxwell laughed at that account - he said he could touch his toes - but he conceded his flexibility is much better now than when he arrived in Seattle. He had hamstring problems then; now, he's more lean. He doesn't feel as stiff.\nIt helps his mental health, too. The breathing exercises clear his mind.\n\"That [stuff] locks you in,\" he said.\nHe goes to studios around Philadelphia - from Northern Liberties to the Navy Yard. He'll find them on the Internet or from trainers in the weight room and takes time after work or on the team's off day.\nConnor Barwin's locker is next to Maxwell's, and when Maxwell first started his yoga poses in the locker room, Barwin asked him how long Maxwell would stay in a position. Barwin no longer asks; it's three minutes. And he knows there's a reason Maxwell does it.\n\"It's a small sign,\" Barwin said. \"It shows he's trying to get ready for practice the next day already. It's good to see.\"\nBefore Maxwell goes to bed, he watches game film. When he wakes up, he does yoga. It's helped him become one of the five highest-paid cornerbacks in the NFL and the Eagles' best hope at stopping at a top wide receiver like Beckham. And when he bends the way a player his size shouldn't, he knows why he's able to do it. He wants others to join him in the yoga studio to learn, too.\n\"They see that it helps,\" Maxwell said. \"Even if it doesn't help, it doesn't hurt to try.\"\nzberman@phillynews.com\n@ZBerm", "external_links": ["http://polls.clickability.com/polls", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:12:32.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
