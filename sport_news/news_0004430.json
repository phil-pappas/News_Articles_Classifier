You're out there in that position, you're either going to play with patience or you're going to play with panic. That's something we like to say. He kept his cool, he was patient. He timed up the right time and he pushed the guy out.\"\nThe words \"patient\" and \"cool\" tend to be more associated with billiards, not with a game like football which is most associated with controlled aggression and speed.\nThe play was uncommon in how it was executed but not by any means something new to the game. Players are just usually pushed out of bounds before they can get their feet down, especially in fades in the end zone.\nRichards, a rookie out of Stanford, relied on an increased awareness to the pro game. Coming into the Jacksonville game, he was one of the players wearing a black jersey, which designates the team's practice player of the week.\n\"It's all about taking our installs from the class to the grass,\" Richards said. \"It's easy to talk X's and O's and I'll be here on film, but you've got to be able to apply that on the field in the heat of the moment. That's just the thing I'm trying to focus on every week.\"\nIt had to come along a little slower for Richards. He was late to organized team activities in the spring because he was finishing his degree in public policy at Stanford. That put him behind the learning curve, but as coach BIll Belichick lauded from the minute Richards was drafted, the safety is sharp enough to pick up the playbook quickly. The speed of the game was the aspect that took the most adjusting to.\nBy the time Sunday rolled around, he was ready for his most significant action of the season. Although Richards had played on special teams the first two games, he had no snaps on defense. Against the Jaguars, he had 30.\nAfter his late arrival in Foxboro, he now has his routine down.\n\"No, I'm starting to feel settled in,\" Richards said. \"I feel better about it and comfortable and, 'OK, this is the routine on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,' and starting to develop a plan throughout the season.\"\nIt's been time well spent, especially with his fellow defensive backs.\n\"I'm so thankful for those guys and they've been huge with that and just getting me to settle down and settle in and just play,\" Richards said. \"You overthink things and you end up playing not fast or really well at that point. It's just about getting line up quickly, communicating and playing fast when the ball's snapped.\"\nAnd then lifting someone up and pushing them out of bounds. When the time calls for it, of course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:15:28.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
