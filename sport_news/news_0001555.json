Darrelle Revis' former business manager went on a Twitter rant Sunday night alleging the star cornerback isn't as squeaky clean as he was made out to be in a \"60 Minutes\" profile.\nAdChoices John Geiger, who was Revis' former manager and long-time close friend, blasted out a series of tweets in an airing of grievances for being pushed out of the inner-circle, including allegations of Revis using drugs. Geiger deleted the tweets but screenshots were taken showing the rant. The CBS program made reference to \"Team Revis,\" the cornerback's support network made up of his agents and family.\n\"When Revis was getting drunk every night and smoking where was the 'team',\" Geiger wrote in one tweet.\n\"The team was me. I made sure he was cool. I made sure the drugs came in. I made sure he was cool,\" the former manager tweeted.\nMYERS: AFTER REVIS RENTAL, JETS STAR BACK IN ENEMY TERRITORY\nAccording to an interview Geiger gave with Complex.com, he and the star cornerback had a falling out around the time of Super Bowl XLIX, saying Revis’ agents drove a wedge between the two Pittsburgh-area natives.\n“I was at the Super Bowl. He won the Super Bowl (with the Patriots), and I tried to get on the field after and I couldn't. I didn’t talk to him for a week after that,” Geiger told Complex, alleging that Revis’ agents wanted to distance their client from the emerging sneaker designer.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nThe long string of tweets was diffcult to follow and bounced between subjects; from Revis' fashion to $500,000 supposedly missing to insults directed at Revis' agents to \"60 Minutes.\"\n\"Revis is A f---ing liar. @60Minutes,\" Geiger wrote in one tweet.\n\"I have dm from Revis and the commissioner about hiring his uncle.
