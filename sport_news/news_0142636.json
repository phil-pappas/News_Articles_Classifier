Here are five questions for the Hawks as things get going in West Long Branch?\n1. Can Collin Stewart keep moving forward?: The 6-foot-7 redshirt junior’s playing time and production both increased last season, highlighted by 21 points on 8-for-9 shooting in a Homecoming rout at Siena on Feb. 14. Some inconsistency lingers, but the light bulb went off last year for Stewart, who is entering his fourth season in King Rice’s program. Getting Stewart to continue furthering his play could be a big factor towards Monmouth’s success.\n2. What will Monmouth get out of Diago Quinn?: A native of the Washington Heights section of Manhattan who played his last two years of high school ball at Lake Forest (Ill.) Academy, the 6-foot-10 forward was the unheralded member of a Monmouth recruiting class that included 6-foot-8 wing Pierre Sarr and 6-foot-9 forward Mustapha Traore. The Hawks coaching staff brought in Zac Tillman and Chris Brady as underrecruited big men two years ago and turned them into productive collegians. It is the same idea with Quinn, who by many accounts, has all of the tools, but simply needs some seasoning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:10:10.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
