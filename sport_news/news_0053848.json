We just need to regroup, get it together. \n“We all want it. We’re all desperate to win it. But you can’t do things like what happened (in pitlane on weekend). \n“You may as well just donate points, that’s effectively what we did.” \nProdrive Racing team boss Tim Richards said they had Winterbottom’s back after they failed to podium at the Gold Coast – the first time since round one in Adelaide. \n“We will learn from it, that’s my focus,” Edwards told speedcafe website. \n“If we just put it behind us and think it’ll be easy street from here we’re kidding ourselves. \n“There’s quite a few things that aren’t just mistakes in the pitlane or car speed. \n“There’s a number of things that weren’t right for us (last weekend) and we’ve got to address each and every one of them.” \nThe next round is the Auckland 500 from November 6.
