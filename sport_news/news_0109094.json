Hermann/for New York Daily News Organizers say carrying signs, like these, help motivate runners during the grueling New York City Marathon. It doesn’t take much conditioning to be a spectator at the New York City Marathon — but it does help to know how to prepare.\nHere is a short list of hacks for anyone planning to cheer on the nearly 50,000 runners during the five-borough race on Nov. 1:\n1. Use public transportation.\nMarathon organizers say it’s better for spectators looking to follow a particular runner to use the subway when traveling to different points along the race.\nTry to let the runner know in advance where you’ll be and check the MTA’s website for any service changes or disruptions.\n2. The most popular places to watch.\nDownload a map of the course to search for the best places to cheer the runners — like along Fourth Ave. in Brooklyn, where marathoners exit the Verrazano-Narros bridge at the beginning of the race.\nThe early encouragement from the crowd will help any runner with an early boost of energy needed to run the remaining 24 or so miles in the race.\nOther hotspots include the entrance to the Pulaski Bridge in Greenpoint and along First Ave. in Manhattan.\nSpectators are not allowed to go near the finish line in Central Park, but can meet their loved ones at the Family Reunion area near W. 62nd St.\nTodd Maisel/New York Daily News About 50,000 runners sign up for the marathon every year.\n3. Follow your runner’s progress.\nDownload the TCS New York City Marathon app before the race. Enter the information for the runner you want to follow and stay up to date with his or her progress.\nOr, you can follow by calling the Runner Information Hotline at (800) 496-6193.\nhttp://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/si New York City Marathon 2015 course map\n4. Dress warm.\nThe average weather for early November typically calls for temperatures in the 40s and 50s.\nSo, be sure to wear gloves and a hat if you plan on standing on the concrete for several hours.\n5. Get creative.\nThe best thing for runners during the grueling 26.2-mile race is a little word of encouragement — so make sure they see anything you can say to cheer them up.\nThink of something witty, use lots of color and, most of all, try to make them laugh.\nA good start could be a sign reading: “Run like Ryan Gosling is waiting for you at the finish line with a puppy.”\n6. Bring snacks.\nIf you’re planning to hand out snacks to the runners, be sure to pack the right ones.\nExperts say that the most easily digestable snacks include raisins and dried mangos, which can be the best natural fuel for runners.\n“Dried fruit is easily digested into glucose, which is what your body needs to sustain itself during a race,\" Nancy Clark, R.D., author of Nancy Clark's Sports Nutrition Guidebook to mens health told Men’s Health.\nCoconut water, a natural source of electrolytes, can also be better for runners instead of sports drinks.\nBananas, rich in potassium and magnessium, are a runner’s best friend — just be careful with the peels.\n7. Deodorant\nIt’s not just the runners breaking a sweat on marathon day — spectators actively cheering and dancing during the race can perspire.\nSo be mindful of the people you’re standing next to, and don’t forget your deodorant.\nEgan-Chin,Debbie,, New York Dail Spectators are encouraged to meet marathoners on Fourth Ave, in Brookly, as they exit the Verrazano-Narros bridge at the beginning of the race. Egan-Chin,Debbie,, New York Dail People run in the 2014 NYC marathon along 4th Ave. in Brooklyn. Previous Next Enlarge\n8. Costumes\nAlong the same lines as the creative signs, wearing a good costume or a goofy hat could be a good way to encourage runners passing by.\n9. Watch on TV\nIf you find it too cold to stand on the concrete, tune into WABC-TV to watch the world’s biggest race from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nMariela Lombard/Mariela Lombard for News 72-year-old James Lu shakes hands with fellow runner at the 2014 NYC Marathon Enlarge Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News Runners cross the Pulaski Bridge during the 2014 marathon. Enlarge Spectators play an important role in giving runners the energy needed to run the 26.2-mile race.\n10. Etiquette\nSpectators are also expected to practice etiquette while watching the runners in the race.\nSo here is a short list of don’ts for everyone in the crowd:\na. Don’t bring in prohibited items such as weapons, large packages, coolers, tents, animals, folding chairs, glass containers or even strollers.\nIt will be extremely crowded and the last thing you want to do is interfere with security.\nClick here to see the long list of banned items.\nb. Don’t take free food and water for runners.\nThey will be sweating (a lot!) and need to hydrate at the water stations. Don’t interfere with this very important part of the race.\nc. Don’t get in the way of the course. With tens of thousands of runners snaking through the five boroughs, you don’t want to do anything to impede traffic or cause anyone to get seriously hurt.\nd. Don’t say things like: “You’re almost there.”\nOne marathon runner told Minneapolisrunning.com that it was demoralizing to hear such words of encouragement when he still had 6.2 miles to go.\nmstumpf@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://running.about.com/od/RunningHumorStories/tp/10-Things-Not-To-Say-To-Marathon-Runners.htm", "http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/sites/default/files/pictures/TCSNYCM15%20CourseMap%20v3.pdf", "http://www.mta.info/", "http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/plan-your-race/prohibited-items", "http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/spectators/spectator-guide", "http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/best-running-fuels", "http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/si"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:55:30.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
