Smith was sacked five times and the Chiefs lost 36-21. By Bob Gretz ChiefsDigest.com \nCINCINNATI — When the game clock strikes zeroes in a modern-day NFL game and a team’s best performer is without question the kicker, it’s easy to assume it was not a successful afternoon. \nDespite dominating time of possession and producing 461 yards on offense, the only points the Kansas City Chiefs scored Sunday afternoon against the Cincinnati Bengals came from kicker Cairo Santos, as they lost their third straight game, falling 36-21 at Paul Brown Stadium. \nThe Kansas City defense struggled most of the day, giving up five touchdowns. The Chiefs allowed four rushing scores after not allowing any the previous three games. They did not force a turnover and did not sack Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton, who threw for 321 yards. They allowed Cincinnati’s offense seven plays of 20 yards or more, with two of those plays going for more than 50 yards. \nBut all of those field goals came from mistakes and poor play when the Chiefs offense moved the ball inside the 50-yard line. \nShaky pass protection, penalties and negative-yardage plays all combined to keep the Chiefs (1-3) offense out of the end zone. Alex Smith threw for a career-high 386 yards, wide receiver Jeremy Maclin caught 11 passes for 148 yards and running back Jamaal Charles touched the ball 17 times for 145 total yards. \nThose were nice fantasy football numbers, but the production did not lead to a single touchdown. \n“Just negative plays, whether it would be penalties, sacks, negative runs would happen and all the sudden we would be in a bad situation,” Smith said. “It was like that all day. We would march it and then all the sudden stall out.” \nSantos broke the team record for successful field goal attempts in a game, connecting on all seven tries. \n“He kept us within striking distance,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said of Santos, who was successful twice from 51 yards, twice from 40 and also from 34, 29 and 22 yards. “It comes down to we have to do a better job when we cross the 50-yard line (on offense) and we can’t give up big plays on defense.” \nThus was the story behind the record-setting day for Santos. All seven field goals came because of offensive mistakes in Cincinnati territory. \n“We’re moving backwards and we have got to take care of that,” Reid said of his offense. “We are going to do that. We just have to eliminate some of these things. In the National Football League, it’s not as bad as you think and not as good as you think. There is a small margin between winning and losing, and we’ve got to tighten that up.” \nHis players agreed. \n“We were moving the ball well, but when we get the ball over the 50-yard line we have to keep it going forward,” tight end Travis Kelce said. “Today, we either got stopped or moved it backwards hurting ourselves. You can’t do that if you want to win games.” \nA pair of third-quarter mistakes really eliminated any chance the Chiefs had of coming back on the scoreboard. On a third-and-11 play, the Kansas City pass rush flushed Dalton out of the pocket, but the Cincinnati quarterback was still able to connect with wide receiver Brandon Tate on what turned into a 55-yard touchdown pass. Tate caught the ball at the 10-yard line against cornerback Marcus Peters, but got up untouched and ran in for the score. \nLate in the quarter, Kelce fumbled as he was going to the ground on a big hit by Cincinnati defensive end Michael Johnson. The ball was recovered by safety Reggie Nelson, who returned it 25 yards to the Chiefs’ 5-yard line. The Bengals scored two plays later on the second of three TD runs by Hill, and added the 2-point conversion on another run by Hill. \nThe Cincinnati offense was a mystery to Bob Sutton’s defense, as it put together back-to-back scoring drives of 7 plays for 80 yards in the first quarter. The Bengals moved the ball running and passing, and six of those 14 plays picked up 10 yards or more. Dalton hit all eight of his passes to four different receivers, including 36 yards to wide receiver A.J. Green and 27 yards to running back Rex Burkhead. \nThe Cincinnati touchdowns came in the running game, with Hill scoring on an 8-yard run and Giovani Bernard busting a 13-yard play for the second score. \nReid made a change in the starting offensive lineup, as second-year man Zach Fulton opened at right guard in place of Laurent Duvernay-Tardiff. \n“We have got to tighten that up and keep working on it,” Reid said of a pass protection unit that gave up five sacks has now surrendered 19 in four games. “We’re young in some spots and inexperienced in some spots … you can expect the improvement to continue to take place as we go forward. We’ve got to keep getting better and that’s the bottom line.” \nThe Chiefs return home to face the Chicago Bears in Week 4. The Bears pulled off a late victory over Oakland, so they arrive sporting a 1-3 record as well. \nPostseason dreams require a concerted and quick turnaround in results for the Chiefs. \n“This is a tough time,” left guard Ben Grubbs said. “This is not a good feeling. A lot of times players start pointing fingers and placing blame others (rather) than themselves. This team has good character. We are family. This is a tough time, but we are going to stick together and weather the storm. Go back to work, go back to practice, keep pounding away and come away with a win next week, hopefully.” \nKansas City 3 9 3 6 — 21 \nCincinnati 14 0 15 7 — 36 \nFIRST QUARTER \nCin — Hill 8 run (Nugent kick), 11:33. \nKC — FG Santos 22, 4:35. \nCin — Bernard 13 run (Nugent kick), :53. \nSECOND QUARTER \nKC — FG Santos 40, 12:44. \nKC — FG Santos 51, 6:09. \nKC — FG Santos 34, :04. \nTHIRD QUARTER \nCin — Tate 55 pass from Dalton (Nugent kick), 8:43. \nKC — FG Santos 40, 4:37. \nCin — Hill 5 run (Hill run), :11. \nFOURTH QUARTER \nKC — FG Santos 29, 9:28. \nCin — Hill 1 run (Nugent kick), 4:50. \nKC — FG Santos 51, 2:34. \nA — 57,498.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:54:06.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
