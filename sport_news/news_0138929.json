(Photo: Charlie Riedel, Associated Press) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Chicago — You have to be a cold-blooded cynic not to feel good for Randy Wolf Sunday.\nThis is a 39-year-old man who has won 133 games in 16 big-league seasons; a man who still believed he could pitch and was willing to go back to Triple-A to prove it.\nThe story didn't quite have the fairy tale ending he was looking for. He finally got back to the big leagues. His former teammate Brad Ausmus, with his own pitching staff in shambles, reached out to him.\n\"Don't screw it up,\" Ausmus jokingly said to him when he signed.\nHe had three quality starts but no wins. His ERA in seven starts was just under 7.00. His last start was a disaster — six runs and seven hits in 1⅔ innings.\nThat would have been a horrible way to leave what had been an inspiring season. So Ausmus threw him another bone. Wolf, who is contemplating retirement, pitched a scoreless inning Sunday in the Tigers 6-0 win over the White Sox.\n\"It was really nice to get in there,\" Wolf said. \"You never know what the future holds. It could be my last inning, it may not be. But the fact Brad got me in there and we were able to hold Daniel's lead — it was nice.\"\nIt was a 2-0 game when Wolf relieved starter Daniel Norris in the sixth inning. He struck out Carlos Sanchez, then allowed a ringing double to Tyler Saladino. He got J.B. Shuck on a ground out, walked Trayce Thompson semi-intentionally, then got Avisail Garcia to bounce to third.\nIf that was his final inning, it should leave a much better taste.\n\"I haven't made a decision,\" he said. \"It's been a whirlwind the last year, the last two years. It will be nice to go home and let my mind and everything else settle down and go from there.\"\nWolf's time in Detroit was brief, but not his time with Norris and another rookie lefty Matt Boyd. He spent most of the season with both at Triple-A Buffalo. Norris and Boyd came over from Toronto in the David Price trade\nWolf mentored both, especially the younger Norris.\n\"Daniel is my guy,\" Wolf said. \"I've been a bad influence on him for about a year now (laughs)…He has the tangible and intangible things that make pitchers really good.\n\"The cliché is about staying healthy, but that's the key. He loves to pitch and he works really hard. With those things, good things usually happen.\n\"He has the work ethic and the pitches to be a special pitcher.\"\nchris.mccosky@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/cmccosky", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:30:21.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
