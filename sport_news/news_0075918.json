Toys and small drones that don't present a safety threat are likely to be exempt. Drones that weigh only a pound or two or that can't fly higher than a few hundred feet are considered less risky. Heavier ones and those that can fly thousands of feet are more risky.\nThe FAA is scrambling to get registration rules in place before Christmas. The Consumer Electronics Association has forecast that 700,000 drones will be sold this holiday season.\nRegistering drones that could pose safety risks \"makes sense, but it should not become a prohibitive burden for recreational users who fly for fun and educational purposes and who have operated harmoniously within our communities for decades,\" Dave Mathewson, executive director of the Academy for Model Aeronautics, said in a statement.\nThe FAA now receives about 100 reports a month from pilots who say they've seen drones flying near planes and airports, compared with only a few sightings per month last year. So far there have been no accidents, but agency officials have said they are concerned that even a drone weighing only a few pounds might cause serious damage if it is sucked into an engine or smashes into an airliner's windshield.\nIn cases where drones have crashed where they were not supposed to be flying — at crowded sports stadiums, for example — it has been difficult to find the operators.\nThe FAA signed an agreement last month with CACI International Inc., an information technology company in Arlington, Virginia, to test technology that could locate the operators of small drones that are flying illegally near airports. The technology would let the government track radio signals used to operate drones within a 5-mile radius and identify the operator's location.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/320*180/320x180_50820B00-KSYYJ.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/320x180_50820B00-KSYYJ.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:06:36.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
