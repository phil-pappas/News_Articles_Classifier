The loss to Boston English dropped the Knights to 0-6 on the season heading into the Burke game this week.\n“We’ve had so many injuries of late that we were down to 11 players,” Butler said. “We’ve had two ACL injuries, a broken hand and five concussions. We thought we were going to get some players back, but they didn’t get the clearance, so I called the Boston English coach (Joe Cain) and (athletic director) Avery Esdaile Thursday night to tell them we had to forfeit.\n“The kids want to play, but we want to do the right thing by them. We’re hoping to get some kids back this week so that we can play a game.”\nAdding to the problem is the fact South Boston is trying to compete with several underclassmen playing key roles. The spirit is clearly willing, but that can only take you so far in football.\n“We have 13- and 14-year-old kids who have never played before going up against 18-year-olds,” Butler said. “They’re trying to get better, they want to get better, but they’re physically not ready.”\nThe long range hope is that South Boston can keep enough players healthy to field a team to play on Thanksgiving against longtime rival East Boston. Jets coach John Parziale expressed hope that the 98th meeting between the schools would happen.\n“We’ve been pretty focused on our own schedule, but we’ve noticed the forfeits,” Parziale said. “We hope that they can get their kids healthy in the next month. It’s always been a big game for the two schools.”\nButler vowed that he would do anything possible to field a roster on Thanksgiving, regardless of how many players would be able to dress.\n“My first year, we dressed 14 kids against them and played the game,” Butler said. “If the (Boston English) game was on Thanksgiving, I think we would have tried to play because there is no tomorrow.”\nSweet 16\n(Last week’s rankings in parantheses)\n1.
