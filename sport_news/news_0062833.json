Seattle had high expectations of contending in the AL West and reaching the postseason, but instead finished in fourth place in the division.\nDipoto was hired to replace Jack Zduriencik the final week of the regular season and said he would take his time evaluating whether McClendon would return. McClendon was under contract for the 2016 season.\nThe Mariners said hitting coach Edgar Martinez and infield coach Chris Woodward have been invited to remain with the Mariners staff. Pitching coach Rick Waits and coach Chris Prieto have been invited to remain in different roles. All other coaches on the major league staff will not return.\nMcClendon raised hopes of a turnaround in Seattle after the Mariners went 87-75 in his first season and missed the playoffs by one game. But Seattle could not sustain the success from the first season. McClendon was 163-161 in his two seasons and was the only black manager in baseball.\nDipoto’s decision means Seattle will have its 10th manager, full-time and interim, since the club’s last playoff appearance in 2001.\nKyle Busch varooms best\nKyle Busch was the fastest in the final practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C.\nBusch, who will start on the front row tonight alongside Matt Kenseth , turned a lap 189.354 mph. Chase drivers had the six fastest times. Kurt Busch was second, followed by Joey Logano , Ryan Newman , Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Brad Keselowski .\nDefending race winner Kevin Harvick was 12th, while Kenseth was the slowest of the Chase drivers with the 25th fastest lap. Jeff Gordon struggled again in practice at a track he typically runs well at, finishing 16th.\nThe winner tonight will automatically qualify for the next round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.\nJazz’ Booker suspended\nUtah Jazz forward Trevor Booker has been suspended one game without pay for striking Los Angeles Lakers center Roy Hibbert with an open hand to the head, the league announced.\nBooker was given two technical fouls and ejected for the hit in the third quarter of Utah’s 117-114 preseason win Tuesday over the Lakers in Hawaii. Booker’s suspension will begin on the first game of the regular season. . . .\nBernhard Langer shot a 7-under 65 in windy conditions to take a 2-stroke lead in the Champions Tour’s SAS Championship in Cary, N.C. The 58-year-old German star had seven birdies in a bogey-free round. . . .\nDenmark’s Soren Kjeldsen joined England’s Matthew Fitzpatrick at the top of the British Masters leaderboard after both reached 9-under 133 at the halfway stage in Woburn, England. . . .\nSouth Korea’s Ha Na Jang used a late three-hole birdie run to take a one-stroke lead in the LPGA Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. . . .\nNovak Djokovic extended his winning streak to 27 matches at the China Open in Beijing with a 6-2, 6-2 win over John Isner to secure a place in the semifinals. The top-ranked Djokovic has never lost a match at the tournament.\nDjokovic will meet fourth-seeded David Ferrer , who beat wild-card entry Lu Yen-hsun 6-3, 6-1 to join fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the last four. Third-seeded Nadal outlasted Jack Sock of the United States 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.\nSpain, Swiss in Euro 2016\nSpain will defend its European Championship title next year, while Switzerland is returning to the tournament for the first time since co-hosting it eight years ago.\nSpain secured its Euro 2016 spot by easily defeating Luxembourg, 4-0, in Madrid, while Switzerland trounced San Marino, 7-0, to clinch its berth for the tournament in France.\nAlso, already qualified England beat Estonia, 2-0, to win for the ninth time in as many qualifying games.\nRussia took a big step toward qualifying thanks to a 2-1 win at Moldova. The victory strengthened its hold on second place with one round of games yet to be played in the group. Austria, which has already qualified as group winner, twice recovered from a goal down to beat Montenegro 3-2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:46:16.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
