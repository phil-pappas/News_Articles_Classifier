He was cold behind center for Merrimack College on Saturday. Very cold. \nHigh-40’s and sunny may not be rough conditions for a native New Englander, but when you spent the first 20 years of your life in the beautiful California sunshine, it’s quite a bit more grueling. \n“No way, I’ve ever played in cold like this,” said Davis with a laugh. “And from what I understand it’s not even that cold for here. I’ll be wearing gloves and hand warmers, and believe me when it drops below 30 I might wear sweaters and long johns.” \nHis body may have been cold, but Davis’ game was red hot. \nThere was the 15-yard dart he threw through defenders for a touchdown to Central Catholic alum Cody Demers. There was the picture-perfect over-the-shoulder pass he dropped into the hands of Jere Brown for a 5-yard score. And for good measure, he threw a nasty cut block on a run play, and had a few words for the defensive lineman after the play. \nThe junior transfer from Moorpark College (Calif.) — and recently-named starter — threw for 253 yards and a pair of touchdowns as Merrimack College rolled past Saint Anselm 41-16. \nIt was a big day for the QB who had to battle to take the job after moving across the country to play for the Warriors. \n“We recruited Nick because we thought he could be a dynamic player,” said Merrimack head coach Dan Curran. “He’s a dual-threat player that can hurt you with his arm and legs, and he had a swagger that rubs off on the other kids. We are very excited to see what he can do the rest of this year and next year.” \nDavis’ journey to becoming a Warrior began 3,162 miles away from the Merrimack College campus. \nThe 6-foot, 190-pound QB grew up in Garden Grove, Calif., where he was a star for Pacifica High School. He threw for 4,209 yards and 39 touchdowns for his career, including 1,377 and 16 scores passing and 863 yards rushing and as a senior. \n“I decided to go the junior college route and I had two right in my back yard,” he said. “I visited Moorpark and just loved it.” \nIn two seasons at Moorpark — the same junior college attended by former NFL star Jamal Anderson and Old Spice pitchman Isaiah Mustafa — Davis threw for over 3,000 yards passing 18 touchdowns, drawing the attention of schools including Merrimack. \n“I had a couple of pretty good seasons and I put together a good highlight reel,” said Davis. “I guess I was what Merrimack wanted because they came out and recruited me. \n“When I visited, it was two degrees outside and no one was here. But I knew I wanted to come back. I knew it was the place for me.” \nCurran said the Warriors were thrilled to bring the new QB to town. \n“The QB position is always so important, and in our offense it is so crucial,” said the coach. “We had a few guys with very good pedigree that wanted to transfer in, and we told Nick that he was the one we chose.” \nBut Davis did not rise to the top of the depth chart right away. He lost the starting spot out of camp to returning starter Joe Capobianco. Then, inserted into the game as a runner in the season-opener, he suffered a concussion that forced him to sit out a game. \nAfter splitting time with Capobianco upon his return, Davis was named the outright starter beginning with the Warriors’ matchup with Bentley. \nIn his four starts, Merrimack is 3-1. On the season Davis has thrown for 1,192 yards and 11 touchdowns. \nHe now hopes that success continues as the Warriors make their postseason push. \n“It’s all about winning games, that’s what matters,” he said. “I’m a dual-threat QB. I like to use my arm and legs. I’m going to do anything necessary because I want to be part of something great.” \nDemers recovers \nMerrimack star Cody Demers, the former Eagle-Tribune All-Star, was off to fast start yesterday, catching seven passes for 60 yards and a score. But he sat out nearly the entire second half with an ankle sprain. \n“We’re optimistic Cody will be back for the next game (against Pace),” said Curran. “Cody is a very tough kid, and if anyone can recover that fast, he can.” \nDemers has 521 yards and six TDs receiving this season. \nFairweather first \nDespite the loss, it was a big day for former Londonderry star and current Saint Anselm QB Eric Fairweather, who threw his first college touchdown pass. \nBut the biggest play for the true freshman was a shifty 61-yard touchdown run he broke just before halftime. It was his fourth running score on the year. \nPerfect pair \nWhen new Merrimack College QB Nick Davis arrived at Merrimack College, he was set up with a perfect roommate, Warrior star receiver Jere Brown. \n“We practice the over the shoulder catches in our dorm room,” said Brown. “We will throw the ball in the room, in the hall, in the cafeteria. Anywhere we can. He is one of my best friends and he is going to tear it up the next two years.” \n... \nDavid Willis is a sportswriter/videographer for The Eagle-Tribune.
