He added: \"We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.\" He called on Congress, and the American people, to get serious about gun legislation.\nRep. Christopher Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, followed up on the president's remarks by making the case on news programs and social media for new laws. Opponents of gun-control legislation responded in kind, arguing that it's naïve to believe restrictive laws will stop mass shootings.\n@ChrisVanHollen Bad people must be stopped from doing bad things! Deploy the unicorns!\n— Tony for Liberty (@peacelovedixie) October 1, 2015\nSo, are President Obama and Congressman Van Hollen naïve?\nIn interviews on Thursday, Van Hollen referenced recent research led by Daniel Webster that has looked at the effects of gun laws in Missouri and Connecticut. Webster is the director of The Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research in Baltimore.\nIn 2014, the Johns Hopkins Center published a study that analyzed Missouri's 2007 repeal of its gun-permitting law. The law had required gun buyers to prove they had passed a background check.\nThe study found that the repeal \"contributed to\" a 14 percent increase in Missouri's murder rate. The research concluded that the repeal \"was associated with an additional 49 to 68 murders per year in Missouri between 2008 and 2012.\" Based on data from \"crime gun traces\" and analysis of death certificates and other related information, researchers determined that firearms-related murders began going up in Missouri immediately after the repeal and kept going up. None of Missouri's border states experienced a similar spike in murders -- but law enforcement in those border states soon discovered more Missouri guns being used in crimes in their communities.\nStated the Johns Hopkins Center at the time of the study's publication in the Journal of Urban Health:\n\"State-level murder data for the time period 1999-2012 were collected and analyzed from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) system. The analyses controlled for changes in policing, incarceration, burglaries, unemployment, poverty, and other state laws adopted during the study period that could affect violent crime.\"\nThe New Republic magazine, after reviewing the data analysis, insisted that the study \"makes the strongest case yet that the policy (of universal background checks) saves lives.\"\nPro-gun advocates insist such measures will only make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to acquire guns, not criminals. But Webster says the research indicates that measures such as universal background checks -- including checks of individuals buying from unlicensed (or private) sellers, which is currently not a requirement in federal law -- demonstrably impede gun violence.\n\"Because many perpetrators of homicide have backgrounds that would prohibit them from possessing firearms under federal law, they seek out private dealers to acquire their weapons,\" Johns Hopkins Center deputy director Jon Vernick said in the 2014 statement . \"Requiring a background check on all gun sales is a commonsense approach to reducing gun violence that does not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners.\"\nThis past summer, the Johns Hopkins Center followed up on the Missouri study by looking at Connecticut. The Center and the University of California at Berkeley analyzed data to determine the effects of Connecticut's handgun permitting law, which was passed in 1995. The results, published in the American Journal of Public Health, were similar to the Missouri study.\n\"We estimated that the law was associated with a 40 percent reduction in Connecticut's firearm homicide rates during the first 10 years that the law was in place,\" the study states . \"By contrast, there was no evidence for a reduction in nonfirearm homicides.\"\nThe researchers reached their conclusions by comparing Connecticut's homicides from 1996 to 2005 with the 39 states that did not have permit-to-purchase gun laws during that period. (After all, the Washington Post pointed out , \"we can't access the alternate universe where Connecticut's law never existed.\")\nWebster says the research clearly shows that strong permit laws keep guns out of the hands of criminals. \"People assume incorrectly that criminals will do anything and everything in terms of cost and risk to get their hands on a gun,\" Webster said . \"But that simply is not what the data tells us.\"\n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/peacelovedixie/status/649697074792038401", "http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302703", "http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2014/repeal-of-missouris-background-law-associated-with-increase-in-states-murders.html", "http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116657/johns-hopkins-gun-control-study-background-checks-really-work", "https://twitter.com/ChrisVanHollen", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/06/12/gun-killings-fell-by-40-percent-after-connecticut-passed-this-law/", "http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-gun-policy-and-research/"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:05:03.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
