Guardiola's side has scored five goals on four occasions during that streak across all competitions, and it also won its last two visits to Arsenal in the 2013-14 and 2012-13 seasons.\nThe other marquee matchup of this week's third series of group games is Real Madrid's trip to Paris Saint-Germain with the Group A lead in dispute on Wednesday. Both sides have won their first two group games without conceding.\nDefending champion Barcelona will take a long flight to BATE Borisov in Belarus in Group E on Tuesday, while English Premier League leader Manchester City hosts Sevilla in Group D on Wednesday.\nHere are some more things to know about this week's matches:\n___\nBULLISH BAYERN\nWith little domestic competition and the Bundesliga title seemingly already in the bag, Bayern can concentrate its full efforts on capturing its first Champions League under Guardiola.\nThe Spanish coach is under pressure to deliver Europe's ultimate prize following meek semifinal exits in his first two seasons in charge after taking over from Jupp Heynckes, who was pushed toward retirement despite claiming a historic treble.\nBayern set a new Bundesliga record Saturday by becoming the first side to start the league with nine wins.\nDespite missing Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben, Mario Goetze and Kingsley Coman through injury, and leaving Javi Martinez and Douglas Costa on the bench, Bayern dominated at Werder Bremen - with nearly 90 percent possession in the first half - before emerging with a 1-0 win.\n\"The performance was enough this time, but we'll need more in the coming weeks,\" Guardiola warned.\n___\nBLANC HOPEFUL ON INJURIES\nPSG is sweating over the fitness of three of its best players ahead of its clash with Madrid.\nGoalkeeper Kevin Trapp picked up a thigh injury at training while defender David Luiz damaged a knee on international duty with Brazil. Italy international Marco Verratti was also left out of the PSG squad that won 2-0 at Bastia on Saturday because of a calf injury.\nPSG coach Laurent Blanc remains in an optimistic mood, though.\n\"We have high hopes of having the players back for the (Madrid) match,\" Blanc said. \"Not only to have them back, but also that they will be competitive enough during the game itself.\"\nPSG lost in the quarterfinals to Barcelona last season while missing key players and Blanc has decided to rotate his squad more than usual in order to have his main men ready for the big matches.\nAgainst Bastia, he rested winger Angel Di Maria, who is expected to feature against his former club. In five seasons with Madrid, Di Maria scored 22 goals and was also the man of the match in the 2014 Champions League final when Madrid beat city rival Atletico to lift its 10th European title.\n___\nMANGLED MADRID\nKnocks have also left Madrid limping into its toughest match of the group phase.\nDespite having a deep squad to draw on, Rafa Benitez is missing first-choice players from defense, midfield and attack.\nDanilo did return to replace the injured Dani Carvajal in the starting lineup of Saturday's 3-0 win over Levante, when Cristiano Ronaldo scored to help lift Madrid to the top of the Spanish league.\nBut Benitez couldn't count on centerbacks Sergio Ramos and Pepe, striker Karim Benzema and midfielders James Rodriguez and Luka Modric due to injury.\nLike Blanc, Benitez is hopeful that he can get some of his stars back in time for the clash at the Parc des Princes.\n\"I don't know, we are working toward that,\" Benitez said on Saturday. \"I spoke with them this morning and they all say that they want to play, but we will have to evaluate them.\"\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
