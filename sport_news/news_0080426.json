(AP Photo/David Richard) more > By ARNIE STAPLETON   12:01 a.m., Saturday, October 24, 2015 \nDENVER (AP) - During an ugly drought in which Denver’s wheezing offense went 25 drives without crossing the goal line, the unbeaten Broncos’ only touchdowns came via pick-6s from Pro Bowl cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. \nYou’d have thought the offense had sprung the blocks the way the players reacted on the sideline. \n“We’re trying to win ballgames,” tackle Tyler Polumbus said. “It doesn’t matter where we get the points.” \nNever in his NFL career has Peyton Manning been so reliant on his defense or his kicker to bail him out. \nAt 39 and learning a new system on the fly without his old reliable safety valves in Wes Welker, Julius Thomas and Jacob Tamme, Manning has too often put the ball in the wrong hands. \nHe leads the league with 10 interceptions, as many as he threw in all of 2013, when he opened the season with seven touchdown tosses against Baltimore - as many as he’s thrown through six weeks this season. \nManning used to be the one whose play led to all the laughter in the locker room. He averaged 44 touchdown throws in his first three seasons in Denver, including a record 55 two years ago. \nMore often than not, the Broncos needed every one of his precise TD passes because their defense was deficient, riddled by injuries or just too conservative. \nNow under Wade Phillips, who’s turned loose waves of pass rushers in an aggressive 3-4 scheme, the Broncos have piled up 26 sacks by 11 different players to go with 18 takeaways. \nLed by Von Miller, who has an NFL-high 31 quarterback hurries, the Broncos have made game-saving plays in crunch time in all six wins. Subtracting the 34 points opponents have scored off turnovers, including three pick-6s, Denver’s defense is allowing just 11 points a game. \n“If we don’t produce those numbers, don’t play how we’ve been playing, who knows? We could easily be 0-6,” safety David Bruton Jr. said. “We’re 6-0 and have a long season to go and a lot more work to do.” \nEspecially the offense, where the line has been beset by injuries, the tight ends are non-factors, the running backs keep getting stuffed, the receivers keep dropping passes and Manning is looking his age. \nBrandon McManus has bailed them out by making 16 of 17 field goals. \nDenver’s defense faces a gauntlet of challengers in November in Aaron Rodgers, Andrew Luck, Alex Smith, Jay Cutler and Tom Brady, so a more efficient offense will take some pressure off them to come up big all the time. \nManning & Co. will have to do better than the 1.5 TDs they’re averaging per game. Even Tim Tebow’s scoring-challenged teams averaged two TDs a game, which got him a one-way ticket to New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:57:03.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
