Prior to beating Washington, Oregon (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) had lost two of three, including a 42-point drubbing at the hands of Utah and a double-overtime upset loss to Washington State. Their only win in that stretch was over Colorado, a game that was still close late.\nBut Adams returned on Saturday from his broken finger and injected life into the offense. He threw the deep ball, Darren Carrington returned to catch it and all of a sudden Oregon feels like it actually has some momentum heading into the bye week.\nThe question: Is it too late?\nWhether Saturday was a revival, or maybe Washington just played a bad game, it doesn't change the fact that the Ducks have two conference losses already heading into the toughest portion of their schedule. Next week is at Arizona State, then Oregon's shaky secondary gets to face Jared Goff and Cal at home, then at Stanford and then home against USC.\nAll four of those teams received preseason media votes to win the conference. And at least two of them — Cal and Stanford — have lived up to that billing without any major hiccups.\nThe fears of Oregon not reaching at least a bowl game seem to be quelled. The Ducks have five games left to win two in a schedule that includes Pac-12-worst Oregon State at the end of the year.\nBut Saturday's win had, at very least, the players thinking about more. Much of this team was in Pasadena a year ago for the Rose Bowl and Dallas for the national championship game. The latter is definitely out of reach for this Oregon team, but players seem to think that they can go on a run and, with some help, potentially still be in contention for the Pac-12 title.\n\"The win is a foundation for the second half of the season,\" senior defensive end DeForest Buckner said. \"Obviously, our goal is to win out, so we have the opportunity to be one of the best teams up there (in Pac-12 standings).\"\nAdded Carrington, who returned from a six-game suspension to catch five passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns: \"I think that was just the beginning. We'll get better from there, and we're about ready to take off.\"\nNow before booking tickets for the Pac-12 title game, consider this: Three teams — WSU, Cal and Stanford — sit in front of the Ducks in just the Pac-12 North standings. Stanford is undefeated in conference play while Cal and WSU both have one loss. There is little margin for error and Oregon can absolutely not afford to drop a game to the Cardinal or Golden Bears. Actually, the Ducks probably can't drop a game at all, which is a challenge that the players felt was worthy on Saturday after one of the few positive post games in several weeks.\nAnd much of that optimism surrounded Adams, who is out to make up for lost time after what, until that point, had been a disappointing season for the heralded Eastern Washington transfer.\n\"He's a playmaker,\" head coach Mark Helfrich said, \"and it really helped him being out there making plays.\"\nOn to the links:\nIfo Ekpre-Olomu is now a very rich man.\nIs Oregon now the team everyone thought it would be?\nWhere does Adams rank in the Pac-12 QB rankings?\nThe Titans were upset about a low hit on Mariota.\nDucks and Sun Devils by the numbers?\nBralon Addison can do it all.\nThe Ducks are the latest post-Heisman drop off team.\n-- Tyson Alger\ntalger@oregonian.com\n@tysonalger", "external_links": ["http://registerguard.com/rg/sports/football/33626468-69/oregon-football-the-latest-post-heisman-drop-off.html.csp", "http://espn.go.com/blog/pac12/post/_/id/93368/with-adams-oregon-is-the-team-we-thought-itd-be", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13924955/ifo-ekpre-olomu-cleveland-browns-collects-3-million-draft-policy", "http://registerguard.com/rg/sports/football/33623634-69/addison-is-oregon-football-wild-card-with-td-pass-run-catch-and-return.html.csp", "http://espn.go.com/blog/pac12/post/_/id/93386/pac-12-quarterback-rankings"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:55:31.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
