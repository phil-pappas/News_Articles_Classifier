Their next game is Tuesday in Vancouver. \n“You have to give (the Leafs) credit, they came out hard,” said defenceman P.K. Subban. “They knew we’d be a bit tired and they pushed the pace. \n“They did exactly what any team would want to do. But we’ve got Carey Price in net and he gave us an opportunity to win the game.” \nSubban and Max Pacioretty each had a goal and assist, while Lars Eller, David Desharnais and Brendan Gallagher also scored for Montreal, which already has an NHL record nine regulation time wins to start the season. \n“Our goal is not to break records, it’s to win a Stanley Cup,” said Subban. “I think we’ll save the champagne or whatever anyone expects us to do for another day. \n“Personally, I think all we’ve accomplished is a good start. That’s really all it is. There’s a lot of hockey left to be played. Everybody’s going to be talking about a lot of things over the next couple of days and that’s fine, but for our team, it’s about the next game and getting ready to play our best.” \nLeo Komarov, James van Riemsdyk and Morgan Reilly scored for Toronto (1-4-2), which is winless in its last three games. \nThe Leafs had numerous chances, hit a handful of goalposts and became the first team this season to get three goals past Price. But it wasn’t enough. \n“We had quite a few chances, a five-on-three, but (Price) made some big saves,” said Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf. “Whatever you want to call them — momentum saves, game-changers, he was solid.” \nThe Canadiens got the lead when Bernier was unable to hang onto Subban’s cannon blast from the top of the right circle on a power play 10:53 into the game. \nToronto had a 23-11 shots advantage in the second but fell behind 5-2. \nAlex Galchenyuk drove to the net and his rebound was banged in by Eller 1:54 into the second period. \nKomarov got it back at 2:37 from in front to score after van Riemsdyk deflected Scott Harrison’s point shot off Price. \nDesharnais saw his pass on the rush up the right side go in off Michael Grabner’s skate at 4:24 but van Riemsdyk got it back at 6:36, banging in the rebound of Phaneuf’s shot off the end boards. \nPacioretty broke down the left side and beat Bernier between the pads shorthanded at 15:30 and Gallagher tipped a Subban shot in from the edge of the crease on a power play at 19:46. \nReilly scored 7:11 into the third when he picked the far corner with a shot on the off-wing on a rush. \nBernier is now 1-7-3 against Montreal in his career. \nByron Froese, recalled Friday from the Toronto Marlies, centred the fourth line in his first NHL game. The Leafs placed Tyler Bozak (lower body) and defenceman Jake Gardiner (undisclosed) on the injured list this week. \nThe Leafs return home to face Arizona on Monday. \nA moment of silence was observed for former Canadien Jimmy Roberts, who died this week. He was 75.
