He won two national titles while in Gainesville, Fla., and along the way watched one player after another walk through the doors of the Alachua County jail. \nBefore the rise to prominence of Alabama and Auburn, the Gators ruled the SEC with its own dynasty. The team in 2008 was Meyer's best, but there was always a constant inner battle between toughness on the field and violence off of it. Two years ago, the New York Times went back and counted the number of arrests from that championship team: 41 while at UF, or after players left the school. \nMeyer was considered one of the best college coaches in the country back then, and he still is today. So, please, spare us your outrage when a player like D'haquille Williams reportedly goes Grand Theft Auto on the streets of Auburn . Is it the price of winning? No, it's the price of simply playing the game. \nSeen through that prism, Williams' rampage is a poor reflection on Auburn coach Gus Malzahn only because Malzahn didn't have a network in place to either cover it up, or limit the number of alleged assaults. That might be overly cynical, but it's also closer to reality in the SEC than many university administrators would like to admit. \nWhen Meyer was at Florida, he paired quarterback Tim Tebow with Aaron Hernandez to try and keep the volatile tight end under control. They were roommates, and, for a while, Tebow chaperoned Hernandez on the weekends. It worked, but only to a degree. \nTebow once pulled Hernandez out of a bar after Hernandez punched out a bouncer. Just busting up one bouncer is apparently OK, though. No charges were filed and, of course, Hernandez wasn't kicked off the team. \nHernandez was later implicated in a shooting that occurred in crowded downtown Gainesville the night after a game. No, Meyer didn't kick Hernandez off the team then either. \nMeyer's game in Gainesville wasn't sustainable, and he knew when to get out ... when he started losing, and when his health failed him. Is Malzahn's program on the verge of spinning out of control? A better question might be, when are these programs not? \nHOME COOKING \nSteve Spurrier's Gamecocks are an 18 ½-point underdog this weekend after having its game against LSU moved from Columbia, S.C., to Baton Rouge, La. The game is still considered a home game for Spurrier, which seems a little absurd. Throughout his career, Spurrier has only lost one home game against LSU. Perhaps this one should come with an asterisk. \nALABAMA OVERRATED \nNick Saban knows how to stunt like a boss , but despite his entertaining press conference on Monday, it's still difficult to gauge his team based on Alabama's body of work. \nSaban was right to point out that his team was counted out too early, but I'm not ready to anoint the Crimson Tide one of the nation's top four teams based off that victory against Georgia. Just because Alabama exposed the Bulldogs as frauds doesn't mean the Crimson Tide is actually any good. \nBased on the first five weeks of the season, the playoff committee might be splitting hairs come December to figure out the nation's best four teams. With that in mind, Alabama's loss to Ole Miss looks even worse today after the Rebels' great collapse against Florida. \nThankfully, there's still plenty of season left to go. For example, if Alabama's defensive line holds Leonard Fournette to under 100 yards, then that alone might be enough to earn a golden playoff ticket. \nOr at least elicit more great theatre from Nicholas Sabanspeare. \nJOE VS THE PRO \nThe puzzling trends of Joe vs. the Pro continued last week with Joe going 2-6 straight up, but 4-4 against the spread. For the record, breaking even is usually seen as a victory for Joe, who is notoriously terrible at picking winners. Joe is now 16-16 straight up on the season, but a sparkling 19-11-2 against the spread. \nAfter a difficult Week 4, the Pro last week went 5-3 straight up and 5-3 against the spread. The Pro, Lee Sterling of ParamountSports.com , is 16-16 straight up and 11-19-2 against the spread. Onto the picks! \nArkansas at Alabama, Alabama by 16.5 \nJoe: Assuming there isn't monsoon, and Arkansas' quarterback can actually hold onto the ball , this point spread seems a little large. Alabama 34, Arkansas 21 \nPro: Tide consistently scores in the 34-38 point range while the Razorbacks might have trouble moving the ball consistently as Tide give up just 84 yards per game on the ground. If superior Bulldogs couldn't run on this crew, I doubt RB Alex Collins and crew do much damage. Alabama 35, Arkansas 14 \nTroy at Mississippi State, Mississippi State by 30.5 \nJoe: The Bulldogs' ball carriers already have lost seven fumbles this season. I'm thinking a few turnovers will keep this thing closer than 30 points. Mississippi State 38, Troy 15 \nPro: Trojans have lost their last three games vs the SEC by an average 56-9 since 2013. Don't see why this game would be any different as Bulldogs only have Louisiana Tech on deck. Mississippi State 51, Troy 10 \nNew Mexico State at Ole Miss, Ole Miss by 43 \nJoe: Chad Kelly get-right game. Ole Miss 58, New Mexico State 14 \nPro: Aggie RB Larry Rose III had a career high 260 rushing yards in their nine-point loss to rival New Mexico last week. I doubt he gets 10 percent of that total versus a very angry Rebel run defense. Mississippi 58, New Mexico State 7 \nGeorgia at Tennessee, Georgia by 3 \nJoe: Tennessee's fourth-quarter nightmares end against the Bulldogs. Tennessee 28, Georgia 25 \nPro: In last year's 35-32 Bulldogs win, they ran for 5.5 yards per carry while Vols had but a 3.4 YPC. Vols have now blown three double-digit leads, and Georgia seems to play their best ball (5-1 ATS) after a loss. Georgia 31, Tennessee 23 \nMiami at Florida State, FSU by 9 \nJoe: The Canes' defense couldn't stop Cincinnati last week, and Coral Gables is ready to meltdown. Noles haven't looked that impressive either, though. FSU 36, Miami 31 \nPro: RB Dalvin Cook's injury status makes this a tough game to predict. He's the best player on both teams. Miami has only 2 offensive turnovers on the season and the underdog is a healthy 12-4 ATS. To the wire! Florida State 23, Miami 20 \nGeorgia Tech at Clemson, Clemson by 7 \nJoe: A sound Clemson defense could mean a long day for Georgia Tech. Clemson 42, Georgia Tech 21 \nPro: Tar Heels dual-threat QB Marquise Williams eventually wore down depth-shy Yellow Jackets defense last week. Tigers QB Deshaun Watson is the best dual-threat QB in the ACC. Clemson 30, Georgia Tech 17 \nFlorida at Missouri, Florida by 5 \nJoe: Will Grier had his flu game against Ole Miss, but Missouri's defense might have some tricks waiting for the redshirt freshman passer. Still, not sure if Mizzou's offense is ready for the test. Florida 25, Missouri 21 \nPro: Tennessee came within one play of knocking off the Gators. Their game plan was to run on Gator run D which netted them 254 yards. Mizzou has mustered above 140 rushing yards in just one game this year. Florida 24, Missouri 14 \nSouth Carolina at LSU, LSU by 18 ½ \nJoe: With Florida up next, LSU coach Les Miles would be wise to shut down Leonard Fournette as soon as possible. LSU 35, South Carolina 20 \nPro: Gamecocks not very good at stopping the run but they might just stack the box and force Tigers to throw it more than the 15 times Brandon Harris attempted last week. Change in venue might cause LSU to lose focus and allow Gamecocks to sneak in the back door. LSU 34, South Carolina 20 As a reminder, AL.com All-Access promotes the expression of creative thought in the comments section, and head carni Joseph Goodman withholds the right to condemn anyone for taking things too seriously. Joe runs the All-Access live chat every Tuesday and Thursday, and he's around throughout the day beginning at 10 a.m CT. (But mostly from just 10 to 11 a.m.) Ask him a question and he might answer if he can keep up with the comments (he's kinda slow).
