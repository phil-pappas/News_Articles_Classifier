LOUIS -- Just as New York Jets defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson gets to return to the field after a drug suspension, he'll also see his legal troubles reappear in court. The former University of Missouri star is scheduled for a court appearance Monday in St. Charles County just west of St. Louis, where the Pro Bowler is charged with five misdemeanor counts that include resisting arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to all of them. The 24-year-old was arrested July 14 after a chase that began on Interstate 64, where police say he was driving his 2014 Bentley Silver Spur at speeds up to 143 mph with a 12-year-old relative and two other men inside the car. Police said Richardson, who lives in the St. Louis suburb of O'Fallon in the offseason, appeared to be racing with another car. Police say they found a loaded handgun under a floor mat, and a probable cause statement said officers detected a \"very strong odor of burned marijuana.\" No gun charges were filed because Richardson legally owned the weapon, and prosecutors declined to pursue drug possession or child endangerment counts, citing insufficient evidence. A conviction for resisting arrest is punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $1,000, though Richardson expressed confidence in August that he won't face jail time - \"I really don't think it'll go that far, but we'll see.\" It was unclear whether Richardson planned to attend the hearing; he did not appear for an arraignment Aug. 31, when his attorney, Scott Rosenblum, entered the plea. Messages seeking comment were left by The Associated Press with Rosenblum in recent days. Richardson completed a four-game suspension Sunday for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy, namely for using marijuana. That suspension came 12 days before his arrest, which carries a possibility of more discipline because it violates the personal conduct policy. \"We are monitoring developments in the case,\" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Friday. Jets coach Todd Bowles said he has \"not yet\" received any word from the league about the prospect of additional discipline. The Jets said last week they expected Richardson to be eligible to return to practice Monday and play Oct. 18 against Washington. Richardson was the 13th overall pick in 2013 and was named Defensive Rookie of the Year that season. He played in the Pro Bowl last season. He apologized to the organization and his teammates after the news of his arrest came out, something he withheld from even his parents until reports surfaced on July 30, early in training camp.
