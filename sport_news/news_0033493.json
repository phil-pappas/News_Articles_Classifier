(Photo: Photo by Bill Gamblin) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMilton celebrated senior night in a big fashion Friday night and they accomplished that feat thanks to two seniors — Ben Coulter and Brady White. \nThe Panthers (5-2) started their final possession with 37.5 seconds left, from their own 20-yard line. \nCrestview’s coaching staff was irate before the drive even started, as what appeared as though the Panthers would be getting the ball and their own 1-yard line, the officials ruled the Bulldogs’ punt went into the endzone for a touchback. \nWith that extra cushion, MHS moved the ball down the field with some timely passing from Aubrey Williams and some untimely penalties as Crestview self-destructed in the final minutes. \nTwo personal fouls against the Bulldogs for kicking the ball in the stands and a late hit on the Milton sideline after Marquise McRoy made a 9-yard reception gave the Panthers the ball on the Crestview 23 with 2.8 second remaining. \nWith the Panthers behind by three points, Coulter trotted out on the field to attempt a 40-yard field goal. \nCoulter kicked the ball and watched it tumble end over end until it hit the right upright and then fell behind the cross bar to tie the game at 22-22 to force overtime. \nShemar Henderson wasted little time in the overtime period as he took the ball nine yards through the Bulldog defense to give Milton the 29-22 lead after Coulter nailed the PAT. \nCrestview took their turn in overtime and scored on the first play when Rusty Moorer hit Andrew Akins for a quick score, but Milton focused on the foot of kicker Seth Kootsouradis. \nOn the snap, the Panthers poured through the left side of the Crestview line as Brady White blocked the extra point to seal the victory. \n“At halftime I told the kids to dig deep and they did that in the second half,” said Milton head coach Chafan Marsh. “The last two games we haven’t performed very well. \n“Tonight I thought we came out and got after it better. The kids were behind one another and they played a tremendous fourth quarter.” \nThe contest was littered with eight turnovers, but the fourth turnover by the Bulldogs proved to be the costliest one of the night. \nAhead 22-12 Crestview had the ball on their own 38 when the Panthers Tristian Satterfield hit Moorer in the backfield to force a fumble. \nE.J. Hurst scored his second TD of the night with 3:08 remaining to cut the lead to 22-19.
