The senior scored the game-winner with 10.2 seconds left to lift the Panthers to a 2-1 victory at Croatan in a match featuring two of the three teams fighting for the second spot in the league. Venegas scored off an assist from freshman Markos Reyes, who played a short diagonal pass toward the right side. That allowed Venegas to run forward and punch the ball into the back of the net. “We were just giving pressure and Markos put it in the corner,” Venegas said. “I just saw him pass it.” While the game wasn’t over, it might as well have been since the Cougars didn’t have enough time to send the ball forward to try to get an equalizer. Venegas’ goal just came at an “unlucky” time for Croatan, coach Paul Slater said. “I saw the kid make the run toward the far post and we were following him,” he said. “Hey, they capitalized and you have to credit them for that.” The Panthers (12-7, 5-3) now control their own destiny as they try to finish second. Mathematically, East Duplin is not eliminated from winning the league title, but Dixon (15-4-1, 7-1) seems to have the top spot within its grasp. The Panthers can finish second with wins Wednesday over North Brunswick (11-6-2, 5-2-1) at home and at Northside (4-7-2, 0-6) on Oct. 27. East Duplin owns the tiebreaker over Croatan (9-7-3, 5-3-1), given it also beat the Cougars 1-0 in Beulaville on Sept. 30. “Coming here and playing away from home, we’ve not done that very well against a quality team,” East Duplin coach Joey Jones said. “So this is a big win. We hope to come out and play well and play hard on senior night against North Brunswick.” Croatan had the momentum down the stretch prior to Venegas’ goal. The Cougars tied the game at 1-1 with 7:10 remaining when senior JT Dupree scored on a penalty kick. The PK was awarded because the central referee ruled the Panthers committed a foul inside the 18-yard-line as a Croatan corner kick from the left side sailed through the middle. The Cougars made another run toward the net in the moments after Dupree’s PK, but came up empty. “We definitely were going for the win because a tie wouldn’t have done any good for us,” Slater said. And while Dupree’s goal sparked the Cougars, Jones said it didn’t faze his squad. Page 2 of 2 - “We felt Croatan had the momentum, but our guys didn’t quit,” said Jones, adding he was already thinking about his team’s overtime game plan. “They played hard and made things happen. Things happen when you don’t quit. Maybe we had a little bit of luck tonight.” The Panthers outshot the Cougars 5 to 3 in the final 40 minutes, although most of those attempts came from outside the 18. Croatan, meanwhile, controlled most of the possession in the second half and recorded more serious looks at the goal. Down 1-0, the Cougars had a 20-yard direct kick with 17:30 remaining bounce off the right post. “We talked at halftime about how we were making simply mistakes,” Slater said. “We cut them out in the second half.” East Duplin took a 1-0 lead just 3:39 into the game when junior Quinton Bass scored off an assist from Adams Canales. The Panthers had the better play before halftime, which led to Bass’ goal. “We got some good passes through,” Venegas said. East Duplin kept that 1-0 lead at the break by not allowing many point-blank looks in the first half. Goalkeeper Diego Avila stopped one with a diving save moments after Bass’ goal.
