However a middle order collapse meant Vidarbha lost the next five wickets for 83 runs.\nIt was a disappointing debut for veteran Wasim Jaffer (1), who made the tough decision to move to Vidarbha from Mumbai. His innings lasted just four balls as he was castled by medium pacer Suryakant Pradhan.\nPradhan and Basant Mohanty brought Odisha back into the game by picking up two wickets each.\nBrief scores: Vidarbha 256/6 in 90 overs (Aditya Shanware 119, Ganesh Satish 53; Suryakant Pradhan 2/52, Basant Mohanty 2/31).
