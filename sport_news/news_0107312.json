Fun place to play. This AFC North is special just because of the fans you have in these cities. Very similar. They're not quite as passionate as Browns fans, but they're close. To come into a place like this, where a fan-base supports their team like this, and get a win in a hostile environment is huge.\" \nMcCown completed 36 of his 51 throws for 457 yards and two touchdowns in the win over the Ravens. The 457 yards were a single-game franchise record, surpassing the previous mark of 444 collected by Brian Sipe against the Baltimore Colts on October 25, 1981. \n\"I made a comment to Flip (offensive coordinator John DeFilippo) earlier in the week that we might have to throw 50 times to win it because as stout as they are up front, we knew it would be tough sledding running the football,\" Browns coach Mike Pettine said. \"I saw it potentially being one of those games where we were going to put it in his hands and we feel real good about our pass concepts and the volume in our pass game and the matchups we can go to, and I think Flip does an outstanding job getting guys in position to make plays, but you have to execute. We protected fairly well. Josh made some huge throws, and we made big-time plays on the receiving end of it.\" \nEight-time Pro Bowl left tackle Joe Thomas added, \"We obviously had no run game in the first quarter, so we said, 'Screw it. We're going to go three receivers. We're going to spread them out and we have a veteran quarterback that's going to be able to read the defense, read the coverage, see where they're coming from. \n\"And if they're going to try to blitz and take away our run game, he's going throw the ball to our jitterbugs outside or take the option, hit (Gary) Barnidge down the middle, and it's going to turn into a throwing game.' He's able to get us in the right thing. We give him the option to either line up in shotgun and hand it off if it's a good look or throw it if it's not a good look.\" \nMcCown has increased his passing yards in each of the last three weeks, and his total of 1,154 combined between starts against the Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers and Ravens are the most in a three-game stretch by any quarterback in Browns history. He is the first Browns quarterback to have three straight 300-yard passing performances. \n\"All I know is that we won the game,\" McCown said. \"That's cool stuff, and when you're done playing, that's cool things you can look back on and be proud of, but for me, there's other things that I want to be the first Browns quarterback to do, and that involves stuff with our team. \n\"That's where my mindset will be, and I just happen to represent that. That's a lot of effort from, first and foremost, John DeFilippo in the coordination of our offensive passing game, down to everybody around me, the O-line, the backs, the receivers. They all have a hand in making our pass game good, so I'm just thankful to be able a function in that.\" \nMcCown suffered an ankle injury when he got rolled up on by an offensive lineman late in the fourth quarter. But he was \"absolutely not\" going to miss any of the game against the Ravens. Following the injury, McCown threw for 32 yards in leading the offense down the field on the Browns' only possession of overtime. \n\"At the moment, it was pretty painful,\" McCown said. \"I think I'll be fine though. Not in that one. Not in that one. You glance down and make sure it's still attached, and if it is, you play.\" \nMcCown entered the 2015 season having won just one of his previous 11 starts, and then, lost his first three games with the Browns. However, despite his lack of success, McCown never stopped believing in himself. \nAnd that belief allowed him to engineer seven scoring drives in the win over Baltimore. \n\"The key word you just said was 'Everybody' wrote me off. I didn't write me off,\" McCown said. \"There's obviously some folks in Cleveland, with the team, that didn't write me off, and thankfully, my wife and kids didn't write me off. That's the key. As a player, as much as we respect what you guys do, it's hard. You've got to block out the noise and block out everything else that's surrounding it, and people's perception or critiques of who you are as a player and just keep moving forward. \n\"It's great, and after, I'll look at that. This is my 14th year professionally, 13th year in the NFL. I played in the UFL for crying out loud, so personal satisfaction kind of flew out the window. You know what I mean? But at the end of the day, when you've played that long, there's a lot of things that I'm thankful for. You look at the average career, and to play as long as I have, it's just an honor and a blessing to be able to play that long. \n\"It's fun to win. How I'm wired, it's just fun to do it with people together. To be in that locker room and watch everyone celebrate, and to know that this week in Cleveland, everybody's going to be excited -- going to work is going to be a better day tomorrow -- that's what gives me personal satisfaction, just knowing you were a part of a group of guys that can give that to a city. That's what makes it cool.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RCynGW TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:51:34.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
