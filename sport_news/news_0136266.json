Star running back Jamaal Charles has a tear in his ACL and is done for the season.\nIt's going to be at least six months before Charles will see the field again. The goal for doctors is to get Charles ready for next year.\n\"He's positive about coming back, getting himself back. That's where his energy will be directed. He'll get through the surgery and get himself back to where he can play. That's where it should be,\" head coach Andy Reid said.\n\"It's not every time you see those types of falls. And, no, you don't have an injury,\" Dr. Daniel Farrell of Overland Park Regional Medical Center stated.\nFarrell is an orthopedic surgeon. He says ACL surgery is pretty straightforward. First, holes are drilled to create a footprint for the joint.\n\"Then we pull this bone tendon bone graft up into this tunnel, across here, which recreates the ACL. Then, the other end of the graft, another bony side of the graft, goes into the socket of the femur,\" Farrell said.\nFarrell says Charles has factors working in his favor. First and foremost is the fact that he's an elite athlete.\n\"His tissue is extremely strong. and,his bones and tendons will be able to reconstruct with his own tissues. They're optimal,\" Ferrell noted.\nCharles was making a cut deep in Bears territory when he hurt his right knee in the third quarter of Sunday's loss to Chicago. His right knee buckled at a gruesome angle.\nThe four-time Pro Bowl selection needed help from a trainer and linebacker Justin Houston to get off the field, never once putting any weight on his right leg.\nCharles tore the ACL in his other knee four years ago, missing most of the season.\nWhile the injury typically sidelines a player for about a year, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson recently beat that timeline by several months. Peterson tore his ACL and MCL on Christmas Eve in 2011, but was back for Week one of the 2012 season.\nBeyond the injury, the question for the Chiefs is how do they replace one of the best running backs in the NFL, not to mention the most dynamic playmaker on their struggling offense?\nReid said the Chiefs would split carries between backups Knile Davis and Charcandrick West, and wide receiver De'Anthony Thomas has experience at running back. The Chiefs (1-4) also have Spencer Ware, a fullback-running back combo, available on the practice squad.\nAmong those available outside the organization are former Steelers running back Ben Tate and Ray Rice, though it appears the Chiefs have no interest in the controversial ex-Ravens star.\n\"We'll look in-house before we go there,\" Reid said.\nDavis hasn't played much this season while ceding time to West, but he has played well in the past when Charles has been out. He had back-to-back 100-yard rushing games early last season, and played well when Charles was hurt in a playoff game in Indianapolis two years ago.\nDavis is a downhill runner, while West offers an elusive change of pace. The former undrafted free agent out of Abilene Christian ran for 31 yards in Sunday's 18-17 loss to the Bears.\n\"They told us, me and Knile, that we're both going to play. We both have to be ready to step up,\" West said. \"We knew our big brother went down, so it's time to step up.\"\nIt's not just the fill-in running backs that need to step up, though. The Chiefs offense struggled when Charles went down, unable to move the ball through the air as much as the ground.\nAlex Smith was just 16 of 30 for 181 yards in another dismal performance. He was also sacked three times, raising his league-leading total to 22 sacks in just five games.\n\"It's not fun to be out there playing like that. We know we're so much better than that,\" Smith said. \"For me, there are two choices: I mean, yeah, you can let this get to you. We have a lot of football left. You can get sidetracked, you can get distracted, you can make excuses. Or we can all look internally, we can all stay together and we can fight.\"\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and the Associated Press.
