Alegado Cup Fiesta Basketball League in Consolacion, Cebu. \nOver at the Jugan gym, Cabangahan overhauled an 18-point deficit at the end of the third quarter to stun Pitogo, 55-52, and barge into the semis of the SK Category A, while Cansaga marched into the Final Four of the Inter-Barangay Seniors Category A after booting out Lamac by the narrowest of margins, 63-62. \nIt's still a bumpy road ahead though for Cabangahan and Cansaga as they face next the twice-to-beat Tayud and Jugan, respectively, for a berth into the finals of the month-long tournament fully supported by the local government of Consolacion under the dynamic leadership of Mayor Teresa ‘Nene’ Alegado and Vice Mayor Rey Damole. \nThe sporting event is co-chaired by municipal councilors Nilo Ferraren and Boy Tibon and ABC President Marilou Casul, while the games are supervised by Paul Alelu Q.
