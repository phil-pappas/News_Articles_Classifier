(AP) - Ben Bishop set a team record for career wins, Alex Killorn scored a go-ahead goal late in the third period and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 on Saturday night. \nTampa Bay also got a goal from Vladislav Namestnikov. \nSam Reinhart scored his first NHL goal for the Sabres, who have scored once in three of their five games this season. \nTampa Bay defenseman Victor Hedman, hurt when he was checked into the boards by Dallas' Jamie Benn in Thursday's 5-3 loss to the Stars, didn't play. The team said Hedman, who underwent concussion protocols, is day to day with an uspecified injury. \nBishop won his 84th game with the Lightning, breaking a tie with Nikolai Khabibulin after making 31 saves. \nChad Johnson made 20 saves for Buffalo. \nKillorn made it 2-1 from the low-right circle during a power play with 3:57 to play.
