Mississippi Power, Coast Electric, the city of Waveland and Hancock County's beautification committee are among the partners handling the cleanup.\nWLOX-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1LmN5NG ) an old washing machine, several boats and a couple of bath tubs were among the debris removed from the harbor's marshes.\nCraig Clement, of the Clermont Harbor Civic Association, says anything that came out of people's homes, ended up in the harbor.\nWaveland officials hope to follow up the effort with similar cleanup projects.
