(AP) - Joey Logano won at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Sunday to automatically advance to the third round of NASCAR's playoffs.\nThe race was rained out Saturday night and run instead in the middle of the day Sunday, and it ended with Logano beating reigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick to the finish line by 0.704 seconds.\nThe top six finishers were Chase for the Sprint Cup championship drivers, but it was a sloppy day for some of the biggest title contenders.\nJoe Gibbs Racing, the overwhelming favorites in the Chase, watched Matt Kenseth and Kyle Busch suffer through problems that led both of them to fall to the back of the championship standings. Same with Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was one of three Hendrick Motorsports drivers to have a rough day.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
