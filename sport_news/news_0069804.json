Murray's last carry came with 10:41 left in the third quarter, a 4-yard gain to the Raiders' 27-yard line.

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nThree games into the season, Cooper and Murray had a great deal to do with a developing Raiders offense, Cooper a rookie and the fourth pick of the draft, and Murray a third-year talent who seized the starting position with a strong training camp. \nThe biggest play turned in by either man came when Cooper streaked down the field and drew a 48-yard pass interference penalty by Bernard Roby, setting up 50-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. \n\"I thought he was free a couple of times,\" Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said. \"We had him on the (pass interference), and they chose to give us those yards via penalty versus catch. But the effectiveness of going to him and taking advantage of his abilities, I thought we did a decent job of that, particularly early.\" Advertisement \nOn the third play from scrimmage, Carr threw short to his left to Cooper for a 13-yard gain. In the second quarter, during an 80-yard scoring drive, Carr connected for 21 yards to Cooper on third-and-3 to the Denver 38. \nThose were the only passes thrown Cooper's way in the first half. In the second half, Cooper's receptions were for 7 and 6 yards, and no passes thrown his way in the game were incomplete. \nThe decreased production in the second half by Cooper mirrored the Raiders' 22-20 loss to Chicago the previous week. After catching four passes for 49 yards in the first half against the Bears, Cooper was shut out in the second half while guarded primarily by veteran defender and former Raider Tracy Porter. \nSunday's game was essentially over when Cooper fielded a punt with eight seconds to play, running it back 18 yards before he lateraled to Lorenzo Alexander, with Denver recovering the resulting fumble with time expired. \n\"I think we're still confident as a team,\" Cooper said. \"We just lost some close ones. We just have to play better at the end of the game. We knew it would be a tough game, a dogfight type game. That was our mindset coming in.\" Oakland Raiders' Latavius Murray (28) runs against Denver Broncos' Danny Trevathan (59) in the first quarter of their NFL game at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Calif, on Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nLikewise, Murray's second-half production declined in the last two losses after being a big part of wins over Baltimore and Cleveland, where he gained a combined 204 yards with two touchdowns. \nWhile two turnovers probably had something to do with Murray's absence at the end of the Bears game, he took a seat against the Broncos primarily because of a shoulder injury suffered against Chicago. \nAfter Murray's last carry, fullbacks Marcel Reece and Jamize Olawale, running back Roy Helu Jr. and Cooper on a lateral combined for seven rushes and 17 yards. \nDel Rio conceded Murray was \"banged up,\" but the thought was to go ahead and see what Murray could do given an approaching by week for rest. \n\"It was bothering me a little bit, Roy stepped in, and Marcel, and we mixed in different personnel,\" Murray said. \"I knew I was going to play, but things happen.\" For more on the Raiders, visit the Inside the Oakland Raiders blog at ibabuzz.com/oaklandraiders .
