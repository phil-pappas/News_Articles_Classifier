San Diego kicker Jack Flatau had made field goals of 49 and 32 yards.\nDayton (5-0, 2-0) was without Connor Kacsor — who came into the game leading the FCS in rushing (151.5 yards per game). The Flyers had just 57 total yards and trailed 9-3 at halftime.\nThe Flyers racked up 173 yards in the third, including a 55-yard touchdown pass from Alex Jeske to Tucker Yinger that gave Dayton the lead for good.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
