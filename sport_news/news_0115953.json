October 14, 2015, 6:22 PM by Brian Karstens SIOUX FALLS, SD - \nIt's that time of year again: Time for winter forecasts. On Thursday, NOAA will release their outlook for the upcoming winter season. While Scot's winter prediction will be coming soon, I thought I would add a little insight into the factors everyone will be keeping a close eye on. \nFirst, El Niño is going strong. There is no question this is going to impact our winter forecast. How it influences the forecast is real question. \nWater temperatures are above normal in much of the eastern Pacific Ocean. We think this will help drive the jet stream patterns this winter as well. In fact, it's very likely that any time we get Pacific air moving our way this winter, we'll be above normal. \nThe climate prediction center has locked in on this idea with their official December, January, and February forecast. The probability of a warmer than normal winter is high, especially compared to normal along the Canadian border. \nThe rain and snow outlook is interesting too The southern jet stream is often very active in an el nino year, so if you're heading to Arizona, Texas or Florida this winter, watch for wetter weather. KELOLAND is a closer call, which is why Scot Mundt does our official winter forecast. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
