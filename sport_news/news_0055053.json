A year ago, they lost in Game 7 to San Francisco. \n\"We came in with one goal and that was to get back to the World Series. It can't be any better than this,\" Cain said. \nJose Bautista's second homer of the game, a two-run shot in the top of the eighth, lifted Toronto into a 3-3 tie. \nBut any momentum Toronto might have had was washed away when a line of rain swept through town, sending players and fans scurrying for cover. \nAfter the delay, Cain promptly worked a leadoff walk from closer Roberto Osuna, and Hosmer followed with a clean single that Bautista fielded down the right-field line. \nRather than hit the cutoff man, though, Bautista threw to second to keep Hosmer to a single. That gave the speedy Cain, running full speed the entire way and being waved home by third base coach Mike Jirschele, enough time to beat the relay throw from second base with a textbook slide that ignited a sellout crowd. \n\"I was hustling all the way,\" Cain said. \"I don't know what happened I just kept going.\" \nThen it was up to Davis, who got the Royals out of a jam in the eighth, to finish it off. \nDavis gave up a single to Russell Martin and walked Kevin Pillar before striking out pinch-hitter Dioner Navarro. After stolen bases put runners on second and third, Davis struck out Ben Revere, then got Donaldson on a bouncer to third. \nKansas City shortstop Alcides Escobar was voted the ALCS MVP after going 11 for 23 (.478). And for the fifth time in two years, the Royals clinched a postseason series at home. \n\"They made a run at it,\" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \"I really couldn't be more proud of our guys. They laid it out every day, they're great competitors and a fun bunch, fun to be around every day.\" \nBen Zobrist and Mike Moustakas homered, and Alex Rios also drove in a run for Kansas City, which ended an embarrassing 29-year postseason drought just last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:10:55.072+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
