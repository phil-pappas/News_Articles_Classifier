Katherine McCarron, wife of Cincinnati Bengals backup quarterback AJ McCarron, took to social media Monday to rip the NFL Network for airing a postgame interview from the team’s locker room where numerous players could be seen in varying states of undress in the background.\nAdChoices Bengals cornerback Adam Jones was the subject of the interview by Albert Breer and the fact that players are unfairly subjected to cameras infiltrating an area that arguably should afford some semblance of privacy was the subject of McCarron’s Twitter rant.\nHow is this ok? What about female reporters required to get an interview? https://t.co/n3RSexRILR\n— Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) October 19, 2015\nNo missing the point. Players should have their privacy. I'm sure female reports would rather not be in there https://t.co/1FjAXHQxPH\n— Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) October 19, 2015\nI would rather my husbands ass/penis not be all over TV. Would you like to be filmed while naked? https://t.co/0cWsGDE5zj\n— Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) October 19, 2015\nSunday’s incident certainly wasn’t the first time a player appeared nude during a postgame segment — then-Minnesota Vikings tight end Visanthe Shiancoe’s appearance naked following a 2008 game arguably is the most infamous incident ( although there have been others ) — and if the policies don’t change, it certainly won’t be the last time such a mess-up occurs.\nThe NFL Network has since acknowledged mistakes were made. Alex Riethmiller, NFL Network’s vice president of communications, said Monday that “it was a regrettable mistake by our production team.”\n“We’ve already done a pretty thorough review of the procedures and processes that were dropped along the way to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Riethmiller said, via ESPN.\nBengals offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth railed against the policy of allowing cameras in the locker room, calling it “a big issue” and “wrong.”\n“It’s not like it bothers me personally,” Whitworth said. “[But] you can’t judge us off who we will and won’t accept into our locker room and then say all these things we have to do, but then also put us in a situation where every single day I have to change clothes and be naked or not in front of media. It’s just not right. There’s no office. There’s no other situation in America where you have to do that. It’s dated, it’s old, and it needs to change.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2014/01/09/pat-mcafee-still-fees-bad-about-andrew-luck-pic/", "https://t.co/0cWsGDE5zj", "https://twitter.com/_KatherineWebb/status/656217677699162112", "https://t.co/n3RSexRILR", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13927107/nfl-network-cites-production-mistake-nudity-cincinnati-bengals-locker-room-interview", "https://twitter.com/_KatherineWebb/status/656216906165329924", "https://t.co/1FjAXHQxPH", "https://twitter.com/_KatherineWebb/status/656216088204738561", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:39:19.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
