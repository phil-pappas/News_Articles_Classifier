Eight individuals topped 36 all-around, the magic number to advance from next month’s sectional meet to the state finals.\n\"Everyone’s getting better and better,\" Johnson said, \"that’s just how the sport is going.\"\nGoing in, it seemed difficult to imagine the Ramapo senior topping what she did last year, when her gold-medal tallies included 38.25 all-around and a meet-record 9.9 on vault.\nThis time, her 38.7 trumped the all-around standard set by Green Raider alum Chelsea Goldschrafe (38.5 in 2007). Johnson edged Marion for the vault title, 9.85-9.8, before Marion returned the favor on beam by coming out on top, 9.55-9.5.\n\"This is the best meet I’ve ever seen, and I’m the luckiest girl in this gym,\" Ramapo coach Michelle Markowski said. \"Emma had an awesome day, and Sammy had a great return [from a sore back].\"\nFloor was the event where competitors really pushed each other to be at their best. Three girls — Ridgewood’s Mika Tamura and Katherine Muccio and Pascack’s Melissa Riccardi — tied for fifth at 9.525, Marion (9.575) edged them for fourth, and Johnson tied Ridgewood’s Victoria Purritano for second at 9.625.\n\"Things like that definitely help us to be better,\" Johnson said, speaking for herself and her team as a whole. \nThe gold medalist on floor was Holy Angels junior Alexis Driscoll, who became the first county champion in program history. She scored a personal-best 9.65 with a routine to which she recently added more degree of difficulty, including a front-handspring, front-full twist sequence.\nJohnson won the uneven bars competition with a 9.725, while Purritano (9.375) collected a second silver medal in the event.\nMarion (38.025), Tamura (37.225), Pascack Regional senior Jillian Dean (36.625) and Northern Highlands freshman Erika Kluge (36.175) each set a personal record in the all-around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:23.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
