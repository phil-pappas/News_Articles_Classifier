MARK OSTOW Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement “When a job is in high demand, the job seeker has way more negotiating power,” said Glassdoor analyst Scott Dobroski. Roles like social media manager, UX designer, and web developer – all jobs in demand in the Boston area – also made the top 10 ranking.\nBut what did workers mean when they said their job had good-work life balance? According to Dobroski, employees said they valued having alternative working arrangements, flexible hours, and the ability to work from home.\n“Employers these days don’t necessarily care whether you’re working 9 to 5, or 10 to 6, or splitting your day,” Dobroski explained. “That’s the theme with the top 25 here.”\nThough all of the top jobs may be high in demand, their salaries varied widely, with data scientists pulling in an average salary of $114,808, and substitute teachers making just $24,380 per year.\nThe top 25 jobs are outliers in their flexibility; as mentioned, Glassdoor has found that U.S. workers are increasingly feeling less satisfied with their work-life balance, with employees reporting an average satisfaction rating of 3.5 in 2009, 3.4 in 2012, and 3.2 thus far in 2015.\n“Work-life balance decreasing is not a huge surprise because of the advancement of technology,” Dobroski said. “It’s great that you can respond to emails or take off in the afternoon for a soccer game if you have to, but it’s also a blessing and a curse because you are accessible, and some managers may not have a good balance and flow there. Each company is figuring it out on their own terms.”\nWhich occupations had some of the lowest satisfaction ratings for work-life balance? According to Dobroksi, reporters, mental health therapists, and social workers all gave their jobs scores of 3.0 or below.", "external_links": ["http://www.glassdoor.com/blog/25-jobs-worklife-balance-2015/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:54:02.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
