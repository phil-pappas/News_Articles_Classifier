Exodus NYC smacks Castle Athletics, 46-30 This was the opening round of the playoffs for both of these teams, and the winner of this game was going to have to get right back on the court to take on one of New Jersey's top H.S. teams in Gill St. Bernard's.Early on Castle, led by a lineup consisting primarily of girls from Murry Bergtraum H.S., was able to hang tough with Exodus, but the perimeter shooting of Dara Mabrey (Manasquan, NJ '18) , and the interior presence of Abbie Wolf (Greenwich, CT '16) proved to be too much as Exodus wore down Castle and coasted late for the win. Deja Francis '17 got things off nicely for Castle as she was able to attack the Exodus defense and get to the FT line where she rock solid, but Wolf was able to get in great positions down low and finish with an array of spins in the paint to get Castle all sorts of issues inside.Combined the strong play of Wolf with Mabrey's excellent shooting touch, and Exodus was up at the half by a score of 24-11.For the most part in the 2nd half, Exodus was in control as Donnetta Johnson (Holderness School, NH '18) was the recipient of some excellent passes from Mabrey, while Kaela Hilaire (Floral Park '16) also started to get going, pushing the offense up the floor, leading to easy transition buckets for the NYC Nike EYBL power. Jozai Vazquez '18 was a physical presence down low for Castle as the Bergtraum forward was able to finish around the rim and cut the deficit down to 36-26 with 7:15 to go, but that is when after an Exodus timeout, they ended up putting it away.A 10-0 run for all intents and purposes put the game to bed as Mabrey hit a trey from the left side, and Erykah Russell (Nazareth '16) provided a nice 1-2 punch in the paint with Wolf as Exodus were able to control things late and advance to the next round with the 16 point win, 46-30.Wolf, Mabrey, and Russell all led Exodus with 9 points apiece in the win, while in defeat it was Vazquez who paced Castle with 11. Gill St. Bernard's (NJ) Over Exodus NYC 47-44 The joy of victory was short lived for Exodus as after a short break they came back to take on Gill St. Bernard's in the Round of 16, but playing without Wolf who had to leave before their 2nd game, Exodus seemed sluggish, and even with a late comeback effort, they couldn't overcome the big deficit and fell to the NJ power by 3.It seemed like this was going to be a real back and forth contest as early on both teams were trading buckets as the game was tied at 11 with 9:40 to go in the half, but that is when Gill St. Bernard's, and more specifically Sam Kramer '16 , took over.Kramer started what proved to be a 14-1 run when she stole a pass at midcourt and took it in for an easy layup. That was followed by a long straightaway uncontested three ball, one of three for Kramer in the opening half.If that wasn't enough, when the Exodus defense did apply pressure to Kramer, she found open teammates like Nisani Santiago '19 , who scored 5 points late in the half herself as a once tie game at 11 expanded to become a 25-12 lead at the break for Gill St. Bernard's.It was 30-16 for Gill St. Bernard's with 12:14 to go in the game, and it looked like they NJ squad was in firm control, but when you have the talent that Exodus has you just cannot rule them out. You knew they had one more run in them, and this was when that run came.Russell scored off a feed from Mabrey, and then Mabrey converted on a layup off a steal and within 22 seconds, the deficit was just 10.Johnson hit on a pair of FT's, and then Hilaire found Johnson once again cutting to the rim, and with 8:34 to go, we had a ballgame as the crowd started to sense the momentum shift and get back into this one.Without Wolf, Russell was stepping up in a major way, and with the Nazareth post threat controlling the inside, a once 15 point lead in the 2nd half for Gill St. Bernard's was cut to just 32-31 with 6:26 to go in the game.All Exodus needed was one stop to have a chance at the lead, but Maddie Gallic '16 ended up posting up inside and she got her way around Russell for the bucket and the foul. That proved to be a huge turning point as it stopped momentum and allowed Gill St. Bernard's to go back up by 4.A turnover in the frontcourt by Exodus allowed Santiago to free up on the right wing where she nailed a three pointer, and the lead was back up to 7, and things once again looked bleak for Exodus.They did end up having 1 more run, cutting it to 2 in the closing seconds. A quick foul was applied with 3 seconds to go, and Exodus needed Santiago to miss at least 1 of 2 from the line, the freshman gave them that glimmer of hope, missing the 2nd after she drained the 1st, but Mabrey didn't have enough time to get close enough for a good looking, falling short with a long heave at the buzzer, giving Gill St. Bernard's the tough and hard fought 47-44 victory.Kramer had 13 of her game high 19 points in the opening half, though she was a consummate playmaker at the lead guard spot and led Gill St. Bernard's to the win. Santiago added 11, and Gallic had 10 for the winners as well.For Exodus, Johnson had 12 points to lead the way in the loss, with Hilaire and Russell adding 10 and 9 points respectively in the defeat. New Heights Edge Riverside Hawks (Red), 44-40 In what may have proven to be the game of the day, New Heights didn't have their best game, as combined an early 8:30am start with the fact that they had to face off against a tough Riverside team, you knew it wasn't going to be easy.Down the stretch though when her team needed her, Sydney Zambrotta (Christ the King '16) come up big like the star that she is, helping her New Heights team hold off a difficult challenge from the Hawks and taking the 4 point win.Zambrotta had 5 straight early in the opening half to give New Heights the lead, but back to back buckets by Anna Zaborowska (Copiague '17) saw Riverside take their first lead at 15-13 with 2:20 to go in the half. Kaelynn Satterfield (Christ the King '19) scored off a feed from the birthday girl Milicia Reid (Bishop Loughlin '17) to tie the game back up, and with a spin in the lane in the closing seconds of the half, Mikaiya Moore (Copiague '16) was able to finish the half strong for New Heights and give them a 20-19 lead at the break.The Hawks wasted no time regaining the lead as star sophomore Kadaja Bailey (St. Mary's '18) drained a long three from the left side. That three was quickly erased though by Moore who was able to get in great positions to score down low time after time in the second half as no one proved to be a bigger difference maker in this one than the underrated senior from Long Island.New Heights was never able to pull away, but they never surrendered the lead either in the 2nd half. Moore had 12 points in the half, and while she didn't have a big time scoring game, Zambrotta hit clutch FT's down the stretch.Riverside had a chance to tie the game late, but down by three at 42-39, New Heights fouled to put Jourdin Thomas (South Side '17) on the FT line instead of giving up a 3 point look.Thomas made the first, and then missed the second on purpose, but the rebound went to Moore, who was immediately fouled, and swished both FT's to seal the game away with 3.7 seconds to play.It was not the cleanest of all games, and it wasn't a game that made head coach Chez Williams happy, but a win is a win, and New Heights is advancing to the Round of 16 on Sunday with a 44-40 win over the Riverside Hawks.Moore had a game high 21 points for New Heights in a fantastic all around effort, with Zambrotta and Satterfield adding 8 points apiece for the winners as well.Bailey had a big time second half to keep Riverside close in this one as she had 11 of her 16 points in the second half, but it was not enough as they fell just short from advancing to play another day. Positive Direction stomps Newark Tech H.S., 50-28 This Positive Direction team is actually The Mary Louis Academy, so this was an NYC vs. NJ H.S. matchup, and from the get go it was too much Danielle Patterson '17 as the forward dominated in the paint in scoring 20 points to help easily lead the Hilltoppers past Newark Tech.TMLA scored the first 12 points of the game, with Patterson scoring 8 of those 12, and it took until nearly midway through the opening half when Dayjah Anderson '16 scored on a runner in the lane for Newark Tech, but at that point, it was already all Mary Louis as they were dominating in all areas of the game. Kayla Podlovits '17 was getting excellent looks from the outside that she was connecting on, Jasmine Brunson '16 was doing a great job in leading the offense from the point guard position, and Celeste Moran '16 was doing a great job on the glass alongside Patterson as Mary Louis went up 23-5 at the half.Newark Tech to their credit never gave up and crawled back within 11 at 28-17 with 9:30 to go in the game, but Brunson finishing on a drive that saw her fall hard on her back, a fall that would see her have to sit out the rest of the game, but with Patterson getting looks once again inside, and Vanerlie Valcourt '18 doing an excellent job slashing her way for bucket after bucket, the Hilltoppers couldn't be stopped as they took over the game in the closing minutes and rolled to the 50-28 victory.Patterson had 20 points in the win, 14 of which came in the decisive opening half that really helped put the game away. Valcourt had 11 points, all of which came in the 2nd half, and Podlovits added 8 for the winners in convincing fashion to see them move on to the Round of 16.Anderson had 9 points to lead Newark Tech, while her twin sister, Nyasia Anderson '16 also had 9 in the defeat. It was not an easy day at the office though for talented young post player Mariah Perez '19 as against the talent of Patterson she struggled to get going finishing with just 1 point in the loss. New Jersey Panthers Knock Off Long Island Lutheran 30-21 This was probably not the result that LuHi head coach Rich Slater was expecting, but he brought only his 9th and 10th graders, so playing against a team full of seniors proved to be tough as his youngsters got down early, and never could crawl out of the hole they dug themselves into, falling to defeat in the opening round at the Rose Classic by 9.The Long Island Lutheran offense never got going early on as both Grace Stone '18 and Celeste Taylor '19 struggled to find their range, and when they made the adjustment to take the ball to the rim, they couldn't buy a bucket inside either. Blair Watson (Nutley, NJ '16) scored half of her teams points in the opening half as she had 8 points, and even though the Panthers were struggling against the Crusaders pressure, they were able to build enough of a cushion to take a 16-7 lead into the half.Connecting on just 2 threes for the entire game for a team that was loaded with perimeter weapons, really set back LuHi, but they were able to cut the Panthers lead to just 26-19 with 2:48 to go after Taylor hit on a pair of FT's.A drive by Stella Johnson (Morris Catholic, NJ '16) bumped the lead back to 9 for the Panthers, and Marika Korpinen '18 couldn't connect on the jumper to answer for the Crusaders. LuHi had numerous opportunities to steal the ball and score easy baskets driving to the rim, but missing layups and missing open jumpers would come back to haunt the Crusaders as the youth and inexperience caught up to them at the Rose as they fell to defeat to a solid NJ Panthers team in this one, 30-21.Watson had 12 points for the Panthers to be their leading scorer, with Johnson adding 7 of her own in the winning effort.It was a game to forget for Long Island Lutheran as the defending NYS Class \"AA\" Federation Champions were led by Taylor's 7 points, while Stone added 6 in the defeat. New Jersey Sparks Bust Up- Team Mike Moore 73-33 Team Mike Moore was playing this one without two of their better players as Jai Moore (Midwood '16) was out with an injury, while Alexis Sykes (Nazareth '17) was away on an unofficial visit to UMass-Lowell this weekend.Without those two this game turned into a blowout quickly as Kelly Reilly (Montville, NJ '16) hit on 5 first half threes, while Blessing Ejiofor (Paterson Eastside, NJ '16) was dominating a small and undersized Team Mike Moore frontline as at the half the Sparks had a 40-13 lead.You do have to give the Brooklyn based Team Mike Moore squad credit for not giving up as Abby Weiss (Boys and Girls '17) was able to connect on a couple of nice jumpers, while Zaria Mohamed (Curtis '16) was a solid offensive weapon down low in the second half as she was much more aggressive around the rim, and was able to finish more times than not against a much bigger and much more physically imposing NJ Sparks team.Unfortunately for Team Mike Moore though, Reilly kept on hitting threes as she was left wide open far too often to connect, and add in a strong second half from the likes of Ejiofor, Megan Swords (Immaculate Heart Academy, NJ '16) , and Breyenne Bellerand (Immaculate Conception, NJ '17) , and the Sparks were able to run away with ease in this one, coasting to the Round of 16 with a 73-33 blowout victory.Reilly connected on 8 of 11 threes and had 24 points in the win for the Sparks. Swords and Bellerand had 11 points each, and Ejiofor added 10 for the winners in a dominant all-around performance by the entire team.A shorthanded Team Mike Moore team was led by Mohamed and her 13 points, while it was Weiss who chipped in by adding 9 points of her own in the loss.
