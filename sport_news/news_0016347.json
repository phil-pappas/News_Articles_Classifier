College football | Central Ohio Watch: Daivon Barrow, Ashland High schools Football team set to battle Golden Gales By Mark Znidar The Columbus Dispatch • Tuesday October 13, 2015 4:54 AM \nIt has been only two weeks since a surgeon cut into one of Daivon Barrow’s shoulders and repaired two tears in a labrum, but he was present and accounted for on the practice field Monday afternoon. \nIt didn’t matter that Barrow, a junior linebacker from Eastmoor Academy, won’t be able to play again until spring practice. \n“I have to suck this up,” he said. “I go to practice every single day. Hey, the team is moving forward. I’m trying to help my replacement, Toney Peters. I’m out there showing him the keys. I watch the game and tell Toney and others what to look for. I love the game of football. It is a team sport. I can still help.” \nThe Eagles (6-0) are ranked eighth in the American Football Coaches Association Division II poll. They are on track to win their first Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference South Division championship since 2012. \nBarrow played a large part in getting the team a foothold despite never being healthy. \n“I got hurt in the first game,” he said. “I made a tackle and landed on the shoulder wrong. I kept playing. I was defensive player of the game the second game against Walsh.” \nTrainers went so far as to order a brace so Barrow could play with the injury. \n“But in the fourth game against Findlay, the shoulder kept sliding in and out,” he said. “I still played, but things just weren’t working out. I was having a good year.” \nThrough four games, Barrow ranked fifth on the team with 24 tackles. He had two interceptions. Ashland has been talking to the NCAA about getting an extra season of eligibility for Barrow, a sports administration major. \nToledo and several other teams from the Mid-American Conference showed interest in Barrow during his junior year of high school before backing off. He is small for his position at 5 feet 11 and 223 pounds. Three weeks before national letters of intent could be signed, he visited Ashland and was sold on the team and university. \n“This has been a good situation for me because we play hard-nosed football, and that’s how we play at Eastmoor,” Barrow said. “We hit you hard. The coaches here like the way I play. That’s the only way to play.” Others to watch \n• Cory Beasy , Alderson Broaddus : Beasy, a junior from Westland, has started 30 straight games at left offensive tackle. \n• Jalen Wells , St. Francis : Wells, a sophomore cornerback from Thomas Worthington, has 17 tackles to rank fifth on the team. \n• Tyler Tate, Bowling Green : Tate, a senior kicker from Bloom-Carroll, was 8 of 8 on extra points, kicked field goals of 37 and 27 yards and had four touchbacks in a 62-38 victory over Massachusetts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:46:51.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
