Join the Conversation Auburn Authority Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 8:38 p.m. CDT October 1, 2015 \nFormer Auburn offensive coordinator Al Borges returns to Jordan-Hare Stadium for the first time Saturday since serving under Tommy Tuberville from 2004-08. Borges is currently the offensive coordinator at San Jose State (Photo: File Photo) \nAUBURN – Al Borges knows his return to Auburn Saturday could result in a similar way to when he coached on the staff as Will Muschamp . \nBorges, the man who now leads San Jose State’s offense, makes his return to Auburn this weekend and he said he is reminded of a drill at the end of an Auburn’s practice about eight years ago under head coach Tommy Tuberville . \n\"We were not near as good on offense as we were my first two years and we were good on defense,\" Borges said Wednesday in a teleconference. \"We would run this two-minute drill at the end of practice and the defense would inevitably kick our butt and I would inevitably get mad, because I do that.” \nGetting the hefty Borges to explode in anger was funny to a young Muschamp, who was beginning his career that would lead him to be considered one of the better defensive coordinators in the country. \n\"Will would go, 'OK, it's time for the Al Borges drill.' He knew when the drill was over, I was going to be mad. That I do remember. I remember it like it was yesterday.\" \nNow Borges, who turns 60 years old this month, returns to Auburn with a little less heft to his body as he’s lost 75 pounds since he was the Auburn offensive coordinator from 2004-08 but he still has the classic self-deprecating humor. \n\"It's like tossing a lawn chair off the Titanic. I'm still too fat, but I'm less fat,\" Borges said. \nWith both men being a little older, wiser and both having been fired at previous stops along the coaching profession, Borges now looks at his professional reunion with Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp as much more simple relationship. Borges is preparing his San Jose State (2-2) offense in Saturday’s matchup at Jordan Hare Stadium (3 p.m., SEC Network) for the same effort he saw eight years ago from a Muschamp-led defense. \n\"I'm expecting them to play their butts off because that's all I know with Will Muschamp's defense,\" Borges said. \"My exposure, when we coached against him at LSU and I worked with him at Auburn, is those guys were 11 bullets running to the ball. And if they weren't, he was screaming bloody murder.” \nBorges admits that he sees Muschamp constantly changing things with the Tigers scheme from a personnel standpoint and possibly even screaming more as he continues to rebuild Auburn’s defense. \n\"He is a demanding guy, that's going to see to it that he gets 11, and I know he's fired a lot of guys looking at their roster,” Borges said. “Every time I watch a game there's a bunch of new guys in there but he's going to find the 11 (players) that are going to play Will Muschamp football.\" \nBorges said he loved the fiery attitude of a young Muschamp that has now developed the in-your-face reputation that goes with the nickname ‘Coach Boom’. \n\"We had a very good relationship, I think, and a very professional relationship and great respect for each other,\" said Borges. \"If guys are so competitive with each other that they can't see the forest through the trees, I don't know that that's very helpful. But we didn't have that. We had a good relationship.\" \nMuschamp said Sunday Borges’ pro-style scheme has a lot of movement that will be designed to distract his players before the snap. \n\"He does a really good job with motions and shifts and giving you situations where you have to leverage the formations well,” Muschamp said. “I think at the end of the day this is a little overrated. They’ve got 11 on the field. We got 11 on the field.” \nBorges said he looks back fondly at his time with the Auburn program and the people that he still considers close friends. \n\"I'd been coaching a long time when I went to Auburn, and it was really neat,” Borges said. “It's good for me to come back. I haven't been back to Auburn since 2008…it would be nice if there was more time and I could see some people, but I am looking forward to it. The game will be fun and we'll see what we can do.\" Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp talks MSU loss and improvements he saw Saturday in the 17-9 loss.
