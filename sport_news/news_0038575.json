(Mark Humphrey / Associated Press) Associated Press \nMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Paxton Lynch threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns as Memphis stunned No. 13 Mississippi, 37-24, on Saturday. \nMemphis (6-0) has won 13 straight games dating back to last season, which is the third longest streak in the nation. It was the first win for the Tigers over a ranked opponent since 1996. \nOle Miss (5-2) jumped out to a 14-0 lead less than six minutes into the game — partly thanks to a 68-yard touchdown pass by receiver Laquon Treadwell on a trick play — but Memphis responded with 31 unanswered points to take a 31-14 lead early in the third quarter. \nLynch was superb, completing 39 of 53 passes. Anthony Miller caught 10 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Rebels were able to pull within 31-24 later in the third quarter, but could get no closer. Treadwell caught a school-record 14 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown. \nIt was an impressive performance for the Tigers, who now have a legitimate claim at being the best team in the country that's not in a Power Five conference. \nThe 6-foot-7, 245-pound Lynch did whatever he wanted against the Rebels' secondary for most of the afternoon, helping the Tigers regroup following the rough start. \nOle Miss' Chad Kelly completed 33 of 47 passes for 372 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. \nNo. 2 Baylor 62, West Virginia 38 \nWACO, Texas -- Corey Coleman caught three more touchdowns and second-ranked Baylor won its FBS-best 19th consecutive home game, getting some measure of revenge with the win. \nColeman matched and then broke the single-season school record for TD catches, his nation-leading 16 coming halfway through the regular season for the Bears (6-0, 3-0 Big 12). \nSeth Russell became the only Baylor quarterback other than Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III in 2011 to throw for 300 yards and run for 100 yards in the same game. Russell had five TD passes and ran 14 times for 160 yards with another score. \nBaylor's only regular-season loss last year was 41-27 at West Virginia, and the Bears wound up the first team left out of the initial College Football Playoff. \nSkyler Howard, from Fort Worth, Texas, less than 100 miles from the Baylor campus, threw four TD passes for West Virginia (3-3, 0-3). \nNo. 11 Florida State 41, Louisville 21 \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Everett Golson threw for 372 yards and three touchdowns as No. 11 Florida State rallied in the second half to secure the victory. \nIt is the eighth 300-yard game of Golson's career and his second since transferring earlier this summer. A 70-yard touchdown pass to Kermit Whitfield, who had nine receptions for 172 yards, gave the Seminoles a 20-14 lead with 8:05 remaining. \nThe win gives Florida State a 6-0 record for the third straight season. The Seminoles are 4-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Cardinals drop to 2-4 and 1-2 in the ACC. \nDalvin Cook had his fourth 100-yard game of the season, gaining 163 yards on 22 carries. \nLouisville's Lamar Jackson passed for a career-high 307 yards and James Quick had five receptions for 130 yards and three touchdowns. \nNo. 17 Iowa 40, No. 20 Northwestern 10 \nEVANSTON, Ill. -- Reserve running back Akrum Wadley ran for 192 yards and tied Iowa's school record with four rushing touchdowns. \nWith leading rusher Jordan Canzeri sidelined in the first quarter with an ankle injury, Wadley took over for Iowa (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten). The injury occurred following a short run when linebacker Jaylen Prater landed on Canzeri, folding his ankle under a pile of players. \nWadley, who had only eight carries coming into the game, scored his third touchdown on a 2-yard run with 6:42 remaining in the third quarter, extending Iowa's lead to 23-10. His record-tying fourth scoring run, which followed a Northwestern fumble on the Wildcats ensuing drive, came on a 4-yard run that. \nNorthwestern (5-2, 1-2) lost for the second straight week after five consecutive victories. \nNo. 22 Toledo 63, Eastern Michigan 20 \nTOLEDO, Ohio -- Phillip Ely threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns as No. 22 Toledo improved to 6-0 for the first time since 1997. \nThe Rockets (6-0, 2-0 Mid-American Conference) led 28-6 at halftime, and then Ely really warmed up. He threw touchdown passes on Toledo's first two possessions of the second half, connecting with Corey Jones for a 55-yard score and then with Cody Thompson on an 88-yarder four minutes later. \nThe touchdown to Thompson was the fourth longest completion in school history, and it wasn't the only record book-worthy play of the game against an Eastern Michigan (1-6, 0-3) defense that entered the game ranked 118th in scoring defense (40.7 points) and 116th in total defense (495.3 yards). \nWisconsin 24, Purdue 7 \nMADISON, Wis. -- Alec Ingold ran for two short scores, Joel Stave threw for 322 yards and Wisconsin's stifling defense held Purdue to a season-low 191 yards. \nThe Badgers (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) overcame several penalties and other mistakes in the red zone to win on homecoming weekend at Camp Randall Stadium. \nWisconsin led just 10-7 late in the third quarter until two rushing touchdowns in an eight-minute span between the third and fourth quarters. \nT.J. Edwards then forced the Boilermakers' Markell Jones to fumble at the Purdue 43. Safety Tanner McEvoy pounced on the ball to seal the win for the Badgers. \nEdwards, one of two freshmen starting at inside linebacker for Wisconsin, finished with 16 tackles. \nThe only score for Purdue (1-6, 0-3) came on David Blough's 2-yard quarterback keeper in the second quarter. \nPittsburgh 31, Georgia Tech 28 \nATLANTA -- Nate Peterman threw three touchdown passes and Chris Blewitt kicked a 56-yard field goal in the closing minutes to help Pittsburgh win. \nPeterman completed 14 of 21 passes for 162 yards. \nTyler Boyd had eight catches with two touchdowns to become Pitt's career leading receiver, and the Panthers burned all but 1 minute, 4 seconds of the final 8:13 with a 14-play drive that ended on Blewitt's school record-long kick. \nPitt (5-1, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) is unbeaten in its first three conference games for the first time since 2010. \nGeorgia Tech (2-5, 0-4 ACC) has lost five straight, its longest single-season skid since it went 1-10 in 1996. The Jackets, who began the season as favorites to win the league's Coastal Division, must regroup before hosting No. 11 Florida State next weekend. \nArmy 21, Bucknell 14 \nWEST POINT, N.Y. -- A.J. Schurr came off the bench to run for two touchdowns and threw for the winning score. \nSchurr connected with Edgar Poe, who won a jump ball over Nick O'Brien and ran all the way to the end zone for a 68-yard score, to put Army up with 4:44 left. Chris Carnegie intercepted R.J. Nitti on Bucknell's ensuing drive to clinch it. \nFollowing a 44-3 rout by Duke last week, Army (2-5) won at home for the first time this season despite trailing at halftime 14-7. The Black Knights came back from a halftime deficit for the first time under second-year coach Jeff Monken, improving to 1-9 when down at the break. Nitti finished 17 for 33 for 186 yards and Matt DelMauro added 105 on the ground for the Bison (3-3).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:46:26.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
