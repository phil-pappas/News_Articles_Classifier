(USATSI) \nThe Los Angeles Dodgers were able to get the job done with their backs against the wall in Game 4 of the NLDS on Tuesday night, winning 3-1. This means the best-of-5 series is now tied 2-2 and heads back to Los Angeles for Game 5 on Thursday. \nHere are seven things to know about Game 4. \n1. Clayton Kershaw was The Man \nWe all heard about it. Many of us discussed how there was something about the postseason that just caused Kershaw to not be what he is during the regular season. I continued to insist that it was just coincidence and hopefully the Game 4 outing wakes the masses up. \nHeading into the game, Kershaw was 1-6 with a 4.99 ERA in the postseason in his career. \nIn Game 4, Kershaw was nails. He came out on short rest and allowed only one run (a solo homer) on three hits while walking one and striking out eight. Aside from the homer, the Mets never had a runner past first base. \nPut simply: The Dodgers' backs were against the wall and Kershaw put the team on his back. That's an ace effort. Now that he's done it, maybe people can look past the few instances where he had some blips on the radar in the postseason. \n2. Give credit to Daniel Murphy for his homer off Kershaw \nHitting home runs off Clayton Kershaw is difficult. As a left-hander, it's even more difficult. Doing so in two straight Kershaw starts, get outta here. But that's what Murphy did with his solo shot off Kershaw in Game 4. \nThe last time a lefty hit two homers in the same season off Kershaw was in 2013, when Jay Bruce did so twice in the same game ( via ESPN Stats and Info ). \nAs far as career, get this: \nLHB with 2 HR off Clayton Kershaw, career: Dunn 4 Votto 2 CarGo 2 J.Bruce 2 Hawpe 2 Daniel Murphy 2 (both this series) — Eric Stephen (@truebluela) October 14, 2015 \nSo, again, credit to Murphy. \n3. A.J. Ellis has a long postseason hitting streak \nThe Dodgers catcher has hit safely in 12 consecutive postseason games, which sets a Dodgers record. \nIn terms of all franchises, Ellis is five games away from tying the record. Manny Ramirez, Derek Jeter and Hank Bauer are tied at 17. Pat Borders had a 16-gamer. Marquis Grissom and Rickey Henderson had 15-game streaks. In all, only 18 players have ever had a longer postseason hitting streak than Ellis ( full list here ). \n4. Justin Turner was worth a big hit and fun fact in this one \nThe difference in this one? Former Mets player turned Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner had a two-RBI double in the third inning in a game the Dodgers won 3-1. Turner was once non-tendered by the Mets (which is essentially cutting him loose) and Tuesday he was intentionally walked by them in an elimination playoff game. \nThat's pretty funky. \nIn all, Turner is 7 for 15 (.467) with four doubles and three RBI in the series. He's been the Dodgers' best offensive weapon and the Mets once discarded him. \n5. Jacob deGrom warmed up \nPrior to Bartolo Colon relieving Mets starter Steven Matz , Mets ace Jacob deGrom actually got up in the bullpen. It seemed a bit odd, given that the Mets had a 2-1 series lead and were trailing 3-1 in the game at the time. \nBasically, though, it seems like the Mets were just trying to mess with the Dodgers' heads. In the post-game comments, we saw deGrom say he wasn't going to be inserted into the game under any circumstance while manager Terry Collins said he wasn't bringing in deGrom even if the Mets tied it up. \nDeGrom is going to start Game 5. Pay no attention to him warming up in the bullpen in Game 4. Pitchers have side sessions on off-days. \n6. Enrique Hernandez is proving a good choice by Dodgers \nJoc Pederson is still a superior defender in center field than anyone else the Dodgers have, but he's been lost at the plate for a long time. From the beginning of July to the end of the regular season, Pederson hit .170/.300/.284 with just six homers. In Game 1 of the NLDS, Pederson went 0 for 3 with a strikeout (and an intentional walk). \nSince then, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly has decided to employ Kiké Hernandez as his center fielder and he used him in the leadoff spot on Tuesday. \nSo far in the series, Hernandez is 4 for 10 with a .500 on-base percentage and three runs scored. He can be removed late for Pederson for defensive purposes (as he was in Game 4) and this seems to be working for Mattingly. \n7. Chase Utley could have served his suspension already \nUtley was slapped with a two-game suspension before Game 3 and appealed it, but he didn't see action in Games 3 or 4. He could have already gotten this thing over with. \nInstead, it might linger into the NLCS, if the Dodgers advance. \nNow, let's be clear on a few points here. First of all, the decision to appeal was Utley's, not the Dodgers. So anyone blaming the Dodgers for the appeal and then not playing him is off base. Secondly, Utley's not an everyday starter for the Dodgers anyway, so it's not like the Dodgers had to go out of their way to not use him. Howie Kendrick had a much better season. \nStill, it's interesting to note that Utley appealed a suspension he could have served with all the circumstances remaining the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:16:06.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
