So a group of three redshirt seniors and two redshirt juniors approached Dungey and helped him get back on track.\n\"They just kept patting Eric on the back after the first half,\" SU offensive coordinator Tim Lester said. \"saying, 'Hey, we've got you man. You've struggled here, you've struggled there, you're not playing great, but just keep going. Keep playing.'\n\"That's a hard lesson to learn in this game with all the emotional swings.\"\nDungey responded by leading Syracuse to three touchdowns, a marked improvement from his first-half performance, though it wasn't enough as USF won 45-24. He completed 16-of-24 passes for 192 yards, two touchdowns and an interception after halftime to go with 18 rushing yards and another score.\nLester said that Dungey, who was not available for interview as he was getting treatment, calmed down after a first-half performance that one would expect from a freshman.\nHe misread a couple defensive ends, keeping or giving a handoff that he should have done the other, missed a couple open receivers and turned the wrong way on the second play of the game.\n\"That's going to happen when you have a freshman guy in there,\" Lester said. \"He's going to have good quarters and bad. We've just got to try to keep him leveled out.\"\nLester said the offense made a few minor adjustments as to how it would attack USF, but for the most part, Dungey made better decisions.\nWhen tasked with running the same play he turned the wrong way on early, Dungey ran for 8 or 9 yards, Lester said. He escaped a pass rush to find freshman running back Jordan Fredericks for a 30-yard catch-and-run touchdown. He scampered in from 7 yards out even after misreading the defensive end — a nod to the explosiveness that Lester said Dungey brings earlier this week.\n\"He ran it, made the guys miss that he should've (read and handed the ball off) and he scored the touchdown,\" Lester said. \"So you're like, 'Hey, read the end right, by good job scoring the touchdown.'\"\nDungey found sophomore wideout Steve Ishmael for a 7-yard touchdown on a hitch before capping his performance with one last freshman mistake, his lone interception in 70 pass attempts this year.\nWhen Dungey and the Orange offense returns to action against Virginia next Saturday, Lester hopes to see a more productive Dungey from start to finish.\nSaid Lester: \"It was good to see the resiliency. We've just got to get it started earlier.\"\nContact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter", "external_links":
