His wife, Skye Marie Santana, posted word on social media. The couple had three children, including a son who was born after the July 6 collapse.\n“Your wings were ready but our hearts were not,” the post said. “We miss you so much David Santana.”\nThe sun-weakened ice toppled on six people while they were exploring the caves about 40 miles east of Everett, Wash. Annalisa Santana, 34, died from blunt force injuries. Her boyfriend was among those who survived. The couple was visiting from Moreno Valley along with her four children, who were not injured.\nOn June 30, Santana wrote in a post on her Facebook page from Ontario International Airport: “Washington bound for a much needed vacation.”\nThe family suffered another tragedy a week after the ice cave collapse when Adrian Martinez Cardona, 35, of Redlands, the father of Santana’s four children, was shot to death in San Bernardino. Community members raised funds for the orphaned children, who were being taken care by a large extended family, according to friends.\nThe caves are a popular hiking destination in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. They are formed in avalanche debris that is compressed, then melts after falling down the north face of Big Four Mountain in winter and early spring.\nThe caves are always dangerous, but this year’s limited snowpack and hot, dry weather ramped up worries. The Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office was warning people away almost as soon as the trail was open again to hikers. The day before the fatal collapse, ice broke off the lip and several people narrowly escaped. The incident was caught on video that was posted to YouTube.\nAnnalisa and David Santana were the third and fourth deaths at the ice caves since 1998.\nCatherine Shields, 27, of Bothell, Wash., was killed by collapsing snow in August 1998. Grace Tam, 11, of Marysville, Wash., died five years ago. Tam was standing on a rock about 20 feet from the front of the cave, waiting for a photograph, when ice broke free from the cave and struck her.\nThe girl’s family brought a wrongful death case, hoping to force the U.S. Forest Service into taking steps to increase safety at the caves. The lawsuit was dismissed.\nSince the July collapse, the Forest Service has closed access to the trail and is mulling its options. Extra patrols have been added to keep people out.\nPress-Enterprise staff writer Imran Ghori and Eric Stevick of The (Everett, Wash.)
