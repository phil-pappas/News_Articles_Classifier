the fear is some plodder will wake up and feel like running today.\n7 Small Town Shuffle – His last race was far and away a career best; the key will be what he does now, improve, repeat or regress.\nLong Shot – 4 Finnerty's Folly\nRace 2 – 1 mile, Purse $53,000, Optional claiming $20,000, Cal-breds, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up\n5 Sadie Clare – Off the turf angle; sprinter stretching out does not have much early speed, will hope for a quick pace and keep grinding along.\n3 Quinnette – Two of her wins have come going a mile distance; this race is going to be one of survival as none of these look like legit 2-turn animals.\nLong Shot – 4 Desert Madam\nRace 3 – 5 ½ furlongs, Purse $28,000, Maiden claiming $50,000, Cal-breds, 2-year-olds\n2 Suavemente – Taking the biggest class drop in racing from MSW to maiden claiming; is also a first time gelding for trainer Jeff Bonde.\n1 Collect the Debt – This is the start of the Pick 6 with a 2-day carryover of $311K; rail runner also is dropping out of MSW to face much easier.\nLong Shot – 5 Star Express\nRace 4 – 6 furlongs, Purse $52,000, Maiden special weights, Cal-breds, Fillies, 2-year-olds\n3 Hurricane Callie – Talk about frustrating, has lost her last three starts by a nose, neck and neck; can be a nibbler or just may finally blow these away.\n2 Roo's Valentine – Has a lot of early gas, which may get the job done tonight; you never know when you run into a no passing zone affair.\nLong Shot – 8 Easy Grader\nRace 5 – 1 mile (turf, rail at 30 feet), Purse $28,000, Maiden claiming $50,000, 3-year-olds and up\n7 Broken Up – With the turf rail out 30 feet, like very much the tactical speed this one has; should be able to carve out a nice trip under Gary Stevens.\n2 Selection – Dead late closer gets the magician Rafael Bejarano to ride; it won't be easy with the turf rail out 30 feet, but he figures to save all of the ground.\nLong Shot – 6 Junior G Man\nRace 6 – 1 1/16th miles, Purse $24,000, Starter allowance $16,000, 3-year-olds and up\n6 Perfect Set – Has been tremendous since claimed by the maestro Jerry Hollendorfer; has won 3 of 4 with the only loss by a nose three races ago.\n8 Ike Walker – Strong second in last off the claim by trainer Doug O'Neill; has a ton of back class and figures to be a major player on all Pick 6 tickets.\nLong Shot – 1 Limited Response\nRace 7 – 1 ¼ miles (turf, rail at 30 feet), Purse $59,000, Optional claiming $80,000, 3-year-olds and up\n2 Wanstead Gardens – Is in fine form right now, but is moving up the class ladder after a gritty victory; has tactical speed which helps with the turf rail out 30 feet.\n4 Abbey Vale – Has been knocking on the door and now gets a big rider switch to Rafael Bejarano; he has a knack for positioning horses to give them a chance to win.\nLong Shot – 6 Southern Freedom\nRace 8 – 5 ½ furlongs, Purse $19,000, Claiming $16,000, 3-year-olds and up\n10 Devil Rising – Sliding down the claiming ladder to the lowest level of him career; he beat better than these two races ago, a repeat of that race should be enough.\n6 Alpine Luck – Ran OK first race off the claim by trainer Keith Desormeaux; the horse to beat is on the outside so expect James Graham to keep an eye on him.\nLong Shot – 5 Market Notes\nBest Bet - 6 Perfect Set (race 6)\nSanta Anita Sunday - Picks/Winners/Mutuels, 18/4/$40.20; Long Shots, 9/1/$7.00; Best Bet, 1/0/$0\nSanta Anita Totals - 255/55/$340.00; Long Shots, 128/27/$331.00; Best Bets, 13/4/$14.40\nSIMULCAST PLAY OF THE DAY - #2 Julie's Jewelry (4/1) in race 7 at Keeneland.
