The Crimson were picked to finish 11th in the preseason ECAC poll, but made a surprising run to the conference championship. Plus, forward Jimmy Vesey was a Hobey Baker Award finalist after leading the nation with 32 goals and the team enjoyed a trip to the NCAA tournament where it fell, 4-1, to Nebraska-Omaha in the first round.\nThat was only a taste. This season Harvard, ranked No. 8 nationally in preseason polls, wants more.\n“Well, I think it’s an exciting group of guys and after finishing strong last year and winning the ECACs and making it to the NCAA tournament I think there was a lot of positive energy, but I think our guys really want to build off of that and have even more success,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato. “So, I think the expectations are high and I think that is healthy, but we all realize we all start at zero and we need to improve and develop throughout the year to have a chance to have success at the end of the year.”\nThe forward position will be a strength for the Crimson. Vesey, a Nashville draft pick, is aided by smooth-skating linemates Kyle Criscuolo (17-31-48) and Devils draft choice Alexander Kerfoot (30 points in 27 games). San Jose draft pick Colin Blackwell of North Andover returned from concussion issues late last season and performed well (five goals in 11 games). Veterans Sean Malone (Buffalo draftee), Tyler Moy (Nashville), and Luke Esposito (nephew of NHL great Mark Messier) provide support. Joining that group is Donato’s son, Ryan, a Bruins draft pick. Also coming aboard up front are Lewis Zerter-Gossage and Michael Floodstrand.\n“I think up front we have some depth. We have some speed and skill and we’ll have to use that speed and skill on both ends of the ice,” Donato said.\nFreshmen Viktor Dombrovskiy and Adam Baughman will help an experienced defense led by seniors Bayden Jaw, Desmond Begin of Natick, and 6-foot-7 sophomore Wiley Sherman, a B’s draft pick.\nGoalie Steve Michalek has graduated, leaving the door open for a competition between sophomore Merrick Madsen (Philadelphia draft pick), senior Peter Traber and freshman Michael Lackey.\n“The goaltending position is certainly an unknown. I think we’re excited about the talent and compete level but the inexperience is certainly an unknown so we’ll have to see where that takes us. We feel we have the talent at that position but it has to produce,” Donato said. “Defensively, it has to be a full team effort.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:11:35.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
