FOXSports 13 hrs ago Â© Marvin Gentry-USA TODAY Sports Sep 6, 2014; Tuscaloosa, AL, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Jake Coker (14) passes against the Florida Atlantic Owls at Bryant-Denny Stadium.

Being average likely won't be enough for Alabama to walk away from Sanford Stadium Saturday with a win against Georgia this weekend.\nAdChoices Can Coker do just enough for the Tide to get the win? His coach and teammates believe he can.\n\"I think he has gotten more confident and I think he's playing with a little more passion about what he's doing rather than thinking about what he's doing, which is a really good thing,\" Nick Saban said according to AL.com . \"So we're pleased with the development.

Despite his faults, Coker does appear to be the Tide's best option moving forward.\n\"I know Jake and I know he's going to be the most well prepared he can,\" center Ryan Kelly said. \"The guy studies his ass off. I just know that's what he's going to do, so he's going to give us the best chance to win.\n(h/t AL.com )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.al.com/alabamafootball/index.ssf/2015/09/will_be_a_more_confident_jake.html", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:31:21.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
